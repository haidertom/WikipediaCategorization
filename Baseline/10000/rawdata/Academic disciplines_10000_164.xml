The '''architecture of ancient Greece''' is the architecture produced by the [[Greeks|Greek-speaking people]] (''Hellenic'' people) whose [[Ancient Greece|culture]] flourished on the Greek mainland, the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Aegean Islands]], and in colonies in [[Asia Minor|Anatolia]] and Italy for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC.&lt;ref name =BDFH/&gt;

Ancient Greek architecture is best known from [[Ancient Greek temple|its temples]], many of which are found throughout the region, and the parthenon is a prime example of this, mostly as ruins but many substantially intact. The second important type of building that survives all over the Hellenic world is the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece#Characteristics of the buildings|open-air theatre]], with the earliest dating from around 525-480 BC. Other architectural forms that are still in evidence are the processional gateway (''[[propylon]]''), the public square (''[[agora]]'') surrounded by storied colonnade (''[[stoa]]''), the town council building (''[[bouleuterion]]''), the public monument, the monumental tomb (''[[mausoleum]]'') and the ''[[stadium]]''.

Ancient Greek architecture is distinguished by its highly formalised characteristics, both of structure and decoration. This is particularly so in the case of temples where each building appears to have been conceived as a sculptural entity within the landscape, most often raised on high ground so that the elegance of its proportions and the effects of light on its surfaces might be viewed from all angles.&lt;ref name = HG2&gt;Helen Gardner, pp. 126-132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] refers to "the plastic shape of the [Greek] temple ... placed before us with a physical presence more intense, more alive than that of any later building".&lt;ref name="Uncle Nick"&gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''An Outline of European Architecture'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the [[Doric Order]], the [[Ionic Order]] and the [[Corinthian Order]], was to have profound effect on [[History of architecture|Western architecture]] of later periods. The [[Ancient Roman architecture|architecture of ancient Rome]] grew out of that of Greece and maintained its influence in Italy unbroken until the present day. From the [[Renaissance]], revivals of [[Classicism]] have kept alive not only the precise forms and ordered details of Greek architecture, but also its concept of architectural beauty based on balance and proportion. The successive styles of [[Neoclassical architecture]] and [[Greek Revival architecture]] followed and adapted Ancient Greek styles closely.

==Influences==

===Geography===
The mainland and islands of Greece are very rocky, with deeply indented coastline, and rugged mountain ranges with few substantial forests. The most freely available building material is stone. Limestone was readily available and easily worked.&lt;ref name = Boardman1&gt;John Boardman, pp. 10-14&lt;/ref&gt; There is an abundance of high quality white [[marble]] both on the mainland and islands, particularly [[Paros]] and [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]]. This finely grained material was a major contributing factor to precision of detail, both architectural and sculptural, that adorned ancient Greek architecture.&lt;ref name = BF1&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 89-91&lt;/ref&gt; Deposits of high quality potter's clay were found throughout Greece and the Islands, with major deposits near Athens. It was used not only for pottery vessels, but also roof tiles and architectural decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate of Greece is maritime, with both the coldness of winter and the heat of summer tempered by sea breezes. This led to a lifestyle where many activities took place outdoors. Hence temples were placed on hilltops, their exteriors designed as a visual focus of gatherings and processions, while theatres were often an enhancement of a naturally occurring sloping site where people could sit, rather than a containing structure. Colonnades encircling buildings, or surrounding courtyards provided shelter from the sun and from sudden winter storms.&lt;ref name = BF1/&gt;

The light of Greece may be another important factor in the development of the particular character of ancient Greek architecture. The light is often extremely bright, with both the sky and the sea vividly blue. The clear light and sharp shadows give a precision to the details of landscape, pale rocky outcrops and seashore. This clarity is alternated with periods of haze that varies in colour to the light on it. In this characteristic environment, the ancient Greek architects constructed buildings that were marked by precision of detail.&lt;ref name = BF1/&gt; The gleaming marble surfaces were smooth, curved, fluted, or ornately sculpted to reflect the sun, cast graded shadows and change in colour with the ever-changing light of day.

===History===
Historians divide ancient Greek civilization into two eras, the Hellenic period (from around 900 BC to the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC), and the Hellenistic period (323 BC to 30 AD).&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt; During the earlier Hellenic period, substantial works of architecture began to appear around 600 BC. During the later (Hellenistic) period, Greek culture spread widely, initially as a result of Alexander's conquest of other lands, and later as a result of the rise of the Roman Empire, which adopted much of Greek culture.&lt;ref name  = BDFH/&gt;&lt;ref name = HG1&gt;Helen Gardner, pp.  110-114&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Hellenic era, two major cultures had dominated the region: the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] (c. 2800–1100 BC), and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] (c. 1500–1100 BC). Minoan is the name given by modern historians to the culture of the people of ancient [[Crete]], known for its elaborate and richly decorated palaces, and for its pottery painted with floral and marine motifs. The Mycenaean culture, which flourished on the [[Peloponnesus]], was quite different in character. Its people built citadels, fortifications and tombs rather than palaces, and decorated their pottery with bands of marching soldiers rather than octopus and seaweed. Both these civilizations came to an end around 1100 BC, that of Crete possibly because of volcanic devastation, and that of Mycenae because of an invasion by the Dorian people who lived on the Greek mainland.&lt;ref name = HG&gt;Helen Gardner, pp. 90-109&lt;/ref&gt; Following these events, there was a period from which few signs of culture remain. This period is thus often referred to as a Dark Age.

The art history of the Hellenic era is generally subdivided into four periods: the Protogeometric (1100–900 BC), the Geometric (900–700 BC), the Archaic (700–500 BC) and the Classical (500–323 BC)&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Gardner etc.&lt;/ref&gt; with sculpture being further divided into Severe Classical, High Classical and Late Classical.&lt;ref name = BDFH&gt;Boardman, Dorig, Fuchs and Hirmer&lt;/ref&gt; The first signs of the particular artistic character that defines ancient Greek architecture are to be seen in the pottery of the Dorian Greeks from the 10th century BC. Already at this period it is created with a sense of proportion, symmetry and balance not apparent in similar pottery from Crete and Mycenae. The decoration is precisely geometric, and ordered neatly into zones on defined areas of each vessel. These qualities were to manifest themselves not only through a millennium of Greek pottery making, but also in the architecture that was to emerge in the 6th century.&lt;ref name = Strong&gt;Donald E. Strong, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The major development that occurred was in the growing use of the human figure as the major decorative motif, and the increasing surety with which humanity, its mythology, activities and passions were depicted.&lt;ref name = BDFH/&gt;

The development in the depiction of the human form in pottery was accompanied by a similar development in sculpture. The tiny stylised bronzes of the Geometric period gave way to life-sized highly formalised monolithic representation in the Archaic period. The Classical period was marked by a rapid development towards idealised but increasingly lifelike depictions of gods in human form.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp.33 - 102&lt;/ref&gt; This development had a direct effect on the sculptural decoration of temples, as many of the greatest extant works of ancient Greek sculpture once adorned temples,&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 39-40, 62-66&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the largest recorded statues of the age, such as the lost [[chryselephantine]] statues of  Zeus at the Temple of Zeus at Olympia and Athena at the Parthenon, Athens, both over 40 feet high, were once housed in them.&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp. 119-121&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion of ancient Greece was a form of nature worship that grew out of the beliefs of earlier cultures. However, unlike earlier cultures, man was no longer perceived as being threatened by nature, but as its sublime product.&lt;ref name = HG1/&gt; The natural elements were personified as gods of completely human form, and very human behaviour.&lt;ref name = BF1/&gt;

The home of the gods was thought to be [[Mt Olympus|Olympus]], the highest mountain in Greece. The most important deities were: [[Zeus]], the supreme god and ruler of the sky; [[Hera]], his wife and goddess of marriage; [[Athena]], goddess of wisdom; [[Poseidon]], god of the sea; [[Demeter]], goddess of the harvest; [[Apollo]], god of the sun, law, healing, plague, reason, music and poetry; [[Artemis]], goddess of the moon, the hunt and the wilderness; [[Aphrodite]], goddess of love; [[Ares]], God of war; [[Hermes]], god of commerce and travelers, [[Hephaestus]], god of fire and metalwork, and [[Dionysus]], god of wine and fruit-bearing plants.&lt;ref name = BF1/&gt; Worship, like many other activities, was done in community, in the open. However, by 600 BC, the gods were often represented by large statues and it was necessary to provide a building in which each of these could be housed. This led to the development of temples.&lt;ref name= Strong2&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greeks perceived order in the universe, and in turn, applied order and reason to their creations. Their humanist philosophy put mankind at the centre of things, and promoted well-ordered societies and the development of democracy.&lt;ref name =HG1/&gt; At the same time, the respect for human intellect demanded reason, and promoted a passion for enquiry, logic, challenge, and problem solving. The architecture of the ancient Greeks, and in particular, temple architecture, responds to these challenges with a passion for beauty, and for order and symmetry which is the product of a continual search for perfection, rather than a simple application of a set of working rules.

==Architectural character==

===Early development ===
There is a clear division between the architecture of the preceding Mycenaean culture and Minoan cultures and that of the ancient Greeks, the techniques and an understanding of their style being lost when these civilisations fell.&lt;ref name = Boardman1/&gt;

Mycenaean art is marked by its circular structures and tapered domes with flat-bedded, cantilevered courses.&lt;ref name = HG/&gt; This architectural form did not carry over into the architecture of ancient Greece, but reappeared about 400 BC in the interior of large monumental tombs such as the Lion Tomb at Cnidos (c. 350 BC). Little is known of Mycenaean wooden or domestic architecture and any continuing traditions that may have flowed into the early buildings of the Dorian people.

The Minoan architecture of Crete, was of trabeated form like that of ancient Greece. It employed wooden columns with capitals, but the columns were of very different form to Doric columns, being narrow at the base and splaying upward.&lt;ref name = HG/&gt; The earliest forms of columns in Greece seem to have developed independently. As with Minoan architecture, ancient Greek domestic architecture centred on open spaces or courtyards surrounded by colonnades. This form was adapted to the construction of [[hypostyle]] halls within the larger temples. The evolution that occurred in architecture was towards public building, first and foremost the temple, rather than towards grand domestic architecture such as had evolved in Crete.&lt;ref name="HG2"/&gt;

====Domestic buildings====
The Greek word for the family or household, [[oikos]], is also the name for the house.  Houses followed several different types.  It is probable that many of the earliest houses were simple  structures of two rooms, with an open porch or "pronaos" above which rose a low pitched gable or pediment.&lt;ref name=BF3/&gt; This form is thought to have contributed to temple architecture.

The construction of many houses employed walls of sun dried clay bricks or wooden framework filled with fibrous material such as straw or seaweed covered with clay or plaster, on a base of stone which protected the more vulnerable elements from damp.&lt;ref name = Boardman1/&gt; The roofs were probably of thatch with eaves which overhung the permeable walls.  Many larger houses, such as those at Delos,  were built of stone and plastered. The roofing material for substantial house was tile.  Houses of the wealthy had mosaic floors and demonstrated the Classical style.

Many houses centred on a wide passage or "pasta" which ran the length of the house and opened at one side onto a small courtyard which admitted light and air.  Larger houses had a fully developed peristyle courtyard at the centre, with the rooms arranged around it. Some houses had an upper floor which appears to have been reserved for the use of the women of the family.&lt;ref name=BF151&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp 151-153&lt;/ref&gt;

City houses were built with adjoining walls and were divided into small blocks by narrow streets. Shops were sometimes located in the rooms towards the street. City houses were inward-facing, with major openings looking onto the central courtyard, rather than  the street.&lt;ref name = BF3&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 93-97&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

====Public buildings====
The rectangular [[Greek temple|temple]] is the most common and best-known form of Greek public architecture. This rectilinear structure borrows from the Late Helladic, Mycenaean [[Megaron]], which contained a central throne room, vestibule, and porch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple did not serve the same function as a modern church, since the altar stood under the open sky in the [[temenos]] or sacred precinct, often directly before the temple. Temples served as the location of a [[cult image]] and as a storage place or strong room for the treasury associated with the cult of the god in question, and as a place for devotees of the god to leave their [[votive offering]]s, such as statues, helmets and weapons. Some Greek temples appear to have been  oriented astronomically.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, pp. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was generally part of a religious precinct known as the ''acropolis''. According to Aristotle, '"the site should be a spot seen far and wide, which gives good elevation to virtue and towers over the neighbourhood".&lt;ref name = HG2/&gt; Small circular temples, ''[[Tholos (building)|tholos]]'' were also constructed, as well as small temple-like buildings that served as treasuries for specific groups of donors.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 5th and 4th centuries BC, town planning became an important consideration of Greek builders, with towns such as [[Paestum]] and [[Priene]] being laid out with a regular grid of paved streets and an ''agora'' or central market place surrounded by a colonnade or ''stoa''. The completely restored [[Stoa of Attalos]] can be seen in [[Athens]]. Towns were also equipped with a public fountain where water could be collected for household use. The development of regular town plans is associated with [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], a pupil of [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref name = Strong9/&gt;&lt;ref name = BF16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moffett, Fazio, Wodehouse,  pp. 62-64&lt;/ref&gt;

Public buildings became "dignified and gracious structures", and were sited so that they related to each other architecturally.&lt;ref name=BF16&gt;Banister Fletcher, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; The [[propylon]] or porch, formed the entrance to temple sanctuaries and other significant sites with the best-surviving example being the [[Propylaea]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. The  [[bouleuterion]] was a large public building with a ''hypostyle'' hall that served as a court house and as a meeting place for the town council ([[boule (ancient Greece)|boule]]). Remnants of bouleuterion survive at Athens, Olympia and Miletus, the latter having held up to 1200 people.&lt;ref name = BF12&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Greek town had an open-air [[theatre]]. These were used for both public meetings as well as dramatic performances. The theatre was usually set in a hillside outside the town, and had rows of tiered seating set in a semicircle around the central performance area, the ''orchestra''. Behind the orchestra was a low building called the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skênê]]'', which served as a store-room, a dressing-room, and also as a backdrop to the action taking place in the orchestra. A number of Greek theatres survive almost intact, the best known being at [[Epidaurus]], by the architect Polykleitos the Younger.&lt;ref name=Strong9&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek towns of substantial size also had a [[palaestra]] or a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], the social centre for male citizens which included spectator areas, baths, toilets and club rooms.&lt;ref name = BF12/&gt; Other buildings associated with sports include the ''hippodrome'' for horse racing, of which only remnants have survived, and the ''stadium'' for foot racing, 600 feet in length, of which examples exist at Olympia, Delphi, Epidarus and Ephesus, while the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] in Athens, which seats 45,000 people, was restored in the 19th century and was used in the 1896, 1906 and 2004 [[Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=BF12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf 2004 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819195306/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2004/or2004b.pdf |date=2008-08-19 }} Volume 2. pp. 237, 242, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of ancient Greece is of a trabeated or "post and lintel" form, i.e. it is composed of upright beams (posts) supporting horizontal beams (lintels). Although the existent buildings of the era are constructed in stone, it is clear that the origin of the style lies in simple wooden structures, with vertical posts supporting beams which carried a ridged roof. The posts and beams divided the walls into regular compartments which could be left as openings, or filled with sun dried bricks, lathes or straw and covered with clay daub or plaster. Alternately, the spaces might be filled with rubble. It is likely that many early houses and temples were constructed with an open porch or "pronaos" above which rose a low pitched gable or pediment.&lt;ref name="BF3"/&gt;

The earliest temples, built to enshrine statues of deities, were probably of wooden construction, later replaced by the more durable stone temples many of which are still in evidence today. The signs of the original timber nature of the architecture were maintained in the stone buildings.&lt;ref name = Strong3&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

A few of these temples are very large, with several, such as the Temple of Zeus Olympus and the Olympians at Athens being well over 300 feet in length, but most were less than half this size. It appears that some of the large temples began as wooden constructions in which the columns were replaced piecemeal as stone became available. This, at least was the interpretation of the historian [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] looking at the Temple of Hera at Olympia in the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref name = HG2/&gt;

The stone columns are made of a series of solid stone cylinders or "drums" that rest on each other without mortar, but were sometimes centred with a bronze pin. The columns are wider at the base than at the top, tapering with an outward curve known as "entasis". Each column has a capital of two parts, the upper, on which rests the lintels, being square and called the "abacus". The part of the capital that rises from the column itself is called the "echinus". It differs according to the order, being plain in the Doric Order, fluted in the Ionic and foliate in the Corinthian. Doric and usually Ionic capitals are cut with vertical grooves known as "fluting". This fluting or grooving of the columns is a retention of an element of the original wooden architecture.&lt;ref name = Strong3/&gt;

====Entablature and pediment====
The columns of a temple support a structure that rises in two main stages, the entablature and the pediment.

The entablature is the major horizontal structural element supporting the roof and encircling the entire building. It is composed of three parts. Resting on the columns is the [[architrave]] made of a series of stone "lintels" that spanned the space between the columns, and meet each other at a joint directly above the centre of each column.

Above the architrave is a second horizontal stage called the "frieze". The frieze is one of the major decorative elements of the building and carries a sculptured relief. In the case of Ionic and Corinthian architecture, the relief decoration runs in a continuous band, but in the Doric Order, it is divided into sections called "metopes" which fill the spaces between vertical rectangular blocks called "triglyphs". The triglyphs are vertically grooved like the Doric columns, and retain the form of the wooden beams that would once have supported the roof.

The upper band of the entablature is called the "[[cornice]]", which is generally ornately decorated on its lower edge. The cornice retains the shape of the beams that would once have supported the wooden roof at each end of the building. At the front and rear of each temple, the entablature supports a triangular structure called the "[[pediment]]". The triangular space framed by the cornices is the location of the most significant sculptural decoration on the exterior of the building.

====Masonry====
Every temple rested on a masonry base called the [[crepidoma]], generally of three steps, of which the upper one which carried the columns was the ''stylobate''. Masonry walls were employed for temples from about 600 BC onwards. Masonry of all types was used for ancient Greek buildings, including rubble, but the finest [[ashlar]] masonry was usually employed for temple walls, in regular courses and large sizes to minimise the joints.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt; The blocks were rough hewn and hauled from quarries to be cut and bedded very precisely, with mortar hardly ever being used. Blocks, particularly those of columns and parts of the building bearing loads were sometimes fixed in place or reinforced with iron clamps, dowels and rods of wood, bronze or iron fixed in lead to minimise corrosion.&lt;ref name = Boardman1/&gt;

====Openings====
Door and window openings were spanned with a lintel, which in a stone building limited the possible width of the opening. The distance between columns was similarly affected by the nature of the lintel, columns on the exterior of buildings and carrying stone lintels being closer together than those on the interior, which carried wooden lintels.&lt;ref name = BF5&gt;Banister Fletcher, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BF20&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Door and window openings narrowed towards the top.&lt;ref name = BF20/&gt; Temples were constructed without windows, the light to the naos entering through the door. It has been suggested that some temples were lit from openings in the roof.&lt;ref name = BF5/&gt; A door of the Ionic Order at the Erechtheion (17 feet high and 7.5 feet wide at the top) retains many of its features intact, including mouldings, and an entablature supported on console brackets. &lt;small&gt;(See Architectural Decoration, below)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name = BF20/&gt;&lt;ref name = BF21&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roof====
{{Further|List of Greco-Roman roofs}}
The widest span of a temple roof was across the cella, or internal space. In a large building, this space contains columns to support the roof, the architectural form being known as [[hypostyle]]. It appears that, although the architecture of ancient Greece was initially of wooden construction, the early builders did not have the concept of the diagonal truss as a stabilising member. This is evidenced by the nature of temple construction in the 6th century BC, where the rows of columns supporting the roof the cella rise higher than the outer walls, unnecessary if roof trusses are employed as an integral part of the wooden roof. The indication is that initially all the rafters were supported directly by the entablature, walls and hypostyle, rather than on a trussed wooden frame, which came into use in Greek architecture only in the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt;

Ancient Greek buildings of timber, clay and plaster construction were probably roofed with thatch. With the rise of stone architecture came the appearance of fired ceramic roof tiles. These early roof tiles showed an S-shape, with the pan and cover tile forming one piece. They were much larger than modern roof tiles, being up to {{convert|90|cm|2|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|70|cm|2|abbr=on}} wide, {{convert|3|-|4|cm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} thick and weighing around {{convert|30|kg|0|abbr=on}} apiece.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rostoker; Elizabeth Gebhard, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Only stone walls, which were replacing the earlier [[mudbrick]] and wood walls, were strong enough to support the weight of a tiled roof.&lt;ref name =MG&gt;Marilyn Y. Goldberg, p305-309&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest finds of [[roof tiles]] of the [[Archaic period in Greece]] are documented from a very restricted area around [[Corinth]], where fired tiles began to replace [[Thatching|thatched]] roofs at the temples of [[Apollo]] and [[Temple of Isthmia|Poseidon]] between 700 and 650 BC.&lt;ref name = OW&gt;Örjan Wikander, p.285-289&lt;/ref&gt; Spreading rapidly, roof tiles were within fifty years in evidence for a large number of sites around the Eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], including Mainland [[Greece]], Western [[Asia Minor]], Southern and Central [[Italy]].&lt;ref name = OW/&gt; Being more expensive and labour-intensive to produce than thatch, their introduction has been explained by the fact that their fireproof quality would have given desired protection to the costly temples.&lt;ref name =OW/&gt; As a side-effect, it has been assumed that the new stone and tile construction also ushered in the end of overhanging eaves in Greek architecture, as they made the need for an extended roof as rain protection for the mudbrick walls obsolete.&lt;ref name =MG/&gt;

Vaults and arches were not generally used, but begin to appear in tombs (in a "beehive" or cantilevered form such as used in Mycenaea) and occasionally, as an external feature, exedrae of [[voussoir]]ed construction from the 5th century BC. The dome and vault never became significant structural features, as they were to become in [[ancient Roman architecture]].&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt;

====Temple plans====
{{Further|List of Ancient Greek temples}}
[[File:Greek temples.svg|thumb|600px|&lt;center&gt;Plans of Ancient Greek Temples&lt;br/&gt; Top: 1. ''[[distyle in antis]]'', 2. ''amphidistyle in antis'', 3. ''tholos'', 4.

''pseudodipteral octastyle'' &lt;/center&gt;]]
Most ancient Greek temples were rectangular, and were approximately twice as long as they were wide, with some notable exceptions such as the enormous [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens]] with a length of nearly 2½ times its width. A number of surviving temple-like structures are circular, and are referred to as ''tholos''.&lt;ref name = BF6&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 107-109&lt;/ref&gt;  The smallest temples are less than 25 metres (approx. 75 feet) in length, or in the case of the circular ''tholos'', in diameter. The great majority of temples are between 30–60 metres (approx. 100–200 feet) in length. A small group of Doric temples, including the [[Parthenon]], are between 60–80 metres (approx. 200–260 feet) in length.  The largest temples, mainly Ionic and Corinthian, but including the Doric [[Temple of the Olympian Zeus, Agrigento]], were between 90–120 metres (approx. 300–390 feet) in length.

The temple rises from a stepped base or "[[stylobate]]", which elevates the structure above the ground on which it stands. Early examples, such as the Temple of Zeus at Olympus, have two steps, but the majority, like the Parthenon, have three, with the exceptional example of the Temple of Apollo at Didyma having six.&lt;ref name = BF&gt;Banister Fletcher&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the building is a masonry-built "naos" within which is a cella, a windowless room originally housing the statue of the god. The cella generally has a porch or "pronaos" before it, and perhaps a second chamber or "antenaos" serving as a treasury or repository for trophies and gifts. The chambers were lit by a single large doorway, fitted with a wrought iron grill. Some rooms appear to have been illuminated by skylights.&lt;ref name = BF/&gt;

On the stylobate, often completely surrounding the naos, stand rows of columns. Each temple is defined as being of a particular type, with two terms: one describing the number of columns across the entrance front, and the other defining their distribution.&lt;ref name = BF/&gt;

Examples:
*''[[Distyle in antis]]'' describes a small temple with two columns at the front, which are set between the projecting walls of the ''pronaos'' or porch, like the Temple of Nemesis at Rhamnus. &lt;small&gt;(see left, figure 1.)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;
*''Amphiprostyle tetrastyle'' describes a small temple that has columns at both ends which stand clear of the ''naos''. ''Tetrastyle'' indicates that the columns are four in number, like those of the Temple on the Ilissus in Athens. &lt;small&gt;(figure 4.)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;
*''Peripteral hexastyle'' describes a temple with a single row of peripheral columns around the ''naos'', with six columns across the front, like the Theseion in Athens. &lt;small&gt;(figure 7.)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;
*''Peripteral octastyle'' describes a temple with a single row of columns around the ''naos'', &lt;small&gt;(figure 7.)&lt;/small&gt; with eight columns across the front, like the Parthenon, Athens. &lt;small&gt;(figs. 6 and 9.)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;
*''Dipteral decastyle'' describes the huge temple of Apollo at Didyma, with the ''naos'' surrounded by a double row of columns, &lt;small&gt;(figure 6.)&lt;/small&gt; with ten columns across the entrance front.&lt;ref name =BF6/&gt;
* The Temple of Zeus Olympius at Agrigentum, is termed ''Pseudo-periteral heptastyle'', because its encircling colonnade has ''pseudo'' columns that are attached to the walls of the ''naos''. &lt;small&gt;(figure 8.)&lt;/small&gt; ''Heptastyle'' means that it has seven columns across the entrance front.&lt;ref name = BF6/&gt;

====Proportion and optical illusion====
The ideal of proportion that was used by ancient Greek architects in designing temples was not a simple mathematical progression using a square module. The math involved a more complex geometrical progression, the so-called [[Golden ratio|''Golden mean'']]. The ratio is similar to that of the growth patterns of many spiral forms that occur in nature such as rams' horns, [[nautilus]] shells, fern fronds, and vine tendrils and which were a source of decorative motifs employed by ancient Greek architects as particularly in evidence in the volutes of capitals of the Ionic and Corinthian Orders.&lt;ref name = BF15&gt;Banister Fletcher p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac 1 \varphi = \varphi - 1;\; \varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618 &lt;/math&gt;

The ancient Greek architects took a philosophic approach to the rules and proportions. The determining factor in the mathematics of any notable work of architecture was its ultimate appearance. The architects calculated for perspective, for the optical illusions that make edges of objects appear concave and for the fact that columns that are viewed against the sky look different from those adjacent that are viewed against a shadowed wall. Because of these factors, the architects adjusted the plans so that the major lines of any significant building are rarely straight.&lt;ref name = BF15/&gt;
The most obvious adjustment is to the profile of columns, which narrow from base to top. However, the narrowing is not regular, but gently curved so that each columns appears to have a slight swelling, called ''entasis'' below the middle. The ''entasis'' is never sufficiently pronounced as to make the swelling wider than the base; it is controlled by a slight reduction in the rate of decrease of diameter.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt;

The [[Parthenon]], the Temple to the Goddess [[Athena]] on the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, is referred to by many as the pinnacle of ancient Greek architecture. [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] refers to its "unsurpassable excellence", to be surveyed, studied and emulated by architects of later ages. Yet, as Gardner points out, there is hardly a straight line in the building.&lt;ref name = HG4/&gt; [[Banister Fletcher]] calculated that the ''stylobate'' curves upward so that its centres at either end rise about 2.6&amp;nbsp;inches above the outer corners, and 4.3&amp;nbsp;inches on the longer sides. A slightly greater adjustment has been made to the entablature. The columns at the ends of the building are not vertical but are inclined towards the centre, with those at the corners being out of plumb by about 2.6&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt; These outer columns are both slightly wider than their neighbours and are slightly closer than any of the others.&lt;ref name = MFW2&gt;Moffett, Fazio, Wodehouse, pp. 50-53&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

===Orders===
Ancient Greek architecture of the most formal type, for temples and other public buildings, is divided stylistically into three "[[classical order|orders]]", first described by the Roman architectural writer [[Vitruvius]].  These are: the [[Doric Order]], the [[Ionic Order]] and the [[Corinthian Order]], the names reflecting their regional origins within the Greek world. While the three orders are most easily recognizable by their capitals, the orders also governed the form, proportions, details and relationships of the columns, [[entablature]], [[pediment]] and the [[stylobate]].&lt;ref name = HG2/&gt; The different orders were applied to the whole range of buildings and monuments.

The Doric Order developed on mainland Greece and spread to [[Magna Graecia]] (Italy). It was firmly established and well-defined in its characteristics by the time of the building of the [[Temple of Hera (Olympia)|Temple of Hera]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], c.&amp;nbsp;600 BC. The Ionic order co-existed with the Doric, being favoured by the Greek cities of [[Ionia]], in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Aegean Islands]]. It did not reach a clearly defined form until the mid 5th&amp;nbsp;century BC.&lt;ref name="Strong3"/&gt; The early Ionic temples of Asia Minor were particularly ambitious in scale, such as the [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref name = Strong/&gt; The Corinthian Order was a highly decorative variant not developed until the [[Hellenistic]] period and retaining many characteristics of the Ionic. It was popularised by the Romans.&lt;ref name = BF3/&gt;

====Doric Order====
The Doric order is recognised by its capital, of which the ''echinus'' is like a circular cushion rising from the top of the column to the square ''abacus'' on which rest the lintels. The echinus appears flat and splayed in early examples, deeper and with greater curve in later, more refined examples, and smaller and straight-sided in Hellenistc examples.&lt;ref name = BF7/&gt; A refinement of the Doric column is the [[entasis]], a gentle convex swelling to the profile of the column, which prevents an optical illusion of concavity.&lt;ref name = BF7/&gt;  This is more pronounced in earlier examples.

Doric columns are almost always cut with grooves, known as "fluting", which run the length of the column and are usually 20 in number, although sometimes fewer. The flutes meet at sharp edges called ''[[arris]]es''. At the top of the columns, slightly below the narrowest point, and crossing the terminating arrises, are three horizontal grooves known as the ''[[hypotrachelion]]''. Doric columns have no bases, until a few examples in the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref name = BF7/&gt;

The columns of an early Doric temple such as the [[Temple of Apollo (Syracuse)|Temple of Apollo]] at Syracuse, Sicily, may have a height to base diameter ratio of only 4:1 and a column height to entablature ratio of 2:1, with relatively crude details. A column height to diameter of 6:1 became more usual, while the column height to entablature ratio at the Parthenon is about 3:1. During the Hellenistic period, Doric conventions of solidity and masculinity dropped away, with the slender and unfluted columns reaching a height to diameter ratio of 7.5:1.&lt;ref name = BF7&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

The Doric [[entablature]] is in three parts, the [[architrave]], the [[frieze (architecture)|frieze]] and the [[cornice]]. The architrave is composed of the stone lintels which span the space between the columns, with a joint occurring above the centre of each abacus. On this rests the frieze, one of the major areas of sculptural decoration. The frieze is divided into ''triglyphs'' and ''metopes'', the triglyphs, as stated elsewhere in this article, are a reminder of the timber history of the architectural style. Each triglyph has three vertical grooves, similar to the columnar fluting, and below them, seemingly connected, are [[guttae]], small strips that appear to connect the triglyphs to the architrave below.&lt;ref name="  BF7"/&gt; A triglyph is located above the centre of each capital, and above the centre of each lintel. However, at the corners of the building, the triglyphs do not fall over the centre the column. The ancient architects took a pragmatic approach to the apparent "rules", simply extending the width of the last two metopes at each end of the building.

The cornice is a narrow jutting band of complex moulding which overhangs and protects the ornamented frieze, like the edge of an overhanging wooden-framed roof. It is decorated on the underside with projecting blocks, ''mutules'', further suggesting the wooden nature of the prototype. At either end of the building the pediment rises from the cornice, framed by moulding of  similar form.&lt;ref name = BF7/&gt;

The pediment is decorated with figures that are in [[relief]] in the earlier examples, though almost freestanding by the time of the [[Elgin Marbles|sculpture on the Parthenon]]. Early architectural sculptors found difficulty in creating satisfactory sculptural compositions in the tapering triangular space.&lt;ref name = Strong4/&gt; By the Early Classical period, with the decoration of the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at Olympia, (486-460 BC) the sculptors had solved the problem by having a standing central figure framed by rearing [[centaur]]s and fighting men who are falling, kneeling and lying in attitudes that fit the size and angle of each part of the space.&lt;ref name = HG4&gt;Helen Gardner, pp. 138-148&lt;/ref&gt;  The famous sculptor [[Phidias]] fills the space at the Parthenon (448-432 BC) with a complex array of draped and undraped figures of deities who appear in attitudes of sublime relaxation and elegance.

====Ionic Order====
The [[Ionic Order]] is recognized by its [[volute]]d capital, in which a curved ''echinus'' of similar shape to that of the Doric Order, but decorated with stylised ornament, is surmounted by a horizontal band that scrolls under to either side, forming spirals or ''volutes'' similar to those of the [[nautilus]] shell or ram's horn. In plan, the capital is rectangular. It is designed to be viewed frontally but the capitals at the corners of buildings are modified with an additional scroll so as to appear regular on two adjoining faces. In the Hellenistic period, four-fronted Ionic capitals became common.&lt;ref name =BF8&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 125-129&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Doric Order, the Ionic Order retains signs of having its origins in wooden architecture. The horizontal spread of a flat timber plate across the top of a column is a common device in wooden construction, giving a thin upright a wider area on which to bear the lintel, while at the same time reinforcing the load-bearing strength of the lintel itself. Likewise, the columns always have bases, a necessity in wooden architecture to spread the load and protect the base of a comparatively thin upright.&lt;ref name = BF8/&gt; The columns are fluted with narrow, shallow flutes that do not meet at a sharp edge but have a flat band or ''fillet'' between them. The usual number of flutes is twenty-four but there may be as many as forty-four. The base has two convex mouldings called ''torus'', and from the late Hellenic period stood on a square plinth similar to the ''abacus''.&lt;ref name = BF8/&gt;

The architrave of the Ionic Order is sometimes undecorated, but more often rises in three outwardly-stepped bands like overlapping timber planks. The frieze, which runs in a continuous band, is separated from the other members by rows of small projecting blocks. They are referred to as ''dentils'', meaning "teeth", but their origin is clearly in narrow wooden slats which supported the roof of a timber structure.&lt;ref name = BF8/&gt;
The Ionic Order is altogether lighter in appearance than the Doric, with the columns, including base and capital, having a 9:1 ratio with the diameter, while the whole entablature was also much narrower and less heavy than the Doric entablature. There was some variation in the distribution of decoration. Formalised bands of motifs such as alternating forms known as "egg and dart" were a feature of the Ionic entablatures, along with the bands of ''dentils''. The external frieze often contained a continuous band of figurative sculpture or ornament,  but this was not always the case. Sometimes a decorative frieze occurred around the upper part of the ''naos'' rather than on the exterior of the building. These Ionic-style friezes around the ''naos'' are sometimes found on Doric buildings, notably the Parthenon. Some temples, like the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, had friezes of figures around the lower drum of each column, separated from  the fluted section by a bold moulding.&lt;ref name = BF8/&gt;

[[Caryatid]]s, draped female figures used as supporting members to carry the entablature, were a feature of the Ionic order, occurring at several buildings including the [[Siphnian Treasury]] at Delphi in 525 BC and at the [[Erechtheion]], about 410 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Boardman p.45, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corinthian Order====
The Corinthian Order does not have its origin in wooden architecture. It grew directly out of the Ionic in the mid 5th century BC, and was initially of much the same style and proportion, but distinguished by its more ornate capitals.&lt;ref name = BF9&gt;Banister Fletcher pp. 137-139&lt;/ref&gt; The capital was very much deeper than either the Doric or the Ionic capital, being shaped like a large ''krater'', a bell-shaped mixing bowl, and being ornamented with a double row of [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] leaves above which rose voluted tendrils, supporting the corners of the abacus, which, no longer perfectly square, splayed above them. According to [[Vitruvius]], the capital was invented by a bronze founder, [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]] of Corinth, who took his inspiration from a basket of offerings that had been placed on a grave, with a flat tile on top to protect the goods. The basket had been placed on the root of an acanthus plant which had grown up around it.&lt;ref name = BF9/&gt; The ratio of the column height to diameter is generally 10:1, with the capital taking up more than 1/10 of the height. The ratio of capital height to diameter is generally about 1.16:1.&lt;ref name = BF9/&gt;

The Corinthian Order was initially used internally, as at the [[Bassae|Temple of Apollo Epicurius]] at Bassae (c. 450–425 BC). In 334 BC it appeared as an external feature on the [[Choragic Monument of Lysicrates]] in Athens, and then on a huge scale at the Temple of Zeus Olympia in Athens, (174 BC – AD 132).&lt;ref name = BF9/&gt; It was popularised by the Romans, who added a number of refinements and decorative details. During the Hellenistic period, Corinthian columns were sometimes built without fluting.&lt;ref name = BF9/&gt;

Early wooden structures, particularly temples, were ornamented and in part protected by fired and painted clay revetments in the form of rectangular panels, and ornamental discs. Many fragments of these have outlived the buildings that they decorated and demonstrate a wealth of formal border designs of geometric scrolls, overlapping patterns and foliate motifs.&lt;ref name = Boardman2/&gt; With the introduction of stone-built temples, the revetments no longer served a protective purpose and sculptured decoration became more common.

The clay ornaments were limited to the roof of buildings, decorating the cornice, the corners and surmounting the pediment. At the corners of pediments they were called ''acroteria'' and along the sides of the building, ''antefixes''. Early decorative elements were generally semi-circular, but later of roughly triangular shape with moulded ornament, often palmate.&lt;ref name = Boardman2&gt;Boardman, pp. 22-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = BF19&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Ionic cornices were often set with a row of lion's masks, with open mouths that ejected rainwater.&lt;ref name = BF5/&gt;&lt;ref name = BF19/&gt; From the Late Classical period, acroteria were sometimes sculptured figures.&lt;small&gt;See "Architectural sculpture"&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name = Dorig/&gt;

In the three orders of ancient Greek architecture, the sculptural decoration, be it a simple half round ''[[astragal]]'', a frieze of stylised foliage or the ornate sculpture of the pediment, is all essential to the architecture of which it is a part. In the Doric order, there is no variation in its placement. Reliefs never decorate walls in an arbitrary way. The sculpture is always located in several predetermined areas, the metopes and the pediment.&lt;ref name = Boardman2/&gt; In later Ionic architecture, there is greater diversity in the types and numbers of mouldings and decorations, particularly around doorways, where voluted brackets sometimes occur supporting an ornamental cornice over a door, such as that at the Erechtheion.&lt;ref name = BF5/&gt;&lt;ref name = BF21/&gt;&lt;ref name = Boardman2/&gt; A much applied narrow moulding is called "bead and reel" and is symmetrical, stemming from turned wooden prototypes. Wider mouldings include one with tongue-like or pointed leaf shapes, which are grooved and sometimes turned upward at the tip, and "egg and dart" moulding which alternates ovoid shapes with narrow pointy ones.&lt;ref name = BF5/&gt;&lt;ref name = Boardman2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Architectural sculpture showed a development from early Archaic examples through Severe Classical, High Classical, Late Classical and Hellenistic.&lt;ref name =BDFH/&gt; Remnants of Archaic architectural sculpture (700–500 BC) exist from the early 6th century BC with the earliest surviving pedimental sculpture being fragments of a Gorgon flanked by heraldic panthers from the centre of the pediment of the [[Temple of Artemis (Corfu)|Artemis Temple of Corfu]].&lt;ref name = Strong13&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; A metope from a temple known as "Temple C" at Selinus, Sicily, shows, in a better preserved state, [[Perseus]] slaying the Gorgon [[Medusa]].&lt;ref name =Strong4&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; Both images parallel the stylised depiction of the Gorgons on the black figure name vase decorated by the Nessos painter (c. 600 BC), with the face and shoulders turned frontally, and the legs in a running or kneeling position. At this date images of terrifying monsters have predominance over the emphasis on the human figure that developed with Humanist philosophy.&lt;ref name = Strong13/&gt;

The Severe Classical style (500–450 BC) is represented by the pedimental sculptures of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, (470–456 BC). The eastern pediment shows a moment of stillness and "impending drama" before the beginning of a chariot race, the figures of Zeus and the competitors being severe and idealised representations of the human form.&lt;ref name = Strong5/&gt; The western pediment has Apollo as the central figure, "majestic" and "remote", presiding over a battle of [[Lapith]]s and [[Centaur]]s, in strong contrast to that of the eastern pediment  for its depiction of violent action, and described by D. E. Strong as the "most powerful piece of illustration" for a hundred years.&lt;ref name =Strong5&gt;Donald E. Strong, pp. 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The shallow reliefs and three-dimensional sculpture which adorned the frieze and pediments, respectively, of the Parthenon, are the lifelike products of the High Classical style (450–400 BC) and were created under the direction of the sculptor [[Phidias]].&lt;ref name = HG10&gt;Helen Gardner, pp. 143–148&lt;/ref&gt; The pedimental sculpture represents the Gods of Olympus, while the frieze shows the Panathenaic procession and ceremonial events that took place every four years to honour the titular Goddess of Athens.&lt;ref name = HG10/&gt; The frieze and remaining figures of the eastern pediment show a profound understanding of the human body, and how it varies depending upon its position and the stresses that action and emotion place upon it. Benjamin Robert Haydon described the reclining figure of [[Dionysus]] as "... the most heroic style of art, combined with all the essential detail of actual life".&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of many famous sculptors are known from the Late Classical period (400–323 BC), including [[Timotheus (sculptor)|Timotheos]], [[Praxiteles]], [[Leochares]] and [[Skopas]], but their works are known mainly from Roman copies.&lt;ref name = BDFH/&gt;  Little architectural sculpture of the period remains intact. The [[Temple of Asclepius at Epidauros]] had sculpture by Timotheos working with the architect Theodotos. Fragments of the eastern pediment survive, showing the [[Sack of Troy]]. The scene appears to have filled the space with figures carefully arranged to fit the slope and shape available, as with earlier east pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympus. But the figures are more violent in action, the central space taken up, not with a commanding God, but with the dynamic figure of [[Neoptolemos]] as he seizes the aged king [[Priam]] and stabs him. The remaining fragments give the impression of a whole range of human emotions, fear, horror, cruelty and lust for conquest.&lt;ref name = Dorig&gt;Jose Dorig in Boardman, Dorig, Fuchs and Hirmer, pp. 435&lt;/ref&gt; The ''acroteria'' were sculptured by Timotheus, except for that at the centre of the east pediment which is the work of the architect. The palmate acroteria have been replaced here with small figures, the eastern pediment being surmounted by a winged [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], poised against the wind.&lt;ref name = Dorig/&gt;

Hellenistic architectural sculpture (323–31 BC) was to become more flamboyant, both in the rendering of expression and motion, which is often emphasised by flowing draperies, the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace|Nike Samothrace]] which decorated a monument in the shape of a ship being a well-known example. The [[Pergamon Altar]] (c. 180–160 BC) has a frieze (120 metres long by 2.3 metres high) of figures in very high relief. The frieze represents the battle for supremacy of Gods and Titans, and employs many dramatic devices: frenzy, pathos and triumph, to convey the sense of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Fuchs in Boardman, Dorig, Fuchs and Hirmer, pp.509–510&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anno Lucis''' (“in the Year of Light”) is a dating system used in [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ceremonial or commemorative proceedings, which is equivalent to the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian year]] plus 4000. It is similar to ''[[Anno Mundi]]''.

==Description==
For example, a date [[Anno Domini]] (A.D.) {{currentyear}} becomes Anno Lucis (A.L.) {{#expr:{{currentyear}}+4000}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url= http://www.freemasonry.london.museum/resources/your-questions-answered/# | title = What is the Masonic Calendar? | author = | accessdate = 2006-07-06 | publisher = Library and Museum Charitable Trust of the United Grand Lodge of England}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[calendar era]], which would designate 4001&amp;nbsp;[[Before Common Era|BCE]] as '[[year zero]]', was adopted in the 18th century as a simplification of the ''Anno Mundi'' era dating system used in the [[Hebrew calendar]] and borrowing from other ideas of that time regarding the [[Dating creation|year of creation]].

After the [[Masoretic]] text was published, dating creation around 4000 BC became common, and it was received with wide support.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collation of the Sacred Scriptures'', Charles Roger Dundee, 1847, pp. 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed calculations of the date of creation, using the Masoretic from the 10th century to the 18th century, were numerous and fluctuated by many decades.&lt;ref name=Jones26&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wsITeHwP9K0C&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q=%22date+of+creation%22+%22no+dispute%22&amp;f=false |title=Chronology of the Old Testament: Solving the Bible's Most Intriguing Mysteries |author=Floyd Nolen Jones |publisher=New Leaf Publishing Group |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-89051-416-0 |page=26 |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, [[Isaac Newton]]'s calculation pointed at the year 4000 BC.&lt;ref name=Jones26/&gt; 

Among the Masoretic creation estimates or calculations for the date of creation, [[Ussher chronology|Archbishop Ussher's specific chronology]] dating the creation to 4004 BC became the most accepted and popular in Christendom, mainly because this specific date was attached to the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/scopes/ussher.html |title=Bishop James Ussher Sets the Date for Creation: October 23, 4004 B.C |publisher=Law2.umkc.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Calendar has traditionally, since the 4th century AD by [[Hillel II]], dated the creation to 3761 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.net/jewish+calendar |title=Definition of Jewish Calendar from |publisher=dictionary.net |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |title=The Jewish Calendar and Biblical Authority |publisher=Askelm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074827/http://askelm.com/doctrine/d911001.htm |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah]]'' compiled by [[Jose ben Halafta]] in AD 160, and in agreement with ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]'', in which the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] identifies ''anno mundi'' as 3448 years before the [[Seleucid era]] but not with ''[[Seder Olam Zutta]]'', which dates it to 4339 BC and was compiled in AD 804.&lt;ref&gt;Young's Analytical Concordance of the Holy Bible, 1879, 8th Edition, 1939—entry under 'Creation', quoting Dr. William Hales New Analysis of Chronology and Geography, History and Prophecy, Vol. 1, 1830, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Before Jerusalem Fell''''' is a book written by [[Kenneth Gentry]] based on his [[PhD]] dissertation from [[Whitefield Theological Seminary]]. The book is currently in its third edition and is published by [[American Vision]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

The book presents a sustained argument from fields such as [[biblical hermeneutics]], ancient history, [[textual criticism]], [[archaeology]], and [[Christian theology]] for why the [[Book of Revelation]] must have been written before the [[destruction of Jerusalem]] in AD 70, during the reign of Roman emperor [[Nero]]. Gentry argues that Nero Caesar is the "sixth king" presently ruling ({{bibleverse||Rev.|17:10}}) who functions in Revelation as the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast]].

The book is controversial in that it goes against majority [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Dispensation (period)|Dispensational]] opinion that Revelation was written in the reign of [[Domitian]] in AD 95, though the pre-AD 70 date for Revelation was the dominant view of scholars in the 19th century and first two decades of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''Bethany Theological Seminary''' is the official [[seminary]] of the [[Church of the Brethren]]. Bethany, located in [[Richmond, Indiana]], is accredited by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada]] and the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.

==History==
The seminary was founded in 1905 as Bethany Biblical Seminary by A.C. Wieand and E. B. Hoff. While the two were traveling in the Holy Land overlooking the village of Bethany from the Mount of Olives in 1901–02, they decided to name the new Bible institute Bethany.  In 1994, the seminary moved from [[Oak Brook, Illinois]], to [[Richmond, Indiana]], to form a partnership with the [[Earlham School of Religion]], a Christian theological school in the [[Quaker]] tradition.

==Educational opportunities==
Bethany offers students opportunities for a degree in ministry in the form of Master of Divinity and one in research through the Master of Arts degree.  Students can further refine their field of study through a degree emphasis in Peace Studies or Ministry With Youth and Young Adults. Peace-related courses cover topics ranging from non-violence and the biblical story, to peace witness in the [[Anabaptist]]/[[Pietist]] tradition, to mediating conflict in families and churches, to peacemaking in national and international arenas. Master of Divinity students pursuing a degree emphasis in Ministry With Youth and Young Adults complete a practicum experience, and Master of Arts students focus their thesis on youth and young adult ministry.

Bethany emphasizes peace, service, simple living, and the importance of the faith community. Along with the [[Quakers]] and [[Mennonites]], the [[Church of the Brethren]] is an historic peace church, conscientiously opposed to all war, and intentional about working with peacemaking and reconciliation concerns. Several Bethany professionals and graduates are also associated with a renewed interest in [[theopoetics]].

Students in either the Master of Divinity or Master of Arts programs can now enroll as residential or Connections students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethanyseminary.edu/academic_programs |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223053100/http://bethanyseminary.edu/academic_programs |archivedate=2009-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Connections is designed for persons who cannot relocate to Richmond, and who can commit to taking a mix of classes online, offsite, and on campus as weekend or two-week intensives. One of the primary locations for off-site Bethany courses is the Susquehanna Valley Ministry Center, on the campus of [[Elizabethtown College]] in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.

Bethany partners with a wide circle of theological schools to further enhance graduate-level educational opportunities. These schools include [[Christian Theological Seminary]] in Indianapolis, IN; Payne Theological Seminary in Yellow Springs, OH; [[United Theological Seminary]] in Dayton, OH; and [[The University of Dayton]] Graduate School in Dayton, Ohio.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">A '''book desert''' is a geographic area (country, state, county, city, neighborhood, home) where printed books and other reading material are allegedly hard to obtain, particularly without access to an automobile or other form of transportation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neuman|first=Susan B.|last2=Moland|first2=Naomi|date=2016-07-05|title=Book Deserts The Consequences of Income Segregation on Children's Access to Print|url=http://uex.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/07/05/0042085916654525|journal=Urban Education|language=en|pages=0042085916654525|doi=10.1177/0042085916654525|issn=0042-0859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have defined book deserts by linking them to poverty and low income, while others use a combination of factors that include census data, income, ethnicity, geography, language, and the number of books in a home.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greeleytribune.com/news/12397504-113/book-books-literacy-desert#|title=Searching for oases in Weld's so-called book desert|last=Silvy|first=Tyler|date=July 30, 2014|work=Greeley Tribune|access-date=August 6, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and research ==
In the past, researchers have studied how the absence or scarcity of books impact how a child's early [[literacy]] and language skills develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=M. D. R.|last2=Kelley|first2=Jonathan|last3=Sikora|first3=Joanna|last4=Treiman|first4=Donald J.|date=2010-06-01|title=Family scholarly culture and educational success: Books and schooling in 27 nations|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0276562410000090|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=28|issue=2|pages=171–197|doi=10.1016/j.rssm.2010.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/blog/2196_a_book_of_their_own_how_owning_books_affects_childrens_literacy|title=A book of their own: how owning books affects children's literacy|last=Poulton|first=Lizzie|date=July 7, 2010|website=Literacy Trust|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "book desert" came into regular use in the mid-2010s and the [[social enterprise]] [http://www.uniteforliteracy.com Unite for Literacy] is credited as having coined the term.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unite for Literacy created an operational definition of a book desert when they published the U.S. Book Desert Map: A geographic area (country, state, county, census tract) where it is predicted that a majority of homes have less than 100 printed books. In March 2014, James LaRue, director of the [[American Library Association]]'s Office for [[Intellectual Freedom]] and the [[Freedom to Read Foundation]], used the term in an issue of ''[[American Libraries]]'', where he described the term as applying to houses with 25 or fewer books in them and discussed ways to lessen or eradicate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/blogs/e-content/the-price-is-right-at-unite-for-literacy/|title=The Price Is Right at Unite for Literacy|last=LaRue|first=James|date=March 4, 2014|website=American Libraries Magazine|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, professors [[Susan B. Neuman]] and Naomi Moland published a study in ''[[Urban Education]]'', where they examined how the lack of printed reading material among low-income and poverty stricken neighborhoods impacts early childhood development and used the term to describe areas and homes with little access to written materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This study built upon other research Neuman had conducted in 2001 on the same topic and the researchers found few stores in [[Detroit]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Washington, D.C.]]; the focus areas of their research had print resources for children ages 0 through 18.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/where-books-are-nonexistent/491282/|title=The Children Who Grow Up in 'Book Deserts'|last=Wong|first=Alia|date=July 14, 2016|website=The Atlantic|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those stores, many were [[dollar stores]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''The Atlantic'' reported that in 2015 Neuman and [[JetBlue|JetBlue Airways]] held an experiment to foster literacy by providing book vending machines in a low-income Washington D.C. neighborhood. Over 20,000 books were given away, prompting Neuman to conclude that the neighborhood's parents did care about their children's education but lacked "the resources to enable their children to be successful."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Contributing factors ===
Multiple factors are credited as contributing to the formation of book deserts, the most frequently highlighted of which tends to be poverty and low income. Other factors tend to include language and geography, as some areas lack access to bookstores or public or community school libraries that would provide books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wkbn.com/2016/07/29/warren-group-works-to-fight-book-desert-phenomenon/|title=Warren group works to fight 'book desert' phenomenon|last=Santelli|first=James|date=July 30, 2016|website=WKBN|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bookselling|Book store]] closures due to [[bankruptcy]] or other financial difficulties are also occasionally cited as a contributing factor, when the closure leaves the area without a bookseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ezproxy2.library.drexel.edu/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;u=drexel_main&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A286307818&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=drexel_main&amp;authCount=1|title=Store closures create US 'book deserts'|last=Gelles|first=David|date=April 14, 2012|work=The Financial Times|subscription=yes|access-date=August 6, 2016|via=Academic OneFile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unite Book Desert Map.jpg|thumb|US Book Desert map from Unite for Literacy]]

Unite for Literacy has developed a book desert map of the [[United States]] powered by [[Esri]]'s ArcGIS platform, which provides a visual presentation of the lack of books in the nation, states, counties and [[census tract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uniteforliteracy.com/corp/esri&lt;/ref&gt; To create the map, Unite for Literacy performed a statistical analyses of data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and the American Community Survey. Data used in the map includes the number of books in 4th graders' homes, average community income, ethnic diversity, geographic location and home language. Unite for Literacy unveiled the map during the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] America (CGI America) meeting held in Denver, Colorado, in June 2014.

==History==
CMD was founded in 1993 by [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] writer [[John Stauber]] in Madison, Wisconsin. [[Lisa Graves]] is the former president of CMD.&lt;ref name=madison/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/04/exposing-alec-how-conservative-backed-state-laws-are-all-connected/255869/| title = Exposing ALEC: How Conservative-Backed State Laws Are All Connected| publisher = [[The Atlantic]] | date = April 14, 2012|accessdate= June 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Sheldon Rampton]] was formerly an editor of PR Watch.

In a report released on April 6, 2006, CMD listed information on 77 television stations that had broadcast [[video news release]]s (VNRs) in the prior 10 months. CMD said that in each case the television station actively disguised the VNR content to make it appear to be its own reporting, and that in more than one-third of the cases, the stations aired the pre-packaged VNR in its entirety. In August 2006, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] mailed formal letters to the owners of the 77 television stations, asking for information regarding agreements between the stations and the creators of VNRs, and asking whether there was any "consideration" given to the stations in return for airing the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = TV Stations' 'Fake News' Scrutinized | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/16/national/main1900602.shtml | agency = [[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[CBS News]] |date = August 16, 2006 | accessdate = August 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. FCC Probes Local TV Stations Airing Ads as News (Update3) |first=Neil |last=Roland |date=May 25, 2006 |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |accessdate=February 25, 2015 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aIeR2Prf88nE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fake out: FCC warns stations about airing video news releases |publisher=[[Mediaweek]] |date=August 21, 2006 |last=Shields |first=Todd |authorlink=Todd Shields}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Farsetta |first1=Diane |first2=Daniel |last2=Price |title=Fake TV news: Widespread and undisclosed |publisher=Center for Media and Democracy |date=April 6, 2006 |accessdate=October 22, 2015 |url=http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9780415517713/STUDENTS/chapter2/iw/dig_deeper/Fake_TV_News.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, CMD merged with ''[[The Progressive]]'', a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] monthly magazine, but separated after six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pulling Together, Saying Goodbye |last=Conniff |first=Ruth | authorlink =Ruth Conniff |date=November 2014 |volume=78 |issue=11 |page=5 |work=[[The Progressive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMD has investigated and reported on [[donor-advised fund]]s, referring to such donations as a form of "[[dark money]]". According to the ''[[Capital Times]]'' of [[Madison, Wisconsin]], CMD is a recipient of donor-advised funds via the [[Schwab Charitable Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Craver|first1=Jack|title=Progressive watchdog group gets two big anonymous donations|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/jack_craver/progressive-watchdog-group-gets-two-big-anonymous-donations/article_fd110a62-5ea5-11e3-90ad-001a4bcf887a.html|accessdate=March 24, 2015|work=Capital Times|date=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 to 2009, SourceWatch hosted Congresspedia, a wiki that was funded by the [[Sunlight Foundation]] and intended to document the activities of the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Ellen|title=Two Great Sites That Go Well Together|url=http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2008/03/28/two-great-sites-that-go-well-together/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
CMD states that it accepts donations from "individuals and philanthropic foundations through gifts and grants", but "no funding from for-profit corporations or grants from government agencies." It maintains a partial list of supporters on its website.&lt;ref name=aboutus/&gt;

In a column for [[Fox News]], Dan Gainor wrote that CMD received $200,000 from the [[Open Society Foundations|Open Society Institute]] (OSI), a [[Grant (money)|grantmaking]] network founded by [[George Soros]], aimed to shape public policy to promote [[democracy|democratic]] [[governance]], [[human rights]], and [[Economic reform|economic]], [[legal]], and [[social reform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/12/11/left-obama-escalate-war-on-banks-into-dangerous-territory/#ixzz1gWfrRwHS|title=Left, Obama Escalate War on Banks Into Dangerous Territory|publisher=Fox News|date=December 11, 2011|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; CMD stated that it received a grant from OSI "to continue work on national security issues".&lt;ref name=aboutus/&gt;

[[Fox News]] reported that in 2011 CMD received $864,740 in donations. $520,000, or 60% of 2011's total revenue, was received from the Schwab Charitable Fund, a [[donor advised fund]] which preserves the anonymity of donors by not disclosing individual donor names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Tori|title=Liberal ‘media’ group gets $520G dark money donation for war on right|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/04/liberal-media-group-gets-520g-dark-money-donation-for-war-on-right/?intcmp=latestnews|accessdate=December 6, 2013|newspaper=Fox News|date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the conservative news website [[Watchdog.org]], the [[Tides Foundation]], a foundation known to donate primarily to liberal organizations,{{cn|date=February 2017}} reported giving CMD $160,000 in 2011, but that money did not appear on CMD's tax return. When asked why CMD heavily criticizes conservative organizations for not revealing their donors while refusing to name all of CMD's funders, CMD's president Lisa Graves said, “The question of conservative funders versus liberal funders, I think, is a matter of false equivalency.&lt;ref name=richards&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Tori|title=Shadowy funders build liberal war chest to unseat governor|url=http://watchdog.org/121286/liberal-war-chest/|accessdate=March 23, 2014|newspaper=Watchdog.org|date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite frankly a number of these (corporate donors) like Koch Industries … they’re advancing not just an ideological agenda but an agenda that helps advance the bottom line of their corporate interests. That’s quite a distinct difference from some of the funders in the progressive universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kittle|first1=M.D.|title=Center for Media and Democracy: Liberals are morally superior|url=https://www.watchdog.org/wisconsin/center-for-media-and-democracy-liberals-are-morally-superior/article_9038a38e-7146-57a8-829b-ae18f317dcef.html|website=WisconsinWatchdog.org|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, ''[[Politico]]'' reported that the Center for Media and Democracy was a recipient of funding through the [[Democracy Alliance]], a network of progressive donors.&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vogel|first1=Kenneth|title=Inside the vast liberal conspiracy|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/inside-the-vast-liberal-conspiracy-108171.html|accessdate=June 24, 2014|publisher=Politico|date=June 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spring 2014 Democracy Alliance Investment Recommendations|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1202744-da-portfolio2012-2014-042714.html#document/p1|publisher=Democracy Alliance|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
CMD and progressive magazine ''[[The Nation]]'' shared a September 2011 [[The Sidney Award|Sidney Award]], an award given by [[The Sidney Hillman Foundation]] in recognition of "socially-conscious journalism", for "ALEC Exposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sedlis |first1=Julie |title=The Center for Media and Democracy and The Nation Win September Sidney for "ALEC:Exposed," A Look Into the Secretive Collaboration Between Corporations and Politicians on State Legislation |url=http://www.hillmanfoundation.org/sidneys/the-center-for-media-and-democracy-and-the-nation-win-september-sidney |accessdate=October 25, 2014 |publisher=[[The Sidney Hillman Foundation]] |date=July 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502125413/http://www.hillmanfoundation.org/sidneys/The-Center-for-Media-and-Democracy-and-The-Nation-Win-September-Sidney |archivedate=May 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre de Recerca Matemàtica (CRM)''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈsentɾə ðə rəˈsɛɾkə mətəˈmatikə}}) is a consortium, with its own [[legal status]], integrated by the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] (IEC)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iec.cat&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan Government]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gencat.cat&lt;/ref&gt; It is a research institute associated with the [[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona]]. The CRM is in essence a horizontal infrastructure that gives support to [[mathematical]] research groups and encourages the pursuit of emerging lines of research. The centre's activities are divided into two very different categories. The first category places the centre as organiser of international competitions (intensive research programmes, advances courses, conferences, etc.) and as a centre for long-term visiting researchers working in collaboration with the research community of Catalonia. Secondly, since 2008 CRM includes its own research groups, which allows it to open lines of research in different applied areas.

The current director of the CRM is Lluís Alsedà. The CRM is a member of ERCOM (European Research Centres in Mathematics). Through its postdoctoral
programme, the institute is also part of EPDI (European Postdoctoral Institute).

The CRM has the following goals:
* To carry out research programmes on high-level topics.
* To attract the best [[Postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral]] fellows by way of competitive programmes of various administrations and agencies.
* To consolidate mechanisms for an efficient service to mathematicians.
* To take further steps towards becoming as competitive as the best European research centres and those of other scientifically [[Developed country|developed countries]] of similar characteristics.

[[Image:Blacksmithmonk.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated initial]] from Gregory's ''Commentary on Job'', Abbey of Saint-Pierre at Préaux, Normandy]]

[[Saint Gregory]]'s '''''Commentary on Job''''', or '''''Moralia, sive Expositio in Job''''', sometimes called '''''Magna Moralia''''' (not to be confused with [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Magna Moralia]]''), was written between 578 and 595, begun when Gregory was at the court of [[Tiberius II]] at [[Constantinople]], but finished only after he had already been in [[Rome]] for several years. It is Gregory's major work, filling some 35 books or 6 volumes, a commentary on the [[Book of Job]] entitled "An Extensive Consideration of Moral Questions".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6549">'''Conflict archaeology''' is a sub-discipline within [[archaeology]] focused on intergroup and intragroup conflict. Closely linked to [[battlefield archaeology]] and Military Sites Archaeology, conflict archaeology is developing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farrell|first=Nancy|editor=Thomas F. King|title=A Companion to Cultural Resource Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OUNw_jXhnkC&amp;pg=PT205|accessdate=30 September 2011|date=29 March 2011|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9605-8|pages=205–|chapter=Historic Battlefields: Studying and Managing Fields of Conflict}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an umbrella sub-discipline that encompasses these others, allowing for greater [[epistemological]] elasticity than other terms. Modern conflict archaeology deals with technological, social, cultural, psychological aspects of present conflicts. Unlike battlefield archaeology, modern conflict archaeology delves deeper into the anthropological study of the conflicts rather than the physical manifestations of the battles.As stated by Nicholas Saunders in his book entitled Beyond the Dead Horizon, "These complexities are generated partly by nature of modern wars/conflicts of industrialized intensity and they incorporate political and nationalistic motivations and notions of ethnicity and identity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to understand the modern-day conflict, it is important to recognize two fundamental issues:

1. Realize that each conflict is a multifaceted issue which incorporates many anthropological contexts of involved populations.

2. In order to understand the actual conflict, one must understand all facets of the motivating issues and their layers of conflict.

As stated by Saunders,"This multitude of issues makes modern conflict sites...multi-layered landscapes...that require robust interdisciplinary approaches."(Saunders, pg. x). Conflict archaeology addresses any type of issue regardless of size or effect, more importantly the residual effects felt from the conflict itself upon the surrounding populations. "In this view the constantly shifting multidimensional aftermaths of conflict are as important as the conflict themselves."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict archaeology is most strongly followed by some historical archaeologists in the [[United States]] and archaeologists of all time periods in [[Europe]]. Significant studies of conflict in [[North America]] predating the arrival of Europeans have been done, but these works are largely situated within regional, not thematic literature.

== A Case Study: The Bare Bones; body parts and conflict behavior ==

Within Saunders work, Susannah Callow's paper is presented as she analyzes the role in which body parts of the deceased act as key indicators of complex narratives of individual experiences during a conflict (i.e. politics, social status, personal memento etc.) as stated by allowing, "...the body is central to human experiences of modern warfare...material and human destruction...becomes a way of living material form to discourse and the body in pain is a vital component in battle to assert meaning and authority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially our bodies act as physical manifestations of past conflicts. The physical effects that violence inflicts upon our bodies are allowed for the characterization of the surrounding conflict which was participated in. Our bodies tell us the human interaction enacted and the course of the conflict, whether one side was dominated in regards to another, based on physical evidence. As Callow states, "Permanent wounds such as scars or missing body parts convey messages about the success or failure of casing wounds to one another...and the military success of the individual who carries out such acts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A primary component is that of dehumanization. "Dehumanization is the psychological term describing a process of denying the humanity or human characteristic of an individual/subgroup" Dehumanization is evident via acts of mutilation and is often revealed by the manner in which the dead are killed. This psychological process leads to the lack of restraint and often incites the celebration of death. Therefore, this is often illustrated by mass killings, genocides, use and disuse of parts and body part artifact construction. There are two major components of the dehumanization perspective:

1. Body parts are equivalent to material culture
This is expressed in the lynchings of the south in the late 18th century. These lynchings often featured a crowd oftentimes which would take and sell body parts of the deceased. These actions, as Callow states, "...conferred the stakes of belonging to the 'correct' group"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|title=Beyond the Dead Horizon: Studies in Modern Conflict Archaeology|year=2012|publisher=Oxbow Books|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-1-84217-471-5|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Deceased Individuals are viewed as waste.
For example, Nazi concentration camps often referred to the Jews as "loads or "merchandise" and resulted in the victims loss of identity. This is further emphasized as they were marked with numbers and herded like cattle. In the end disposal of their bodies were often mechanical oftentimes lacking proper post-mortem practices. Also, the deceased body parts were often used to create various commodities. For example, skulls were collected and sold for profit, skin was used to make leather  and human fat was used to make soap.
Therefore, it is through these examples that we realize that modern day conflicts are not limited to the battles and wars, but the psychological and anthropological interactions between various populations and the underlying motivations it exposes.

The four tables give the most commonly accepted dates or ranges of dates for the [[Old Testament]]/[[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Deuterocanonical books]] (included in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] bibles, but not in the Hebrew and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] bibles) and the [[New Testament]], including, where possible, hypotheses about their formation-history.

Table I is a chronological overview. Table II treats the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible books, grouped according to the divisions of the Hebrew Bible with occasional reference to scholarly divisions. Table III gives the Deuterocanonical books. Table IV gives the books of the New Testament, including the earliest preserved fragments for each. The tables are in chronological order in reference to how they read in the Bible.

==Table I: Chronological overview==
This table summarises the chronology of the main tables and serves as a guide to the historical periods mentioned. Much of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament may have been assembled in the 5th century BCE.{{sfn|Berquist|2007|p=3–4}} The New Testament books were composed largely in the second half of the 1st century CE.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff.}} The [[Deuterocanonical books]] fall largely in between.

|[[Book of Genesis]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Exodus]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Leviticus]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Numbers]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Book of Deuteronomy]]
|The majority of modern biblical scholars believe that the [[Torah]] – the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy – reached its present form in the [[Second Temple Judaism|post-Exilic period]].{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=5}} 

The five books are drawn from four "sources" (distinct schools of writers rather than individuals): the [[Priestly source]], the [[Yahwist]] and the [[Elohist]] (these two are often referred to collectively as the "non-Priestly" source), and the [[Deuteronomist]].{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}} There is general agreement that the Priestly source is post-exilic, but there is no agreement over the non-Priestly source(s).{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}}

* Genesis is a post-exilic work combining "Priestly" and "non-Priestly" material.{{sfn|Carr|2007|p=10}}
* Exodus is an anthology drawn from nearly all periods of Israel's history.{{sfn|Dozeman|2000|p=443}}
* Leviticus is entirely Priestly and dates from the exilic/post-exilic period.{{sfn|Houston|2003|p=102}}
* Numbers is a Priestly redaction (i.e., editing) of a [[Yahwist]]ic/non-Priestly original.{{sfn|McDermott|2002|p=21}}
* Deuteronomy, now the last book of the Torah, began as the set of religious laws (these make up the bulk of the book), was extended in the early part of the 6th century to serve as the introduction to the [[Deuteronomistic history]], and later still was detached from that history, extended yet again, and edited to conclude the Torah.{{sfn|Van Seters|2004|p=93}}

|This group of books, plus Deuteronomy, is called the "[[Deuteronomistic history]]" by scholars. The proposal that they made up a unified work was first advanced by [[Martin Noth]] in 1943, and has been widely accepted. Noth proposed that the entire history was the creation of a single individual working in the exilic period (6th century BCE); since then there has been wide recognition that the history appeared in two "editions", the first in the reign of Judah's [[King Josiah]] (late 7th century), the second during the exile (6th century).{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=2 and fn.6}} Noth's dating was based on the assumption that the history was completed very soon after its last recorded event, the release of King [[Jehoiachin]] in Babylon c. 560 BCE; but some scholars have termed his reasoning inadequate, and the history may have been further extended in the post-exilic period.{{sfn|Person|2010|p=10-11}}

|Three Major Prophets: 
[[Book of Isaiah#Composition|Book of Isaiah]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Jeremiah#Composition|Book of Jeremiah]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Ezekiel]]

The [[Book of Jeremiah]] exists in two versions, Greek (the version used in Orthodox Christian Bibles) and Hebrew (Jewish, Catholic and Protestant Bibles), with the Greek representing the earlier version.{{sfn|Allen|2008|p=7-8}} The Greek version was probably finalised in the early Persian period and translated into Greek in the 3rd century BCE, and the Hebrew version dates from some point between then and the 2nd century BCE.{{sfn|Sweeney|2010|p=94}}

The [[Book of Ezekiel]] describes itself as the words of the [[Ezekiel]] ben-Buzi, a priest living in exile in the city of [[Babylon]], and internal evidence dates the visions to between 593 and 571 BCE. While the book probably reflects much of the historic Ezekiel, it is the product of a long and complex history, with significant additions by a "school" of later followers.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=8}}{{sfn|Joyce|2009|p=16}}

[[File:Lden Schiphol.gif|thumb|right|Noise level map of the surroundings of [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]]]]
The '''day–evening–night noise level''' or '''L{{sub|den}}''' is a 2002 [[European Union|European]] standard to express noise level over an entire day. It is calculated as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32002L0049&amp;from=EN|title=Directive 2002/49/EC|date=25 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_{den} = 10 \cdot log_{10} \left(\frac{1}{24} \left(12\cdot 10 ^ \frac{L_{day}}{10} + 4\cdot 10 ^\frac{L_{evening} + 5}{10} + 8\cdot 10 ^\frac{L_{night} + 10}{10}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where the long-term average noise levels are defined as:
{| class="wikitable
!Part of the day || hours || penalty (dB)
|-
| day || 6 - 18 || 0
|-
| evening || 18 - 22 || 5
|-
| night || 22 - 6 || 10
|}
The exact hours of the three periods may be chosen differently by individual EU member states.

A '''Discourse-Completion Task''' (DCT) is a tool used in [[linguistics]] and [[pragmatics]] to elicit particular [[speech acts]].  A DCT consists of a one-sided role play containing a situational prompt which a participant will read to elicit the responses of another participant.

==Background==
The instrument was originally developed by [[Shoshana Blum-Kulka]] for studying speech act realization comparatively between native and non-native Hebrew speakers, based on the work of E. Levenston.&lt;ref name="blum"&gt;Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper. (1989). Investigating cross-cultural pragmatics: An introductory overview. In Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper (Eds.), Cross-cultural pragmatics: Requests and apologies (pp. 1-34). Norwood, NJ: Ablex, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

DCTs are used in pragmatics research to study speech acts and find the medium between naturally occurring speech and scripted speech acts.  In comparing role-plays to DCTs, role-plays are considered to elicit data more similar to naturally occurring speech acts,&lt;ref&gt;Gass, S., &amp; Houck, N. (1999). Interlanguage refusals: a cross-cultural study of Japanese English. Walter de Gruyet, pp. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golato, A. (2003). Studying compliment responses: A comparison of DCTs and recordings of natu-
rally occurring talk. Applied Linguistics, 24(1), 90–121.&lt;/ref&gt; yet are considered harder to score, attributed to the influence of the interlocutors.&lt;ref&gt;Roever, C. (2011). Testing of second language pragmatics: Past and future. Language testing (0265-5322), 28 (4), p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A discourse-completion task consists of scripted dialogue representing various scenarios, preceded by a short prompt describing the setting and situation.&lt;ref name="blum" /&gt; The prompt usually includes information on social distance between participants and pre-event background to help the participant construct the scenarios.

In [[social science]], '''disenchantment''' ({{lang-de|Entzauberung}}) is the cultural [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] and devaluation of [[religion]] apparent in modern society. The term was borrowed from [[Friedrich Schiller]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jenkins, [http://maxweberstudies.org/kcfinder/upload/files/MWSJournal/1.1pdfs/1.1%2011-32.pdf Disenchantment, Enchantment and Re-Enchantment] (2000) 1 ''Max Weber Studies'' 11.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Max Weber]] to describe the character of [[modernized]], [[bureaucratic]], [[secularized]] [[Western World|Western society]], where scientific understanding is more highly valued than belief, and where processes are oriented toward rational goals, as opposed to [[traditional society]], where for Weber, "the world remains a great enchanted garden".&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Sociology of Religion'' (1971) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment ambivalence==

Weber's ambivalent appraisal of the process of disenchantment as both positive ''and'' negative&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Cascardi, ''The Subject of Modernity'' (1992) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by the [[Frankfurt school]] in their examination of the self-destructive elements in [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism.&lt;ref&gt;G. Borradori, ''Philosophy in an Age of Terror'' (2004) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]] has subsequently striven to find a positive foundation for [[modernity]] in the face of disenchantment, even while appreciating Weber's recognition of how far secular society was created from, and is still "haunted by the ghosts of dead religious beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;Murray E. G. Smith, ''Early Modern Social Theory'' (1998) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have seen the disenchantment of the world as a call for [[Existentialism|existentialist]] commitment and individual responsibility before a collective normative void.&lt;ref&gt;L. Embree ed., ''Schutzian Social Science'' (1999) p. 110-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacralization==

Disenchantment is related to the notion of desacralization, whereby the structures and institutions that previously channeled spiritual belief into rituals that promoted collective identities came under attack and waned in popularity. According to [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], the ritual of sacrifice involved two processes: sacralization and desacralization. The first process endows a profane offering with sacred properties—consecration—which provides a bridge of communication between the worlds of the sacred and profane. Once the sacrifice has been made, the ritual must be desacralized in order to return the worlds of the sacred and profane to their proper places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Catherine|title=Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}} p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Disenchantment operates on a macro-level, rather than the micro-level described above. It also destroys part of the process whereby the chaotic social elements that require sacralization in the first place continue with mere knowledge as their antidote. Thereby disenchantment can be related to Durkheim's concept of [[anomie]]: an un-mooring of the individual from the ties that bind in society.&lt;ref&gt;Bell&lt;/ref&gt;{{RefImprove|section|date=December 2016}}

==Reenchantment==

In recent years, Weber's paradigm has been challenged by thinkers who see a process of "reenchantment" operating alongside that of disenchantment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua Landy]] and Michael Saler, eds., ''The Re-Enchantment of the World: Secular Magic in a Rational Age'', Stanford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, enchantment is used to fundamentally change how even low paid service work is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;Endrissat, N., Islam, G., &amp; Noppeney, C. (2015). Enchanting Work: New Spirits of Service Work in an Organic Supermarket. Organization Studies, 36(11), 1555–1576. http://doi.org/10.1177/0170840615593588.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jung]] considered [[Symbol#Psychoanalysis and archetypes|symbols]] to provide a means for the [[numinous]] to return from the unconscious to the desacralized world&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) p. 83-94&lt;/ref&gt; - a means for the recovery of [[myth]], and the sense of wholeness it once provided, by a disenchanted modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Casement, ''Who Owns Jung?'' (2007) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Gellner]] argued that though disenchantment was the inevitable product of modernity, many people just could not stand a disenchanted world, and therefore opted for various "re-enchantment creeds" (as he called them) such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[Marxism]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinianism]]{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[ethnomethodology]]. A noticeable feature of these re-enchantment creeds is that they all tried to make themselves compatible with naturalism: i.e., they did not refer to supernatural forces.&lt;ref&gt;[[John A. Hall]], ''Ernest Gellner: An Intellectual Biography'', Verso, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leo Ruickbie]] showed on the basis of research in the [[Neopagan]] community that modern magical practitioners demonstrated re-enchantment. Using both qualitative participant research and quantitative survey analysis he was able to demonstrate a range of re-enchanted characteristics conforming to those extrapolated from Weber's theories.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Ruickbie, 'The Re-Enchanters: Theorising Re-Enchantment and Testing for its Presence in Modern Witchcraft', unpublished PhD thesis, King's College, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leo Ruickbie, 'Weber and the Witches: Sociological Theory and Modern Witchcraft', Journal of Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies, 2006, 116-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disenchantment as Myth===

American [[historian of religion]] Jason Josesphson-Storm has challenged mainstream sociological and historical interpretations of the ideas of both disenchantment and reenchantment, labeling disenchantment as a "myth." Josephson-Storm argues that there has not been a decline in belief in magic or mysticism in Western Europe or the United States, even after adjusting for religious belief, education, and class.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephson-Storm has further argued that many influential theorists of disenchantment, including Weber and some members of the [[Frankfurt School]], were not only aware of modern European magical and occult movements but consciously engaged with them.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 215, 269-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Foundational theorists of disenchantment such as Weber and [[James George Frazer]] did not envision a rigid binary between rationality or rationalization and magical thinking and did not describe a process of "reenchantment" to reverse or compensate for disenchantment.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 277-8, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephson-Storm, this information necessitates a re-interpretation of Weber's idea of disenchantment as referring more to the sequestering and professionalization of magic.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm, ''Myth of Disenchantment'' (2017), 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Etymologicum Magnum''''' ({{lang-el|Ἐτυμολογικὸν Μέγα}}, ''Ἐtymologikὸn Mέga'') (standard abbreviation '''''EM''''', or '''''Etym. M.''''' in older literature) is the traditional title of a Greek lexical [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] by an unknown [[lexicographer]] around 1150 AD. It is the largest Byzantine lexicon and draws on many earlier grammatical, lexical and rhetorical works. Its main sources were two previous ''etymologica'', the so-called ''[[Etymologicum Genuinum]]'' and the ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]''. Other sources include [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], the ''Epitome'' of [[Diogenianus]], the so-called ''Lexicon'' Αἱμωδεῖν (''Haimōdeῖn''), Eulogius’ Ἀπορίαι καὶ λύσεις (''Ἀporίai kaὶ lύseis''), [[Georgius Choeroboscus|George Choeroboscus]]’ ''Epimerismi ad Psalmos'', the ''Etymologicon'' of [[Orion of Thebes]], and collections of [[Scholion|''scholia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897), 248–253, 351–352; Sturz (1820)&lt;/ref&gt; The compiler of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was not a mere copyist; rather he amalgamated, reorganised, augmented and freely modified his source material to create a new and individual work.

The ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the ''Etymologicum Magnum'' was published by [[Zacharias Calliergi|Zacharias Kallierges]] and [[Nikolaos Vlastos]] under the patronage of [[Anna Notaras]] at [[Venice]] in 1499. The typeface was designed and cut by Kallierges, modeled on his own handwriting. The decorative initial letters and headpieces are patterned on the decorations of the Byzantine manuscript tradition, and the woodcut borders incorporate elaborate arabesque designs, usually colored white on red, but also white on gold. The decorations of the Kallierges edition had a great influence in printing, especially on Greek liturgical books.&lt;ref&gt;Ecro Layton, ''Five Centuries of Books and Manuscripts in Modern Greek: A Catalogue of an Exhibition at the Houghton Library December 4, 1987, through February 17, 1988'' (Cambridge: Harvard College Library, 1990), pp. 39-41&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent complete edition is by [[Thomas Gaisford]] (Oxford 1848).&lt;ref&gt;T. Gaisford (ed.), ''Etymologicum Magnum'' (Oxford 1848; repr. Amsterdam 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; A new (uncompleted) edition is in preparation  by F. Lasserre and N. Livadaras (under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Auctum'').&lt;ref&gt;F. Lasserre and N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">'''Forensic geology''' is the study of evidence relating to [[mineral]]s, [[oil]], [[petroleum]], and other materials found in the [[Earth]], used to answer questions raised by the [[legal system]].

In 1975, Ray Murray and fellow [[Rutgers University]] professor John Tedrow published ''Forensic Geology''.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Raymond C. and Tedrow, John C. F. (1975) ''Forensic Geology: Earth sciences and criminal investigation'' Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, New Jersey, {{ISBN|978-0-8135-0794-1}}; second edition 1992, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, {{ISBN|978-0-13-327453-0}}; replaced by Murray, Raymond C. (2004) ''Evidence from the Earth: Forensic geology and criminal investigation'' Mountain Press Publications, Missoula, Montana, {{ISBN|978-0-87842-498-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in 2008, Alastair Ruffell and Jennifer McKinley, both of Queen's University Belfast, UK, published ''Geoforensics''&lt;ref&gt;Ruffell, Alastair and McKinley, Jennifer (2008) ''[http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470057351.html Geoforensics]'' John Wiley and Sons, West Sussex, England, {{ISBN|978-0-470-05735-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book that focuses more on the use of [[geomorphology]] and [[geophysics]] for searches. In 2012, Elisa Bergslien, at SUNY Buffalo State, published a general textbook on the topic, ''An Introduction to Forensic Geoscience.'' &lt;ref&gt;Bergslien, Elisa (2012) ''[http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&amp;bcsId=7212&amp;itemId=1405160543 An Introduction to Forensic Geoscience]'' Wiley-Blackwell, West Sussex, England, UK, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6054-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

== Early use of forensic geology ==
According to Murray, forensic geology began with [[Sherlock Holmes]] writer, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. The character Sherlock Holmes claimed to be able to identify where an individual had been by various methods, including his having memorized the exposed geology of London to such a degree that detecting certain clays on a person's shoe would give away a locale.  Georg Popp, of Frankfurt, Germany, may have been the first to use soil analysis for linking suspects to a crime scene.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bell, Suzanne (2004) "geology, forensic" ''The Facts on File Dictionary of Forensic Science'' Infobase Publishing, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x0kmY7Bj1zYC&amp;pg=PA102 page 102], {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5153-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, [[Hans Gross]] used microscopic analysis of soils and other materials from a suspect's shoes to link him to the crime scene.&lt;ref name="Donnelly"&gt;Donnelly, Laurance (2011) [http://facstaff.buffalostate.edu/bergslet/ForensicGeology/Papers/Donnelly2011.pdf "The Renaissance in Forensic Geology"] ''Teaching Earth Sciences'' 36(1): pp. 46&amp;ndash;52&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7553">'''Functional contextualism''' is a modern [[philosophy of science]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=Needs a citation from a Philosophy of Science s source.}} rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general and the field of [[behavior analysis]] and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Roche, B. (Eds.). (2001). ''Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Strosahl, K. &amp; Wilson, K.G. (1999). ''Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: An experiential approach to behavior change''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

==Contextualism==
The form of contextualism from which functional contextualism emerged is the one described by the philosopher [[Stephen C. Pepper]] in his book ''[[World Hypotheses]]: A Study in Evidence''.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, S.C. (1942). ''World hypotheses: A study in evidence''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Pepper noted that philosophical systems tend to cluster around a few distinct "world hypotheses" or "[[world view]]s". Each world view is characterized by a distinctive underlying root metaphor and [[Truth#Substantive theories|truth criterion]]. Root metaphors are based on seemingly well-understood, common-sense, everyday objects or ideas, and serve as the basic analogy by which an analyst attempts to understand the world. A world view's root metaphor roughly corresponds to its [[ontological]] assumptions, or views about the nature of being or existence (e.g., whether the universe is deterministic or not). Truth criteria are inextricably linked to their root metaphors, and provide the basis for evaluating the validity of analyses. A world view's truth criterion roughly corresponds to its [[epistemological]] assumptions, or views about the nature of knowledge and truth (e.g., whether it is discovered or constructed).

The root metaphor of contextualism is the "act in context", whereby any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context. The truth criterion of contextualism is often dubbed "successful working", whereby the truth and meaning of an idea lies in its function or utility, not in how well it is said to mirror reality. In contextualism, an analysis is said to be true or valid insofar it as it leads to effective action, or achievement of some goal. Contextualism is Pepper's term for the philosophical [[pragmatism]] developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], and others.

===Varieties of contextualism===
Analytic goals are vitally important to the contextualistic world view. This is because the analytic tools of contextualism—its root metaphor and truth criterion—both hinge on the purpose of the analysis, and neither can be mounted effectively without a clearly specified analytic goal. The pragmatic truth criterion of "successful working" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because "success" can only be measured in relation to the achievement of some objective.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1953). ''Essays in experimental logic''. New York: Dover (Original work published 1916)&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the root metaphor of the "act-in-context" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because there would be no basis on which to restrict the analysis to a subset of the infinite expanse of the act's historical and environmental context.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, E.V. &amp; Hayes, S.C. (1999). Functional contextualism: A pragmatic philosophy for behavioral science. In W. O'Donohue &amp; R. Kitchener (Eds.), ''Handbook of behaviorism'' (pp. 285–327). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Without a clear analytic goal, the contextualist could analyze the endless context of an act in perpetuity, without ever knowing when the analysis was complete or good enough to be deemed "true" or "useful". It is very difficult for a contextualist without an explicit goal to construct or share knowledge.

Contextualists can, and do, adopt different analytic goals, and the many different varieties of contextualism can be distinguished by their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C. (1993). Analytic goals and the varieties of scientific contextualism. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese &amp; T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), ''Varieties of scientific contextualism'' (pp. 11–27). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their overarching analytic goals, contextualistic theories can be divided into two general categories: "descriptive contextualism" and "functional contextualism".

====Descriptive contextualism====
Descriptive contextualists seek to understand the complexity and richness of a whole event through a personal and aesthetic appreciation of its participants and features. This approach reveals a strong adherence to the root metaphor of contextualism and can be likened to the enterprise of [[history]], in which stories of the past are constructed in an attempt to understand whole events. The knowledge constructed by the descriptive contextualist is personal, ephemeral, specific, and spatiotemporally restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, E.K. (1993). Contextualism, historiography, and the history of behavior analysis. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese &amp; T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), ''Varieties of scientific contextualism'' (pp. 137-165). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Like a [[historical narrative]], it is knowledge that reflects an in-depth personal understanding of a particular event that occurred (or is occurring) at a particular time and place. Most forms of contextualism, including [[social constructionism]], [[dramaturgy]], [[hermeneutics]], and narrative approaches, are instances of descriptive contextualism.

====Functional contextualism====
Functional contextualists, on the other hand, seek to predict and influence events using empirically based concepts and rules. This approach reveals a strong adherence to contextualism's extremely practical truth criterion and can be likened to the enterprise of [[science]] or [[engineering]], in which general rules and principles are used to predict and influence events. Rules or theories that do not contribute to the achievement of one's practical goals are ignored or rejected. Knowledge constructed by the functional contextualist is general, abstract, and spatiotemporally unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, E. J. (2006). Constructing a pragmatic science of learning and instruction with functional contextualism. ''Educational Technology Research &amp; Development, 54'' (1), 5-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Like a scientific principle, it is knowledge that is likely to be applicable to all (or many) similar such events, regardless of time or place.

[[File:Hipogeu Cala en Blanes 10 oct.jpg|thumb|Entrance of the hypogeum of Torre del Ram. ]]
The '''Hypogeum of Torre del Ram''' is an archaeological site of de '''Torre del Ram''', in Cala en Blanes ([[Ciutadella de Menorca]]), is a [[Bronze Age]] funerary [[hypogeum]], which was used as a collective tomb by a family or a small community. Even though it was emptied in later centuries to be reused as a cattle shelter, which caused the loss of all the information about the interred population, grave goods and chronology, its resemblance with other prehistoric tombs of Menorca dates it to between 1700 and 1400 BC.

A stepped corridor leads to the tomb's rectangular chamber, which has a stone bench that surrounds its internal perimeter. Part of the stone gallery, which used to cover the corridor and the entrance, is still preserved, which was built with the cyclopean{{explain|date=December 2017}} technique. 

The corridor is 2.60 m long, while the dimensions of the chamber are: 8.80 m long, 2.50 m wide and 1.95 m high. 
[[File:TORRE DEL RAM interior.jpg|thumb|right|View of the chamber of Torre del Ram hypogeum, ]]

The walls of the internal chamber present several engravings representing three sailing ships and other undetermined figures. Some authors claim the importance of these elements, since they could date back to the [[Bronze Age]].  However, the date of these engraving has not been determined and could have been made in any other subsequent period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.menorcatalayotica.info/Contingut.aspx?IdPub=8574#ancla4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cannes_beach_1980_6.jpg|thumb|Topless sunbathing in France. In certain cultures, public nudity (partial or total) is accepted in certain contexts]]
'''Indecent exposure''' is the deliberate exposure in public or in view of the general public by a person of a portion or portions of their body, in circumstances where the exposure is contrary to local moral or other standards of appropriate behavior. The term ''indecent exposure'' is a legal expression. Social and community attitudes to the exposing of various body parts and laws covering what is referred to as indecent exposure vary significantly in different countries. It ranges from outright prohibition to prohibition of exposure of certain body parts, such as the [[genital area]], [[buttock]]s or [[breast]]s.

Decency is generally judged by the standards of the local community, which are seldom codified in specifics in law. Such standards may be based on religion, morality or tradition, or justified on the basis of "necessary to [[public order]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |edition=Tenth |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=2001 |chapter=Indecent exposure |page=589 |isbn=0-87779-713-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-sexual [[exhibitionism]] or [[public nudity]] is sometimes considered indecent exposure. If [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]]s are performed, with or without an element of nudity, this can be considered [[gross indecency]], which is usually a more serious criminal offence. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of [[modesty]] is also considered to be public indecency.

The legal and community standards of what states of undress constitute indecent exposure vary considerably and depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. These standards have also varied over time, making the definition of indecent exposure itself a complex topic.

== Overview ==
It is generally accepted, at least in [[western countries]], that a naked human body is not in itself indecent. That principle is reflected, for example, in [[depictions of nudity|depiction of the human form]] in art of various forms. Nevertheless, as a general rule, it is also commonly expected that people when they appear in a public place will be appropriately attired. Inappropriateness is viewed in context, so that, for example, what may be appropriate on a beach may be inappropriate in a street, school or workplace. Depending on the context, some degree of inappropriateness may be tolerated, and perhaps described as [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], but in extreme cases of inappropriateness it may be regarded as "crossing the line". Besides the social disapproval of such a state of dress, most jurisdictions have laws to "maintain social order", variously described as [[public nudity]], indecent exposure, as an affront to [[public morality]], public nuisance, besides others. What is an inappropriate state of dress in a particular context depends on the standards of [[decency]] of the community where an exposure takes place. These standards vary from time to time and can vary from the very strict standards of [[modesty]] in places such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, which require most of the body to be covered, to tribal societies such as the [[Pirahã people|Pirahã]] or [[Mursi people|Mursi]] where full nakedness is the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/1416/legality-of-nudism-in-public-places/1524#1524|title=Legality of Nudism in Public Places?|website=politics.stackexchange.com|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is generally no implication that the state of dress objected to is of a sexual nature; and if such an allegation were to be made, the act would generally be described as "[[gross indecency]]".

The standards of decency have varied over time. During the [[Victorian era]], for example, exposure of a woman's legs and some extent the arms,  was considered indecent in much of the [[Western world]].  Hair was sometimes required to be covered in formal occasions as in a form a hat or bonnet. As late as the 1930s and to some extent, the 1950s,  both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing [[bathing suit]]s that covered above the waist. An adult woman exposing her [[navel]] was also considered indecent in the West into the 1960s and 1970s, and even as late as the 1980s.  Moral values changed drastically during the 1990s and 2000s, which in turn changed the criteria for indecent exposure.  Public exposure of the navel has been accepted during the 1990s, such as in beaches,  while in the 2000s, the buttocks can be exposed while wearing a thong.  Today, however, it is quite common for women to go topless at public beaches throughout Europe and South America and even some parts of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3834365/map-topless-laws/|title=Here's Where It's Legal for Women to Go Topless in the U.S.|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the phenomenon widely known as [[exhibitionism|flashing]], involving a woman exposing bare nipples by suddenly pulling up her shirt and [[bra]], may be free from sexual motive or intent, it nonetheless is public exposure and is therefore defined by statute in many states of the United States as prohibited criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/state_statutes2.html#criminal_code |title=Criminal Code |author= |date= |work=Topical Index: State Statutes 2 |publisher=Cornell University Law School |accessdate=2010-09-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation of the exposure is sometimes based on it being unusual, attention-getting, [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]], or separately, as in a public policy protest, inappropriate and to show disrespect to the enemy side. The effects (including negative consequences) may be enhanced by intended or unintended publication of a photograph or film of the act, which would also include [[mooning]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Public clothing==

Public clothing varies by country and may be regulated by law. What parts of the body must be covered varies by region. Although genitals are usually expected to be covered in public in almost all societies, when it comes to other parts of the body such as female breasts, midriff, legs or shoulders, norms vary. For example, in some African cultures, it is the thighs, not the breasts, which must be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3031969.stm|title=MPs defend Swazi bare breasts|author=Tom Holloway |date=15 May 2003|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some societies, the head hair, especially female, must be covered, usually with a scarf. The vast majority of cultures accept that the face can and must be seen, but some cultures (especially in the [[Middle East]]), require that it be covered under a [[burqa]]. In conservative societies, appearing in a public place in clothing that is deemed 'indecent' is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6919581.stm|title=Nigerian skimpy dressers arrested|author=|date=27 July 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44628887|title=Inquiry into Saudi TV presenter's clothing|author=|date=27 June 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6596933.stm|title=Crackdown in Iran over dress codes|author=Frances Harrison |date=27 April 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries there are exceptions to the general rules (social or legal) regarding clothing. For instance, a country which generally prohibits full nudity may allow it in designated places, such as [[nude beaches]], or during various social events such as festivals or nude protests.

==Europe==
Attitudes towards nudity vary by country and are generally most relaxed in [[Scandinavia]], 
where genitals and breasts are not normally considered indecent or obscene. Hence, laws and societal views on public nudity are generally relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Welfare States: Scandinavian Politics and Policy in the Global Age |page=309 |first=Eric S. |last=Einhorn |first2=John |last2=Logue |year=2003 |location=Oxford |publisher=Harcourt |isbn=0-275-95044-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Finland, it is very typical for patrons to bathe nude in the intense heat of [[sauna]]s. 

In the [[Netherlands]], public nudity is allowed at sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and "other suitable places."&lt;ref&gt;[http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html Nudity and the law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012081745/http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html |date=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On nudist beaches, in unisex saunas and in swimming pool changing rooms, remaining partially clothed is frowned upon and the social norm is to undress. 

In [[Barcelona]], public nudity was a recognised right. However, on 30 April 2011, the Barcelona City Council voted a by-law forbidding walking "naked or nearly naked in public spaces" and limiting the wearing of bathing costumes to pools, beaches, adjacent streets and sea-side walks.&lt;ref&gt;[[APNEL]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries, such as the UK, Ireland or Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/classified-odd/11/08/08/model-fined-sunbathing-topless-ombudsman-appeal-mulled|title=Model fined for sunbathing topless; Ombudsman appeal mulled|agency=AFP|date=8 November 2008|website=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt; are more conservative. 

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, indecent exposure was prosecuted under either section 28 of the [[Town Police Clauses Act 1847]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1847/89/pdfs/ukpga_18470089_en.pdf|title=Town Police Clauses Act 1847 (as enacted)|last=|first=|date=|website=Legislation.Gov.Uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or section 4 of the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]]. The latter was a piece of legislation that made it an offence to sleep rough or beg and contained a provision for the prosecution of:
:every person wilfully openly, lewdly, and obscenely exposing his person in any street, road, or public highway, or in the view thereof, or in any place of public resort, with intent to insult any female...
This provision was repealed by section 66 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] which replaced the offence of "indecent exposure" and other sexual offences with legislation that is more specific and explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Indecency in England 1857-1960: 'A Serious and Growing Evil’|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1HeCQAAQBAJ|first1=David J.|last1=Cox|first2=Kim|last2=Stevenson|first3=Candida|last3=Harris|first4=Judith|last4=Rowbotham|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317573838|volume=Volume 6|series=SOLON Explorations in Crime and Criminal Justice Histories|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current laws apply only to genital exposure with intent to shock those who do not want to see them. The maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment, but this is extremely rare as most cases are dealt with by a fine or through community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030042_en_5#pt1-pb18-l1g66 |title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 |author=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|title=Equality Act 2010|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; People convicted of exposure contrary to section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 must sign the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register]] if they are sentenced to a term of imprisonment or a [[community order]] in excess of 12 months, or if the person they exposed themselves to was aged under 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Offenders Register|url=http://ukcriminallawblog.com/sex-offenders-register/|work=UK Criminal Law Blog|author=Dan Bunting|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public nudity in England and Wales can also be punished as "disorderly behaviour" under the [[Public Order Act 1986]], sections 4A and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2013/10/31/freedom-of-expression-nakedness-in-a-public-place/|title=Freedom of expression – nakedness in a public place  - UK Human Rights Blog|work=UK Human Rights Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland and Northern Ireland the situation is more complex, as some sections of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 extend to these places and some do not. Under [[Scots law]], indecent exposure is considered to be a form of public indecency and is regarded as a [[crimes of indecency|crime of indecency]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Scots law has been known to respond differently from English and Welsh law in cases of indecent exposure. [[Stephen Gough]], a man known as the "Naked Rambler" who hikes across Britain wearing only shoes, has been arrested in both jurisdictions with different consequences in each. The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has considered the introduction of new legislation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

{{Main article|Indecent exposure in the United States}}
The laws governing indecent exposure in the United States vary according to location. In most states [[public nudity]] is illegal. However, in some states it is only illegal if it is accompanied by an intent to shock, arouse or offend other persons.  Some states permit local governments to set local standards. Most states exempt [[breastfeeding]] mothers from prosecution.

==Canada==
In Canada, s.173 of the ''Criminal Code''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/cc/cc.part-v.html |title=Criminal Code of Canada, 1985, Part V, Sexual Offences |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits "indecent acts".&lt;ref&gt;Part 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code provides, in part - Indecent acts - 173. (1) Every one who wilfully does an indecent act (a) in a public place in the presence of one or more persons...is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act, other than the exposure of the genitals and/or female nipples for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age.  Thus, the decision of what states of undress are "indecent", and thereby unlawful, is left to judges. Judges have held, for example, that [[nude sunbathing]] is not indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Beaupré'', 1971, British Columbia Supreme Court. Held: "the phrase 'indecent act' connotes something more active, with greater moral turpitude than the mere state of being nude in a public place."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[streaking]] is similarly not regarded as indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Springer'', 1975, Saskatchewan District Court&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Niman'', 1974, Ontario Provincial Court&lt;/ref&gt; Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends "against public decency or order" and in view of the public.  The courts have found that nude swimming is not offensive under this definition.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Benolkin'', 1977, Saskatchewan Court of the Queen's Bench. It was found that "It cannot be an offence to swim in the nude at a lonely place in Canada in summer. That is part of the pleasure of summer in Canada, particularly to young males. If somebody comes along unexpectedly or if the swimmer misjudged the loneliness of the place the act cannot suddenly become criminal.".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toplessness]] is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in [[Guelph, Ontario]] while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent.&lt;ref name="QueenvsJacob"&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1996/1996canlii1119/1996canlii1119.html | title = Judgment C12668, R. vs. Jacob | date = 1996-12-09 | publisher = Province of Ontario Court of Appeal | accessdate = 2009-02-16| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?language=en&amp;searchTitle=1996+CanLII+1119+%28ON+CA%29&amp;origin=%2Fen%2Fon%2Fonca%2Fdoc%2F1996%2F1996canlii1119%2F1996canlii1119.html&amp;path=/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2000/2000bcsc902/2000bcsc902.html District of Maple Ridge v.

==Australia==
[[File:Banner protesting vehicle emissions at the World Naked Bike Ride, Auckland, New Zealand - 20050217.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Protesters gathered outside a courthouse to protest against the arrest of [[Simon Oosterman]] (second from left), Auckland's 13 Feb 2005 WNBR organizer.]]
In Australia, it is a [[Summary judgment|summary]] or [[criminal]] offence in some [[States and territories of Australia|States and Territories]] to expose one's genitals (also referred to as - 'his or her person')&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|452|1997|litigants=R v Eyles |date=1 October 1997 |courtname=[[NSW Court of Criminal Appeal|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (NSW, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in a public place or in view of a public place. In some jurisdictions exposure of the genitals alone does not constitute an offence unless accompanied by an indecent act, indecent behaviour, grossly indecent behaviour, [[obscenity]], intention to cause offence or deliberate intention. The applicable law is different in each jurisdiction and in several jurisdictions the offence of indecent exposure does not apply.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Penalties vary between jurisdictions and are summarised below. Specific state [[Act of Parliament|Acts]], are as follows:
*Australian Capital Territory – ''Crimes Act'' 1900, section 393 – 'indecent exposure' – penalty 12 months. Under the ''Nudity Act'' 1976, the responsible minister may declare a public area where public nudity is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|393}} Indecent exposure.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|ACT|act|na1976108|Nudity Act 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition of ''person''===
The laws of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory use the term "person", while in the other States the exposure refers to the [[genitalia|genital area]]. It has been noted that a term such as "exposing one's person" relates back to the United Kingdom [[Vagrancy Act 1824|''Vagrancy Act'' 1824]] and ''Evans v Ewels'' (1972)&lt;ref&gt;''Evans v Ewels'' [1972] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 671.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was said that the word "person" was a [[euphemism|genteel synonym]] for "penis" or "vulva". However, it has been held that the word "person" in s5 of the (NSW) ''Summary Offences Act'' is not limited to "penis" or "vulva". For example, in ''R v Eyles'' (1997) the offender was seen masturbating in his front garden and charged with obscene exposure under the NSW Act.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOA1988" /&gt;

:In the case of both males and females, the parts of the body which are capable of being employed for the purpose of obscene exposure are limited. The concepts of obscenity and exposure in a practical sense restrict the potential operation of the provision. There is a question as to whether there is any further restriction to be found in the word "person". The [[Crown Advocate]] has submitted that there may be circumstances in which the exposure of the breasts of a woman is capable of being regarded as obscene, and that it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which the exposure of a person's buttocks could be obscene.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;

However &amp;ndash;

:It is unnecessary and inappropriate to decide in the present case whether her submissions in that regard are correct. The jurisdiction which this Court is exercising is a jurisdiction confined to determining questions of law which arise in the case before the District Court. No question arises in the present case as to whether there are any circumstances in which the exposure by a female of breasts, or by a female or male of buttocks, could involve a contravention of s5. The prosecution case against the appellant was that he obscenely exposed his penis and other genitals. It is sufficient for resolution of the present case to say that this was capable of constituting exposure of "his person" for the purposes of the proceedings against him.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;

The '''Indian Council of Social Science Research''' ('''ICSSR''') is the national body overseeing research in the [[social sciences]] in India. It was established in [[New Delhi]] in 1969.{{r|epw|page=3606}} It provides funding to scholars and to a network of twenty-seven [[research institutes]],{{r|epw|page=3606}} among them:

* the [[Centre for Development Studies]], Thiruvananthapuram
* the [[Centre for Policy Research]], New Delhi
* the [[Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta]]
* the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]], Delhi
* the Centre for Multi-Disciplinary Development Research
* the [[Centre for Women's Development Studies]], Delhi
* the [[Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute]], Allahabad
* the Indian Institute Of Economics, Hyderabad
* the [[Institute of Public Enterprise]], Hyderabad
* the [[Institute for Social and Economic Change]], Bangalore
* the [[Institute for Studies in Industrial Development]], New Delhi
* the [[Madras Institute of Development Studies]].

A large proportion of its budget is spent on its own administration; in 1996–1997, this amounted to 23% of total expenditure.{{r|epw|page=3607}} It has been described as an "oversized, unimaginative and inefficient bureaucrac[y]".{{r|epw|page=3604}}

The '''Institute for the Languages of Finland''' ({{lang-fi|Kotimaisten kielten keskus}}, abbreviated ''KOTUS'', {{lang-smn|Päikkieennâm kielâi tutkâmkuávdáš}}, {{lang-se|Ruovttueatnan gielaid guovddáš}}, {{lang-sms|Dommjânnmlaž ǩiõli kõõskõs}}, {{lang-rom|Finnosko tšimbengo instituutos}}, {{lang-sv|Institutet för de inhemska språken}}) is a governmental [[Linguistics|linguistic]] research institute of [[Finland]] geared at studies of [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (cf. [[Finland Swedish]]), the [[Sami languages]], [[Romani language]], and the [[Finnish Sign Language]].

The institute is charged with the standardization of languages used in Finland. In the Swedish language, the institute usually promotes the Swedish usage, with the key aim to prevent the Swedish spoken in Finland from straying too far from its counterpart in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073020/http://www.kotus.fi/index.phtml?l=en&amp;s=205 Swedish]. Research Institute for the Languages of Finland. 12-14-2006. Retrieved 11-22-2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the institute is the foremost authority on Finnish [[language planning]] and its recommendations are considered to define the standard Finnish which is used in official communication. In addition to these tasks, the Institute also has an important consulting function in the shaping of Finnish language policy and in choosing [[toponyms of Finland|toponyms]].

The '''Jerusalem Bird Observatory''' is an urban [[bird observatory]] in [[Israel]], sited on a 5000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; plot in central [[Jerusalem]] between the [[Knesset]] and the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=gis/&gt;

== History ==

The Jerusalem Bird Observatory was established in 1994 by the [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]]. It was founded by the naturalist  Amir Balaban and theornithologist Gidon Perleman.&lt;ref name=gis&gt;[http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000079511.htm Gems in Israel: The Jerusalem Bird Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, 50,000 tourists visited the park.&lt;ref name="jpost 505776"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/HEALTH-SCIENCE/Jerusalem-holds-a-haven-for-birds-505776|title=Jerusalem holds a haven for birds|website=Jpost.com|date=24 September 2017|author=Judy Siegel-Itzkovich|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The Jerusalem Bird Observatory has a strategic location on the [[bird migration]] route between [[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]] along the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]]. Every spring and fall, more than 500 million [[bird]]s migrate through Israel. Two-thirds of the species seen in Jerusalem are migratory. 30% of the birds are permanent residents, they do not migrate.&lt;ref name="jpost 505776"/&gt; [[Gazelle]]s also populate the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Travel/Around-Israel/Top-5-nature-spots-in-Jerusalem|title=Top 5 nature spots in Jerusalem|website=Jpost.com|date=7 February 2012|author=Loren minsky|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The observatory serves as the national [[bird ringing|bird banding]] center.&lt;ref&gt;The Capital's feathered friends., Esteban Alterman, Jerusalem Post, Nov. 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  It is directed by naturalist Amir Balaban and ornithologist Gidon Perleman.&lt;ref name=gis/&gt; Two hundred birds are banded every day by trained [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s during the spring and fall migrations.

It is located between the Parliament, the [[Wohl Rose Park]] and the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] building. Small wooden observation posts are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&lt;ref name="jpost 505776"/&gt; The park is free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.israel21c.org/top-18-things-to-do-in-jerusalem-for-free/|title=Top 18 things to do in Jerusalem for FREE|website=Israel21c.org|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laws against child sexual abuse''' vary by country based on the local definition of who a [[child]] is and what constitutes [[child sexual abuse]]. Most countries in the world employ some form of [[age of consent]], with sexual contact with an [[Minor (law)|underage]] person being criminally penalized. As the age of consent to sexual behaviour varies from country to country, so too do definitions of child sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg3/children/1in5/Source/PublicationSexualViolence/Lalor-McElvaney.pdf|title=Overview of the nature and extent of child sexual abuse in Europe|author=|date=|website=coe.int|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adult's sexual intercourse with a [[Minor (law)|minor]] below the legal [[age of consent]] may sometimes be referred to as [[statutory rape]],&lt;ref name=ojjdp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/208803.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statutory Rape Known to Law Enforcement |accessdate=2008-03-24 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice - Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary 8th Edition''.

The United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC) is an international [[treaty]] that legally obligates nations to protect children's rights. Articles 34 and 35 of the CRC require states to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. This includes outlawing the coercion of a child to perform sexual activity, the [[child prostitute|prostitution of children]], and the [[child pornography|exploitation of children in creating pornography]]. States are also required to prevent the abduction, sale, or trafficking of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/k2crc.htm|title=unhchr.ch|author=|date=|website=www.unhchr.ch|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2014, 195 countries have ratified the Convention, including every member of the [[United Nations]] except the [[United States]] and [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name=untreaty&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection.

==Fiji==
Fiji has recently updated its legislative standards with the introduction of the Crimes Decree (2009). This removed gendered limitations that the Penal Code had held regarding victims and offenders. It updated the maximum sentence so that any offender can face a sentence of life imprisonment for the sexual assault of a person under the age of 13. Prior to this, female offenders could only receive a maximum sentence of up to seven years imprisonment. As well as this, it included the offence of penile-anal penetration, though it does still use the degrading terminology of "sodomy". Previously, the Penal Code only considered penile-vaginal penetration. There are still limitations in Fiji regarding child sexual assault, particularly in the criminal justice practices. The use of mediation between offender, victim and the surrounding families has great potential to revictimise and retraumatise the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304495447_Child_Sexual_Abuse_in_Fiji_Authority_Risk_Factors_and_Responses]|title=Whitehead, John and Roffee, James.

==India==
{{Main article|Child sexual abuse laws in India}}
The Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act, 2012 regarding child sexual abuse has been passed by both the houses of the Indian Parliament in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parliament passes bill to protect children from sexual abuse |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/parliament-passes-bill-to-protect-children-from-sexual-abuse-214437 |publisher=[[NDTV]] |date=May 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act came into force from 14 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tough law on sexual offences against children comes into force|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tough-law-on-sexual-offences-against-children-comes-into-force/article4095666.ece|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysia==
Few forms of child abuse are a crime under Malaysian law. Suspects can be charged only for rape (penile penetration) and incest.
Police can do little since the legal definition is limited. Malaysian courts seldom convict people for child sexual abuse, and Malaysia keeps no official statistics on child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.trust.org/item/20160609025710-2dazo/?source=fiOtherNews3|title=British paedophile exploited stigma of abuse in vulnerable communities|first=Thomson Reuters|last=Foundation|date=|website=trust.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
The South African law on sexual offences was codified in the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]]. Chapter 3 of the act deals with sexual offences against children. The act criminalises:
* acts of sexual penetration with a child (statutory rape)
* other sexual acts with a child (statutory sexual assault)
* exploitation of children in prostitution
* sexual grooming of children
* showing pornography to children
* using children in child pornography
* compelling children to witness sexual acts
* indecent exposure to children
The act establishes a [[National Register for Sex Offenders]] which lists people convicted of sexual offences against children and the mentally disabled.

==Turkey==
Turkey's constitutional court decided in 2016 to annul the provision that punishes all sexual acts against children under the age of 15 as sexual abuse, according to opposition media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-constitutional-court-stirs-outrage-by-annulling-child-sex-abuse-clause.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=101607&amp;NewsCatID=509 Turkey’s Constitutional Court stirs outrage by annulling child sex abuse clause] Hürriyet Daily News, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government, they are preparing a new law more efficient against child abuse and the prohibition is still in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2016/04/11/zero-tolerance-for-child-abuse-turkish-family-minister-says ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom rewrote its criminal code in the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003|Sexual Offences Act of 2003]]. This Act includes definitions and penalties for child sexual abuse offences, and (so far as relating to offences) applies to [[England]] and [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Scottish Law Commission]] published its review of [[rape]] and sexual offences in December 2007, which includes a similar consolidation and codification of child sexual abuse offences in Scotland.

==United States==
{{Main article|Child sexual abuse laws in the United States}}

Child sexual abuse has been recognized specifically as a type of [[child encouragement]] in U.S. federal law since the initial Congressional hearings on child sex in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[[Child sex initiation and Treatment Act|''Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974,'']] (most recently reauthorized by Public Law No.108-36, (2003)).&lt;/ref&gt; Child sexual abuse is illegal in every state,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/state/can/ ''State Statutes - Child Abuse and Neglect,''] Children's Bureau, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as under federal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childwelfare.gov/systemwide/laws_policies/index.cfm ''Index of Child Welfare Laws,''] Children's Bureau, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the states, the specifics of child sexual abuse laws vary, but certain features of these laws are common to all states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/whatiscan.pdf ''Definitions of Child Abuse and Neglect, Summary of State Laws,''] National Clearinghouse on Child Abuse and Neglect Information, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yemen==
In [[Yemen]], the law does not define [[child abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100610.htm |title=Yemen |publisher=State.gov |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zambia==
A recent June 30, 2008 landmark decision by judge, Philip Musonda, of the Zambian High Court gave a minor girl-student 45 million [[Zambian Kwacha]] in awards after she brought her teacher to court for statutory rape. This is the first case of its kind for a minor to win against a person of authority in the nation of Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/08/11/rapecasezambia-articl804/] Women News Network - WNN, ''"When a Girl Student Stands Up and Wins"''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''MPT8080 "Microtutor"''' is a [[microprocessor]] trainer based on the [[Intel 8080]] processor, developed by Limrose Electronics. It was designed in the mid-1970s to assist in the understanding of the then-new microprocessors.

Users of the MPT8080 enter [[assembly language]] programs via binary switches or a [[hexadecimal]] keypad. While the code executes, the user can observe what is happening on the address, data, and control signals of the microprocessor. The MPT8080 acts like a [[Computer architecture simulator|simulator]], in that code can be stepped through one [[Instruction set|instruction]]—or each cycle of each individual instruction—at a time to observe what is happening.

The MPT8080 has simple input and output, consisting of eight [[LED]]s and eight switches. The input port allows code to sense the state of external switches, whilst the output port can display information on one of its eight LEDs. The input and outputs port also have connectors, allowing them to be connected to external signals through accessory patch kits, allowing the MPT8080 to control and monitor other circuitry.

==History==
Initially, a [[Motorola 6800]]-based trainer was developed alongside the Intel 8080–based model, but due to technical and operational issues the 6800 trainer was abandoned.

As recently as 2012, the MPT8080 remained in academic use at [[King's College London]], as part of a course in practical physics.

This version used eight binary switches and a load button for program entry.

=== MPT8080 Version 2 ===
The second version of the MPT8080, introduced around 1980,{{When|date=March 2011}} replaced the binary switch input with a 16-key hexadecimal keypad.  Although more than half of the trainer's circuitry was redesigned for this version, it remained compatible with the first version. A trace mode was added to allow single-cycle execution as well as machine cycles; this allowed the user to quickly step through code until reaching the portion of the program in which the user was interested. Latest UK price £495+vat (source: Limrose U.K.Price List 1st Sept 2010).

== Operating the MPT8080 ==
Programs are entered in the MPT8080 in data entry mode ("MMLE").  Each byte of the program is entered, either by toggling the binary switches and pressing the load button, or by entering the byte on the hexadecimal keypad.  The program can then be executed.

The program can control the eight output port lines, turning the associated LEDs on or off.

By selecting single-step and single-cycle mode and stepping through a program with the step button, the user can see exactly what happens during every [[instruction cycle]], observing the program counter, data bus and control signals on their corresponding LEDs.

By selecting single-instruction mode, rather than single-cycle mode, each press of the step button will execute a complete instruction, rather than a single cycle.  This is useful for quickly advancing to a specific address.

The input/output ports can be used to read external signals and drive [[output device]]s like motors and buzzers with little or no additional hardware.

The system is programmed directly in 8080 [[machine code]]:
&lt;pre&gt;
Address       Code           Instruction                     Comments
0000          DB 00          IN  0                           Read from switches
0002          D3 00          OUT 0                           write to LEDs
0004          C3 00 00       JMP 0                           return to start of code
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Micro-sustainability''' focuses on the small [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al actions that collectively result in a large [[environmental impact]]. Micro-sustainability centers on individual efforts, [[behavior modification]] and creating attitudinal changes, which result in an environmentally conscious individual or community. Micro-sustainability encourages sustainable changes through "change agents", which are individuals that are encouraged; and therefore, foster positive environmental action inside their [[sphere of influence]]. Examples of micro-sustainability include [[recycling]], [[power saving]] by turning off unused lights, programming [[thermostat]]s for efficient [[energy use|use of energy]], reducing [[water usage]], changing [[driving habits]] or patterns in order to use less gasoline or modifying [[buying habits]] to reduce waste and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. The focus is on individual actions, rather than organizational practices. These narrow, small ticket, community level actions have immediate local benefits. If widely imitated, they have a cumulative,&lt;ref name=transformative&gt;[http://www.grist.org/article/2010-02-01-how-personal-actions-can-kick-start-a-sustainability-revolution How personal actions can kick-start a sustainability revolution | Grist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; broader impact.

They combat [[global issue]]s including [[climate change]], and reliance upon [[petroleum]]-based energy sources. Businesses primarily focus on the business case and return on investment of changes such as their source of energy or the way they transport or manufacture products. Governments confront these larger issues through increased regulation, subsidies, and investment in new technologies and energy sources.

'''Moscow State University of Economics, Statistics, and Informatics (MESI)''' was a [[university]].

==History==
Moscow State University of Economics, Statistics and Informatics was founded in 1932 as the Moscow Institute of National Economic Accounting, which in 1948 was reorganized into the Moscow Economic and Statistical Institute (MESI). In 1996 the college received university status and was renamed the Moscow State University of Economics, Statistics and Informatics, while maintaining the same acronym.
Recently, [[Plekhanov Russian University of Economics|Plekhanov University]] acquired the Moscow State University of Economics, Statistics, and Informatics.

In 2014 the agency "Expert RA" included the university in the list of the best higher educational institutions of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

==Alumni==
[[Boris Nuraliev]] - one of the founder of [[1C Company]].
[[Yuri Ayzenshpis]] - Russian entertainment promoter.
[[Puntsagiin Jasrai]] - former Mongolian prime minister.
[[Artemy Troitsky]] - Russian journalist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">{{Listen|filename=Example of flats in music.ogg|title=Example|description=An A natural, then A{{music|♭}}.}}
In [[music theory]], a '''natural''' is an [[accidental (music)|accidental]] which cancels previous accidentals and represents the unaltered [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a [[Musical note|note]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music in Theory and Practice, Vol 1'', p.6. McGraw-Hill, Seventh edition. "''Natural'' ({{music|natural}})—cancels any previous sharp or flat and returns to the natural, or unaltered, pitch."&lt;/ref&gt;

A note is natural when it is neither [[Flat (music)|flat]] ({{music|b}}) nor [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] ({{music|#}}) (nor [[Double flat|double-flat]] {{music|bb}} nor [[Double sharp|double-sharp]] {{music|x}}). Natural notes are the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G represented by the white keys on the [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] of a [[piano]] or [[Organ (music)|organ]]. On a modern [[Pedal harp|concert harp]], the middle position of the seven pedals that alter the tuning of the strings gives the natural pitch for each string.

The scale of [[C major]] is sometimes regarded as the central, natural or basic [[major scale]] because all of its notes are natural notes, whereas every other major scale has at least one sharp or flat in it.

The notes F{{music|b}}, C{{music|b}}, E{{music|#}}, B{{music|#}}, and most notes inflected by double-flats and double-sharps correspond in pitch with natural notes; however, they are not regarded as natural notes but rather as [[enharmonic]] equivalents of them and are just as much [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]]ally inflected notes as most sharped and flatted notes that are represented by black notes on a keyboard.

==Natural sign==
&lt;!--Include history of the natural sign--&gt;
In [[musical notation]], a ''natural sign'' ({{Music|natural}}) is an [[accidental (music)|accidental]] sign used to cancel a [[Flat (music)|flat]] or [[Sharp (music)|sharp]] from either a preceding note or the [[key signature]]. 

: &lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c'' { 

  \time 4/4 a!1
} }

&lt;/score&gt;
If a [[Bar (music)|bar]] contains a double sharp or double flat [[Accidental (music)|accidental]] and the [[composer]] wishes to denote the same note with only a single sharp or flat, a natural sign traditionally precedes the (single) sharp or flat symbol. Naturals are assumed (by default) in key signatures and mentioned only in key signature changes.

The natural sign is derived from a square ''b'' used to denote B{{music|natural}} in medieval music (in contrast with the round ''b'' denoting B{{music|b}}, which became the flat symbol). The [[Unicode]] character &lt;small&gt;MUSIC NATURAL SIGN&lt;/small&gt; '♮' (U+266E) should display as a natural sign. Its HTML entity is &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#9838;&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Double natural==
In a case where one needs to cancel both sharps or flats of a [[double sharp]] or [[double flat]], it is acceptable to write a single natural. In older practice, two naturals ({{music|♮}}{{music|natural}}) can be written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textd/Doublenatural.html|title=OnMusic Dictionary - Term|author=|date=|website=www.music.vt.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, to cancel one flat or sharp from a double flat or sharp, the traditional convention is to use ({{music|natural}}{{music|flat}}) or ({{music|natural}}{{music|sharp}}) respectively, but the naturals are generally omitted in modern notational practice.

[[File:Autograph score of part of Act2 (Wolf's Glen) of 'Der Freischütz' - NGO4p1116.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A hand-written [[Sheet music|musical score]] for Act 2 of the [[opera]] ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]], written in the 1820s. The score contains all the parts for the singers and the [[accompaniment]] parts and melodies for the [[orchestra]].]]
'''Orchestration''' is the study or practice of writing [[music]] for an [[orchestra]] (or, more loosely, for any [[musical ensemble]], such as a [[concert band]]) or of adapting music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Also called "instrumentation", orchestration is the selection of different instruments to play the different parts (e.g., [[melody]], [[bassline]], etc.) of a musical work. For example, a work for solo piano could be adapted and orchestrated so that an orchestra could perform the piece, or a concert band piece could be orchestrated for a symphony orchestra.

Only gradually over the course of music history did orchestration come to be regarded as a separate compositional art and profession in itself. In [[classical music]], most [[composer]]s write the [[melody|melodies]], [[chord progression]] and [[musical form]] for a piece and, then, if they want the piece to be played by an orchestra, they orchestrate the piece themselves. In [[musical theatre]], however, the composer typically writes the [[melody|melodies]] and then hires a professional [[arranger]] or orchestrator to devise the parts for the [[pit orchestra]] to play.

Similarly, when a film company is making a film score, a composer thinks up the main melodies and themes for the score, and then one or more orchestrators are hired to "flesh out" these basic melodies by adding [[accompaniment]] parts, [[bassline]]s, backing chords, and so on. In jazz [[big band]]s, the composer or [[songwriter]] writes the [[lead sheet]], which contains the melody and the chords, and then one or more orchestrators or arrangers "flesh out" these basic musical ideas by creating parts for the saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and the [[rhythm section]] (bass, piano/[[jazz guitar]]/[[Hammond organ]], drums).

==As profession==
An '''orchestrator''' is a trained musical professional who assigns instruments from an [[orchestra]] or other [[musical ensemble]] to a piece of music written by a [[composer]], or who adapts music composed for another medium for an orchestra. Orchestrators may work for [[musical theatre]] productions, [[film production]] companies or [[recording studio]]s. Some orchestrators teach at colleges, conservatories or universities. The training done by orchestrators varies. Most have completed formal postsecondary education in music, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] (B.Mus.), [[Master of Music]] (M.Mus.) or an artist's diploma. Orchestrators who teach at universities, colleges and conservatories may be required to hold a master's degree or a Doctorate (the latter may be a Ph.D. or a D.M.A). Orchestrators who work for film companies, musical theatre companies and other organizations may be hired solely based on their orchestration experience, even if they do not hold academic credentials. In the 2010s, as the percentage of faculty holding [[terminal degree]]s and/or Doctoral degrees is part of how an institution is rated, this is causing an increasing number of postsecondary institutions to require terminal and/or Doctoral degrees.

==In practice==
The term ''orchestration'' in its specific sense refers to the way instruments are used to portray any musical aspect such as [[melody]], [[harmony]] or [[rhythm]]. For example, a C [[major chord]] is made up of the notes [[C (musical note)|C]], [[E (musical note)|E]], and [[G (musical note)|G]]. If the notes are held out the entire duration of a [[bar (music)|measure]], the composer or orchestrator will have to decide what instrument(s) play this chord and in what [[Register (music)|register]]. Some instruments, including [[woodwinds]] and [[brass]] are [[Monophony|monophonic]] and can only play one note of the chord at a time. However, in a full orchestra there are more than one of these instruments, so the composer may choose to outline the chord in its basic form with a group of [[clarinets]] or [[trumpets]] (with separate instruments each being given one of the three notes of the chord). Other instruments, including the [[string instrument|strings]], [[piano]], [[harp]], and pitched [[percussion]] are [[polyphonic]] and may play more than one note at a time. As such, if the composer/orchestrator wishes to have the strings play the C major chord, she could assign the low C to the cellos and basses, the G to the violas, and then a high E to the second [[violin]]s and an E an octave higher to the first violins. If the composer/orchestrator wishes the chord to be played only by the first and second violins, she could give the second violins a low C and give the first violins a [[double stop]] of the notes G (an open string) and E.

Additionally in orchestration, notes may be placed into another register (such as transposed down for the [[string bass|basses]]), doubled (both in the same and different octaves), and altered with various levels of dynamics.  The choice of instruments, registers, and dynamics affect the overall [[timbre|tone color]].  If the C major chord was orchestrated for the [[trumpet]]s and [[trombone]]s playing [[fortissimo]] in their upper registers, it would sound very bright; but if the same chord was orchestrated for the [[cello|celli]] and [[string bass]]es playing [[sul tasto]], doubled by the [[bassoon]]s and [[bass clarinet]], it might sound heavy and dark.

Note that although the above example discussed orchestrating a chord, a melody or even a single note may be orchestrated in this fashion. Also note that in this specific sense of the word, ''orchestration'' is not necessarily limited to an orchestra, as a composer may ''orchestrate'' this same C major chord for, say, a [[woodwind quintet]], a [[string quartet]] or a [[concert band]]. Each different ensemble would enable the orchestrator/composer to create different tone "colours" and timbres.

A [[melody]] is also orchestrated. The composer or orchestrator may think of a melody in her head, or while playing the piano or organ. Once she has thought of a melody, she has to decide which instrument (or instruments) will play the melody. One widely used approach for a melody is to assign it to the first violins. When the first violins play a melody, the composer can have the second violins double the melody an octave below, or have the second violins play a harmony part (often in thirds and sixths). Sometimes, for a forceful effect, a composer will indicate in the score that all of the strings (violins, violas, cellos, and double basses) will play the melody in unison, at the same time. Typically, even though the instruments are playing the same note names, the violins will play very high-register notes, the violas and cellos will play lower-register notes, and the double basses will play the deepest, lowest pitches.

As well, the [[woodwinds]] and [[brass instrument]]s can effectively carry a melody, depending on the effect the composer/orchestrator desires. The [[trumpet]]s can perform a melody in a powerful, high register. Alternatively, if the trombones play a melody, the pitch will be lower than the trumpet, and the tone will be heavier, which may change the musical effect that is created. While the [[cello]]s are often given an [[accompaniment]] role in orchestration, there are notable cases where the cellos have been assigned the melody. In even more rare cases, the double bass section (or principal bass) may be given a melody (e.g., the high-register double bass solo in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Lieutenant Kije Suite]]'').

While assigning a melody to a particular section, such as the string section or the woodwinds will work well, as the stringed instruments and all the woodwinds blend together well, some composers give the melody to one section and then have the melody doubled by a different section or an instrument from a different section. For example, a melody played by the first violins could be doubled by the [[glockenspiel]], which would add a sparkling, chime-like colour to the melody. Alternatively, a melody played by the piccolos could be doubled by the [[celesta]], which would add a bright tone to the sound.

In the 20th and 21st century, [[contemporary composer]]s began to incorporate [[music technology (electric)|electric]] and [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic]] instruments into the orchestra, such as the [[electric guitar]] played through a [[guitar amplifier]], the [[electric bass]] played through a [[bass amplifier]], the [[Theremin]] and the [[synthesizer]]. The addition of these new instruments gave composers new options for creating tonal "colours" in their orchestration. For example, in the late 20th century and onwards, a composer could have a melody played by the first violins doubled by a futuristic-sounding [[synthesizer]] or a [[theremin]] to create an unusual effect.

Orchestral instrumentation is denoted by an abbreviated formulaic convention,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orchestral Music a Handbook|last=Daniels|first=David|publisher=Scarecrow Press Inc.|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: [[flute]], [[oboe]], [[clarinet]], [[bassoon]]- horn, [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], [[tuba]]. More details can be contained in brackets. A dot separates one player from another, a slash indicates doubling. Timpani and percussion are denoted 2Tmp+ number of percussion.

For example, 3[1.2.3/pic] 2[1.Eh] 3[1.2.3/Ebcl/bcl] 3[1.2/cbn.cbn] tmp+2 is interpreted as:

* 3 flautists, the 3rd doubling on piccolo ("doubling" means that the performer can play flute and piccolo)
* 
* 2 oboists, the 2nd playing English horn throughout
* 
* 3 clarinetists, the 3rd doubling also on E-flat clarinet and bass clarinet
* 
* 3 bassoonists, the 2nd doubling on contrabassoon, the 3rd playing only contra
* 
* Timpani+ 2 percussion.

As an example, Mahler Symphony 2 is scored: 4[1/pic.2/pic.3/pic.4/pic] 4[1.2.3/Eh.4/Eh] 5[1.2.3/bcl.4/Ebcl2.Ebcl] 4[1.2.3.4/cbn]- 10 8 4 1- 2tmp+4-2&amp;nbsp;hp- org- str.

==Examples from the repertoire==

===J.S Bach===
During the [[Baroque]] era, composers showed increasing awareness of the expressive potential of orchestration.  While some early Baroque pieces have no indication of which instruments should play the piece, the choice of instruments being left to the musical group's leader or [[concertmaster]], there are Baroque works which specify certain instruments. The orchestral accompaniment to the aria 'et misericordia' from J.S.Bach’s ''[[Magnificat]]'', BWV243 (1723) features muted strings [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] by flutes, a subtle combination of mellow instrumental [[timbres]].[[File:Et misericordia.png|thumb|center|500px|Orchestral introduction to 'et misericordia' from Bach's Magnificat, BWV 243.

The orchestral introduction to the opening chorus of J.S.Bach’s [[epiphany (holiday)|epiphany]] Cantata [[Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen, BWV 65|''Sie werden aus Saba alle kommen'']] BWV65, which [[John Eliot Gardiner]] (2013, p.&amp;nbsp;328) describes as “one of the crowning glories of Bach’s first Christmas season” demonstrates the composer’s mastery of his craft.  Within a space of eight bars, we hear recorders, [[oboe da caccia|oboes da caccia]], horns and strings creating a “glittery sheen” of contrasted timbres, sonorities and textures ranging from just two horns against a string [[pedal point]] in the first bar to a “restatement of the octave unison theme, this time by all the voices and instruments spread over five octaves” in bars 7-8:&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, J.E. (2013, p. 328) ''Music in the Castle of Heaven''.  London, Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.wav|thumb|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65.]][[File:Sie werden aus Saba Alle kommen opening bars.png|thumb|center|600px|Opening orchestral introduction to J.S. Bach's Cantata, BWV65. ]]

Igor Stravinsky (1959, p45) marvelled at Bach’s skill as an orchestrator: “What incomparable instrumental writing is Bach's. You can smell the resin [(rosin)] in his violin parts, [and] taste the reeds in the 
oboes.”&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky I. and Craft, R. ''Conversations with Igor Stravinsky''.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rameau===
Jean Philippe [[Rameau]] was famous for "the eloquence of [his] orchestral writing which was something entirely new... - with a feeling for colour [(i.e., tone colour or timbre)] that is altogether 'modern'."&lt;ref&gt;Pincherle, M. (1967, p.122) ''An Illustrated History of Music''.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In 'The Entrance of Polymnie' from his opera ''[[Les Boréades]]'' (1763), the predominant string texture is shot through with descending scale figures on the bassoon, creating an exquisite blend of timbres:[[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.wav|thumb|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]][[File:Entry of Polymnie from les Boreades.png|thumb|center|500px|'L'Entrée de Polymnie' from ''Les Boréades'' by Rameau.]]

===Mozart===
Another important technique of orchestration was [[call and response (music)|antiphony]], the "call and response" exchange of musical motifs or "ideas" between different groups in the orchestra. In an antiphonal section, the composer may have one group of instruments introduce a melodic idea (e.g., the first violins), and then have the woodwinds "answer" by restating this melodic idea, often with some type of variation. In the trio section of the minuet from Mozart’s [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 41]] (1788), the flute, bassoons and horn exchange phrases with the strings, with the first violin line [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubled]] at the [[octave]] by the first oboe:[[File:Mozart Jupiter Symphony Trio.wav|thumb|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41.]] [[File:Mozart Jupiter Trio.png|thumb|center|500px|Trio section of the Minuet from Mozart's Symphony No. 41. ]] Charles Rosen (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;240) admires Mozart’s skill in orchestrating his piano concertos, particularly the [[Piano Concerto No. 22 (Mozart)|Concerto in E flat major, K482]], a work that introduced clarinets into the mix.  “This concerto places the greatest musical reliance on tone colour, which is, indeed, almost always ravishing.  One lovely example of its sonorities comes near the beginning.” &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mozart Piano Concerto 22 first movement opening.wav|thumb|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars  1-12]][[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 1-6]] 
 
The orchestral [[tutti]] in the first two bars is answered by just horns and bassoon in bars 2-6.  This passage repeats with fresh orchestration: [[File:Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12.png|thumb|center|500px|Mozart Piano Concerto K482 first movement bars 7-12. ]]“Here we have the unusual sound on the violins providing the bass for the solo clarinets.  The simplicity of the sequence concentrates all our interest on tone-colour, and what follows – a series of woodwind solos – keeps it there.  The orchestration throughout, in fact, has a greater variety than Mozart had wished or needed before, and fits the brilliance, charm, and grace of the first movement and the finale.” &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (1971, p240) The Classical Style.  London Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beethoven===
A demonstration of Beethoven’s consummate skill at obtaining the maximum variety out of seemingly unprepossessing and fairly simple material can be found in the first movement of the [[Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 5|Piano Concerto No. 5]] in E flat (‘The Emperor’) Opus 73 (1810). The [[sonata form|second subject of the sonata form]] is a deceptively simple tune that, according to Fiske (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;41) “is limited to notes playable on the horns for which it music have been specially designed.”&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme appears in five different orchestrations throughout the movement, with changes of [[Mode (music)|mode]] (major to minor), [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] ([[forte (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]]) and a blending of instrumental [[Timbre|colour]] that ranges from boldly stated [[tutti]] passages to the most subtle and differentiated episodes, where instrumental sounds are combined often in quite unexpected ways:[[File:Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor).wav|thumb|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]][[File:Subsidiary theme from the first movement of beethoven's Piano Conxcert No. 5 (Emperor).png|thumb|center|600px|Second subject theme from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 (Emperor)]]

The theme first appears in the minor mode during the orchestral introduction, performed using [[staccato]] articulation and orchestrated in the most delicate and enchanting colours:[[File:Minor version of the theme.wav|thumb|Minor version of the theme]][[File:Minor version 1.png|thumb|center|500px|Minor version of the theme. ]]This is followed by a more straightforward version in the major key, with horns accompanied by strings.  The theme is now played [[legato]] by the horns, accompanied by a sustained [[pedal point]] in the bassoons.  The violins simultaneously play an elaborated version of the theme.  (See also [[heterophony]].)  The timpani and [[pizzicato]] lower strings add further colour to this variegated palette of sounds. “Considering that the notes are virtually the same the difference in effect is extraordinary”:&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.41), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody.wav|thumb|Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody]][[File:Major version of the theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Major version of the theme, with horns playing the melody. ]]When the solo piano enters, its right hand plays a variant of the minor version of the theme in a [[Tuplet|triplet]] rhythm, with the backing of pizzicato (plucked) strings on the off-beats:[[File:Minor version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets.wav|thumb|Minor version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets]][[File:Minor version 2 - piano.png|thumb|center|500px|Minor key version of the theme, with piano right hand elaborating the melody in triplets. ]]This is followed by a bold [[Tutti|''tutti'']] statement of the theme, "with the whole orchestra thumping it out in aggressive semi-[[staccato]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.42), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Tutti statement of the theme.wav|thumb|Tutti statement of the theme]]:[[File:Tutti version in major.png|thumb|center|500px|Tutti statement of the theme. ]]The minor version of the theme also appears in the [[cadenza]], played staccato by the solo piano:[[File:Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza.wav|thumb|Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza]][[File:Cadenza.png|thumb|center|500px|Solo piano statement of theme in the cadenza. ]]This is followed, finally, by a restatement of the major key version, featuring horns playing legato , accompanied by pizzicato strings and [[filigree]] arpeggio figuration in the solo piano:[[File:Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza.wav|thumb|Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza]][[File:Major version in cadenza.png|thumb|center|500px|Final statement of the theme in a major key by the horns after the end of the cadenza. ]] Fiske (1970) says that Beethoven shows “a superb flood of invention” through these varied treatments.  “The variety of moods this theme can convey is without limit” .”&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, R. (1970, p.42), ''Beethoven Concertos and Overtures''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlioz===

The most significant orchestral innovator of the early 19th century was Hector [[Berlioz]].  (The composer was also the author of a ''[[Treatise on Instrumentation]]''.) “He was drawn to the orchestra as his chosen medium by instinct … and by finding out the exact capabilities and [[timbres]] of individual instruments, and it was on this raw material that his imagination worked to produce countless new sonorities, very striking when considered as a totality, crucially instructive for later composers, and nearly all exactly tailored to their dramatic or expressive purpose.” &lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p5) ''Berlioz Orchestral Music''.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous examples of Berlioz’s orchestral wizardry and his penchant for conjuring extraordinary sonorities can be found in his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''.  The opening of the fourth movement, entitled “March to the Scaffold” features what for the time (1830) must have seemed a bizarre mix of sounds.  The timpani and the double basses play thick chords against the snarling muted brass: [[File:March to the Scaffold bars 1-4.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, March to the Scaffold from the Symphonie [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXHrHQ5ZEHo Fantastique. Listen]]]

“Although he derives from Beethoven, Berlioz uses features that run counter to the rules of composition in general, such as the chords in close position in the low register of the double basses.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.44) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlioz was also capable of conveying great delicacy in his instrumental writing.  A particularly spectacular instance is the “[[Queen Mab]]” [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsf7Jmj7HM scherzo] from the ''[[Romeo et Juliette]]'' symphony, which [[Hugh Macdonald]] (1969, p51) describes as “Berlioz’s supreme exercise in light orchestral texture, a brilliant, gossamer fabric, [[prestissimo]] and [[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]] almost without pause: [[File:Queen Mab main theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, Queen Mab scherzo from Romeo et Juliette]]

Boulez points out that the very fast tempo must have made unprecedented demands on conductors and orchestras of the time (1830), “Because of the rapid and precise rhythms, the staccatos which must be even and regular in all registers, because of the isolated notes that occur right at the end of the bar on the third quaver…all of which must fall into place with absolutely perfect precision.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (203, p.37) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt;
Macdonald highlights the passage towards the end of the scherzo where “The sounds become more ethereal and fairylike, low clarinet, high harps and the bell-like antique cymbals…The pace and fascination of the movement are irresistible; it is some of the most ethereally brilliant music ever penned.” &lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, H. (1969, p51) Berlioz orchestral Music.  London, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Queen mab scherzo p218.png|thumb|center|500px|Berlioz, orchestral texture from  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICsf7Jmj7HM&amp;t=6m0s Queen Mab Scherzo. Listen]]] The [[New Grove Dictionary]] says that for Berlioz, orchestration “was intrinsic to composition, not something applied to finished music...in his hands [[timbre]] became something that could be used in free combinations, as an artist might use his palette, without bowing to the demands of line, and this leads to the rich orchestral resource of Debussy and Ravel.”&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, H., (2001) “Berlioz”, article in Sadie, S. (ed.) ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition.  London, MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagner===

After Berlioz, [[Richard Wagner]] was the major pioneer in the development of orchestration during the 19th century.  [[Pierre Boulez]] speaks of the “sheer richness of Wagner’s orchestration and his irrepressible instinct for innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Latham says that Wagner had a “unique appreciation of the possibilities for colour inherent in the instruments at his disposal, and it was this that guided him both in his selection of new recruits for the orchestral family and in his treatment of its established members. The well-known division of that family into strings, woodwind, and brass, with percussion as required, he inherited from the great classical symphonists such changes as he made were in the direction of splitting up these groups still further.” Latham gives as an example, the sonority of the opening of the opera ''[[Lohengrin]]'', where “the ethereal quality of the music” is due to the violins being “divided up into four, five, or even eight parts instead of the customary two.”&lt;ref&gt;Latham, P. (1926) “Wagner: Aesthetics and Orchestration.” Gramophone, June 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Prelude to Lohengrin condensed score.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Prelude to Lohengrin [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqk4bcnBqls Listen]]]

As he matured as a composer, particularly through his experience of composing [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|''The Ring'']] Wagner made “increasing use of the contrast between pure and mixed [[Timbre|colours]], bringing to a fine point the art of transition from one field of sonority to another.” &lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (1986, p273) Orientations.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first act of his final opera ''[[Parsifal]]'', Wagner offsets the bold brass with gentler strings, showing that the same musical material feels very different when passed between contrasting families of instruments:[[File:Parsifal contrasting groups.png|thumb|center|500px|Contrasting orchestral groups from the first Act of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04Q-dl2RYyA&amp;t=0m54s Parsifal]]]

On the other hand, the prelude to the opera ''[[Tristan and Isolde]]'' exemplifies the variety that Wagner could extract through combining instruments from different [[Orchestra|orchestral families]] with his precise markings of [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[Articulation (music)|articulation]].  In the opening phrase, the cellos are supported by wind instruments: [[File:Tristan prelude bars 1-7.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan prelude, opening. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA&amp;list=RDJ-qoaioG2UA Listen]]]

When this idea returns towards the end of the prelude, the [[Timbre|instrumental colors]] are varied subtly, with sounds that were new to the 19th century orchestra, such as the [[cor anglais]] and the [[bass clarinet]].  These, together with the ominous rumbling of the timpani effectively convey the brooding atmosphere: [[File:Wagner, Tristan prelude closing bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Tristan Prelude, closing bars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-qoaioG2UA&amp;list=RDJ-qoaioG2UA&amp;t=9m45s Link to passage]]]

“It’s impressive to see how Wagner… produces balance in his works.  He is true genius in this respect, undeniably so, even down to the working out of the exact number of instruments.”  Boulez is “fascinated by the precision with which Wagner gauges orchestral balance, [which] … contains a multiplicity of details that he achieved with astonishing precision.”&lt;ref&gt;Boulez, P. (2003, p.52) Boulez on Conducting.  London, Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger Scruton]], "Seldom since Bach's inspired use of [[obbligato]] parts in his cantatas have the instruments of the orchestra been so meticulously and lovingly adapted to their expressive role by Wagner in his later operas." &lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. (2016, p147) ''The Ring of Truth: The Wisdom of Wagner's'' Ring of the Nibelung.  Penguin Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahler===
William Austin (1966) says “[[Mahler]] expanded the orchestra, going ahead to a historic climax in the direction already marked by [[Beethoven]], [[Berlioz]] and [[Wagner]]… The purpose of this famous expansion was not a sheer increase in volume, but a greater variety of sound with more nearly continuous gradations… Mahler only occasionally required all his vast orchestra to play together, and his music was as often soft as loud.  Its colours were continually shifting, blending or contrasting with each other.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adorno]] (1971) similarly describes Mahler’s symphonic writing as characterised by “massive tutti effects” contrasted with “chamber-music procedures”.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, T.W. (1971, p.53) ''Mahler, a musical physiognomy''.  Trans. Jephcott.  University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The following passage from the first movement of his Symphony No. 4 illustrates this:[[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.wav|thumb|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Fig 5]][[File:Mahler 4 1st movt Fig 5.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler, Symphony No. 4, first movement, Figure 5. ]] Only in the first bar of the above is there a full ensemble.  The remaining bars feature highly differentiated small groups of instruments.  Mahler’s experienced conductor’s ear led him to write detailed performance markings in his scores, including carefully calibrated dynamics.  For example, in bar 2 above, the low harp note is marked [[Dynamics (music)|''forte'']], the clarinets, [[Dynamics (music)|''mezzo-forte'']] and the horns [[Dynamics (music)|''piano'']].  Austin (1966) says that “Mahler cared about the finest nuances of loudness and tempo and worked tirelessly to fix these details in his scores.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p. 123) ''Music in the 20th Century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahler’s imagination for sonority is exemplified in the closing bars of the slow movement of the Fourth Symphony, where there occurs what [[Walter Piston]] (1969, p.&amp;nbsp;140) describes as “an instance of inspired orchestration… To be noted are the sudden change of mode in the harmonic progression, the unusual spacing of the chord in measure 5, and the placing of the perfect fourth in the two flutes. The effect is quite unexpected and magical.”&lt;ref&gt;Piston, W. (1969) ''Orchestration''.  London, Victor Gollancz.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Mahler 4 3rd movement Fig 13.wav|thumb|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]][[File:Mahler 4 third movement.png|thumb|center|500px|Mahler Symphony No 4, third movement, Figure 13.]]

===Debussy===

Apart from Mahler and [[Richard Strauss]], the major innovator in orchestration during the closing years of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth century was Claude [[Debussy]].  According to Pierre [[Boulez]] (1975, p20) “Debussy’s orchestration… when compared with even such brilliant contemporaries as Strauss and Mahler… shows an infinitely fresher imagination.”  Boulez said that Debussy’s orchestration was “conceived from quite a different point of view; the number of instruments, their balance, the order in which they are used, their use itself, produces a different climate.”  Apart from the early impact of [[Wagner]], Debussy was also fascinated by music from Asia that according to Austin “he heard repeatedly and admired intensely at the Paris World exhibition of 1889”.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p20) ''Music in the 20th century''. London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both influences inform Debussy’s first major orchestral work, ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune|Prelude a l’après-midi d’un faune]]'' (1894).  Wagner’s influence can be heard in the strategic use of [[silence]], the sensitively differentiated orchestration and, above all in the striking [[half-diminished seventh]] chord spread between oboes and clarinets, reinforced by a [[glissando]] on the harp. Austin (1966, p.&amp;nbsp;16) continues “Only a composer thoroughly familiar with the [[Tristan chord]] could have conceived the beginning of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYyK922PsUw ''Faune''].”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.16) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi opening.png|thumb|center|600px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, opening bars]]

Later in the ''Faune'', Debussy builds a complex texture, where, as Austin says, “[[Polyphony]] and orchestration overlap...He adds to all the devices of [[Mozart]], [[Weber]], [[Berlioz]] and Wagner the possibilities that he learned from the [[heterophonic]] music of the Far East.... The first harp varies the flute parts in almost the same way that the smallest bells of a [[Java]]nese [[gamelan]] vary the slower basic melody.”&lt;ref&gt;Austin, W. (1966, p.20) ''Music in the 20th century''.  London, Dent.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Prelude a l'apres midi, from Fig 7- short score version.png|thumb|center|700px|Debussy, Prelude a l'apres midi d'un faune, Figure 7, bars 11-13]]

Debussy’s final orchestral work, the enigmatic ballet ''[[Jeux]]'' (1913) was composed nearly 20 years after the ''Faune''.  The opening bars feature divided strings, spread over a wide range, a harp doubling horns with the addition of the bell-like [[celesta]] in the 5th bar and the sultry voicing of the [[whole tone scale|whole tone]] chords in the woodwind:[[File:Jeux opening bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8qP_2i3HYA Jeux opening bars]]]

Jensen (2014, p.&amp;nbsp;228) says “Perhaps the greatest marvel of ''Jeux'' is its orchestration.  While working on the piano score, Debussy wrote: ‘I am thinking of that orchestral colour which seems to be illuminated from behind, and for which there are such marvellous displays in ''[[Parsifal]]''’  The idea, then, was to produce timbre without glare, subdued… but to do so with clarity and precision.” &lt;ref&gt;Jensen, E.F. (2014) ''Debussy''.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As adaptation==
In a more general sense, ''orchestration'' also refers to the re-adaptation of existing music into another medium, particularly a full or reduced orchestra. There are two general kinds of adaptation: [[Transcription (music)|transcription]], which closely follows the original piece,  and [[arrangement]], which tends to change significant aspects of the original piece. In terms of adaptation, ''orchestration'' applies, strictly speaking, only to writing for orchestra, whereas the term ''[[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]]'' applies to instruments used in the texture of the piece. In the study of orchestration&amp;nbsp;– in contradistinction to the practice&amp;nbsp;– the term ''instrumentation'' may also refer to consideration of the defining characteristics of individual instruments rather than to the art of combining instruments.

In commercial music, especially musical theatre and film music, independent orchestrators are often used because it is difficult to meet tight deadlines when the same person is required both to compose and to orchestrate. Frequently, when a stage musical is adapted to film, such as ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' or ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', the orchestrations for the film version are notably different from the stage ones. In other cases, such as ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'', they are not, and are simply expanded versions from those used in the stage production.

Most orchestrators often work from a draft (sketch), or [[Sheet music#Types|short score]], that is, a score written on limited number of independent [[musical staff|musical staves]]. Some orchestrators, particularly those writing for the [[opera]] or [[music theatre]]s, prefer to work from a piano [[vocal score]] up, since the singers need to start rehearsing a piece long before the whole work is fully completed. That was, for instance, the method of composition of [[Jules Massenet]]. In other instances, simple cooperation between various creators is utilized, as when [[Jonathan Tunick]] orchestrates [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s songs, or when orchestration is done from a [[lead sheet]] (a simplified music notation for a song which includes just the melody and the [[chord progression]]). In the latter case, arranging as well as orchestration will be involved.

==Film orchestration==
Due to the enormous time constraints of film scoring schedules, most film composers employ orchestrators rather than doing the work themselves, although these orchestrators work under the close supervision of the composer. Some [[Film score|film composers]] have made the time to orchestrate their own music, including [[Bernard Herrmann]] (1911-1975), [[Georges Delerue]] (1925-1992), [[Ennio Morricone]] (1928-), [[John Williams]] (1932-) (his very detailed sketches are 99% orchestrated), [[Howard Shore]] (1946-), [[James Horner]] (1953-2015) (on Braveheart), [[Bruno Coulais]] (1954-), [[Rachel Portman]] (1960-), [[Philippe Rombi]] (1968-) and [[Abel Korzeniowski]] (1972-).

Although there have been hundreds of orchestrators in film over the years, the most prominent film orchestrators for the latter half of the 20th century were [[Jack Hayes (composer)|Jack Hayes]], [[Herbert W. Spencer]], [[Edward B. Powell (orchestrator)|Edward Powell]] (who worked almost exclusively with [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]), [[Arthur Morton (composer)|Arthur Morton]], Greig McRitchie, and [[Alexander Courage]].  Some of the most in-demand orchestrators today (and of the past 30 years) include [[Jeff Atmajian]], [[Pete Anthony]], [[Brad Dechter]] (James Newton Howard, Christopher Young, Theodore Shapiro, Teddy Castellucci, Danny Elfman, John Powell, Marco Beltrami, John Debney, Marc Shaiman, Michael Giacchino), [[Conrad Pope]] (John Williams, Alexandre Desplat, Jerry Goldsmith, James Newton Howard, Alan Silvestri, James Horner, Mark Isham, John Powell, Michael Convertino, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore), [[Eddie Karam]] (John Williams, James Horner), [[Bruce Fowler]] (Hans Zimmer, Klaus Badelt, Harry Gregson-Williams, Steve Jablonsky, Mark Mothersbaugh, John Powell), [[John Ashton Thomas]] (John Powell, John Debney, Alan Silvestri, James Newton Howard, Henry Jackman, Lyle Workman, Theodore Shapiro, John Ottman, John Paesano), [[Robert Elhai]] (Elliot Goldenthal, Michael Kamen, Ed Shearmur, Brian Tyler, Klaus Badelt, Ilan Eshkeri ) and [[J.A.C. Redford]] (James Horner, Thomas Newman). 

[[Conrad Salinger]] was the most prominent orchestrator of MGM musicals from the 1940s to 1962, orchestrating such famous films as ''[[Singin' in the Rain (film)|Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[An American in Paris (film)|An American in Paris]]'', and ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''. In the 1950s, film composer [[John Williams]] frequently spent time with Salinger informally learning the craft of orchestration. [[Robert Russell Bennett]] (George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hammerstein) was one of America's most prolific orchestrators (particularly of Broadway shows) of the 20th century, sometimes scoring over 80 pages a day.

===Process===
Most films require 30 to 120 minutes of musical score. Each individual piece of music in a film is called a "cue". There are roughly 20-80 cues per film. A dramatic film may require slow and sparse music while an action film may require 80 cues of highly active music. Each cue can range in length from five seconds to more than ten minutes as needed per scene in the film. After the composer is finished composing the cue, this sketch score is delivered to the orchestrator either as hand written or computer generated. Most composers in Hollywood today compose their music using sequencing software (e.g. [[Digital Performer]], [[Logic Pro]], or [[Cubase]]). A sketch score can be generated through the use of a [[MIDI]] file which is then imported into a [[scorewriter|music notation program]] such as [[Finale (software)|Finale]] or [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]]. Thus begins the job of the orchestrator.

Every composer works differently and the orchestrator's job is to understand what is required from one composer to the next. If the music is created with sequencing software then the orchestrator is given a MIDI sketch score and a synthesized recording of the cue. The sketch score only contains the musical notes (e.g. eighth notes, quarter notes, etc.) with no phrasing, articulations, or dynamics. The orchestrator studies this synthesized "mockup" recording listening to dynamics and phrasing (just as the composer has played them in).  He or she then accurately tries to represent these elements in the orchestra. However some voicings on a synthesizer ([[synthestration]]) will not work in the same way when orchestrated for the live orchestra.

The sound samples are often doubled up very prominently and thickly with other sounds in order to get the music to "speak" louder. The orchestrator sometimes changes these synth voicings to traditional orchestral voicings in order to make the music flow better. He or she may move intervals up or down the octave (or omit them entirely), double certain passages with other instruments in the orchestra, add percussion instruments to provide colour, and add Italian performance marks (e.g. Allegro con brio, Adagio, ritardando, dolce, staccato, etc.). If a composer writes a large action cue, and no woodwinds are used, the orchestrator will often add woodwinds by doubling the brass music up an octave. The orchestra size is determined from the music budget of the film.

The orchestrator is told in advance the number of instruments he or she has to work with and has to abide by what is available. A big-budget film may be able to afford a [[Romantic music era]]-orchestra with over 100 musicians. In contrast, a low-budget [[independent film]] may only be able to afford a 20 performer [[chamber orchestra]] or a [[jazz quartet]]. Sometimes a composer will write a three-part chord for three flutes, although only two flutes have been hired. The orchestrator decides where to put the third note. For example, the orchestrator could have the clarinet (a woodwind that blends well with flute) play the third note. After the orchestrated cue is complete it is delivered to the copying house (generally by placing it on a computer server) so that each instrument of the orchestra can be electronically extracted, printed, and delivered to the scoring stage.

The major film composers in Hollywood each have a lead orchestrator. Generally the lead orchestrator attempts to orchestrate as much of the music as possible if time allows. If the schedule is too demanding, a team of orchestrators (ranging from two to eight) will work on a film. The lead orchestrator decides on the assignment of cues to other orchestrators on the team. Most films can be orchestrated in one to two weeks with a team of five orchestrators. New orchestrators trying to obtain work will often approach a film composer asking to be hired. They are generally referred to the lead orchestrator for consideration. At the scoring stage the orchestrator will often assist the composer in the recording booth giving suggestions on how to improve the performance, the music, or the recording. If the composer is conducting, sometimes the orchestrator will remain in the recording booth to assist as a producer. Sometimes the roles are reversed with the orchestrator [[conducting]] and the composer producing from the booth.

'''''Persian Letters''''' ({{lang-fr|Lettres persanes}}) is a literary work, written in 1721, by [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu]], recounting the experiences of two [[Persia]]n noblemen, Usbek and Rica, who are traveling through [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1051588x/f5.image.r=| title =  Lettres persanes | access-date= 13 June 2016 | year = 1721| publisher = P.

Brunel | place=Amsterdam| volume = II |via= Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
In 1711 Usbek leaves his [[seraglio]] in [[Isfahan]] to take the long journey to France, accompanied by his young friend Rica. He leaves behind five wives (Zashi, Zéphis, Fatmé, Zélis, and Roxane) in the care of a number of black [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]], one of whom is the head or first eunuch. During the trip and their long stay in [[Paris]] (1712–1720), they comment, in letters exchanged with friends and [[mullah]]s, on numerous aspects of Western, Christian society, particularly French politics and [[Moors]], ending with a biting satire of the System of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]. Over time, various disorders surface back in the seraglio, and, beginning in 1717 (Letter 139 [147]), the situation there rapidly unravels. Usbek orders his head eunuch to crack down, but his message does not arrive in time, and a revolt brings about the death of his wives, including the vengeful suicide of his favorite, Roxane, and, it appears, most of the eunuchs.

The Chronology breaks down as follows:

*Letters 1–21 [1–23]: The journey from Isfahan to France, which lasts almost 14 months (from 19 March 1711 to 4 May 1712).
*Letters 22 [24]–89 [92]: Paris in the reign of [[Louis XIV]], 3 years in all (from May 1712 to September 1715).
*Letters 90 [93]–137 [143] or [supplementary Letter 8 =145]: the Regency of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d’Orléans]], covering five years (from September 1715 to November 1720).
*Letters 138 [146]– 150 [161]: the collapse of the seraglio in Isfahan, approximately 3 years (1717–1720).

The first edition of the novel, which consists of 150 letters, appeared in May 1721 under the rubric Cologne: [[Pierre Marteau]], a front for the Amsterdam publisher Jacques Desbordes whose business is now run by his widow, Susanne de Caux.{{clarify|date=November 2014}} Called edition A, this is the text utilized in the recent critical edition of ''Lettres persanes'' for the complete works of Montesquieu published by the Voltaire Foundation in 2004. A second edition (B) by the same publisher later in the same year, for which there is so far no entirely satisfactory explanation, curiously included three new letters but omitted thirteen of the original ones. All subsequent editions in the author’s lifetime (i.e., until 1755) derive from A or B. A new edition in 1758, prepared by Montesquieu’s son, included eight new letters – bringing the total to 161 – and a short piece by the author entitled "Quelques réflexions sur les ''Lettres persanes''." This latter edition has been used for all subsequent editions until the ''Œuvres complètes'' of 2004, which reverts to the original edition but includes the added letters marked as "supplementary" and, in parentheses, the numbering scheme of 1758.

==An epistolary novel==
[[File:Persianische Briefe.jpg|thumb|An early illustration depicting Usbek and Rica]]
Montesquieu never referred to ''Lettres persanes'' (Persian Letters) as a [[novel]] until "Quelques remarques sur les ''Lettres persanes''," which begins: "Nothing about the ''Lettres persanes'' was more ingratiating than to find in it unexpectedly a sort of novel. There is a visible beginning, development, and ending […]." Initially, for most of its first readers as well as for its author, it was not considered primarily a novel, and even less an "[[epistolary novel]]" (as it is often classified now), which was not at that time a constituted genre. Indeed, it has little in common with the sole model at the time, Guilleragues’s ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun|Lettres portugaises]]'' of 1669. A collection of "letters" in 1721 would more likely evoke the recent tradition of essentially polemical and political periodicals, such as ''Lettres historiques'' (1692–1728), the Jesuits’ famous ''Lettres édifiantes et curieuses'' (1703–1776), not to mention [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer|Mme Dunoyer’s]] ''Lettres historiques et galantes'' (1707–1717) which, in the form of a correspondence between two women, provide a chronicle of the end of the reign of Louis XIV and the beginning of the Regency. The ''Lettres persanes'' thus helped confirm the vogue of a format that was already established. But it is in its numerous imitations – such as ''Lettres juives'' (1738) and ''Lettres chinoises'' (1739) of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d’Argens]], ''Lettres d’une Turque à Paris, écrites à sa sœur'' (1730) by Poullain de Saint-Foix (published several times in conjunction with ''Lettres persanes''), and perhaps especially [[Françoise d'Issembourg d'Happoncourt, Madame de Graffigny|Françoise de Graffigny]]’s ''Lettres d’une Péruvienne'' (1747) – not to mention the letter-novels of [[Samuel Richardson|Richardson]] – which, between 1721 and 1754, had in effect transformed ''Lettres persanes'' into an "epistolary novel." Whence this remark in Montesquieu’s ''Mes Pensées'': "My ''Lettres persanes'' taught people to write letter-novels" (no. 1621).

The [[Epistolary novel|epistolary structure]] is quite flexible: nineteen correspondents in all, with at least twenty-two different recipients. Usbek and Rica by far dominate with sixty-six letters for the former and forty-seven for the latter (of the final 161). Ibben, who functions more as addressee than correspondent, writes only two letters but receives forty-two. Likewise, an unnamed person (designated only as ***) – if always the same – receives eighteen letters and writes none at all. There is even one complete anomaly, a letter from Hagi Ibbi to Ben Josué (Letter 37 [39]), neither of whom is mentioned elsewhere in the novel.

The letters are apparently all dated in accordance with a [[lunar calendar]] which, as [[Robert Shackleton]] showed in 1954, in fact corresponds to our own, by simple substitution of Muslim names, as follows: Zilcadé (January), Zilhagé (February), Maharram (March), Saphar (April), Rebiab I (May), Rebiab II (June), Gemmadi I (July), Gemmadi II (August), Rhegeb (September), Chahban (October), Rhamazan (November), Chalval (December).

==Social commentary==

In Paris, the Persians express themselves on a wide variety of subjects, from governmental institutions to salon caricatures. The difference of temperament of the two friends is notable, Usbek being more experienced and asking many questions, Rica less implicated and more free, and more attracted by Parisian life. Both retain Montesquieu's rich satirical tone, as in Rica's ''Lettre 72'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Je me trouvai l’autre jour dans une compagnie où je vis un homme bien content de lui. Dans un quart d’heure, il décida trois questions de morale, quatre problèmes historiques, et cinq points de physique : Je n’ai jamais vu un décisionnaire si universel ; son esprit ne fut jamais suspendu par le moindre doute. On laissa les sciences ; on parla des nouvelles du temps : il décida sur les nouvelles du temps. Je voulus l’attraper, et je dis en moi-même : Il faut que je me mette dans mon fort ; je vais me réfugier dans mon pays. Je lui parlai de la Perse ; mais, à peine lui eus-je dit quatre mots, qu’il me donna deux démentis, fondés sur l’autorité de messieurs Tavernier et Chardin. Ah ! bon Dieu ! dis-je en moi-même, quel homme est-ce là ? Il connoîtra tout à l’heure les rues d’Ispahan mieux que moi ! Mon parti fut bientôt pris : je me tus, je le laissai parler, et il décide encore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Lettres_persanes/Lettre_72 Lettre 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I found myself recently in a company where I met am man very well satisfied with himself. In a quarter of an hour, he decided three questions in morals, four historical problems, and five points in physics. I have never seen so universal a decider; his mind was not once troubled with the least doubt. We left science, and talked of the current news: he decided upon the current news. I wished to catch him, so I said to myself, “I must get to my strong point; I will betake me to my own country.” I spoke to him of Persia; but hardly had I opened my mouth, when he contradicted me twice, basing his objections upon the authority of Tavernier and Chardin. “Ah! Good heavens!” said I to myself, “what kind of man is this? He will know next all the streets in Ispahan better than I do!” I soon knew what part to play-to be silent, and let him talk; and he is still laying down the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Persian_Letters/Letter_72 Letter 72], trans. [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this takes place in the declining years of the aged king, much of what he has accomplished is still admired in a Paris where the Invalides is being completed and cafés and theatre proliferate. We observe the function of parliaments, tribunals, religious bodies ([[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Jesuits]], etc.), public places and their publics (the [[Tuileries]], the [[Palais Royal]]), state foundations (the hospital of the Quinze-Vingts [300] for the blind, the [[Les Invalides|Invalides]] for those wounded in war). They describe a thriving culture, where even the presence of two Persians quickly becomes a popular phenomenon, thanks to the proliferation of prints (letter 28 [30]). The café&amp;nbsp;– where debates take place (letter 34 [36])&amp;nbsp;– has become established as a public institution, as were already the theatre and opera. There are still people foolish enough to search at their own expense for the [[philosopher's stone]]; the newsmonger and the periodical press are beginning to play a role in everyday life. Everything from institutions (the [[University of Paris|university]], the [[Académie française|Academy]], Sciences, the Bull ''[[Unigenitus]]'') via groups (fashion, dandies, coquettes) to individuals (the opera singer, the old warrior, the rake, and so forth) comes to the eye of the reader.

Usbek for his part is troubled by religious contrasts. Though it never occurs to him to cease being a [[Muslim]], and while he still wonders at some aspects of Christianity (the [[Trinity]], [[Communion rite|communion]]), he writes to austere authorities to inquire, for example, why some foods are considered to be unclean (letters 15–17 [16–18]). He also assimilates the two religions and even all religions with respect to their social utility.

Certain sequences of letters by a single author develop more fully a particular subject, such as letters 11–14 from Usbek to Mirza on the Troglodytes, letters 109–118 (113–122) from Usbek to Rhedi on [[demography]], letters 128–132 (134–138) from Rica on his visit to the library at Saint-Victor. They sketch analyses that will later be developed in [[The Spirit of the Laws|''L’Esprit des lois'']] for many subjects such as the types of powers, the influence of climate and the critique of colonization.

==The dénouement==

While Usbek appreciates the freer relations among men and women in the West, he remains, as master of a seraglio, a prisoner of his past. His wives play the role of languorous and lonely lovers, he the role of master and lover, with no true communication and without revealing much about their true selves. Usbek’s language with them is as constrained as theirs with him. Knowing, moreover, from the outset that he is not assured of a return to Persia, Usbek is also already disabused about their attitude (letters 6 and 19 [20]). The seraglio is a hothouse from which he increasingly distances himself, trusting his wives no more than his eunuchs (Letter 6).

Everything cascades in the final letters (139–150 [147–161]), thanks to a sudden analepse of more than three years with respect to the preceding letters. From letter 69 (71) to letter 139 (147) – chronologically from 1714 to 1720 – not a single letter from Usbek relates to the seraglio, which is unmentioned in any guise from letter 94 to 143 (and even in the edition of 1758 from supplementary letter 8 (97) to 145. Moreover, all the letters from 126 (132) to 137 (148) are from Rica, which means that for about fifteen months (from 4 August 1719 to 22 October 1720) Usbek is completely silent. Although he has in the meantime received letters, the reader does not learn of them until the final series, which is more developed after the addition of supplementary letters 9–11 (157, 158, 160) of 1758. Although Usbek has learned as early as October 1714 that "the seraglio is in disorder" (letter 63 [65]). As the spirit of rebellion advances, he decides to act, but too late; with delays in the transmission of letters and the loss of some, the situation is beyond remedy.

A dejected Usbek is apparently resigned to the necessity of returning, with little hope, to Persia; on 4 October 1719 he laments: "I shall deliver my head to my enemies" (147 [155]). He nevertheless does not do so: late in 1720 he is still in Paris, for letters 134–137 (140–145), which contain the whole history of Law’s "System," are in fact posterior to Roxane’s last missive (dated 8 May 1720), which he must already have received – the usual time for delivery being about five months – when he writes the latest in date of his own (supplementary letter 8 and letter 138 [145 and 146]), in October and November 1720.

==Sources==

Montesquieu’s "sources" are legion, since they doubtless extend to readings and conversations which are modified en route. The impact of [[Jean Chardin]]’s ''Voyages en Perse'', to which he owes most of his information about Persia – which is far from superficial – must of course be recognized; he owned the two-volume edition of 1687 and purchased the extended edition in ten volumes in 1720. To a lesser degree, he drew on the ''Voyages'' of [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] and [[Paul Rycaut]], not to mention many other works which his vast library afforded him. Everything having to do with contemporary France or Paris, on the other hand, comes from his own experience, and from conversations of anecdotes related to him.

Various aspects of the book are doubtless indebted to particular models, of which the most important is Giovanni Paolo Marana’s ''L’Espion dans les cours des princes chrétiens'' (''[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]''), widely known at the time, even though Montesquieu’s characters obviously are Persians and not Turks. While the great popularity of [[Antoine Galland]]’s ''Mille et Une Nuits'' (''[[The Arabian Nights]]'') contributes, as do the Bible and the Qu’ran, to the general ambiance of oriental subjects, in fact it has almost nothing in common with the ''Lettres persanes''.

==Critical history==

The ''Lettres persanes'' was an immediate success and often imitated, but it has been diversely interpreted over time. Until the middle of the twentieth century, it was its "spirit" of the Regency which was largely admired, as well as the caricature in the classical tradition of [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]. No one had the notion of attaching it to the novelistic genre. The Persian side of the novel tended to be considered as a fanciful decor, the true interest of the work lying in its factitious "oriental" impressions of French society, along with political and religious satire and critique.

In the 1950s began a new era of studies based on better texts and renewed perspectives. Particularly important were the extensively annotated edition by Paul Vernière and the research of [[Robert Shackleton]] on Muslim chronology; also studies by Roger Laufer, Pauline Kra and Roger Mercier, which put new focus on the work’s unity and integrated the seraglio into its overall meaning. Others who have followed have looked into the ramifications of epistolary form, the structure and meaning of the seraglio, Usbek’s contradictions. Beginning about 1970 it is religion (Kra) and especially politics (Ehrard, Goulemot, Benrekassa) which predominate in studies on ''Lettres persanes'', with a progressive return to the role of the seraglio with all its women and eunuchs (Delon, Grosrichard, Singerman, Spector) or the cultural cleavage of Orient and Occident.

The American philosopher [[Marshall Berman]] devotes several chapters in his book ''The Politics of Authenticity'' (1970) to the radical humanism of the Persian Letters.

===The Jewish Letters===
{{main article|Jewish Letters}}
The Jewish Letters of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d'Argens]] were published in 1738, composed in a total of 180 letters that originally spanned 30 volumes. Although they are certainly an imitation of the Persian Letters, they are not considered plagiarism due to the distinction of content between the two works. Although he titled himself as the work's "translator", he is most ascribed as the work's author.

'''Rectal foreign bodies''' are large [[Foreign body|foreign items]] found in the [[rectum]] that can be assumed to have been inserted through the anus, rather than reaching the rectum via the mouth and gastrointestinal tract. It can be of clinical relevance if the patient cannot remove it the way they intended. Smaller, ingested foreign bodies, such as bones eaten with food, can sometimes be found stuck in the rectum upon x-ray and are rarely of clinical relevance.

Rectal foreign bodies are a subgroup of [[Foreign body in alimentary tract|foreign bodies in the alimentary tract]].&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Ayantunde, T. Oke: ''A review of gastrointestinal foreign bodies.'' In: ''Int J Clin Pract'' 60, 2006, S.&amp;nbsp;735–739. {{PMID|16805760}} (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID17556153"&gt;M. T. Smith, R. K. Wong: ''Foreign bodies.'' In: ''Gastrointest Endosc Clin N Am'' 17, 2007, S.&amp;nbsp;361–382. {{PMID|17556153}} (Review)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frequency ==

There is no reliable data about the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of clinically meaningful foreign rectal bodies. It may have increased in the long term&lt;ref name="Munter2009"&gt;D. W. Munter: [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/776795-overview ''Foreign Bodies, Rectum.''] Vom 28. September 2009, abgerufen am 15. April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as it is observed more often in recent times.&lt;ref name="PMID18662236"&gt;N. Manimaran, M. Shorafa, J. Eccersley: ''Blow as well as pull: an innovative technique for dealing with a rectal foreign body.''

The incident rate is significantly higher for men than for women. The gender ratio is in the area of 28:1.&lt;ref name="Munter2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PMID15606596"&gt;D. L. Clarke u. a.: ''Colorectal foreign bodies.'' In: ''Colorectal Dis'' 7, 2005, S.&amp;nbsp;98–103. {{PMID|15606596}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. B. Stack, D. W.

Median age of the patients was 44.1 years, with a [[standard deviation]] of 16.6 years.&lt;ref name="PMID19895597"&gt;M. A. Kurer, C. Davey, S. Khan, S. Chintapatla: ''Colorectal foreign bodies: a systematic review.'' In: ''Colorectal disease: the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland'' Band 12, Nummer 9, September 2010, S.&amp;nbsp;851–861, {{ISSN|1463-1318}}. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1463-1318.2009.02109.x}}. {{PMID|19895597}}. (Review).&lt;/ref&gt; Rectal foreign bodies are not an unusual occurrence in hospital emergency rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 17375796| year = 2007| author1 = Feigelson| first1 = S| title = Removal of a large spherical foreign object from the rectum using an obstetric vacuum device: A case report| journal = The American surgeon| volume = 73| issue = 3| pages = 304–6| last2 = Maun| first2 = D| last3 = Silverberg| first3 = D| last4 = Menes| first4 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented case dates from the 16th century.&lt;ref name="PMID18925957" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Haft, H. B.  Benjamin: ''Foreign bodies in the rectum: some psychosexual aspects.'' In: ''Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality'' 7, 1973, S.&amp;nbsp;74–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Reasons for foreign rectal bodies vary wildly, but in most cases they are of sexual or criminal motivation.&lt;ref name="Messmann2004"&gt;H. Messmann: ''Lehratlas der Koloskopie.'' Georg Thieme Verlag, 2004, {{ISBN|3-13-136441-6}}, S.&amp;nbsp;219. ISGN {{Google books|TCeklf42u0wC||page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreign body was inserted voluntarily in the vast majority of cases. This especially includes sexually motivated behaviour, encompassing the majority of cases. [[Bodypacking]], i.e. illegal transport of [[drugs]] within a body orfice (here: inside the rectum), is another – potentially – voluntary reason for insertion of foreign rectal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Laitenberger: [http://d-nb.info/978949625/34 ''Klinische und rechtsmedizinische Aspekte des intestinalen Rauschmitteltransportes in Hamburg 1989 bis 2004.''] Dissertation, Universität Hamburg, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes attempts to transport objects like weapons, including knives, or ammunition. According to one study, sexual stimulation was responsible for 80% of clinically relevant foreign rectal bodies. About 10% of the cases were due to sexual assault.&lt;ref name="PMID8908954"&gt;J. S. Cohen and J. M. Sackier: ''Management of colorectal foreign bodies.'' In: ''J Roy Coll Surg Edin'' 41, 1996, S.&amp;nbsp;312–315. {{PMID|8908954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In rare cases, the patient inserted the object into the rectum without a way to remove it intending to receive attention and pity from doctors and nurses. This behaviour is categorized as [[Munchausen's syndrome]].&lt;ref name="PMID18925957"&gt;S. A. Khan u. a.: [http://www.casesjournal.com/content/1/1/243 ''Munchausen's syndrome presenting as rectal foreign body insertion: a case report.''] In: ''Cases J'' 1, 2008, 243. {{PMID|18925957}} ([[Open Access]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cause may be attempted self-treatment of diseases. One patient attempted to treat his chronic [[diarrhea]] by inserting an ear of [[maize]] into his rectum.&lt;ref&gt;V. Stenz u. a.: ''Fremdkörpergeschichten.'' In: ''Ther Umsch'' 65, 2008, S.&amp;nbsp;699–702. {{PMID|19048523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another patient tried to soothe the itching due to his [[hemorrhoids]] (''[[Pruritus ani]]'') with a [[toothbrush]]. The toothbrush went out of control and disappeared inside his anus.&lt;ref name="PMID11491473"&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. Kumar |date=July 2001 |title=Don't forget your toothbrush! |url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v191/n1/full/4801082a.html |journal=British Dental Journal |volume=191 |issue=1 |pages=27–28 |issn=0007-0610 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4801082a |pmid=11491473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidents or [[torture]] may cause an involuntary insertion of a foreign body.&lt;ref&gt;F. Nuschler u. a.: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719103018/http://inef.uni-due.de/cms/files/report01.pdf ''Bericht über die internationale Folterfoschung.''] (PDF; 4,6&amp;nbsp;MB) Universität Duisburg, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; A mercury [[medical thermometer]] inserted into the anus in order to measure the temperature, but broke off while inside, is an example of a foreign rectal body due to an accident.&lt;ref name="PMID19444034"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B. Azman |author2=B. Erku |author3=B. H. Güvenç |date=May 2009 |title=Balloon extraction of a retained rectal foreign body under fluoroscopy, case report and review |journal=Pediatric Emergency Care |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=345–347 |issn=1535-1815 |doi=10.1097/PEC.0b013e3181a3494f |pmid=19444034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greece knew the [[Rhaphanidosis]] as a punishment for male adulterers. It involved the insertion of a [[radish]] into the anus. Many self-inserted rectal bodies are stated as accidentally by the patients due to feelings of shame.

There are several reasons that contribute to the jamming of rectal bodies inside the rectum. Many of the objects used for sexual stimulation have a conical tip in order to facilitate penetration, while the base is flat. Extraction by the user may be impossible if the base of the object passed the anus towards the rectum. In order to receive a stronger stimulation, the object may be inserted deeper than intended. In this case, the [[sphincter]] prevents, by mechanical means, the extraction of the foreign body.&lt;ref name="PMID984928" /&gt;

== Objects ==
Type and size of the foreign rectal bodies are diverse and may exceed the anatomical-physiological imagination.&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt;

Objects documented in literature include:
* Razor, screw, screwdriver, small rolled tool bag (15×12&amp;nbsp;cm, including tools 620&amp;nbsp;g), [[hairpin]], [[milk can opener]]
* [[Fish bone]], bone splinters
* Different drug containers
* Short staffs, such as a 27&amp;nbsp;cm long chair leg, a 19&amp;nbsp;cm long [[spade]] handle and a broken off broom handle, extension parts for a vacuum cleaner
* Containers, sometimes exceeding 0.5&amp;nbsp;l in volume, e.g. sparkling wine bottles, bottles of Coca-Cola, jam pots, small beer glasses, cups
* Spray can, light bulb, [[vacuum tube]], candle
* [[Table tennis]] ball, [[Boccia]] ball
* [[Ammunition]], [[firecracker]]
* Cucumber, carrot, maize ear, banana, apples, onion, [[Figging|carved pieces of ginger]]

Not all objects are solid. In 1987, a case was documented of a patient who administered a [[cement]] [[enema]]. After it solified and impacted, the resulting block had to be surgically extracted.&lt;ref&gt;P. J. Stephens, M. L. Taff: ''Rectal impaction following enema with concrete mix.'' In: ''Am J Forensic Med Pathol'' 8, 1987, S.&amp;nbsp;179–182. {{PMID|3649167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another extreme case occurred in November 1953. A depressed man inserted a 15&amp;nbsp;cm long cardboard tube into his rectum and tossed a lighted firecracker into the tube's opening, resulting in a large hole in his rectum.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Butters: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1980742/?tool=pubmed ''An unusual rectal injury.''] In: ''Br Med J'' 2, 1955, S.&amp;nbsp;602–603. {{PMID|13240191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Many patients feel ashamed during the [[Medical history|anamnesis]] and provide information only reluctantly. This may lead to missing information that may be important during therapy. For the same reason, patients may not visit a doctor until very late. Trusting and sensitive care for the ashamed and uncomfortable patients is paramount for a successful therapy&lt;ref name="PMID9887927"&gt;R. P. Mackinnon, G. Fulde: [http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/xmas98/mkinnon/mkinnon.html ''Removing rectal foreign bodies: is the ventouse gender specific?''] In: ''Med J Aust'' 169, 1998, S.&amp;nbsp;670–671. {{PMID|9887927}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be livesaving.&lt;ref&gt;E. Stein: ''Proktologie: Lehrbuch und Atlas.'' Verlag Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|3-540-43033-4}}, S.&amp;nbsp;329f. {{Google books|8yQAecJo5AoC||page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, several [[radiology|radiological]] images are recorded in order to pinpoint the precise place and depth of the foreign body. This is usually done by [[x-ray]]. Foreign bodies made from low-contrast material (e.g. plastics) may necessitate [[medical ultrasound]] or a [[CT scan]].&lt;ref name="PMID9887927" /&gt; [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] is [[contraindication|contraindicated]], especially if the foreign body is unknown. Foreign rectal bodies may penetrate deep into the colon, in certain circumstances up to the [[right colic flexure]].&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt;

An [[endoscopy]], which may also be of use during therapy, facilitates the identification and localisation of the object inside the rectum.&lt;ref name="Axon2004"&gt;A. T. R. Axon and M. Classen: ''Gastroenterologische Endoskopie.'' Georg Thieme Verlag, 2004, {{ISBN|3-13-132401-5}}, S.&amp;nbsp;400–401. {{Google books|6LtyFKwyCv4C||page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about the foreign body obtained in those ways are of high importance during therapy, as a [[perforation]] of the rectum or the anus is to be absolutely avoided.

== Therapy ==
[[File:Rectal foreign body 02.jpg|thumb|Endoscopic sling with the fragment of a glass bottle.]]
The therapeutic measures to remove the foreign body can be as diverse as the objects inside the rectum. In many instances, the foreign bodies consist of fragile materials, such as glass. Most patients wait for several hours or even days until they visit a doctor. Before they do, they often repeatedly try to remove the object themselves or by a layperson. This often worsens the situation for a successful extraction.

In most cases, the foreign body can be removed endoscopic. Vibrators, for example, can be often removed using a large sling usually used to remove [[polyp (medicine)|polyps]] during [[coloscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Hartmann u. a.: ''Notfallendoskopie – Update.'' In: ''Gastroenterologie up2date'' 5, 2009, S.&amp;nbsp;321–334. {{DOI|10.1055/s-0029-1215318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller objects like a [[medical thermometer]] can be removed by a biopsy forceps.&lt;ref name="PMID14703278"&gt;W. C. Huang u. a.: ''Retained rectal foreign bodies.'' In: ''J Chin Med Assoc'' 66, 2003, S.&amp;nbsp;607–612. {{PMID|14703278}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flexible endoscope can be of no help with large and jammed objects. It may be preferable to use rigid tools in those cases.&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt;

There have been several cases where instruments used in child birth have proven their worth for the removal of those foreign bodies, such as the [[forceps]]&lt;ref name="PMID1252815"&gt;T. N. Peet: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1638849/?page=1 ''Removal of impacted rectal foreign body with obstetric forceps.''] In: ''British Medical Journal'' 1976, S.&amp;nbsp;500–501. {{PMID|1252815}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ventouse|suction cups]].&lt;ref name="PMID8756851" /&gt;
Wooden objects have been retrieved with corkscrews and drinking glasses after filling them with [[plaster]].&lt;ref name="PMID1252815" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Bailey and J. Love: ''A short textbook of surgery.'' A. J. H. Rains and H. D. Ritchie (Herausgeber), 16th edition. Verlag Lewis, 1975, S.&amp;nbsp;1013.&lt;/ref&gt; A spoon can be used as an "anchor" by leaving it inside the glass during the plaster filling, removing it together with the glass.&lt;ref name="Spiegel1991" /&gt; Light bulbs are encased in a [[gauze]] shroud, shattered inside the rectum and extracted.&lt;ref name="Spiegel1991" /&gt;

There have been successful cases using [[Argon plasma coagulation|argon-plasma coagulation]]. The object in question was a green apple wraped in [[cellophane]] inside the rectum of a 44-year-old patient. The argon-beam coagulation shrunk the apple by more than 50%, enabling its removal. Previous extraction attempts using endoscopic tools failed due to the flat surface of the object.&lt;ref name="PMID9201486"&gt;J. Glaser u. a.: [https://www.thieme-connect.com/ejournals/pdf/endoscopy/doi/10.1055/s-2007-1004178.pdf ''Unusual rectum foreign body: Treatment using argon-beam coagulation.''] (PDF; 224&amp;nbsp;kB) In: ''Endoscopy'' 29, 1997, S.&amp;nbsp;230–231. {{PMID|9201486}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the object is too far up, in the area of the ''[[colon sigmoideum]]'', and cannot be removed using one of the above methods, bed rest and sedation can cause the object to descend back into the rectum, where retrieval and extraction are easier.&lt;ref name="PMID984928" /&gt;

In difficult cases, a [[laparotomy]] may be necessary. Statistically, this is the case in about 10 percent of patients.&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt; The large intestine can be manipulated inside the abdominal cavity, making it possible for it to wander in the direction of the anus and be grabbed there. A surgical opening of the large intestines can be indication in very difficult cases, especially if the manipulation of the object may pose a serious health risk. This may be the case with a jammed drug condom.&lt;ref name="Axon2004" /&gt;

=== Anaesthesia ===
Mild cases may need a [[sedation]] at most. [[Local anaesthesia|Local]] and [[spinal anaesthesia]] find common use. Difficult interventions may need [[general anaesthesia]]; surgical opening of the abdominal cavity or the colon require it. General anaesthesia can be beneficial for the relaxation of the [[sphincter]].&lt;ref name="Messmann2004" /&gt;

=== Aftercare ===
After the surgery, a [[sigmoidoscopy]] – a [[colonoscopy]] focused on the first 60&amp;nbsp;cm of the colon – is good practice in order to rule out possible perforation and injury of the rectum and the ''colon sigmoideum''.&lt;ref name="PMID18666334"&gt;J. J. Koornstra and R. K. Weersma: [http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/14/4403.asp ''Management of rectal foreign bodies: description of a new technique and clinical practice guidelines.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919143918/http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/14/4403.asp |date=2008-09-19 }} In: ''World J Gastroenterol'' 14, 2008, S.&amp;nbsp;4403–4406. {{PMID|18666334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stationary aftercare may be indicated.

== Possible consequences of a non-removed object ==
If the foreign body is too big to allow feces from the colon to pass, a mechanical [[ileus]] may occur. The distension of the rectum and the disruption of the [[Vasoconstriction|peristasis]] reinforce this effect.

The foreign body may cause infections, destroying the intestinal wall. Depending on the location of the perforation, this may lead to a [[peritonitis]] due to the feces or an [[abscess]] in the retroperitoneal space.

Smaller objects that injure the intestinal wall, but do not perforate it, may be encapsulated by a [[foreign body granuloma]]. They may remain in the rectum as a pseudotumor without any further effects.

== Complications ==
The most common – but still rare – [[complication (medicine)|complication]] is a perforation of the rectum caused by the foreign object itself or attempts to remove it. Diagnosed perforations are operated immediately by opening the [[abdomen]] and removal or [[surgical suturing|suturing]] of the perforated area. In order to suppress [[infections]], antibiotics are usually prescribed.&lt;ref name="PMID984928" /&gt; Often, a temporary [[ileostomy]] is necessary to protect the stitches.&lt;ref name="PMID8908954" /&gt; After a contrast medium applied by an enema proves the complete healing of the perforated area, the ileostomy is reversed. This usually takes between three and six months.
&lt;ref&gt;J. Ruiz del Castillo u. a.: ''Colorectal trauma caused by foreign bodies introduced during sexual activity: diagnosis and management.'' In: ''Rev Esp Enferm Dig'' 93, 2001, S.&amp;nbsp;631–634. {{PMID|11767487}} (Review)&lt;/ref&gt; Average hospitalization is 19 days.&lt;ref name="PMID984928" /&gt;

Medical literature describes some deaths due to rectal foreign bodies, but they are very rare and usually classified as [[autoerotic fatality]]. A 75-year-old patient died due to a rectal perforation caused by a [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]] person using a cane.&lt;ref&gt;N. Ikeda u. a.: ''Homicide by rectal insertion of a walking stick.'' In: ''Nihon Hoigaku Zasshi.'' Band 45, 1991, S.&amp;nbsp;341–344. {{PMID|1766149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another middle-aged patient died due to a rectal perforation by a vibrator. The perforation was sutured and the patient received intensive medical care, but he contracted [[Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome]] (ARDS) and [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]] (SIRS) due to the trauma, resulting in [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]] (MODS) and death.&lt;ref&gt;N. G. Waraich u. a.: ''Vibrator-induced fatal rectal perforation.'' In: ''New Zealand Medical Journal.'' Band 120, 2007, S.&amp;nbsp;U2685. {{PMID|1772649}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a paper describing a death after a perforation with a [[shoehorn]].&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Byard u. a.: ''Unusual fatal mechanisms in nonasphyxial autoerotic death.'' In: ''Am Journal of Forensic Medical Pathology.'' Band 21, 2000, S.&amp;nbsp;65–68. {{PMID|10739230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rectum has to be nursed after a surgical procedure until healing is complete. A 54-year-old man, who had been operated on twice in order to remove a foreign body (a cucumber and a parsnip), died due to a [[peritonitis]] after he inserted two apples into the rectum before the wound had healed.&lt;ref name="Spiegel1991" /&gt;

== By oral intake ==
The other way for a foreign body to travel through the digestive system (after oral intake and passage through the entire intestines) happens very often, but is only rarely medically relevant. Other constriction, such as the [[esophagus]], [[cardia]], [[pylorus]] or [[ileocecal valve]] tend to cause issues with other organs, provided a foreign body is large enough to be an issue. Some foreign bodies may still pass those narrows and may cause medically relevant issues, i.e. toothpicks and bones.&lt;ref name="PMID17556153" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Munter2009" /&gt; Bones especially, i.e. from chickens, cause about half of all intestinal perforations.&lt;ref name="PMID1854398"&gt;D. H. Davies: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1285738/ ''A chicken bone in the rectum.''] In: ''Arch Emerg Med'' 8, 1991, S.&amp;nbsp;62–64. {{PMID|1854398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Manus: ''Perforation of the intestine by ingested foreign bodies.'' In: ''American Journal of Surgery'' 53, 1941, S.&amp;nbsp;392–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant-based food, especially [[seeds]] like [[popcorn]],&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Roberge u. a.: ''Popcorn primary colonic phytobezoar.'' In: ''Ann Emerg Med'' 17, 1988, S.&amp;nbsp;77–79. {{PMID|3337421}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[watermelon]], [[sunflower seed|sunflower]] and [[pumpkin]] seed, may clump together inside the lower intestines to form [[bezoar]]s. Those may grow too big for normal anal passage, thus becoming clinically relevant. This kind of rectal foreign body happens chiefly in children, especially in [[Northern Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], where those seeds form an elemental part of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;A. Eitan u. a.: ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6WKP-4NX46MB-19-1&amp;_cdi=6912&amp;_user=582538&amp;_pii=S0022346807000929&amp;_orig=search&amp;_coverDate=06%2F30%2F2007&amp;_sk=999579993&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkWA&amp;md5=15e313c025d4b95eae6975a89ce2fb8f&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf Fecal impaction in children: report of 53 cases of rectal seed bezoars.]'' In: ''J Pediatr Surg'' 42, 2007, S.&amp;nbsp;1114–1117. {{PMID|17560231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Mirza u. a.: ''Rectal bezoars due to pumpkin seeds.'' In: ''Trop Doct'' 39, 2009, S.&amp;nbsp;54–55. {{PMID|19211433}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In very rare cases, seeds inside a bezoar may germinate inside the lower intestines or the rectum, causing a blockade.&lt;ref&gt;F. Mahjoub u. a.: ''Invading plant material appearing as a colonic tumoural mass in a four-year-old girl.'' In: ''Trop Doct'' 39, 2009, S.&amp;nbsp;253–254. {{PMID|19762589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In veterinary medicine ==
Foreign rectal bodies are rare in [[veterinary medicine]]. A passage through the entire intestines, followed by a stay inside the rectum is – as with humans – rare.&lt;ref&gt;C. B. Webb u. a.: ''Rectal strictures in 19 dogs: 1997–2005.'' In: ''JAVMA.'' Band 43, 2007, S. 332–336. {{PMID|17975215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals may have [[bezoar]]s out of different materials, which may migrate to the rectum and cause problems.&lt;ref&gt;N. D. Sargison u. a.: ''Intestinal obstruction in a blue-faced Leicester ram associated with a phytobezoar lodged at the pelvic inlet.'' In: ''Veterinary Record.'' Band 137, 1995, S. 222. {{PMID|7502475}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Atypical foreign rectal bodies in animals of both sexes may be caused by sexual or [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] abuse.&lt;ref&gt;H. M. C. Munro, M. V. Thrusfield: ''[http://canadianveterinarians.net/pdfs/Munro_SexualAbuse.pdf "Battered Pets": Sexual Abuse.''] In: ''Journal Of Small Animal Practice.'' Band 42, 2001, S. 333–337. {{PMID|11480898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;|width=280|caption=An example of rehearsal letters}}A '''rehearsal letter''' is a boldface letter of the [[alphabet]] in an [[orchestra]]l [[Sheet music|score]], and its corresponding parts, that provides the [[conducting|conductor]], who typically leads rehearsals, with a convenient spot to begin at places other than the start of movements or pieces. Rehearsal letters are most often used in scores of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] and onwards, beginning with [[Louis Spohr]]. 

==Terminology==
They may also be generically called '''rehearsal marks'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usermanuals.finalemusic.com/FinaleMac/Content/Finale/Rehearsal_letters.htm|title=Rehearsal marks|website=usermanuals.finalemusic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://musescore.org/en/handbook/rehearsal-marks|title=Rehearsal marks {{!}} MuseScore|website=musescore.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''rehearsal figures''',&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar&lt;/ref&gt; or, when numbers are used instead of letters, '''rehearsal numbers'''.

== Purpose ==

In the course of rehearsing a symphony or piece, it is often necessary for the conductor to stop and go back to some point in the middle, in order to master the more difficult passages or sections, or to resolve a challenge that the ensemble is having. Many scores and parts have [[bar (music)|bar]] numbers, every five or ten bars, or at the beginning of each page or line. But as pieces and individual movements of works became longer (extending to several hundred bars) as the Romantic era progressed, bar numbers became less practical in rehearsal.

[[Image:RehLetterXamp_fromFullScore.png|300px|thumb|right|From a page in the full score of [[Christoph Graupner]]'s Symphony in D major, Nagel 75. If the conductor wants to resume rehearsal from the second measure shown here, he could either say "measure 21" or "letter A".]]

For example, a conductor can tell their musicians to resume at bar 387, so that the musicians have to find the nearest bar number in their parts (e.g. 385 or 390) and count back or forward a couple of measures. Even if the number 387 is written at the appropriate bar, it might not particularly stand out. But if there is, for example, a big, bold letter M in the score and parts, it is much easier for the conductor to just say "begin at letter M". Even if the conductor were to say "one bar before letter M", that would still be more convenient than saying "bar 386". Alternatively the conductor could first say "before M..." and allow the players time to find M and then say "one bar".&lt;ref&gt;J. V. Horn ''The Community Orchestra'' Greenwood Press, 1979 p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In the score of a full orchestra, rehearsal letters are typically placed over the [[flute]]s' (or [[piccolo]]'s) staff, and duplicated above the first [[violin]]s' staff. For concert bands, rehearsal letters are placed over the piccolo's staff (or flutes'), and over the [[trumpet]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Nicholl &amp; Richard Grudzinski, ''Music Notation: Preparing Scores and Parts'', ed. Jonathan Feist. Boston: Berklee Press (2007): 46. "Rehearsal marks appear above the top staff in most scores. In large scores, rehearsal marks can also appear in a second place, usually in the middle of the system or above each choir."&lt;/ref&gt; Rehearsal letters should appear in every part, but the conductor or librarian should check this and also make sure that they agree with the conductor's score; if they do not, the letters from the parts should be copied to the conductor's score.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, 1979, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; For typical pieces or movements of the Romantic era marked [[allegro (music)|allegro]], the letters A to Z can be used up, though the letters I, J or O (or all) may be skipped.

Placement and frequency of the letters do not follow a hard-and-fast rule. Generally they are inserted at places where there is a musically significant change, for example a new theme, or a change in dynamic or instrumentation or the start of a new section – just those places where a conductor might want to restart in rehearsal. In addition, having the letters coincide with musical signposts can help players who are counting rests confirm they are still in the right place, which would not be possible if the marks were placed at numerically regular intervals.

The letter A is almost always used for a point close to the beginning, but not for the very beginning itself because it is much easier to say "from the beginning". Likewise, rehearsal letters are not necessary at changes in [[tempo]], [[key signature]] or [[time signature]], as the name of the new tempo or signature can serve the same purpose. For example, in some editions of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], letter A of the Finale does not occur until bar 140, when the relatively late entry of the first violins with the "[[Ode to Joy]]" theme might not stand out enough to the other players to be a convenient point of reference, whereas the reminiscences of the previous movements' themes are more easily referenced by their tempo markings.

[[Image:RehLetterXamp_fromBassoonPart.png|700px|thumb|center|From the bassoon part of [[Christoph Graupner]]'s Symphony in D major, Nagel 75. If the conductor says to resume playing from measure 21, the bassoonist has to count from measure 18, or count backwards from measure 23. But if the conductor says to resume from letter A, the bassoonist needs only find the letter A in his or her part.]]

A rehearsal letter usually breaks a [[multimeasure rest]] in a part (except in cases where a given instrument does not play at all in a given movement of the work). Because rehearsal letters are sometimes independent of edition and in some cases even version, they are also useful for telling applicants for positions in the orchestra what passages they need to play at the [[audition (performing arts)|audition]]. They are also useful for easy reference in scholarly essays about orchestral works. However, rehearsal letters are altogether absent from some editions of some pieces that have them in other editions, such as the older editions of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Meistersinger]]'' prelude.&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar&lt;/ref&gt;

Rehearsal letters are less useful in unaccompanied instrumental music such as the solo [[piano]] repertoire (although they may be used in duets), since the instrumentalist has no need to communicate to a fellow player where to resume playing. Songs also tend not to use them, because it is more useful to refer to the [[lyrics]] (except in pieces where the lyrics are highly repetitive, or those with long lyric-less sections).

== Usage in the late 19th century to 21st century ==

In some cases, A to Z might not be enough. After Z, Aa may be used, followed by Bb, and so on until Zz (though Ii, Jj and/or Oo might also be skipped). The Wilhelm Hansen edition of [[Jean Sibelius]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|Symphony No. 7 in C major]] presents one unusual case: the letters A to Z (including both I and J) are used up with just three more pages left in the score. For the final flute and bassoon solo, the editors use [[Ö]] (the final letter of the [[Finnish alphabet]]) as a rehearsal letter.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{Image frame|content=&lt;score&gt;  \relative c'' {
  \set Score.markFormatter = #format-mark-box-numbers

}
&lt;/score&gt;|width=280|caption=Boxed rehearsal numbers}}But in the case of some composers, such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], twice through the alphabet might still not be enough. For this reason, some editors prefer rehearsal numbers to rehearsal letters. Mahler's and Shostakovich's scores use rehearsal numbers rather than letters. These are typically in [[boldface]] and enclosed in a box, or less commonly, a circle. Confusingly, however, some editions enclose bar numbers in boxes, though usually not in bold. In the Schirmer edition of [[Roy Harris]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Harris)|Symphony No. 3]] (in one movement), the rehearsal numbers are enclosed in circles, and they occur every ten measures, actually being the bar number divided by 10. That rehearsal numbers "are easily confused with measure numbers" is a reason sometimes given in favor of rehearsal letters.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Stone. ''Music Notation in the Twentieth Century: A Practical Guidebook'' (New York &amp; London, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1980), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of rehearsal numbers counter that even 26 letters are not enough for some scores. Whereas rehearsal letters reset to A for each movement of a multi-movement work (even for connected movements), rehearsal numbers typically run over the course of the entire work, even if the movements are not connected. For example, the rehearsal number for the last few bars of the first movement of [[Edward Elgar]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 (Elgar)|First Symphony]] is 55; the first rehearsal number of the second movement is 56. There are exceptions, however. The final outburst in the first movement of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 2 (Mahler)|Second Symphony]] is rehearsal number 27. Mahler actually wanted a pause of five minutes before the next movement, so the rehearsal numbers reset to 1, ending with 15. The third movement follows after a short break, but its first rehearsal number is 28.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Gustav. ''Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2 in Full Score'', Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-25473-9}} (1987) pp. 224-225, 248.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Jazz and pop===
For jazz and pop compositions with several choruses, "many jazz composers and arrangers" use a format in which "each successive verse/chorus part of the form is assigned successive letters of the alphabet" combined with a measure number: for example, letter A for the first 8-bar phrase of the verse after the introduction, A9 for the next 8-bar phrase, A17, A25, then B, B9, B17, B25 for the chorus, etc., with the special rehearsal marking TAG for the [[tag ending]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholl &amp; Grudzinski (2007): 45&lt;/ref&gt; In jazz and pop music, the musicians frequently refer to the "A section" or the "B section" of a [[32 bar song]] during rehearsals. In pop music, the music is commonly organized into standard sections, such as an [[introduction (music)|intro]], multiple [[verse (popular music)|verse]]s and [[chorus (song)|chorus]]es (refrain), one or more [[bridge (music)|bridge]]s, a [[guitar solo]] (or other instrumental solos), and an [[outro (music)|outro]]s. As such, a [[bandleader]] who wishes to start in the middle of a song will typically specify which part of this structure the band should start on (e.g., "last four bars of the bridge, going into the guitar solo" or "last verse and go to the outro").

[[File:Riparian strip.jpg|thumb|right|A well-preserved natural riparian strip on a tributary to [[Lake Erie]]]]

A '''riparian zone''' or '''riparian area''' is the interface between land and a [[river]] or [[stream]]. '''Riparian''' is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen terrestrial [[biome]]s of the Earth. Plant habitats and communities along the river margins and [[Bank (geography)|banks]] are called riparian vegetation, characterized by [[Aquatic plant|hydrophilic plants]]. Riparian zones are important in [[ecology]], [[environmental resource management]], and [[civil engineering]] because of their role in [[soil conservation]], their habitat [[biodiversity]], and the influence they have on [[fauna]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, including [[grassland]]s, [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, or even non-vegetative areas.  In some regions the terms '''riparian woodland''', '''[[riparian forest]]''', '''[[riparian buffer]] zone,''' '''riparian corridor''' and '''riparian strip''' are used to characterize a riparian zone. The word ''riparian'' is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:ripa|ripa]]'', meaning river bank.

==Characteristics==
Riparian zones may be natural or engineered for soil stabilization or [[Land rehabilitation|restoration]]. These zones are important natural [[biofilter]]s, protecting aquatic environments from excessive [[sediment]]ation, polluted [[surface runoff]] and [[erosion]]. They supply shelter and food for many [[aquatic animal]]s and shade that limits stream temperature change. When riparian zones are damaged by [[construction]], [[agriculture]] or [[silviculture]], biological restoration can take place, usually by human intervention in [[erosion control]] and revegetation. If the area adjacent to a watercourse has standing water or saturated soil for as long as a season, it is normally termed a [[wetland]] because of its [[hydric soil]] characteristics. Because of their prominent role in supporting a [[biodiversity|diversity of species]], riparian zones are often the subject of national protection in a [[biodiversity action plan]]. These are also known as a "Plant or Vegetation Waste Buffer".

Research shows that riparian zones are instrumental in [[water quality]] improvement for both surface runoff and water flowing into streams through subsurface or [[groundwater]] flow. Riparian zones can play a role in lowering nitrate contamination in surface runoff, such as manure and other [[fertilizer]]s from [[Field (agriculture)|agricultural fields]], that would otherwise damage [[ecosystem]]s and human health. Particularly, the attenuation of [[nitrate]] or [[denitrification]] of the nitrates from [[fertilizer]] in this buffer zone is important. The use of wetland riparian zones shows a particularly high rate of removal of nitrate entering a stream and thus has a place in agricultural management.

==Roles and functions==
[[File:Pisuerga2.JPG|thumb|right|Thick riparian vegetation along the [[Pisuerga|Pisuerga River]] in [[Spain]]]]
Riparian zones dissipate stream energy. The [[meander]]ing curves of a river, combined with vegetation and root systems, slow the flow of water, which reduces soil erosion and flood damage. Sediment is trapped, reducing suspended solids to create less [[turbidity|turbid]] water, replenish soils, and build stream banks. Pollutants are filtered from surface runoff, enhancing water quality via biofiltration.

The riparian zones also provide [[wildlife]] [[habitat]], increased biodiversity, and [[wildlife corridor]]s, enabling aquatic and riparian organisms to move along river systems avoiding isolated communities. Riparian vegetation can also provide [[Fodder|forage]] for wildlife and livestock.

Riparian zones are also important for the fish that live within rivers, such as brook and charr. Impacts to riparian zones can affect fish, and restoration is not always sufficient to recover fish populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sievers |first1=Michael |last2=Hale |first2=Robin |last3=Morrongiello |first3=John R. |title=Do trout respond to riparian change? A meta-analysis with implications for restoration and management |journal=Freshwater Biology |date=March 2017 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=445–457 |doi=10.1111/fwb.12888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They provide native [[landscape]] irrigation by extending seasonal or perennial flows of water. Nutrients from terrestrial vegetation (e.g. [[plant litter]] and insect drop) are transferred to aquatic food webs. The vegetation surrounding the stream helps to shade the water, mitigating [[thermal pollution|water temperature changes]].  The vegetation also contributes wood debris to streams, which is important to maintaining [[geomorphology]].

From a social aspect, riparian zones contribute to nearby property values through amenity and views, and they improve enjoyment for footpaths and bikeways through supporting [[Greenway (landscape)#Foreshoreway|foreshoreway]] networks. Space is created for riparian sports such as fishing, swimming and launching for vessels and paddlecraft.

The riparian zone acts as a sacrificial erosion buffer to absorb impacts of factors including [[climate change]], increased runoff from [[urbanization]] and increased [[Wake#Wake pattern of a boat|boat wake]] without damaging structures located behind a setback zone.

==Role in logging==
The protection of riparian zones is often a consideration in [[logging]] operations.  The undisturbed soil, soil cover, and vegetation provide shade, plant litter, and woody material, and reduce the delivery of [[soil erosion|soil eroded]] from the harvested area. Factors such as soil types and [[root]] structures, [[Climate|climatic]] conditions and vegetative cover determine the effectiveness of riparian buffering.

==Vegetation==
[[File:Willow Creek, Trout Creek Mountains, Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Riparian zone along Trout Creek in the [[Trout Creek Mountains]], part of the Burns Bureau of Land Management District in southeastern [[Oregon]]. The creek provides critical habitat for [[trout]].]]

The assortment of riparian zone trees varies from those of wetlands and typically consists of plants that are either emergent aquatic plants, or [[herb]]s, [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s that thrive in proximity to water.

==Repair and restoration==
Land clearing followed by floods can quickly erode a riverbank, taking valuable grasses and soils downstream, and later allowing the sun to bake the land dry. [[Natural Sequence Farming]] techniques have been used in the [[Upper Hunter Shire|Upper Hunter]] Valley of [[New South Wales]], Australia, in an attempt to rapidly restore eroded farms to optimum productivity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The Natural Sequence Farming technique involves placing obstacles in the water's pathway to lessen the energy of a flood, and help the water to deposit soil and [[Seep (hydrology) |seep]] into the flood zone. Another technique is to quickly establish [[ecological succession]] by encouraging fast-growing plants such as "weeds" ([[pioneer species]]) to grow. These may spread along the watercourse and cause environmental degradation, but may stabilize the soil, place carbon into the ground, and protect the land from drying. The weeds will improve the streambeds so that trees and grasses can return, and later ideally replace the weeds. There are several other techniques used by government and non-government agencies to address riparian and streambed degradation, ranging from the installation of bed control structures such as log sills to the use of pin groynes or rock emplacement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53725">'''Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics''' ('''STEM'''), previously [[Science]], [[Math]], [[Engineering]] and [[Technology]] ('''SMET'''), is a term used to group together these [[academic disciplines]].&lt;ref name="fas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42642.pdf|format=PDF|title=Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is typically used when addressing education policy and [[curriculum]] choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;

The [[acronym]] came into common use shortly after an interagency meeting on science education held at the US [[National Science Foundation]]{{when?|date=May 2018}} chaired by the then NSF director [[Rita Colwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite web|url= http://www.naplesnews.com/opinion/perspectives/guest-commentary-a-stem-in-collier-county-to-reach-their-future-2392f62e-9c19-2198-e053-0100007f6ee5-341858231.html|title= Guest commentary: A "STEM" in Collier County to reach their future|website= Naplesnews.com|access-date= 2016-06-09 | quote = The acronym STEM was suggested by Rita Colwell, Ph.D., a bacteriologist who was director of NSF in the 1980s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
A director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists, Peter Faletra, suggested the change from the older acronym SMET to STEM. Colwell, expressing some dislike for the older acronym, responded by suggesting NSF institute the change. However, the acronym STEM predates NSF and likely traces its origin to Charles Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/about.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - About CAHSEE|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stem.ccny.cuny.edu/|title=STEM Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics - Main|website=stem.ccny.cuny.edu|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqnRETS9FWwC|title=Hispanic Engineer &amp; IT|last=Group|first=Career Communications|date=1996|publisher=Career Communications Group|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In the early 1990's CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute.  Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100381&amp;org=HRD&amp;from=news|title=President Bush Honors Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cahsee.org/about/founder.asp.htm|title=CAHSEE - Founder's Biography|website=www.cahsee.org|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM.  One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym{{cn|date=May 2018}} was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], which was founded in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

===United States===

In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum.&lt;ref name="STEM PA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iu1stemcenter.org/files/CMU_and_IU_STEM_Survey.pdf |title=STEM Education in Southwestern Pennsylvania |year=2008 |publisher=The Intermediate Unit 1 Center for STEM Education |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the [[public education]] agenda of the United States.&lt;ref name="USNEWS2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/stem-education/2012/07/26/us-news-inducts-five-to-stem-leadership-hall-of-fame |title=U.S. News Inducts Five to STEM Leadership Hall of Fame |date=July 26, 2012 |author=Morella, Michael |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States [[work visa]]s for [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas.&lt;ref name="Bill Clinton Lays Out"&gt;{{cite news

====National Science Foundation====
Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[Computer science|computer]] and [[information technology]] science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, [[social sciences]] ([[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]), and STEM education and learning research.&lt;ref name="fas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12599/nsf12599.htm#appendix|title=Graduate Research Fellowship Program|work=nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eligibility for scholarship programs such as the CSM STEM Scholars Program use the NSF definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmd.edu/istem/scholarship_stem.html |title=ISTEM – College of Southern Maryland }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/about/what.jsp |title=What We Do |publisher=The National Science Foundation |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and [[information science]] and  engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs.&lt;ref name="nsf.gov"/&gt;

====Immigration policy====
Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the [[National Science Foundation]] on what constitutes a STEM field, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42530.pdf|format=PDF|title=Immigration of Foreign Nationals with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Degrees|website=Fas.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States are able to remain in the country and receive training through work experience for up to 12 months. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can remain for an additional 17 months on an OPT STEM extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DHS Expands List of STEM designated-degree programs|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/dhs-expands-list-stem-designated-degree-programs |publisher=Fowler White Boggs P.A. |author=Jennifer G.

====STEM-eligible degrees in US immigration====
{{Details|topic=Temporary foreign workers|Global labor arbitrage|H-1B visa|Optional Practical Training}}

An exhaustive list of STEM disciplines does not exist because the definition varies by organization. The [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] lists disciplines including&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ice.gov/sevis/stemlist.htm |title=STEM Designated Degree Programs |date=April 2008 |publisher=U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement |accessdate=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]], [[actuarial science]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mathematics]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[computer science]], [[computational science]], [[psychology]], [[biochemistry]], [[robotics]], [[computer engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[information science]], [[information technology]], [[civil engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[chemical engineering]], [[astrophysics]], [[astronomy]], [[optics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear physics]], [[mathematical biology]], [[operations research]], [[neurobiology]], [[biomechanics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[geographic information system]]s, [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Educational technology|educational/instructional technology]], [[software engineering]], and [[educational research]].

====Education====
By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved. [[School segregation|School integration]] can  help black, Hispanic and aboriginal students catch up with Asian and white students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

STEM supports broadening the study of [[engineering]] within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the "''Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)''" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/02/obamas-budget-shuffles-stem.html |title=Obama's Budget Shuffles STEM Education Deck |date=14 February 2012 |author=Jane J.

In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/|title=Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) - Overview|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

STEM education often uses new technologies such as [[RepRap]] [[3D printers]] to encourage interest in STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Irwin, D.E. Oppliger, J.M. Pearce, G. Anzalone, [http://www.asee.org/file_server/papers/attachment/file/0005/4988/asee_K-12_2015_finalpaper.pdf Evaluation of RepRap 3D Printer Workshops in K-12 STEM]. ''122nd ASEE 122nd ASEE Conf.

In 2006 the [[United States National Academies]] expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to:
* Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education
* Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology
* Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|title=STEM Education|website=Slsd.org|access-date=2016-06-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126095634/http://www.slsd.org/webpages/rcolelli/resources.cfm?subpage=493006|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Individual states, such as [[California]], have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://powerofdiscovery.org/sites/default/files/cde_report_task_10_and_11.pdf|format=PDF|title=Final Report : California Department of Education : CDE Agreement|website=Powerofdiscovery.org|accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where [https://floridapolytechnic.org/ Florida Polytechnic University], Florida’s first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Florida Polytechnic University|url = https://floridapolytechnic.org/about/|website = Florida Polytechnic University|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S.  Some states include [[New Jersey]], [[Arizona]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/domain/1012|title=STEM Academy / Overview|website=www.olentangy.k12.oh.us|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/national-rankings/stem|title=Best STEM High schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Competitiveness Initiative====
In the [[State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] announced the [[American Competitiveness Initiative]]. Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced [[R&amp;D]] programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines.

The ''NASA Means Business'' competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education.

The [[National Science Foundation]] has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some [[Arizona]] schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields.

The STEM Academy is a national nonprofit-status organization dedicated to improving STEM literacy for all students. It represents a recognized national next-generation high-impact academic model. The practices, strategies, and programming are built upon a foundation of identified national best practices which are designed to improve under-represented minority and low-income student growth, close achievement gaps, decrease dropout rates, increase high school graduation rates and improve teacher and principal effectiveness. The STEM Academy represents a flexible use academic model that targets all schools and is for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stem101.org/about.asp|title=stemacademy|website=Stem101.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Lead The Way]] (PLTW) is a leading provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. The national nonprofit organization has over 5,200 programs in over 4,700 schools in all 50 states. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called ''Pathway To Engineering'', a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called ''Gateway To Technology''. PLTW provides the curriculum and the teacher professional development and ongoing support to create transformational programs in schools, districts, and communities. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President [[Barack Obama]] and [[United States Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]] as well as various state, national, and business leaders.

Women constitute 47% of the U.S. workforce, and perform 24% of STEM-related jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.doc.gov/reports/women-stem-2017-update|title=Women in STEM: 2017 Update| access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK women perform 13% of STEM-related jobs (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|title=Science careers face diversity challenge|work=westminster.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018110732/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/business/2014/science-careers-face-diversity-challenge|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. women with STEM degrees are more likely to work in education or healthcare rather than STEM fields compared with their male counterparts.

The gender ratio depends on field of study. For example, in the [[European Union]] in 2012 women made up 47.3% of the total, 51% of the social sciences, business and law, 42% of the science, mathematics and computing, 28% of engineering, manufacturing and construction, and 59% of PhD graduates in Health and Welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|date= 2016|title= She Figures 2015|url= https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf#view=fit&amp;pagemode=none|publisher= European Commission|page= |access-date= 15 September 2018 |ISBN=978-92-79-48375-2|doi=10.2777/744106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The focus on increasing participation in STEM fields has attracted criticism. In the 2014 article "The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage" in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', demographer Michael S. Teitelbaum criticized the efforts of the U.S. government to increase the number of STEM graduates, saying that, among studies on the subject, "No one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher", and that "Most studies report that real wages in many—but not all—science and engineering occupations have been flat or slow-growing, and unemployment as high or higher than in many comparably-skilled occupations." Teitelbaum also wrote that the then-current national fixation on increasing STEM participation paralleled previous U.S. government efforts since [[World War II]] to increase the number of scientists and engineers, all of which he stated ultimately ended up in "mass layoffs, hiring freezes, and funding cuts"; including one driven by the [[Space Race]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, which he wrote led to "a bust of serious magnitude in the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Myth of the Science and Engineering Shortage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/03/the-myth-of-the-science-and-engineering-shortage/284359/ |first=Michael S. |last=Teitelbaum |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' contributing editor Robert N. Charette echoed these sentiments in the 2013 article "The STEM Crisis Is a Myth", also noting that there was a "mismatch between earning a STEM degree and having a STEM job" in the United States, with only around ¼ of STEM graduates working in STEM fields, while less than half of workers in STEM fields have a STEM degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The STEM Crisis Is a Myth |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth |first=Robert N. |last=Charette |publisher=IEEE Spectrum |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics writer Ben Casselman, in a 2014 study of post-graduation earnings for ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'', wrote that, based on the data, science should not be grouped with the other three STEM categories, because, while the other three generally result in high-paying jobs, "many sciences, particularly the [[life sciences]], pay below the overall median for recent college graduates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/ |first=Ben |last=Casselman |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |date=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to remedy the perceived domination of STEM subjects by men of Asian and non-Hispanic European backgrounds has led to intense efforts to diversify the STEM workforce. However, some critics feel that this practice in higher education, as opposed to a strict [[meritocracy]], causes lower academic standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Scripps Institution of Oceanography''' (sometimes referred to as '''SIO''', '''Scripps Oceanography''', or '''Scripps''') in the [[La Jolla]] community of [[San Diego|San Diego, California]]. founded in 1903, is one of the oldest and largest centers for [[ocean]] and [[Earth]] science [[research]], public service, undergraduate and graduate training in the world.  Hundreds of ocean and Earth scientists conduct research with the aid of oceanographic [[research vessel]]s and shorebased laboratories. Its [[Old Scripps Building]] is a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]]. SIO is a division of the [[University of California San Diego]] (UCSD).  The public explorations center of the institution is the [[Birch Aquarium]] at Scripps.  Since becoming part of the University of California in 1912, the institution has expanded its scope to include studies of the physics, chemistry, geology, biology, and climate of Earth.

Dr. [[Margaret Leinen]] took office as Vice Chancellor for Marine Sciences, Director of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Dean of the Graduate School of Marine Sciences on October 1, 2013.&lt;ref name=leinen&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scripps.ucsd.edu/news/13601|title=Scripps Welcomes Margaret Leinen as Director|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scripps publishes [http://explorations.ucsd.edu ''explorations now''], an e-magazine of ocean and earth science.

== Mission statement ==
"To seek, teach, and communicate scientific understanding of the [[ocean]]s, [[atmosphere]], [[Earth]], and other planets for the benefit of society and the [[Natural environment|environment]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scripps.ucsd.edu/about/mission-and-quick-facts Mission and Quick Facts], Scripps Institution of Oceanography&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Scripps Institution of Oceanography was founded in 1903 as the Marine Biological Association of San Diego, an independent biological research laboratory. It was proposed and incorporated by a committee of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce, led by local activist and amateur [[List of malacologists|malacologist]] [[Fred Baker (physician)|Fred Baker]], together with two colleagues. He recruited [[University of California]] [[Zoology]] professor [[William Emerson Ritter]] to head up the proposed marine biology institution, and obtained financial support from local philanthropists [[E. W. Scripps]] and his sister [[Ellen Browning Scripps]]. They fully funded the institution for its first decade. It began institutional life in the boathouse of the [[Hotel del Coronado]] located on [[San Diego Bay]]. It re-located in 1905 to the La Jolla area on the head above [[La Jolla Cove]], and finally in 1907 to its present location.&lt;ref name="Shragge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shragge|first=Abraham J.|author2=Dietze, Kay|date=Spring 2003|title=Character, Vision, and Creativity: The Extraordinary Confluence of Forces that Gave Rise to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography|journal=Journal of San Diego History|volume=49|issue=2|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v49-2/character.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 Scripps became part of the [[University of California]] and was renamed the "Scripps Institution for Biological Research."&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Since 1916, measurements have been taken daily at its pier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Graff |first=Amy |date=15 August 2018 |title=81-degree reading likely sets record for highest temperature ever measured in California waters |url=https://www.sfgate.com/weather/article/highest-Pacifica-ocean-temperature-California-13152086.php |work=SFGate |location=San Francisco |access-date=15 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was changed to Scripps Institution of Oceanography in October 1925.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[https://scripps.ucsd.edu/about/history Scripps history].&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, led by Scripps Institution of Oceanography director [[Roger Revelle]], it formed the nucleus for the creation of the University of California, San Diego on a bluff overlooking Scripps Institution.

The [[Old Scripps Building]], designed by [[Irving Gill]], was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1720&amp;ResourceType=Building

== Research programs ==
[[Image:SIOresearch.jpg|thumb|300px|Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers at sea]]The institution's research programs encompass biological, physical, chemical, geological, and geophysical studies of the oceans and earth. Scripps also studies the interaction of the oceans with both the atmospheric [[climate]] and environmental concerns on ''terra firma.'' Related to this research, Scripps offers undergraduate and graduate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scripps.ucsd.edu/education/|title=Education|website=scripps.ucsd.edu|publisher=Scripps Institution of Oceanography|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Scripps staff of 1,300 includes approximately 235 [[Faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]], 180 other scientists and some 300 [[graduate students]], with an annual budget of more than $195 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scripps.ucsd.edu/about/mission-and-quick-facts|title=Mission and Quick Facts  {{!}} Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego|website=scripps.ucsd.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution operates a fleet of three [[oceanography|oceanographic]] [[research vessel]]s and the research platform [[R/P FLIP]] (FLoating Instrument Platform) for oceanographic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ships/|title=Ships|website=scripps.ucsd.edu|publisher=Scripps Institution of Oceanography|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual repression''' is a state in which a person is prevented from expressing their own [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Sexual repression is often associated with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] or [[shame]], being associated with sexual impulses.&lt;ref&gt;Karen A. McClintock, ''Sexual Shame: An Urgent Call to Healing'', Fortress Press, Minneapolis, MN. ({{ISBN|0800632389}}) (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; What constitutes sexual repression is subjective and can vary greatly between cultures and moral systems. Many [[Religion and sexuality|religions]]{{which|date=November 2018}} have been accused of fostering sexual repression{{cn|date=November 2018}}.

Some ideologies{{which|date=November 2018}} seek to repress certain forms of sexual expression, such as [[homosexuality]]{{cn|date=November 2018}}, and some cultures{{which|date=November 2018}} even use [[violence|violent practices]] such as [[genital modification and mutilation]], [[honor killings]], or [[stoning]], in an attempt to regulate [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]].

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] was the first to use the term widely, and argued that it was one of the roots of many problems in [[Western world|Western society]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilf Hey. [http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 "Sigmund Freud: Psychoanalysis and Sexual Repression"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518033909/http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=597 |date=2008-05-18 }}, vision.org&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed that people's naturally strong instincts toward sexuality were repressed by people in order to meet the constraints imposed on them by civilized life. However, Freud's ideas about sexual repression have not been without their critics. According to sex therapist Bernard Apfelbaum, Freud did not base his belief in universal innate, natural sexuality on the strength of sexual desire he saw in people, but rather on its weakness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bapfelbaumphd.com/Sexual_Reality.html B. Apfelbaum. "Sexual Reality and How We Dismiss It."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704081455/http://www.bapfelbaumphd.com/Sexual_Reality.html |date=2009-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods of Indian history [[anaphrodisiac]]s were utilised in order to lower libidos.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fBVNAQAAMAAJ&amp;q="anaphrodisiac"++repression&amp;dq="anaphrodisiac"++repression&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1_bPRrdLUAhXsLcAKHXCoCY0Q6AEILTAD&lt;/ref&gt;

Many forms of Islam have strict sexual codes which include banning homosexuality, demanding virginity before marriage accompanied by a ban on fornication, and can require modest dress-codes for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=csX0f7AVM3gC&amp;pg=PA722 Sex and Society] Volume 3 - Page 722&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
{{Further|Child marriage}}
Marriage has been seen as a means of controlling sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/facpubs/1885/&lt;/ref&gt; Some forms of marriage, such as [[child marriage]], are often practiced as a means of regulating the sexuality of girls, by ensuring they do not have several partners, thus preserving their [[virginity]] for the future husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dayofthegirl.org/child-marriage/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531090804/http://dayofthegirl.org/child-marriage/ |archivedate=2014-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[BBC World Service]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/ihavearightto/four_b/casestudy_art16.shtml|title=Article 16: Right to marriage and family and to equal rights of men and women during and after marriage|publisher=[[BBC World Service]]|accessdate=June 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In some cases, parents willingly marry off their young girls in order to increase the family income or protect the girl from the risk of unwanted sexual advances or even [[promiscuity]].}}

==Female genital mutilation==
[[File:Fgm_map.gif|200px|thumb|Prevalence of FGM in Africa]]
{{Main|Female genital mutilation}}
Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting or female circumcision, "comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons".&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
The practice is concentrated in 27 countries in Africa as well as Iraqi Kurdistan, Yemen and Indonesia; and more than 125 million girls and women today are estimated to have been subjected to FGM.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM does not have any health benefits, and has serious negative effects on health; including complications during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

FGM is used as a way of controlling [[female sexuality]]; the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) states:&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

{{quote|FGM is often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, linking procedures to premarital [[virginity]] and marital fidelity. FGM is in many communities believed to reduce a woman's libido and therefore believed to help her resist "illicit" sexual acts.}}

FGM is condemned by international human rights instruments. The [[Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence|Istanbul Convention]] prohibits FGM (Article 38).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/090000168008482e&lt;/ref&gt; FGM is also considered a form a [[violence against women]] by the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] which was adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1993; according to which: ''Article Two: Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: (a) Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including [...] '''female genital mutilation''' [...]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/a48r104.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Male circumcision==
{{Main|Circumcision}}
[[File:Global Map of Male Circumcision Prevalence by Country.svg|thumb|300px|Male circumcision [[prevalence]] by country according to a World Health Organization's 2007 review.&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA&gt;{{cite web |title=Male circumcision: Global trends and determinants of prevalence, safety and acceptability |year=2007 |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Male circumcision has been practiced as a surgical means of sexual repression in some cultures, although it may be practiced for various reasons, with the World Health Organization recommending it as a means of reducing [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Circumcision is also a religious tradition in Judaism and Islam. According to medieval Jewish theologian Moses Maimonides, the "reason" for male circumcision is "the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/maimonides/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the late-nineteenth century, circumcision of the penis was prescribed by John Harvey Kellogg as a "cure" for masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19924/19924-h/19924-h.htm#chapi133&lt;/ref&gt; William Acton, a leading authority on sexuality in mid-Victorian Britain, advocated male circumcision in order to prevent "undue excitement of the sexual desires … which it is our object to repress."&lt;ref&gt;Willliam Acton. The Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive Organs in Childhood, Youth, Adult Age, and Advanced Life, Considered in their Physiological, Social, and Moral Relations. Third Edition. London: Churchill, 1862, pp. 5–6. https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cVX7PaDkzGYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

A "biocultural analysis" of male circumcision supports the hypothesis "that a practical consequence of circumcision, complementary to any religious-symbolic function, is to make a circumcised male less sexually excitable and distractible, and, hence, more amenable to his group's authority figures."&lt;ref&gt;Immerman, Ronald S. &amp; Wade C. Mackey (1997) "A biocultural analysis of circumcision." Social Biology 44: 3–4, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor killings==
{{Main|Honor killing}}
An honor killing is the [[homicide]] of a member of a family or social group by other members, due to the perpetrators' belief that the victim has brought shame or dishonor upon the family or community, usually for reasons such as refusing to enter an [[arranged marriage]], being in a relationship that is disapproved by their relatives, having [[sex outside marriage]], becoming the victim of [[rape]], dressing in ways which are deemed inappropriate, or engaging in [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honor%20killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/honor+killing?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/13/world/europe/turkey-gay-killing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/02/23/arizona.iraqi.father/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to a UN Expert Group Meeting on good practices in legislation to address harmful practices against women:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw_legislation_2009/Expert%20Paper%20EGMGPLHP%20_Sherifa%20Zuhur%20-%20II_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|They [honor killings] stem from the deeply-rooted social belief that male family members (in some cases, mothers and other women are involved in planning or carrying out honor crimes) should control the sexuality of or protect the reputation of women in the family, and that they may contain their movements or kill them for blemishing family honor, even when rumors or false gossip are the reason for public suspicion.}}

==Same-sex sexual activity==
{{Further|Sodomy law}}
Various cultures attempt to repress homosexual sexual expression. As of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by prison in 70 countries, and in five other countries and in parts of two others, homosexuality is punishable with the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from criminal prosecution, LGBT individuals may also face social stigmatization and serious violence (see [[violence against LGBT people]]).

==Studies==
Some researchers{{who|date=November 2018}} have hypothesized a relationship between sexual repression and [[rape]]. However, they have been unable to find any support for this hypothesis - whether the tremendous difficulty of measuring sexual repression is to blame, or whether the theory is simply false, is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYj_woVgA3EC&amp;pg=PA93 Mary E. Odem, Jody Clay-Warner, ''Confronting rape and sexual assault'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1998, p. 104.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual repression is often viewed as a key issue within [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[feminist views on sexuality]] vary widely.

===Michel Foucault===
[[Michel Foucault]], in his ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', neither refutes nor confirms what he calls the "repressive hypothesis." Instead, he says sexuality has become an important topic to understand and manipulate for the purpose of nation building. Through categorization of sexuality, the idea of repression was born. While he agrees sexuality has become much more controlled, he equates it to necessity. Furthermore, it is through [[psychiatric]] and medical discourse on sexuality that it has become repressed.

Foucault argues that religious confession as well as psychiatric procedure codify confession within as a means of extracting [[truth]]. Because the mechanisms of sex were obscure, it was elusive by nature and its mechanisms escaped observation. By integrating it into the beginnings of a scientific discourse, the nineteenth century altered the scope of confession. Confession tended no longer to be concerned solely with what the subject wished to hide but with what was hidden from himself. It had to be extracted by force, since it involved something that tried to stay hidden. This relationship of truth scientifically validated the view of the confessed which could assimilate, record, and verify this obscure truth.&lt;ref name="Foucault1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michel Foucault|title=The history of sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Mbc5eMjLpoC|accessdate=5 January 2013|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=978-0-679-72469-8|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repression in various countries==
{{Incomplete section|date=May 2017}}
Many countries{{which|date=November 2018}} have developed a much more liberal attitude{{cn|date=November 2018}} towards sexuality, but in some{{which|date=November 2018}} it has become less so{{cn|date=November 2018}}:

===China===
Reproduction-based sex was urged by [[Mao Zedong]], but later politicians instituted a [[one-child policy]]. In a country where atheism is popular, the restriction cannot be ascribed to religion but to nationalist motives.&lt;ref name="Body &amp; Society"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking Sexual Repression in Maoist China: Ideology, Structure and the Ownership of the Body |journal=[[Body &amp; Society]] |date=September 2005 |last=Yuehong Zhang |first=Everett |volume=11 |issue=3 |doi=10.1177/1357034X05056188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5764">'''Spiritual self-schema therapy''', sometimes referred to as '''3-S Therapy''', was developed at Yale University School of Medicine by S. Kelly Avants, Ph.D., and Arthur Margolin, Ph.D. It is a therapy for addicted individuals who have contracted [[HIV]] or are at risk for contracting [[HIV]], whose goals are to reduce illicit drug use as well as drug- and sex-related risk behaviors.  In general, it aims to promote living a spiritual life aiding in their recovery .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) development program for the treatment of addiction and HIV risk behavior|url=http://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual self-schema therapy has a non-theistic foundation based on Buddhist practices, which are very similar to contemporary cognitive-behavioral techniques, and incorporates the client's spiritual beliefs, which do not need to be specifically or conventionally religious. &lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=3-S Theoretical Foundation|url=http://www.3-s.us/about/foundation/index.aspx|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  3-S therapy does not "convert" clients to Buddhism or any other spiritual or religious belief system, but always works within the client's pre-existing set of beliefs. 

==Self-schema==
The term [[self-schema]] describes a mental process to aim in understanding and organizing incoming information (stimuli). An example would include looking in your rearview mirror while driving and seeing flashing lights - typically an individual has an automatic response and prepares to pull over with out having to think. This illustrates a well-organized schema on "flashing lights". The connection between self-schema and spiritual self-schema therapy is shown in the automatic beliefs about oneself. An individual doesn't have to stop and think "Who am I? How would somebody like that respond to this situation?" If an individual is shy and believes they are ugly, they may see somebody looking in their direction and assume the person is staring at how ugly they are, when in reality they could be finding the person quite attractive or even not looking at them at all.

==3-S at Yale==
[[Yale School of Medicine]] has started a program called 3-S Thearpy, signifying '''S'''piritual '''S'''elf-'''S'''chema. Self-schemas can be helpful, but they can also be problematic. Stereotypes are an example. Additionally, people who believe that they are "bad, worthless, or unlovable" do significant amounts of mental damage to themselves. Yale School of Medicine's 3-S program promotes [[spirituality]] as a strong resource for coping with life's troubles. The goal of its program is to create a path to enhance one's spiritual nature.&lt;ref name="3-S Theoretical Foundation" /&gt;  The therapy manuals for 3-S Therapy, in English, as well as translated into Spanish and Russian, are available at the Yale University website: https://medicine.yale.edu/spiritualselfschema/training/manuals/therapy.aspx

==HIV==

The '''Swiss Centre for Affective Sciences''' (French title 'Centre Interfacultaire en Sciences Affectives' or 'CISA') is an [[interdisciplinary]] research centre based in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="Le Temps article"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Temps 11th July 2007 |publisher=Le Temps |url=http://www.letemps.ch/template/recherche.asp?page=rechercher&amp;contenuPage=identification&amp;types=search&amp;type=0&amp;artID=211058&amp;rubrique=1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7%2C8%2C9%2C10%2C11%2C12%2C13%2C15%2C16%2C17%2C18%2C19%2C20%2C21%2C22%2C23%2C24%2C25&amp;liste=precedent |accessdate=2007-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124214838/http://www.letemps.ch/template/recherche.asp?page=rechercher |archivedate=24 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2003, the focus of its research is the emotions or [[affective science]]. It is one of 20 Swiss Government funded NCCR (National Centres for Competence in Research). The centre was headed by Professor [[Klaus Scherer]], is now headed by David Sander, and researches emotions in the areas of [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[archaeology]] and [[affective computing]]. It has project focuses in cognitive appraisal, expression, social and legal regulation, norms and values and [[aesthetic emotions]]. Over 100 researchers from different universities attend in the NCCR Affective Sciences.&lt;ref name="affective-sciences.org"&gt;http://www.affective-sciences.org/home&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research tries to train as many new affective young scientists as possible. They have a program devoted to the ''Education and Training Program'' which helps train and prepare researchers in the affective sciences for the future. The goal of ''Education and Training Program'' is to encourage approach towards affective phenomena without losing the punitive profession required for a professional career between disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.affective-sciences.org/teaching-activities&lt;/ref&gt;
There is an annual program called the [[International Summer School in Affective Sciences (ISSAS)]] which is available for young researchers worldwide. The summer school tries to bring together arts and emotions of students using many methods including literature, neuroscience, psychology, and musicology. 

The Centre's main research goals include attempting to understand affective phenomena, such as emotions and motivation, through research and analysis. Affective phenomena are complex and difficult to understand. They are described as intricate events in human behaviour and experience.&lt;ref name="affective-sciences.org"/&gt;

The centre focusses on three parts of emotions: emotions being complicated reactions to our surroundings, emotions as being disruptive and needing conscious control and regulation and emotions as being a regulating force of today’s society. Therefore, individual research projects are organized around three main categories of research relating to these aspects: emotion awareness and elicitation, emotion regulation and the social purposes of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.affective-sciences.org/research-program-overview&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''technology adoption lifecycle''' is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical [[normal distribution]] or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "[[innovators]]", followed by "[[early adopters]]". Next come the '''early majority''' and '''late majority''', and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "Laggards" or "phobics." For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.

The [[demographic]] and [[psychological]] (or "[[psychographic]]") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957.&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
The report summarized the categories as:&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
* [[innovators]] – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented
* [[early adopter]]s – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous
* early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours
* late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active
* laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated

The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century.

==Adaptations of the model==
The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest.

In his book ''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'', [[Geoffrey Moore]] proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets.

Disruption as it is used today are of the [[Clayton M. Christensen]] variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. 

In [[educational technology]], Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm Pencil metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128192012/http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing the [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] uptake in education. In [[medical sociology]], Carl May has proposed [[normalization process theory]] that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation.

Wenger, White and Smith, in their book ''Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities'', talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.&lt;ref&gt; Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July-September 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One way to model product adoption&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis. (2008) [http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture04.pdf Science of the Web] lectures at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; if they adopt product B, they get ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of&amp;nbsp;0.

A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks.

==History==
The technology adoption lifecycle is a [[sociological]] model that is an extension of an earlier model called ''the diffusion process'', which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and [[Everett M. Rogers]] at [[Iowa State University]] and which was originally published only for its application to [[agriculture]] and [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957&gt;{{cite journal

building on earlier research conducted there by Neal C. Gross and Bryce Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Neal C. (1942) ''The diffusion of a culture trait in two Iowa townships''. M.S. Thesis, Iowa State College, Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1943) “The diffusion of hybrid seed corn in two Iowa communities.” ''Rural Sociology'' 8: 15–24. RS(E)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1950) ''Acceptance and diffusion of hybrid corn seed in two Iowa communities''. Research Bulletin 372, Agricultural Experiment Station, Ames, Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt; Their original purpose was to track the purchase patterns of hybrid seed corn by farmers.

Beal, Rogers and Bohlen together developed a model called ''the diffusion process''&lt;ref&gt;Beal, George M., Everett M. Rogers, and Joe M. Bohlen (1957) "Validity of the concept of stages in the adoption process." ''Rural Sociology'' 22(2):166–168.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, Everett Rogers generalized the use of it in his widely acclaimed book 1962 ''[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of Innovations]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovations'', Glencoe: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (now in its fifth edition{{cn|date=November 2016}}), describing how new ideas and technologies spread in different cultures. Others have since used the model to describe how innovations spread between states in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Robert L. (1985).

'''''The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us''''' is a 1999 book about [[lesbian sexual practices]] by sex educator [[Felice Newman]].

== Overview ==
First published in 1999 by Cleis Press, ''The Whole Lesbian Sex Book'' was written to "offer information and encouragement for all women who desire women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-whole-lesbian-sex-book-felice-newman/1103671272|title=The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us {{!}} Barnes and Noble|last=|first=|date=|work=Cleis Press|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intended audience includes lesbians, bisexuals, butch, femme, androgynous, and transgenders. The second edition was published October 5th, 2004 with an additional chapter, new research, an expanded resource guide, and extra illustrations.

== Topics ==
Topics include the importance of communication in any sexual relationship, how to communicate about lesbian sex, exploring personal desires and fantasies, how masturbation improves sex, how to achieve the preferred orgasm, where to find sex partners, expert advice on various lesbian sex techniques, and a guide to picking sex toys.

== Controversy ==
Two teenage brothers from [[Bentonville, Arkansas]], found the book in a [[public library]] and told their father, Earl Adams. The father complained to the library's director, Bentonville's [[mayor]], and to a local [[newspaper]]. He threatened to sue the library if the book was not removed. The [[Fox News Channel]] picked up the story in April 2007, which gave it and the book national attention.&lt;ref name=Ficera&gt;{{cite news

The word '''Type''' followed by a number is a common way to name a weapon or product in a production series, similar in meaning to "[[Mark (designation)|Mark]]". "Type" was used extensively by the Japanese and Chinese militaries beginning in the 1920s, and is still in current use by the militaries of both nations. The United Kingdom uses a '''type number system''' for much of their military equipment. Many other nations use the word "Type" to designate products in a series.

==Japan==
The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) began using the Type-Number System in 1921 to designate aircraft accepted for production. The numbers used after the word "Type" were based on the number of years that the [[Emperor Taishō]] had reigned. Since his reign began in 1912, an aircraft ordered into production in 1921 would have been called "Type 10", the tenth year of the emperor's reign. At the end of 1926, the emperor died, leaving his son [[Hirohito]] as the Emperor Shōwa, and the numbering system was reset to mark the new emperor's reign.&lt;ref name=Peattie&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Zero Akagi Dec1941.jpg|thumb|The Mitsubishi [[A6M Zero]] was ordered into production in 1940 as the Type 0 Carrier Fighter.]]
In 1929, the government of Japan adopted a new system based on the [[Japanese_era_name#Imperial_year|imperial year]].&lt;ref name=Peattie/&gt; Aircraft ordered for production from 1929 onward were assigned the last two digits of the year marking the continuity of Japanese emperors. 1929 was the 2589th imperial year, so aircraft ordered that year were designated "Type 89". 1940 was the 2600th year, and the IJN numbering system was reset to single digits. New aircraft were designated [[0 (number)|0 (zero)]]. The well-known Mitsubishi [[A6M Zero]] was ordered into production in 1940 as the IJN "Type 0 Carrier Fighter" (''Rei shiki Kanjō sentōki'', 零式艦上戦闘機), and was popularly called the "Zero" because of its type.&lt;ref name=Peattie/&gt;

In 1943, the designation system was abandoned by the IJN as it was considered too revealing about the nature of the aircraft. In its place, the aircraft were named with popular terms such as ''Kyōfū'' (強風 "Strong Wind") for the [[Kawanishi N1K]] introduced in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred T. Jane|Jane, Frederick Thomas]]. ''Jane's all the world's aircraft, Volume 34'', p. 155c, Jane's Information Group, 1945&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) began using the Type designation system in 1927, for all weapons, vehicles, military equipment, subassemblies and subsystems such as engines and gunmounts. In 1940, instead of resetting to zero, the IJA assigned "Type 100" to equipment put into production that year. In 1941, the IJA reset to "Type 1". Unlike the IJN, the IJA continued to use the system through 1945 with the production of the [[Kawasaki Ki-100]] Army Type 5 Fighter.&lt;ref&gt;Rickard, J. (2008) History of War. [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_japanese_army_aircraft_designations.html ''Japanese Army Air Force Designations of the Second World War''.] Retrieved on December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945, Japan's military changed to a numbering system based on the Japanese fiscal year which begins on April 1 in the same manner as the British fiscal year. As an example, "Type 63" was the designation for equipment such as the [[Type 63 AT mine]] accepted in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1997, p. xl, "Prefatory Notes".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[kanji]] character ''shiki'' (式) is what the Japanese use to designate products in a series. The [[English language]] translation of ''shiki'' has been variously given as "model" or "type".&lt;ref name=Easterly&gt;Easterly, William M. P. (June 2009) [http://www.dragonsoffire.com/ARTICLE:--MODEL---TYPE.php ''Dragons of Fire'', "Model/Type"]. Retrieved on December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Some manuals and texts have translated ''shiki'' as both "model" and "type" within the same publication, confusing the matter. [[World War II]]-era military dictionaries do not give ''shiki'' as the Japanese word for "model"—instead, the kanji character ''kata'' is given. In turn, ''kata'' (型 or 形) is translated as "form", "type", "pattern", "mark", or "model". The only [[Japanese language]] translation given for the English word "type" is ''shiki''.&lt;ref name=Easterly/&gt;

==China==
Chinese weapons and military vehicles are often, but not always, designated according to the [[Gregorian calendar]], the one used by most nations. Two digits are used to designate the year. The two digits appear first, followed by the character ''shi'', meaning "type".&lt;ref&gt;Blasko, Dennis J. ''The Chinese Army today: tradition and transformation for the 21st century'', p. 122. Routledge, 2006. {{ISBN|0-415-77003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, in 1956, the [[Type 56 assault rifle]] was put into production, and the [[Type 64 pistol]] was designed and approved in 1964.

==United Kingdom==
The [[Royal Navy]] uses a type number system where blocks of numbers are reserved for specific purposes. For instance, the block 900–999 was given to naval radar sets beginning in 1945 and continuing for roughly 20 years. Numbers are not always sequential, as the Type 992 target indication radar was developed long before the Type 967 target designation radar. When a reserved block has been fully utilized, another is assigned.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, 1997, p. xli, "Prefatory Notes".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7751">The '''Department of Applied Science at the University of California, Davis''' was a cooperative academic program involving the [[University of California, Davis]] and the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL). It was established in the fall of 1963 by [[Edward Teller]], director of LLNL,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversial champion for defense, nuclear research Edward Teller dies|publisher=UC Davis Dateline|date=September 19, 2003|url=http://www-dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id=6668|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roy Bainer, then dean of the [[UC Davis College of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="Bookless1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

==History==
Teller's push for an educational institution associated with the LLNL was part of a general movement championed by [[Alvin M. Weinberg]] of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] to use the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories]] to educate scientists, since at the time the department employed roughly 10% of the scientists in the United States.&lt;ref name=westwick/&gt;  Teller first approached the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with his idea,&lt;ref name=state/&gt; but the faculty there opposed the idea because of the military focus of the program and the administration wasn't receptive. So he turned, reluctantly,&lt;ref name=memoir&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Teller|author2=Judith L. Shoolery|title=Memoirs: A Twentieth Century Journey in Science and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n82xMo-BI8QC&amp;pg=PA479|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=16 October 2002|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5170-9|pages=479–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; to UC Davis instead.  There Bainer and [[Emil M.

The lab at first shared the facilities at Lawrence Livermore, although the students conducted non-classified research.&lt;ref name=westwick&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Westwick|title=The National Labs: Science in an American System, 1947-1974|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpXQtHWGghcC&amp;pg=PA191|accessdate=10 January 2013|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-00948-6|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teller intended the DAS to educate advanced students in nuclear physics and other subjects applicable to defense industries.&lt;ref name=teller/&gt;  The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], which administered LLNL,  was worried about allowing DAS to use its facilities if foreign students would be enrolled.  To meet this objection Teller agreed to limit the number of foreign students attending and to require prospective students to undergo [[FBI]] background checks.&lt;ref name=westwick/&gt;

Teller, who had been director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory beginning in 1958, was named the first chairman of the Department of Applied Science.&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite book|author=Istvan Hargittai|title=Judging Edward Teller: A Closer Look at One of the Most Influential Scientists of the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XlkmmIHiS9UC&amp;pg=PT273|accessdate=11 January 2013|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=978-1-61614-269-8|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its main location, built in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;p_product=AWNB&amp;p_text_direct-0=document_id=%28%2013D8CA13EFC95A48%20%29&amp;p_docid=13D8CA13EFC95A48&amp;p_theme=aggdocs&amp;p_queryname=13D8CA13EFC95A48&amp;f_openurl=yes&amp;p_nbid=F60E56PUMTM1NzkxNjk1NS4yNzE3NDk6MToxMzoxOTIuMTYwLjIxNi4w&amp;&amp;p_multi=DVEB|publisher=Davis Enterprise|author=Derrick Bang|date=March 15, 2012|title=UCD College of Engineering celebrates 50 years|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was on the grounds of the LLNL in a building paid for with a matching grant of $1,000,000 from the [[Hertz Foundation]] and thus called Hertz Hall.&lt;ref name="Broad1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=William J Broad|title=Star Warriors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMmCmxmWSJYC&amp;pg=PA40|accessdate=11 January 2013|date=15 October 1986|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-62820-8|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Applied Science later became more centered at the UC Davis campus.  Many of the department's faculty had joint appointments with LLNL or other national laboratories, so that students in the department had access to facilities in both locations.

The UC Davis College of Engineering closed the Department of Applied Science in July 2011 for budgetary reasons after 48 years of operation.&lt;ref name = "closed"&gt;{{cite news|title=UCD department shuttered as more budget cuts loom|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/ucd/ucd-department-shuttered-as-more-budget-cuts-loom/|publisher=Davis Enterprise|date=July 2, 2011|author=Cory Golden|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Wilderness}}

'''Wildness''', in its literal sense, is the quality of being [[Wildlife|wild]] or [[Domestication|untamed]]. Beyond this, it has been defined as a quality produced in [[nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Thoreau 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; as that which emerges from a forest,&lt;ref&gt;Micoud 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a level of achievement in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been defined as "a quality of interactive processing between organism and nature where the realities of base natures are met, allowing the construction of durable systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cookson |first=L. J. |title=A definition for wildness |journal=Ecopsychology |year=2011 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=187–193 |doi=10.1089/eco.2011.0028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[wilderness]] is a place where wildness occurs.

== Cultural perceptions of wildness ==
People have explored the contrast of wildness versus tameness throughout recorded history. The earliest great work of literature, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], tells a story of a wild man [[Enkidu]] in opposition to [[Gilgamesh]] who personifies civilization. In the story, Enkidu is defeated by Gilgamesh and becomes civilized. Cultures vary in their perception of the separation of humans from nature, with [[western civilization]] drawing a sharp contrast between the two while the traditions of many [[indigenous peoples]] have always seen humans as part of nature. The perception of man's place in nature and civilization has also changed over time. In western civilization, for example, [[Darwinism]] and environmentalism have renewed the perception of humans as part of nature, rather than separate from it.
 
Wildness is often mentioned in the writings of naturalists, such as [[John Muir]] and [[David Brower]], where it is admired for its freshness and otherness. [[Henry David Thoreau]] wrote the famous phrase, “In wildness is the preservation of the world.” Some artists and photographers such as [[Eliot Porter]] explore wildness in the themes of their works. The benefits of reconnecting with nature by seeing the achievements of wildness is an area being investigated by [[ecopsychology]].

Attempts to identify the characteristics of wildness are varied. One consideration sees wildness as that part of nature which is not controllable by humans. Nature retains a measure of autonomy, or wildness, apart from human constructions (Evanoff, 2005). Another version of this theme is that wildness produces things that are natural, while humans produce things that are artificial (man-made). Ambiguities about the distinction between the natural and the artificial animate much of art, literature and philosophy. There is the perception that naturally produced items have a greater elegance over artificial things. Modern zoos seek to improve the health and vigour of animals by simulating natural settings, in a move away from stark man-made structures.

Another view of wildness is that it is a social construct (Callicott 1994), and that humans cannot be considered innately ‘unnatural’. As wildness is claimed to be a quality that builds from animals and ecosystems, it often fails to be considered within reductionist theories for nature.

Meanwhile, an [[Ecology|ecological]] perspective sees wildness as "(the degree of) subjection to [[natural selection]] pressures", many of which emerge independently from the [[biosphere]].  Thus [[modern civilization]] - contrasted with all [[human]]ity – can be seen as an 'unnatural' force (lacking wildness) as it strongly insulates its population from many natural selection mechanisms, including [[interspecific competition]] such as predation and disease, as well as some [[intraspecific]] phenomena.

== Wildness in animals ==

The importance of maintaining wildness in animals is recognized in the management of [[Wilderness areas]]. Feeding wild animals in national parks for example, is usually discouraged because the animals may lose the skills they need to fend for themselves. Human interventions may also upset continued [[natural selection]] pressures upon the population, producing a version of [[domestication]] within wildlife (Peterson et al. 2005).

Tameness implies a reduction in wildness, where animals become more easily handled by humans. Some animals are easier to tame than others, and are amenable to domestication.

===Rating scales for mouse wildness===
In a clinical setting, ''wildness'' has been used as a scale to rate the ease with which various strains of laboratory mice can be captured and handled ([http://phenome.jax.org/pub-cgi/phenome/mpdcgi?rtn=projects/doc&amp;sym=Wahlsten2&amp;doc=protocol Wahlsten et al. 2003]):
         
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!rowspan="2"| {{longitem|Wildness&lt;br/&gt;rating}}
!colspan="2"| Behavioral response

|-
! 4

|-
! 5

|-

|}

In this sense, "wildness" may be interpreted as "tendency to respond with anxiety to handling".  That there is no ''necessary'' connection between this factor and the state of wildness ''per se'', given that some animals in the wild may be handled with little or no cause of anxiety. However, this factor does clearly indicate an animal's resistance to being handled.

===Degrees of domestication===
{{main|Domestication}}
A [[Categorization|classification]] system can be set out showing the spectrum from wild to domesticated animal states:
* '''Wild''': These species experience their full life cycles without deliberate human intervention.
* '''Raised at [[zoo]]s or [[botanical garden]]s''' (captive): These species are nurtured and sometimes bred under human control, but remain as a group essentially indistinguishable in appearance or behaviour from their wild counterparts. (Zoos and botanical gardens sometimes exhibit domesticated or feral animals and plants such as [[camel]]s, [[Mustang (horse)|mustang]]s, and some [[orchids]].)
* '''Raised commercially''' (captive or semidomesticated): These species are [[ranch]]ed or [[farm]]ed in large numbers for food, commodities, or the pet trade, but as a group they are not substantially altered in appearance or behavior.  Examples include the [[elephant]], [[ostrich]], [[deer]], [[alligator]], [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], [[pearl]] [[oyster]], and [[ball python]]. (These species are sometimes referred to as ''partially domesticated''.)
* '''Domesticated''': These species or varieties are bred and raised under human control for many generations and are substantially altered as a group in appearance or behaviour. Examples include the [[domestic canary|canary]], [[pigeon]]s, the [[budgerigar]], the [[peach-faced lovebird]], [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[sheep]], [[cattle]], [[chicken]]s, [[llama]]s, [[guinea pig]]s and laboratory [[mouse|mice]].

This classification system does not account for several complicating factors: [[genetically modified]] organisms, [[feral]] populations, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]].  Many species that are farmed or ranched are now being genetically modified. This creates a unique category of them because it alters the organisms as a group but in ways unlike traditional domestication. Feral organisms are members of a population that was once raised under human control, but is now living and multiplying outside of human control.  Examples include [[Mustang (horse)|mustangs]].  Hybrids can be wild, domesticated, or both: a [[liger]] is a hybrid of two wild animals, a [[mule]] is a hybrid of two domesticated animals, and a [[beefalo]] is a cross between a wild and a domestic animal.

== Wildness in human psychology ==
{{main|Ecopsychology}}

The basic idea of ecopsychology is that while the human mind is shaped by the modern social world, it can be readily inspired and comforted by the wider natural world, because that is the arena in which it originally evolved. Mental health or unhealth cannot be understood in the narrow context of only intrapsychic phenomena or social relations. One also has to include the relationship of humans to other species and ecosystems. These relations have a deep evolutionary history; reach a natural affinity within the structure of their brains and they have deep psychic significance in the present time, in spite of urbanization. Humans are dependent on healthy nature not only for their physical sustenance, but for mental health, too.

== Wildness in political philosophy ==
{{main|State of nature}}

The concept of a state of nature was first posited by the 17th century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''. Hobbes described the concept in the Latin phrase ''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]'', meaning "the war of all against all." In this state any person has a [[natural right]] to do anything to preserve their own liberty or safety. Famously, he believed that such a condition would lead to a "war of every man against every man" and make life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

Hobbes's view was challenged in the eighteenth century by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who claimed that Hobbes was taking socialized persons and simply imagining them living outside of the society they were raised in. He affirmed instead that people were born neither good nor bad; men knew neither vice nor virtue since they had almost no dealings with each other. Their bad habits are the products of [[civilization]] specifically social hierarchies, [[property]], and markets. Another criticism put forth by [[Karl Marx]] is his concept of [[species-being]], or the unique potential of humans for dynamic, creative, and cooperative relations between each other. For Marx and others in his line of [[critical theory]], [[Social alienation|alienated]] and [[reification (Marxism)|abstracted]] social relations prevent the fulfillment of this potential (see [[anomie]]).

[[David Hume]]'s view brings together and challenges the theories of Rousseau and Hobbes. He posits that in the natural state we are born wicked and evil because of, for instance, the cry of the baby that demands attention. Like Rousseau, he believes that society shapes us, but that we are born evil and it is up to society to shape us into who we become.

[[Thoreau]] made many statements on wildness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

I wish to speak a word for Nature, for absolute Freedom and Wildness, as contrasted with a Freedom and Culture merely civil, — to regard man as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society.  — "Walking"

I long for wildness, a nature which I cannot put my foot through, woods where the wood thrush forever sings, where the hours are early morning ones, and there is dew on the grass, and the day is forever unproved, where I might have a fertile unknown for a soil about me.  — Journal, 22 June 1853

As I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my pole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight, and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was hungry then, except for that wildness which he represented.  — Walden

What we call wildness is a civilization other than our own.  — Journal, 16 February 1859

In Wildness is the preservation of the World.  — "Walking"

We need the tonic of wildness — to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hearing the booming of the snipe; to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close o the ground.  — Walden

It is in vain to dream of a wildness distant from ourselves. There is none such.  — Journal, 30 August 1856

The most alive is the wildest.  — "Walking"

Whatever has not come under the sway of man is wild. In this sense original and independent men are wild — not tamed and broken by society.  — Journal, 3 September 1851

Trench says a wild man is a willed man. Well, then, a man of will who does what he wills or wishes, a man of hope and of the future tense, for not only the obstinate is willed, but far more the constant and persevering. The obstinate man, properly speaking, is one who will not. The perseverance of the saints is positive willedness, not a mere passive willingness. The fates are wild, for they will; and the Almighty is wild above all, as fate is.  — Journal, 27 June 1853&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2184">'''William Zeitlin''' (c. 1850 – 1921, in [[Leipzig]]) was a Russian scholar and bibliographer born at [[Homel]], government (''[[guberniya]]'') of [[Moghilef]], about the middle of the 19th century. He is known especially as the author of ''Kiryat Sefer,'' or ''Bibliotheca Hebraica Post-Mendelssohniana'' (Leipzig, 1891–95), a bibliographical dictionary of modern [[Hebrew literature]] from the beginning of [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s epoch until 1890. The compilation of this work occupied Zeitlin for twenty years. He made extensive use of [[Benjacob]]'s ''Otzar ha-Sefarim'' and of [[Julius Fürst|Fürst]]'s ''Bibliotheca Judaica'', and visited [[Vilna]] and [[Warsaw]], the centers of the Hebrew book market, as well as many university cities—as [[Königsberg]], [[Berlin]], [[Geneva]], and [[Paris]]—from the libraries of which he gathered additional material for his work.

The ''Qiryat Sefer'' indexes not only works in book form, but also important periodical articles, biographical sketches, and scientific essays, in addition to giving biographical notes on several authors. Zeitlin had previously prepared an index of works written on the [[Hebrew calendar]], in which he enumerates seventy-seven Hebrew works; this index was published by [[Chayyim Jonah Gurland]] in ''Yevreiski Kalendar'' (St. Petersburg, 1882). In the ''Zeit. für Hebr. Bibl.'' (ix.3-4) Zeitlin has published an alphabetical list of anagrams and pseudonyms of modern Hebrew writers; he was also a contributor to several Hebrew periodicals, writing mostly biographical articles.

'''Women in music''' describes the role of women as [[composer]]s, [[songwriter]]s, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], [[singer]]s, [[Conducting|conductors]], [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critic]]s/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements (e.g., [[women's music]], which is music written and performed by women for women), events and genres related to [[Woman|women]], [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women constitute a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and [[classical music]] singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being [[singer-songwriter]]s), there are few women [[record producer]]s, [[music journalist|rock critic]]s and rock instrumentalists. Notable women artists in pop, such as [[Bjork]] and [[Lady Gaga]] have commented about [[sexism]] and [[gender discrimination]] in the [[music industry]].&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics|title=The World Needs Female Rock Critics|first=Anwen|last=Crawford|date=26 May 2015|accessdate=7 April 2018|website=Newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people.com"&gt;{{cite web|first = Karen |last = Mizoguchi|title = Lady Gaga Calls Music Industry a 'F---king Boys Club' |work = People|date = 12 December 2015|url =  http://www.people.com/article/lady-gaga-music-industry-boys-club-billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a recent study led by Dr. Smith announced that "...over the last six years, the representation of women in the music industry has been even lower".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/arts/music/music-industry-gender-study-women-artists-producers.html|title=Gender Diversity in the Music Industry?

Women constitute a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Julian|last1=  Schaap |first2= Pauwke |last2 =Berkers|title = Grunting Alone?

While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap|title=CBC Music|website=music.cbc.ca|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|conductor of an orchestra]],&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jessica|last=Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a profession which has been called "one of the last [[glass ceiling]]s in the [[music industry]]".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;  In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[music producer]]s, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One of the most recorded artists is a woman, [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer who is best known as a [[playback singer]] in Hindi cinema.&lt;ref name="indiatoday.intoday.in"/&gt;

==Songwriters==

Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women... were primarily seen as consumers:... Singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument, writing songs, or producing records simply wasn't done...

A songwriter is an individual who writes the [[lyrics]], [[melody|melodies]] and [[chord progression]]s for songs, typically for a [[popular music]] genre such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]] or [[country music]]. A songwriter can also be called a [[composer]], although the latter term tends to be mainly used for individuals from the classical music genre.

===19th century-early 20th century===
"Only a few of the many women [songwriters] in America had their music published and heard during the late 19th and early 20th centuries."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; According to Richard A. Reublin and Richard G. Beil, the "lack of mention of women [songwriters] is a glaring and embarrassing omission in our musical heritage."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Women "struggled to write and publish music in the man's world of 20th century [[Tin Pan Alley]]. Prior to 1900 and even after, it was expected that "women would perform music, not make music."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; In 1880, Chicago music critic George P. Upton wrote the book ''Women In Music'', in which he argued that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to the "biological predisposition" of women.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; As part of women's role in music education, women wrote hymns and children's music. The "secular music in print in America before 1825 shows only about 70 works by women." In the mid 19th century, notable women songwriters emerged, including [[Faustina Hasse Hodges]], Susan Parkhurst, [[Augusta Browne]] and [[Marion Dix Sullivan]]. By 1900, there were many more women songwriters, but "many were still forced to use pseudonyms or initials" to hide the fact that they were women.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt;

[[Carrie Jacobs-Bond]] was the "preeminent woman composer of the late 1800's and well into the middle of the twentieth century... [making her] the first million selling woman" songwriter.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Maude Nugent (1877–1958) wrote "Sweet Rosie O'Grady" in 1896. She also penned "Down At Rosie Reilly's Flat", "My Irish Daisy" and "Mary From Tipperary".&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; Charlotte Blake (1885–1979) was a staff writer for at the Whitney Warner Publishing Co., in Detroit, Michigan. Initially, the company billed her as "C. Blake" to hide her gender, but by 1906 ads used her full name.&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; [[Caro Roma]] (1866–1937) was the gender-ambiguous pseudonym for [[Carrie Northly]]. She was "one of America's more well known and popular composers of the Tin Pan Alley era." Her songs include "Can't Yo' Heah Me Calling", "Faded Rose", "The Angelus", "Thinking of Thee" and "Resignation".&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; About 95% of the songwriters in British [[music hall]] during the early 1900s were men; however, about 30% of the singers were women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Mullen.

===Jazz in the 20th century===
[[File:Lil Armstrong Billboard.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] (1898-1971) was a notable jazz songwriter.]]
While [[jazz]] songwriting has long been a male-dominated field, there have been a few notable [[Women in Jazz|women jazz songwriters]]. In the 1930s, [[Ann Ronell]] (1905–1993) wrote several hit songs. She is known for her 1932 hit song "[[Willow Weep for Me]]" and the 1933 Disney song "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?".&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"/&gt; [[Irene Higginbotham]] (1918–1988) wrote almost 50 songs, her best-known being "Good Morning Heartache".&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2013/03/jazz-women-songwriters-gioia/|title=Five women songwriters who helped shape the sound of jazz |website= OUPblog|date=12 March 2013|first = Ted|last = Gioia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Fields]] (1905–1974) wrote the lyrics for over 400 songs, some of which were played by [[Duke Ellington]]. She co-wrote "[[The Way You Look Tonight]]" with [[Jerome Kern]], which won the 1936 Oscar for Best Song. She co-wrote several jazz standards with [[Jimmy McHugh]], such as "[[Exactly Like You (song)|Exactly Like You]]," "[[On the Sunny Side of the Street]]" and "[[I Can't Give You Anything but Love]]."&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"/&gt; [[Lil Hardin Armstrong]] (1898–1971) played piano in [[King Oliver]]'s Creole Jazz Band. Her most famous song, "Struttin' with Some Barbecue" has been recorded 500 times. Her other notable songs are "Doin' the Suzie Q," "Just for a Thrill" and "Bad Boy".&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"/&gt; While [[Billie Holiday]] (1915–1959) is best known as a singer, she co-wrote "[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]" and "[[Don't Explain (song)|Don't Explain]]" with [[Arthur Herzog, Jr.]] and she penned the blues song "[[Fine and Mellow (song)|Fine and Mellow]]."&lt;ref name="blog.oup.com"/&gt;

===Pop in the 1960s===

[[Laura Nyro]] penned "[[Wedding Bell Blues]]", "Eli's Coming"  and "[[And When I Die]]". She stated "I'm not interested in conventional limitations when it comes to my songwriting….I may bring a certain [[feminist]] perspective to my songwriting."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

===New wave of female singer-songwriters===
By the late 1960s a new wave of female singer-songwriters broke from the confines of pop, using the urban landscape as their canvass for lyrics in the confessional style of poets like Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath.  These pioneering women, appeared in a feature in [[Newsweek]], July, 1969, "The Girls: Letting Go": "What is common to them – to [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Lotti Golden]], to [[Laura Nyro]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[Janis Ian]] and to Elyse Weinberg, are the personalised songs they write, like voyages of self-discovery. [[Grace Slick]] a former model, was widely known in rock and roll history for her role in San Francisco's burgeoning psychedelic music scene in the mid–1960s." In ''[[The Guardian]]'', 26 January 2017, author Laura Barton describes the radical shift in subject matter — politics, drugs, disappointment, the isolation of the itinerant performer, and urban life.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/26/from-joni-mitchell-to-laura-marling-how-female-troubadours-changed-music|title=From Joni Mitchell to Laura Marling: how female troubadours changed music|first=Laura|last=Barton|date=26 January 2017|website=the Guardian|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native New Yorker, [[Lotti Golden]], in her Atlantic debut album ''[[Motor-Cycle (album)|Motor-Cycle]]'', chronicled her life in NYC's East Village in the late '60s counterculture, visiting subjects such as gender identity (The Space Queens-Silky is Sad) and excessive drug use (Gonna Fay's). The women in the 1969 Newsweek article ushered in a new age of the singer-songwriter, informing generations of women singer-songwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=2664&amp;from=search |via= JoniMitchell.com Library|title= THE GIRLS—LETTING GO|work= Newsweek|date= 14 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Musical theatre===
In [[musical theatre]], "female songwriters are rare in an industry dominated by males on the creative end.

===Black women===
According to [[LaShonda Katrice Barnett]], a college and university teacher and author of a book on black women songwriters, of the "over 380 members of the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], just 2 are black women ([[Sylvia Moy]] and [[Valerie Simpson]])". Barnett asks "[w]hy are there so few prominent black women songwriters?"&lt;ref name="songfacts.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/writing/black_women_songwriters/ |title=Black Women Songwriters |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett states that two important black women songwriters are [[Abbey Lincoln]], a rare example of a jazz singer who wrote her own albums and [[Cassandra Wilson]], who records both her own songs and "covers" of famous artists.&lt;ref name="songfacts.com"/&gt;

==Composers==
[[File:Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren.jpg|thumb|right|upright|220px|Nineteenth-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]]]]
{{See also|List of female composers by birth date}}
American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard  'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

According to Abbey Philips, "women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve".&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Abbey|last = Philips |url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992 |title=Spacebomb: Truth lies somewhere in between |publisher=Rvanews.com |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Medieval eras, most of the art music was created for liturgical (religious) purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders, few women composed this type of music, with the nun [[Hildegard von Bingen]] being among the exceptions. Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers. As well, very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music. In the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is the only woman composer who is mentioned.&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"/&gt; Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts".&lt;ref name="rvanews.com"/&gt;

===Medieval era===
{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|description=From ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]''|format=[[Ogg]]}}
[[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098–1179) was a German [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]], composer, writer, philosopher, and [[visionary]].&lt;ref name="Bennett, Judith M 2001"&gt;Bennett, Judith M. and Hollister, Warren C. ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; One of her works as a composer, the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'', is an early example of liturgical drama and an early [[morality play]].  Some writers have speculated a distant origin for opera in this piece, though without any evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/opera.html alt Opera, see Florentine Camerata in the province of Milan, Italy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kitbraz.com/gen/rev/1998nytmirapaulHild.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive. This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers. Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum.'' The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.&lt;ref&gt;Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Her music is described as [[monophony|monophonic]], using soaring melodies that pushed the boundaries of the more traditional [[Gregorian chant]].

===Renaissance era===
[[Maddalena Casulana]] (1544–1590) was an Italian composer, [[lute]]nist and singer.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative names: Madalena Casulana di Mezarii, Madalena Casula.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first work dates from 1566: four madrigals in a collection, ''Il Desiderio'', which she produced in [[Florence]]. Two years later she published in [[Venice]] her first book of madrigals for four voices, ''Il primo libro di madrigali'', which is the first printed, published work by a woman in Western music history.&lt;ref name="Bridges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000005155|title=Casulana [Mezari], Maddalena - Grove Music|website=Oxfordmusicinline.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was close to [[Isabella de' Medici]] and dedicated some of her music to her. In 1570, 1583 and 1586 she published other books of madrigals. In the dedication to her first book of madrigals, she shows her feelings about being a female composer at a time when this was rare: "[I] want to show the world, as much as I can in this profession of music, the vain error of men that they alone possess the gifts of intellect and artistry, and that such gifts are never given to women." 
Her style is [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] and [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] and her melodic lines are singable and attentive to the text. Other composers of the time, such as [[Philippe de Monte]], thought highly of her.

[[Caterina Assandra]] (1590–1618) was an Italian composer and [[Benedictine]] [[nun]]. She became famous as an organist and published various works.&lt;ref&gt;''Women Composers: Music Through the Ages.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid# |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165459/http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/midi/mid/assand2.mid# |archive-date=3 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assandra composed a number of [[motet]]s and organ pieces. She studied [[counterpoint]] with Benedetto Re, one of the leading teachers at [[Pavia Cathedral]]. She composed a collection of [[motet]]s in the new [[concertato]] style in [[Milan]] in 1609, an imitative eight-voice ''[[Salve Regina]]'' in 1611, and a [[motet]], ''Audite verbum Dominum,'' for four voices in 1618. She composed traditional pieces and more innovative works. Among the latter is ''Duo seraphim.'' Her motet ''O Salutaris hodie,'' included in ''Motetti'' op. 2, was one of the first pieces to include the [[violone]], a bowed stringed instrument.

===Baroque era===
[[File:Orazio Gentileschi - Il suonatore di liuto (National Gallery of Art).jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Lute Player'' by [[Orazio Gentileschi]], presumed to be a portrait of Francesca Caccini]]
[[Francesca Caccini]] (1587–1641) was an Italian composer, singer, [[lute]]nist, poet, and music teacher. Her singing for the wedding of [[Henry IV of France]] and [[Maria de Medici]] in 1600 was praised by Henry, who called her the "best singer in all of France". She worked in the [[Medici]] court as a teacher, chamber singer, rehearsal coach and composer of both chamber and stage music until 1627. By 1614 she was the court's most highly paid musician, because her musical [[virtuosity]] so well exemplified an idea of female excellence projected by Tuscany's de facto Regent, Granduchess [[Christina of Lorraine]]. Most of her stage music was composed for performance in comedies. In 1618 she published a collection of thirty-six solo songs and soprano/bass duets. In 1625 she composed a 75-minute "comedy-ballet". In all, she wrote sixteen staged works. She was a master of dramatic harmonic surprise: in her music it is harmony changes, more than counterpoint, that most powerfully communicates emotional affect.

[[Barbara Strozzi]] (1619–1677) was an Italian [[Baroque]] composer and singer. As a child, her considerable vocal talents were displayed to a wide audience. She was also compositionally gifted, and her father arranged for her to study with composer [[Francesco Cavalli]]. Strozzi was said to be "the most prolific composer – man or woman – of printed secular vocal music in Venice in the Middle of the century".{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=135}} Her output is also unique in that it only contains secular vocal music, with the exception of one volume of sacred songs.{{sfn|Heller|2006}} She was renowned for her poetic ability as well as her compositional talent. Her lyrics were often poetic and well-articulated.{{sfn|Glixon|1999|p=138}} Nearly three-quarters of her printed works were written for [[soprano]], but she also published works for other voices.{{sfn|Kendrick|2002}} Her compositions are firmly rooted in the ''[[seconda pratica]]'' tradition. Strozzi's music evokes the spirit of [[Francesco Cavalli|Cavalli]], heir of [[Monteverdi]].  However, her style is more lyrical, and more dependent on sheer vocal sound.{{sfn|Rosand|1986|p=170}} Many of the texts for her early pieces were written by her father Giulio. Later texts were written by her father's colleagues, and for many compositions she may have written her own texts.

[[Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre]] (1665–1729) was a French composer, musician and [[harpsichordist]]. She was born into a family of musicians and master instrument-makers. A child prodigy, she performed on the [[harpsichord]] before King [[Louis XIV]]. She became a musician in the Royal Court and taught, composed, and gave concerts at home and throughout Paris, to great acclaim.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;[[Catherine Cessac]]. "Jacquet de La Guerre, Elisabeth." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 9 March 2015. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/14084].&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of the few well-known female composers of her time, and unlike many of her contemporaries, she composed in a wide variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Cyr. "Elisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre: Myth or Marvel? Seeking the Composer's Individuality." The Musical Times. Vol. 149, No. 1905 (Winter, 2008), pp. 79–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her talent and achievements were acknowledged by [[Titon du Tillet]], who accorded her a place on his ''Mount Parnassus'' when she was only 26 years old, next to Lalande and Marais and directly below Lully. Her works include a ballet, an opera (''[[Céphale et Procris (Jacquet de la Guerre)|Céphale et Procris]]''), [[trio sonata]]s, harpsichord pieces, ''Sonates pour le viollon et pour le clavecin'' and vocal works such as her ''[[Cantates]] françoises sur des sujets tirez de l'Ecriture''.

[[Harriett Abrams]] (1758–1821) was an English composer and [[soprano]]. As a singer, she was praised for her performances of [[George Frideric Handel]]. She studied singing, [[music theory]], and [[Musical composition|composition]] with composer [[Thomas Arne]] before making her opera début in 1775 at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in London. Abrams became a principal singer at the fashionable London concerts and provincial festivals, appearing regularly from 1780–1790. Abrams composed several songs, two of which, "The Orphan's Prayer" and "Crazy Jane", became popular. She published two sets of Italian and English [[canzonet]]s, a collection of Scottish songs and glees harmonized for two and three voices, and more than a dozen songs, mainly sentimental [[ballad]]s. A collection of songs published in 1803 was dedicated by Harriett to [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]].&lt;ref name="Grove1"&gt;Olive Baldwin, Thelma Wilson: "Harriett Abrams", ''Grove Music Online'' ed.

[[Maria Teresa Agnesi]] (1720–1795) was an Italian composer.  Though she was most famous for her compositions, she was also an accomplished [[harpsichordist]] and singer. The majority of her surviving compositions were written for keyboard, the voice, or both. Her career was made possible by the Austrian Lombardy, which was progressive and enlightened in [[women's rights]]. Her patron was [[Maria Theresia]], holy Roman Empress and sovereign of Lombardy, and [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis]], a gifted composer and contemporary. Her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic. She composed operas, including heroic drama and serious drama styles. She also wrote arias, concertos and sonatas for keyboard, small ensemble and voice.

[[Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia|Princess Anna Amalia]] (1723–1787) was a Prussian composer and score curator. She learned to play the harpsichord, flute, and violin as a young woman. She became the Abbess of Quedlinburg in 1755.&lt;ref name="huberty"&gt;{{cite book | title=L'Allemagne Dynastique, Tome V -- Hohenzollern-Waldeck | publisher=Laballery |author1=Huberty, Michel |author2=Giraud, Alain |author3=Magdelaine, F. and B. | year=1989 | location=France | pages=162, 172| isbn=2-901138-05-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent most of her time in Berlin, where she devoted herself to music, and became a musical patron and composer. As a composer she achieved a modest amount of fame and is most known for her smaller chamber works, which included trios, marches, cantatas, songs and fugues. In 1758, she studied musical theory and composition with [[Johann Kirnberger|Johann Philipp Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. She composed chamber music such as flute sonatas. More, she set the text of Ramler's [[Passion cantata]] ''Der Tod Jesu'' ("The Death of Jesus") to music. She was also a collector of music, preserving over 600 volumes of works by Johann Sebastian Bach, [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Karl Heinrich Graun]] and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], among others. Her works of [[curator|curation]] are a significant contribution to [[Western culture]].

She debuted as Alfhild in ''Syrinx'' referred to as Sweden's first native [[Opéra comique|Opera comique]], at ''[[Bollhuset]]'' in 1747. She became a famed vocalist in the regular public concerts at ''[[Riddarhuset]]'' in [[Stockholm]], and published her own compositions; she was one of the Swedish composers who wrote one composition each for the collection ''Gustaviade.

She was a native speaker of both Italian and German and knew French and English.&lt;ref&gt;Godt, 541&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, she played for the Imperial court, where she "attracted attention with her beautiful voice and her keyboard playing".&lt;ref&gt;Wessely, [[New Grove]], "Marianne von Martinez", online edition cited below&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult, she was frequently asked to perform before the Empress [[Maria Theresa]].&lt;ref&gt;Godt 1995, 538&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the works that Marianna composed are set for solo voice. She wrote a number of secular cantatas and two oratorios to Italian texts. Surviving compositions include four [[mass]]es, six [[motet]]s, and three litanies for choir. She wrote in the Italian style, as was typical for the early [[classical music era|Classical]] period in Vienna.  Her harpsichord performance practice was compared to the style of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]]. Her Italian oratorio ''Isacco figura del redentore'' was premiered by massive forces in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;Pohl (1856:60)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maria Szymanowska]] (1789–1831) was a well-known Polish composer and pianist. She wrote in many of the same genres as fellow Pole [[Frederic Chopin]] (1810–1849). Szymanowska maintained connections with several famous nineteenth-century people, including [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], and [[Adam Mickiewicz]], Poland's greatest poet.

[[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805–1847) was one of the best-known women composers of the 1800s. She showed prodigious musical ability as a child and began to write music. Even though famous visitors to her family home were equally impressed by Fanny and her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], Fanny was limited by prevailing attitudes of the time toward women. Her father was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. Her father wrote to her in 1820, telling her that "[m]usic will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament [in your life]".&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I 82&lt;/ref&gt; Felix cautioned her against publishing her works under her own name and seeking a career in music. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for [musical] authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it'.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy,24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113
&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Clara Schumann]] (1819–1896) was a German composer and concert pianist who had a 61-year concert career, which changed the format and repertoire of the piano recital and the tastes of the listening public. From an early age, she had a one-hour lesson in piano, violin, singing, theory, harmony, composition, and counterpoint. In 1830, at the age of eleven, she had become a virtuoso soloist and she left on a concert tour of European cities. In the late 1830s, she performed to sell-out crowds and laudatory critical reviews. [[Frédéric Chopin]] described her playing to [[Franz Liszt]], who came to hear one of her concerts and subsequently "praised her extravagantly" in a letter that was published in the Parisian ''Revue et Gazette Musicale''.&lt;ref name="Nancya250"&gt;Reich (1986), 250.&lt;/ref&gt; She was named a ''Königliche und Kaiserliche Kammervirtuosin'' ("Royal and Imperial Chamber Virtuoso"), [[Austria]]'s highest musical honor.&lt;ref name="Nancya250" /&gt;

She was also instrumental in changing the kind of programs expected of concert pianists. In her early career, before her marriage to [[Robert Schumann]], she played what was then customary, mainly bravura pieces designed to showcase the artist's technique, often in the form of arrangements or variations on popular themes from operas, written by virtuosos such as Thalberg, Herz, or Henselt. As it was also customary to play one's own compositions, she included at least one of her own works in every program, works such as her Variations on a Theme by Bellini (Op. 8) and her popular Scherzo (Op. 10). Her works include songs, piano pieces, a piano concerto, a [[piano trio]], choral pieces, and three Romances for violin and piano. &lt;!--Her husband however remarked that she did not have the opportunity to do this often, as a result of being a wife and a mother:

{{quote|'Clara has composed a series of small pieces, which show a musical and tender ingenuity such as she has never attained before. But to have children, and a husband who is always living in the realm of imagination, does not go together with composing. She cannot work at it regularly, and I am often disturbed to think how many profound ideas are lost because she cannot work them out'.}}{{cn|date=February 2018}}--&gt;

[[Katherine Hoover]] (born 1937) studied music at the University of Rochester and the Eastman School of Music, where she earned a Performance Certificate in Flute and a Bachelor's of Music in Music Theory in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tu|first1=Mary-Ann|title=About Katherine|url=http://www.katherinehoover.com/KatherineHoover/about_Katherine.html|website=Katherine Hoover|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started publishing professional works in 1965, with her ''Duet for Two Violins''. Hoover was the winner of the National Flute Association's Newly Published Music Competition twice, first in 1987 with her piece ''Medieval Suite'' and second in 1991 with her piece ''Kokopelli'' for solo flute. These pieces utilize many extended techniques for flute, such as pitch bending.

From 1985-1988 Tower was the composer-in-residence at the St. Louis Symphony. In 1990 she was the first woman to win the Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition, which included a prize of $150,000. Since then, Tower has been the composer-in-residence at numerous music festivals, including the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival and Tanglewood Contemporary Music Festival. Tower has been a professor of music at Bard College in New York since 1982 and is considered one of the most influential women composers of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Gray 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Anne K.|title=The World of Women in Classical Music|date=2007|publisher=WordWorld|location=La Jolla, California|isbn=978-1-59975-320-1|pages=278–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellen Taaffe Zwilich]] (born 1939) received her Doctorate in Composition from [[Juilliard]] and was the first woman to ever achieve this. The same year, she won a gold medal at the International Composition Competition in Italy. In 1983 Zwilich made history again, becoming the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in music for her ''Symphony No. 1.'' Since this success, she has received many commissions. Her piece ''Millennium'' has been performed by twenty-seven orchestras since its premiere in 2000. She has been the Francis Eppes Professor of Music at Florida State University since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Anne K.|title=The World of Women in Classical Music|date=2007|publisher=WordWorld|location=La Jolla, California|isbn=978-1-59975-320-1|pages=288–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwilich is known to have an 'eclectic millennial voice' in her compositions, utilizing a clear design and rich timbres. Though her music was originally very dissonant and influenced by the Second Viennese School, her style became more emotional after the death of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Von Glahn|first1=Denise|title=Music and the Skillful Listener|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|pages=179|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/|accessdate=4 May 2017|format=eBook|chapter=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music===

====Individuals and bandleaders====
[[File:Suzi Quatro plays a bass guitar while she sings at AIS Arena.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Suzi Quatro]] is a singer, bassist and bandleader. When she launched her career in 1973, she was one of the few prominent women instrumentalists and bandleaders.]]

Women have a high prominence in many [[popular music]] styles as singers. However, professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in popular music, especially in rock genres such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. "[P]laying in a band is largely a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is largely a peer-based... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 101-102&lt;/ref&gt; As well, rock music "is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis-à-vis female bedroom culture."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 102"&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, there has been a gendered "distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation" in music.&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 102"/&gt; "[S]everal scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands' rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; "Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick, prefabricated – hence, inferior – pop music..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/&gt; One of the reasons that there are rarely mixed gender bands is that "bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidarity – social bonds between people of the same sex... – plays a crucial role."&lt;ref name="Pauwke Berkers 2014 p. 104"/&gt; In the 1960s pop music scene, "[s]inging was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument...simply wasn't done."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women—often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens—in rock usually sang songs as personæ utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends...". Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".&lt;ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man"&gt;{{cite journal

====All-female bands and girl groups====
An [[all-female band]] is a musical group in [[popular music]] genres such as rock, [[blues]], [[jazz]] and related genres which is exclusively composed of [[female musician]]s. This is distinct from a [[girl group]], in which the female members are solely vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalists [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as a "girl band" in [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud ''OK'' magazine] and the [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor ''Guardian''], while [[Girlschool]] are termed a "girl group" at the [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio ''imdb''] and [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 ''Belfast Telegraph''].&lt;/ref&gt; While all-male bands are common in many rock and pop bands, all-female bands are less common.

A [[girl group]] is a music act featuring several female singers who generally [[vocal harmony|harmonize]] together. The term "girl group" is also used in a narrower sense within English-speaking countries to denote the wave of American female [[pop music]] singing groups which flourished in the late [[1950s in music|1950s]] and early [[1960s in music|1960s]] between the [[Rock and roll#decline|decline of early rock and roll]] and the [[British Invasion]], many of whom were influenced by [[doo-wop]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutledge |first=Meredith E. |url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6655_the-fabulous-girl-groups-women-who-rock/ |title=The Fabulous Girl Groups &amp;#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history-of-rock.com/g_g-history.htm |title=Girl Groups - A Short History |publisher=History-of-rock.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; All-female bands are sometimes also called girl groups.&lt;ref&gt;For example, vocalist groups [[Sugababes]] and [[Girls Aloud]] are referred to as "girl bands" [http://www.ok.co.uk/fashion/view/8555/Meet-the-duo-dressing-Girls-Aloud Meet the duo dressing Girls Aloud] ''OK'' magazine, 20 March 2009; [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/09/girlsaloud-thexfactor The nation's new sweetheart] ''The Observer'', 9 November 2008; while instrumentalists [[Girlschool]] are termed a "[[girl group]]" [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320918/bio Biography for Girlschool] Internet Movie Database; [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/reviews/the-hedrons-13401497.html?startindex=-1 The Hedrons] ''Belfast Telegraph'', 19 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====1930s-1960s====
In the [[Jazz Age]] and during the 1930s, all-female bands such as The Blue Belles, the Parisian Redheads (later the Bricktops), Lil-Hardin's All-Girl Band, [[The Ingenues]], The Harlem Playgirls, Phil Spitalny's Musical Sweethearts and "Helen Lewis and Her All-Girl Jazz Syncopators" were popular.[[Ina Ray Hutton]] led an all-girl band, the [[Melodears]], from 1934 to 1939.  Eunice Westmoreland, under the name [[Rita Rio]], led an all-female band appearing on [[NBC Radio]] and for [[Vitaphone]] and [[RKO]]. A Polish group [[Filipinki]] was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://szczecin.gazeta.pl/szczecin/1,34959,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html?as=2 |title=Wyborcza.pl |publisher=Szczecin.gazeta.pl |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2016-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217153333/http://szczecin.gazeta.pl/szczecin/1,34959,14873014,Filipinki__W_USA_przecieraly_szlaki__w_ZSRR_czerwone.html?as=2# |archive-date=17 December 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups composed solely of women began to emerge with the advent of [[rock and roll]]. Among the earliest all-female rock bands to be signed to a record label were [[Goldie &amp; the Gingerbreads]], to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1964, [[The Pleasure Seekers/Cradle|The Pleasure Seekers]] with [[Suzi Quatro]] to Hideout Records in 1964 and [[Mercury Records]] in 1968, [[The Feminine Complex]] to Athena Records in 1968, and [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] (who pioneered the all-female band sound in the early to mid-1970s) in 1969 when [[Mo Ostin]] signed them to [[Warner Bros. Records]].  There were also others, such as [[The Liverbirds]] (1962–1967), [[the Ace of Cups]] (1967), [[The Heart Beats]] (1968), and Ariel (1968–1970).

====1970s-1980s====
In 1971 [[Fanny (band)|Fanny]] became the first all-female band to reach the Hot 100's top 40, with "Charity Ball" peaking at No. 40. In 1975, the Canadian duo of sisters, [[Kate and Anna McGarrigle]], recorded the first of a string of albums. [[The Runaways]] were an early commercially successful, hard-edged, all-female hard rock band, releasing their first album in 1976: band members [[Joan Jett]], [[Cherie Currie]] and [[Lita Ford]] all went on to solo careers. The 1980s, for the first time, saw long-sought chart success from all-female bands and female-fronted rock bands.  On the Billboard Hot 100-year-end chart for 1982&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&amp;g=Year-end+Singles&amp;year=1982 "The Billboard Hot 100 1982"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Retrieved 30 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Jett]]'s ''[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]'' at No. 3 and [[the Go-Go's]] ''[[We Got the Beat]]'' at No. 25 sent a message out to many industry heads that females who could play could bring in money.

In the United Kingdom, the advent of [[Punk rock|punk]] in the late 1970s with its "anyone can do it" ethos led to women making significant contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coon|first1=Caroline|title=1988: The New Wave Punk Rock Explosion|date=1977|publisher=Omnibus/Hawthorne Books|location=London|isbn=978-0801561290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Judy|title=15 Essential Women Punk Rock Icons|url=http://flavorwire.com/199630/15-essential-women-punk-icons|website=Flavorwire|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] scenes of the 1970s, which were dominated by men, the anarchic, counter-cultural mindset of the punk scene in mid- and late 1970s encouraged women to participate. "That was the beauty of the punk thing," [[Chrissie Hynde]] later said."

Rock historian Helen Reddington states that the popular image of young punk women musicians as focused on the fashion aspects of the scene (fishnet stockings, spiky blond hair, etc.) was stereotypical. She states that many, if not most women punks were more interested in the ideology and socio-political implications, rather than the fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music: Female Musicians of the Punk Era|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate/Equinox Publishing|isbn=978-1845539573|url=http://www.ashgate.com/default.aspx?page=637&amp;calcTitle=1&amp;isbn=9780754657736&amp;lang=cy-GB|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woronzoff|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Lost Women of Rock Music' Is an Important Work, But a Replay of the Same Old Themes|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/161962-the-lost-women-of-rock-music...-by-helen-reddington/|website=Pop Matters|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music historian Caroline Coon contends that before punk, women in rock music were virtually invisible; in contrast, in punk, she argues "[i]t would be possible to write the whole history of punk music without mentioning any male bands at all -- and I think a lot of [people] would find that very surprising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conference proceedings (September 2001)|title=No Future?|accessdate=26 November 2015|publisher=University of Wolverhampton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reddington|first1=Helen|title=Introduction: The Lost Women of Rock Music|date=1977|publisher=Ashgate|location=London|isbn=9780754657736|url=http://www.ashgate.com/pdf/SamplePages/Lost_Women_of_Rock_Music_Intro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Rotten]] wrote that "During the Pistols era, women were out there playing with the men, taking us on in equal terms ...

Others take issue with the notion of equal recognition, such as guitarist [[Viv Albertine]], who stated that "the A&amp;R men, the bouncers, the sound mixers, no one took us seriously..

=====Heavy metal=====
[[File:Girlschool live 2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Girlschool]] is a British all-women [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] scene in 1978 and frequently associated with contemporaries [[Motörhead]].

The all-female [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Girlschool]], from South London, formed in 1978 out of the ashes of Painted Lady. While somewhat successful in the UK, they became better known in the early 1980s. One of the original members of the band, [[Kathy Valentine]] departed to join the all-female band [[The Go-Go's]], switching from guitar to bass. Among Girlschool's early recordings was an EP titled "The St. Valentines Day Massacre" which they recorded with Bronze label-mates [[Motörhead]] under the name [[Headgirl]]. In 1974, The Deadly Nightshade, a rock/country band, was signed by Phantom. Women in the heavy metal genre tend to have to limit themselves due to the genre being very male orientated.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, R.L. (2016). 'Power has a penis': Cost reduction, social exchange and sexism in metal--reviewing the work of Sonia Vasan. Metal music studies, 2(3), 263-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Grunge=====
While there is a perception that the groups in the 1980s and 1990s [[alternative rock]] genre of [[grunge]] were "overwhelmingly male" (e.g., [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]), "[w]omen were totally represented" in grunge bands such as [[L7 (band)|L7]], [[Lunachicks]], [[Dickless]], STP, [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Courtney Love]]'s group [[Hole (band)|Hole]] and [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]], the latter an "[[All female band|all-female Minneapolis band]]", and grunge was "inextricably linked with [[Riot Grrrl]]", an underground [[feminist]] [[punk rock|punk]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/24/grunge-myths-nirvana-kurt-cobain|title=Ten myths about grunge, Nirvana and Kurt Cobain |last=True |first=Everett |date= 24 August 2011|publisher=The Guardian |access-date=29 January 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable women instrumentalists include the bassists [[D'arcy Wretzky]] and [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] from [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] and drummers [[Patty Schemel]] ([[Hole (band)|Hole]] and Courtney Love projects) and [[Lori Barbero]] of [[Babes in Toyland (band)|Babes in Toyland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://90srock.about.com/od/top-picks/tp/The-Greatest-Drummers-of-the-90s.htm|title=The 10 Greatest Drummers of the '90s|website=90srockmusic.com|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1990s-2000s====
In the 1990s, musician's magazines were starting to view female musicians more seriously, putting [[Bonnie Raitt]]&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', May 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Raitt cover story, ''Guitar Player Magazine'', July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tina Weymouth]]&lt;ref&gt;"Tina Weymouth &amp; David Byrne, The Talking Heads" (cover story), ''Guitar Player Magazine'', March 1984&lt;/ref&gt; on their covers. While The Go-Go's and [[The Bangles]], both from the LA club scene, were the first all-female rock bands to find sustained success, individual musicians paved the way for the industry to seek out bands that had female musicians.

In the 1990s, bands such as [[Hole (band)|Hole]], [[Super Heroines]], The Lovedolls and [[L7 (band)|L7]] became popular, while demonstrating on stage, and in interviews, a self-confident and  "bad" attitude at times, always willing to challenge assumptions about how an all-female band should behave. [[Courtney Love]] described the other females in [[Hole (band)|Hole]] as using a more "lunar viewpoint" in their roles as musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Boder, Christopher. "The Hole Story", ''Buzz'', Page 13, Vol VII, Issue 70. October 1991. "Most women in rock are only repeating what men have done. The women in this band are not doing that. We're coming at things from a more feminine, lunar, viewpoint."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the punk, female-led [[Riot Grrrl]] genre was associated with bands such as [[Bratmobile]] and [[Bikini Kill]].

====2000s-2010s====
In the 2000s, all female and female fronted bands started using their influence to promote feminism and females in the music industry. Bands like The Distillers, fronted by Brody Dalle, influenced the rise of street punk. St. Vincent started gaining more traction and eventually appeared on the cover of Guitar World magazine. St. Vincent wore a T-shirt with a bikini decal on the magazine cover, a comment on how when women appear with guitars, they're usually dressed very minimally, as a marketing tool to sell the instruments. Haim, a band composed of three sisters, is extremely outspoken when it comes to the promotion of women in music, calling out major music festivals for the lack of female-fronted bands on bills and the lack of payment for female artists as compared to male artists of the same level.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/06/13/haim-festival-inequality/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/12/tonights-live-music-acts-will-mostly-be-male-only-whats-holding-women-back&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the lack of female representation in music has been a major controversial point in the industry. Female musicians and bands are constantly overlooked in favor of male artists, however many people in the music industry have been making an effort to change this.

===Jazz===
[[File:Mary Lou Williams (Gottlieb 09231) - Crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Mary Lou Williams]] (1910–1981) was a pianist, composer and arranger who played [[jazz]], classical and [[Gospel music|gospel]] music. She wrote hundreds of compositions and arrangements and recorded more than one hundred records.]]
Historically, the majority of well-known [[Women in jazz|women performers in jazz]] have been singers, such as [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Dinah Washington]]. ''Culture Trip'' notes that women in jazz have been "too often confined to the role of chanteuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rasch|first1=Mirac|title=The Top 10 Female Jazz Musicians You Should Know|url=https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/the-top-10-female-jazz-musicians-you-should-know/|accessdate=3 April 2016|publisher=Culture Trip|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many notable instrumental performers. In some cases, these musicians are also composers and bandleaders:
* [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] (b. 1929): bandleader, pianist, arranger, composer
* [[Regina Carter]]: [[jazz violin]]
* [[Melba Liston]]: trombonist and arranger
* [[Vi Redd]] (b. 1928): alto saxophonist 
* [[Melissa Aldana]]: tenor saxophonist 
* [[Emily Remler]]: jazz guitar
* [[Mimi Fox]]: jazz guitar
*[[Sweet Emma Barrett]]
*[[Terri Lyne Carrington]] (drums)
*[[Carla Bley]] (piano)
*[[Mary Lou Williams]] (piano)
*[[Billie Pierce]] (piano)
*[[Jeanette Kimball]] (piano)
*[[Lovie Austin]] (piano and bandleader)
*[[Joelle Khoury]] (piano and composer)

There have also been [[all-female band|all-female jazz bands]] such as [[The International Sweethearts of Rhythm]].

===Classical music===
Instrumentalists in classical music may focus on one specific type of playing, such as solo recitals, solo concertos, [[chamber music]], or performing as a member of an orchestra, or they may do different types. Some musicians who play orchestral instruments may do all of these types of performances. Instrumentalists in classical music may do both live performances for an audience and recordings. In some cases, classical performers may do mostly live performances. There has traditionally been a gendered aspect to playing instruments in classical music.

Many album covers for female classical musicians have photographs that emphasize the physical attractiveness of the performer, "often using risqué images".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan. ''Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World'', Volume 1. SAGE Publications, 2011. p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', Classical women musicians are "too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;

====Orchestra====
[[File:Music. Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra BAnQ Vieux-Montréal P48S1P08057.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Montreal Women's Symphony Orchestra in 1942]]
Historically, orchestras tended to be almost exclusively male, with the exception of the harp player, as the harp was considered a "women's instrument". A music newspaper editorial in 1917 in England encouraged orchestras to allow women to play the "lighter instruments", with the understanding that these women performers would relinquish their positions to men once WW I was over.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the 1990s, to reduce the likelihood of [[gender bias]], some orchestras began conducting [[audition]]s of potential new members behind a screen, so the audition panel could not see if it was a male or female performer. Historically, there has been a tendency for brass sections to be male, and some women brass players have alleged that there is gender bias against female brass players. A study in the 1980s found that women made up 36% of US orchestras; 30% in the United Kingdom, and 16% in East and West Germany.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/excuse.htm |title=Gender Bias In International Orchestras |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women tended to be hired by lower paid orchestras and they were less present in major orchestras.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt;

In the past, the [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] argued that "ethnic and gender uniformity" gave their orchestra a better sound.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; Several male VPO musicians stated in a 1996 interview that classical music has "gender-defined qualities which can be most clearly expressed by male uniformity" in the orchestra.&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; One male VPO member stated that men "carry secrets that are involved with music and tones, just like in Australian aboriginal or Indian cultures where men play certain instruments, and not the women."&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt; One male VPO performer stated that "pregnancy brings problems.  It brings disorder.  Another important argument against women is that they can bring the solidarity of the men in question. You find that in all men's groups."

The Vienna Philharmonic did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than comparable orchestras (of the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by [[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] in 2008,&lt;ref name="The world's greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the last to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) As late as February 1996, first flautist Dieter Flury told [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] was a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=25 February 1996 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sarah Chang before performing.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Classical violinist [[Sarah Chang]] before performing a 2005 solo concert]]

In 1997, the orchestra was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and International Association of Women in Music. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-appoints-first-ever-female-concertmaster-opera-austria |title = Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster|work = [[France 24]]|date = 8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership, compared to 14% in the Berlin Philharmonic, 30% in the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], and 36% in the [[New York Philharmonic]]. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened [[blind audition]]s. She said it chooses "the best we get," implying that full gender equity would take time as older members retire and new ones audition under gender-neutral conditions.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;James R. Oestrich, [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/even-legends-adjust-to-time-and-trend-even-the-vienna.html "Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czech Philharmonic]] excludes women and the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] "has a history of gender discrimination."&lt;ref name="osborne-conant.org"/&gt;

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists. Brass, percussion, and [[Double bass|string-bass]] orchestra sections are still predominantly male."&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Hannah|last=Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soloists====
In classical music, soloists may perform unaccompanied solos on their instrument, as occurs with pianists who play works for solo piano or stringed instruments who play Baroque suites for one instrument (e.g., [[Bach suites for solo cello]]). In many cases, though, soloists are accompanied, either by a pianist, a small [[chamber music]] ensemble, or, in the case of a concerto, by a full symphony orchestra. In the 2014–2015 season, the majority of concerto soloists who performed with major Canadian orchestras were male. In the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]], 67% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]], 74% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[National Arts Centre Orchestra]], 79% of the concerto soloists were male. In the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]], 84% of the concerto soloists were male.&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; When the CBC news story on the gender balance of concerto soloists was released, the conductor of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, [[Bramwell Tovey]], disputed the accuracy of the news story in regards to his orchestra, arguing that the article only took a single season into account.

==Singers==

===Popular music===
[[File:Madonna Rebel Heart Tour 2015 - Amsterdam 2 (23823323680).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is often referred to as the artist who changed the role of women in popular music.]]

Singers in popular music perform the vocals for bands and other music groups, which may range in size from a [[Musical duo|duo]] or a [[power trio]] to a large jazz [[big band]]. Singers typically do both live performances and studio recordings. Singers who do live performances may sing in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s or [[nightclub]]s, or they may perform in larger venues ranging from arts centres to stadiums. Some singers also perform in music videos, which are used to promote the songs. In some styles of music, singers may play a [[rhythm section]] instrument, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass or a percussion instrument while they sing. In some styles of pop, singers perform choreographed dance moves during the show. Two well-known examples of pop singers who perform elaborate dance routines in their live shows are [[Madonna (singer)|Madonna]] and [[Britney Spears]].

Singer-songwriter and music producer [[Bjork]] has commented on how "women's labor and expertise—inside and outside of the music industry—go unnoticed." She has stated that "[I]t's invisible, what women do," and "[I]t's not rewarded as much."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; Bjork states "that her male collaborators are typically credited for the sound of her records; because on stage she mainly sings, there is a widespread assumption that she neither produces [as a music producer] nor plays an instrument."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt; In 2015, "while accepting the Woman of the Year honor at this year's Billboard Women in Music event", [[Lady Gaga]] commented on the "difficulties of being a female recording artist." She said it "is really hard sometimes for women in music. It's like a f[uck]ing boys club that we just can't get in to." She stated that she "tried for so long... to be taken seriously as a musician for my intelligence more than my body", yet she felt that others in the industry did not believe that women could have a "musical background... [or] understand what you're doing because you're a female."&lt;ref name="people.com"/&gt; A [[University Press of Kentucky]] book  states that customers did not treat a woman who worked at a guitar store like she knew anything about guitars until she would use special guitar terms.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Indie folk singer-songwriter/guitarist [[Ani di Franco]] states that for women, in the past, even entering a guitar store was an "act of courage" because it felt like a "boys' club".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Not only do female artists feel the pressure to please their male counterparts but it is also difficult for female DJs to fit in, in a male-dominated field&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ricochet.media/en/48/DJs-tackle-gender-bias|title=Female DJs tackle gender bias {{!}} Ricochet|work=Ricochet|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chaka Khan in Chris March 01.jpg|thumb|right|180 px |[[Chaka Khan]] (born 1953) has been called the "Queen of Funk."]]
Despite [[funk]]'s popularity in modern music, few people have examined the work of funk women. As cultural critic Cheryl Keyes explains in her essay "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis," most of the scholarship around funk has focused on the cultural work of men. She states that "[[Betty Davis]] is an artist whose name has gone unheralded as a pioneer in the annals of funk and rock. Most writing on these musical genres has traditionally placed male artist like Jimi Hendrix, George Clinton (of Parliament-Funkadelic), and bassist Larry Graham as trendsetters in the shaping of a rock music sensibility"&lt;ref&gt;Cheryl Keyes, "She Was too Black for Rock and too hard for Soul: (Re)discovering the Musical Career of Betty Mabry Davis" 35.&lt;/ref&gt; (35). Notable funk women include [[Chaka Khan]], [[Labelle]], [[Brides of Funkenstein]], [[Klymaxx]], [[Mother's Finest]], and [[Betty Davis]].

Below are some of the top-earning female singers in the [[2010s in music|2010s]]. Another way of selecting the most notable singers for this section would be by [[Music criticism|critical acclaim]], but this is a more subjective criteria than earnings. Almost all of these singers are also songwriters, and some are also music producers:

[[Classic female blues]] was an early form of [[blues music]] popular in the 1920s. An amalgam of traditional folk blues and urban theater music, the style is also known as vaudeville blues.  Classic blues songs performed by female vocalists were accompanied by pianists or small jazz ensembles, and were the first blues to be recorded. The classic female blues singers were pioneers in the [[record industry]], as they were among the first black singers and blues artists who were recorded. They were also instrumental in popularizing the [[12-bar blues]] throughout the US.

[[Ma Rainey|Gertrude "Ma" Rainey]] (1886–1939), known as the "[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|Mother of]] the Blues", is credited as the first to perform the blues on stage as popular entertainment when she began incorporating blues into her act of show songs and [[comedy]] around 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; New York-based cabaret singer [[Mamie Smith]] recorded "Crazy Blues" in 1920, which sold over 75,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith became known as "America's First Lady of the Blues". In 1920, the vaudeville singer [[Lucille Hegamin]] became the second black woman to record blues when she recorded "The Jazz Me Blues".&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Baxter, Derrick. ''Ma Rainey and the Classic Blues Singers''. New York: Stein &amp; Day Publishers, 1970. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethel Waters]], [[Alberta Hunter]], [[Mary Stafford (singer)|Mary Stafford]], [[Katie Crippen]], [[Edith Wilson (singer)|Edith Wilson]], and [[Esther Bigeou]], among others, made their first recordings before the end of 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sheldon. ''Blues Who's Who'' (Revised Ed.). New York: Da Capo Press, 1994. pp. 48, 137, 254, 484, 540, 580.&lt;/ref&gt; These blues recordings were typically labeled as "[[race records]]" to distinguish them from records sold to white audiences. Nonetheless, the recordings of some of the classic female blues singers were purchased by white buyers as well.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Jesse R., and Abrol Fairweather. ''Blues: Thinking Deep about Feeling Low''. Hoboken, N.J. Wiley; Chichester: John Wiley [distributor], 2011, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marion Harris]] became one of the first white female singers to record the blues.

The most popular of the classic blues singers was [[Tennessee]]-born [[Bessie Smith]] (no relation to Mamie Smith), who first recorded in 1923 and became known as the "Empress of the Blues". She signed with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and became the highest-paid black artist of the 1920s, recording over 160 songs. Other classic blues singers who recorded extensively until the end of the 1920s were [[Ida Cox]], [[Clara Smith]], and [[Sara Martin]]. These early blues singers were an influence on later singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Janis Joplin]]. These blues women's contributions to the genre included "increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. The blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, [[Broadway musical]]s, [[torch song]]s of the 1930s and 1940s, [[gospel music|gospel]], [[rhythm and blues]], and eventually [[rock and roll]]."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Daphne Duval. ''Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the '20s''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1988. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Country music ===
Gender discrimination and sexism occurs frequently in [[country music]]. In more recent times, a popular subgenre has developed: "Bro-Country", which has lyrics that sexually objectify women and frame them as assets for men's use. Some popular "Bro-Country" artists include [[Luke Bryan]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], and [[Blake Shelton]]. Gender discrimination and sexism has become more prominent in this genre over time. Dr. Eric Rasumssen, a professor in the College of Media and Communication and Texas Tech University, argues that compared to the 1990s and 2000s (decade), the country music of the 2010s discriminates more against women. Some of the ways they discriminate include, "talking more about women’s appearance, [showing] women in tight or revealing clothing, comparing women to objects, referring to women in slang [terms] versus their real names, and portraying women as distrustful and cheaters."

"Bro-Country" may be influenced by historical aspects of Southern culture which have been associated with racism and sexism. Women in country music continue to face these issues. [[Kacey Musgraves]], a recording artist, describes her experience with sexism in country music by stating that if a label can't get your song off the ground, it's immediately blamed on your personality or the fact that you're female, or that you didn't make a radio station program director feel important.

===Jazz===
[[File:Ella Fitzgerald in September 1947.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ella Fitzgerald]] performing with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], [[Milt Jackson]] and [[Timme Rosenkrantz]] in September 1947, New York]]
While woman have been underrepresented in jazz as instrumentalists, composers, songwriters and bandleaders, there have been many notable women singers. [[Bessie Smith]] sang both the blues and jazz. [[Lena Horne]] first appeared in the [[Cotton Club]] as a teenager. [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Billie Holiday]] were known for their ballads during the swing era. [[Shirley Horn]] sang both jazz and blues. [[Nina Simone]] sang jazz, folk and Rhythm and blues. [[Etta Jones]] sang rhythm and blues and jazz. [[Anita O'Day]] is known for her contributions to Bebop. [[Betty Carter]] sang during the post-bop era. [[Mary Lou Williams]] was a singer and pianist during the swing and hard bop eras. [[Sarah Vaughan]] is known for her singing in the  Cool jazz era. Other notable singers include [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Diane Schuur]] and [[Flora Purim]]. Contemporary jazz singers include [[Norah Jones]], [[Diana Krall]], [[Melody Gardot]] and singer-bassist [[Esperanza Spalding]].

===Classical music===

Classical singers typically do both live performances and recordings. Live performances may be in small venues, such as churches, or large venues, such as opera halls or arts centers. Classical singers may specialize in specific types of singing, such as [[art song]], which are songs performed with piano accompaniment, or opera, which is singing accompanied by a [[symphony orchestra]] in a staged, costumed theatrical production.  Classical singers are typically categorized by their voice type, which indicates both their vocal range and in some cases also the "color" of their voice. Examples of voice types that indicate the range of a singer's voice include [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (these go from the lowest range to the highest range). Examples of voice types that indicate both the singer's range and the "color" of her voice type are [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]]. Whereas popular music singers typically use a [[microphone]] and a [[sound reinforcement system]] for their vocals, in classical music the voice must be projected into the hall naturally, a skill for which they undertake vocal training.

L. Macy (Accessed 9 February 2009), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her singing career was spent performing in concert and recital in major music venues and with famous orchestras throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965. Anderson became an important figure in the struggle for black artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]]. With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, 9 April 1939, on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in Washington, D.C. She sang before a crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions. Anderson continued to break barriers for black artists in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City on 7 January 1955.

Women play an important role in [[world music]], a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the world, including [[ethnic music]] and [[traditional music]] from Africa, the Caribbean, South America, Asia, and other regions, indigenous music, neotraditional music, and music where more than one cultural tradition intermingle (e.g., mixtures of Western pop and ethnic music). The term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Erlmann, Veit|year=1996| title=Aesthetics of the Global Imagination: Reflections on World Music in the 1990s|journal=Public Culture|volume=8|issue=3|pages=467–488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Discourse of World Music |author=Frith, Simon|editor=Born and Hesmondhalgh|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|booktitle=Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation, and Appropriation in Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian actress, singer and dancer [[Carmen Miranda]] became known in the West as [[Exotism|exotic]] supplement in Hollywood films in the 1930s, akin to dancer [[Josephine Baker]] before, and the voice of [[exotica]] [[Yma Sumac]] after her. In the 1960s [[Elis Regina]] was the most prominent female singer in the [[Bossa Nova]] of Brazilian music that influenced popular music around the world. In the 1960s and 1970s Argentinian folk singer [[Mercedes Sosa]], South African [[Miriam Makeba]] or Greek [[Maria Farantouri]] were also recognized for their engagement against the oppressive political situation in their home states. Sosa singing "[[Gracias a la vida]]", Makeba's "[[Pata Pata]]", and Farantouri's collaboration with composer [[Mikis Theodorakis]] were musical icons of the struggle for [[human rights]]. The "Queen of Salsa" [[Celia Cruz]] immigrated from Cuba to the United States in 1966.

With the rising interest in the then so-called world music in the 1980s old recordings of long established artists were re-discovered for a global audience and distributed worldwide; well known in their home country –sometimes stars with legendary status– like Arabic singers [[Umm Kulthum]], [[Asmahan]], and [[Fairuz]], the Algerian [[Raï]] singer [[Cheikha Rimitti]], [[Asha Bhosle]], most prolific playback singer for [[Bollywood]] film soundtracks, Romani [[Esma Redžepova]], Mexican [[ranchera]] singer [[Chavela Vargas]], and the [[Mahotella Queens]] from South Africa; or they were recorded for the first time (by Caucasian males) like [[Cesária Évora]] from Cape Verde, [[Stella Chiweshe]] from Zimbabwe and Afro-Peruvian [[Susana Baca]].

There are many notable women world music performers, including: [[Ann Savoy]], [[Bi Kidude]], [[Brenda Fassie]], [[Chabuca Granda]], [[Chava Alberstein]], [[Cleoma Breaux Falcon]], [[Dolly Collins]], [[Elizabeth Cotten]], [[Frehel]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Genoa Keawe]], [[Googoosh]], [[Hazel Dickens]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Lola Beltrán]], [[Lucha Reyes (Peruvian singer)|Lucha Reyes]], [[Lucilla Galeazzi]] (The Mammas), [[Lydia Mendoza]], [[Maria Tanase]], [[Mariam Doumbia]], [[Nada Mamula]], [[Ofra Haza]], [[Oumou Sangare]], [[Rita Marley]], [[Rosa Passos]], [[Roza Eskenazi]], [[Safiye Ayla]], [[Salamat Sadikova]], [[Selda Bagcan]], [[Shirley Collins]], [[Valya Balkanska]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[Warda Al-Jazairia|Warda]], and [[Zap Mama]].

===Arabic music===

[[Arabic music]], which has [[Persian traditional music|Persian]] origins,&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age of the Moor''. By [[Ivan van Sertima]]. 1992. Transaction Publishers. {{ISBN|1-56000-581-5}}. p.17&lt;/ref&gt;
is an amalgam of the music of the [[Arab people]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the music of all the varied peoples that make up the Arab world. In [[Music of Egypt|Egypt during the medieval era]], male professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means "a player upon an instrument". However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. Male professional musicians were considered disreputable and lowly, and they earned their living playing at parties. Female professional musicians in Egypt were called Awalim (pl) or Al'meh, which means a "learned female". These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the [[harem]] of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded.

In the 9th century,  using male instrumentalists was harshly criticized in a treatise, because male musicians were associated with perceived vices such as playing [[chess]] and writing [[love poetry]]. Following the invasion of Egypt, [[Napoleon]] commissioned reports on the state of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] culture. The report reveals that there were [[guild]]s of male instrumentalists who played to male audiences, and "learned female" singer/musicians who sang and played for women audiences.

===Chinese music===

In [[Chinese music]], music was a major activity for women during Ancient times, especially for learned women. Women performers were associated with the [[guqin]] since ancient times. The guqin is a plucked seven-string [[Chinese musical instrument]] of the [[zither]] family. It has traditionally been favored by [[scholars]] and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement. A notable woman guqin player was [[Cai Wenji]], associated with the piece ''Hujia Shiba-pai''.&lt;ref&gt;《胡笳十八拍》&lt;/ref&gt;

Women musicians also play a key role in Chinese folk music. In southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music]] is a genre of traditional Chinese folk ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] flute and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with the topic of a love-stricken woman.

The [[Chinese pop]] (C-pop) music industry in the 1930s and 1940s was dominated by the [[Seven Great Singing Stars]], who were the most renowned singers of China in the 1940s. [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Gong Qiuxia]], [[Yao Lee]] and [[Bai Hong]] emerged in the 1930s, while [[Bai Guang]], [[Li Xianglan]] and [[Wu Yingyin]] became popular in the 1940s. After 1949, these early generations of C-pop were denounced by the [[Communist Party of China]] as [[Yellow Music]] as it saw pop music as sexually indecent (the color yellow is associated with eroticism and sex in China). Only after the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], by the early 1980s, could Yellow Music be performed again.

Nowadays, after China's extensive political and cultural changes of the past 50 years, Chinese popular music has been increasingly emulating and taking inspiration from the styles of popular music of South Korea ([[K-pop]]) and of Japan ([[J-pop]]), both of which it now closely resembles. As such, during the 2010s, several [[girl groups]] have been established based both on the Japanese model, like [[SNH48]] (created in 2012) and its [[SNH48#Sister groups|sister groups]], as well as on the Korean model, like [[Rocket Girls (band)|Rocket Girls]], created in 2018 from the [[Produce 101 (Chinese TV series)|Chinese version]] of a Korean reality television talent competition show. These groups have achieved significant success, with the debut [[Extended play|EP]] of Rocket Girls selling over 1.6 million copies.&lt;ref name="Tencent"/&gt; Despite this though, solo Chinese female artists continue to be much more popular overall in the country, as they have traditionally been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&amp;page=1&amp;sex=-100&amp;|title= 歌手列表|accessdate= August 26, 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most recently popular solo Chinese female singers include 胡66, [[Ada Zhuang]], [[Kelly Yu]], 陳粒 ([[:zh:陳粒|zh]]), [[Feng Timo]], [[Bibi Zhou]], 双笙, [[Tia Ray]], 金玟岐 ([[:zh:金玟岐|zh]]) and [[Jane Zhang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://y.qq.com/portal/singer_list.html#area=200&amp;page=1&amp;sex=1&amp;|title= 歌手列表|accessdate= August 26, 2018|work= [[QQ Music]]|publisher= [[Tencent]]|language= Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian music===
[[File:Ms subbulakshmi.jpg|thumb|right|140px|The Indian Carnatic classical singer [[M.S. Subbulakshmi]] (1916–2004)]]
[[Indian classical music]] is the [[art music]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The origins of Indian classical music can be found in the [[Hindu]] hymns. This chanting style evolved into [[jatis]] and eventually into [[raga]]s. Indian classical music has also been significantly influenced by, or syncretised with, Indian folk music. The major composers from the historical Indian classical music tradition were men. Modern women vocalists include [[D. K. Pattammal]], [[M. S. Subbalakshmi]], [[Gangubai Hangal]], [[Hirabai Barodekar]], [[Kesarbai Kerkar]], [[Kishori Amonkar]], [[Malini Rajurkar]], [[Mogubai Kurdikar]], [[Prabha Atre]], [[Roshan Ara Begum]] and [[Shruti Sadolikar Katkar]]. One woman instrumentalist is [[Annapurna Devi]].

In [[Indian folk music]], [[lavani]] is a music genre popular in [[Maharashtra]] that is traditionally performed by women.
[[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਭੰਗੜਾ) is a form of [[dance]]-oriented [[folk music]] of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. The present musical style is derived from non traditional musical accompaniment to the riffs of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] called by the same name. The female dance of [[Punjab region]] is known as [[Giddha]] ([[Gurmukhi|Punjabi]]: ਗਿੱਧਾ).

In the [[music of Bollywood]] (the centre of India's film industry) and other regional film industries in India, women [[playback singer]]s have had a significant role, with the sisters [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Asha Bhosle]], who have mainly worked in Hindi films, often referred to as two of the best-known and most prolific playback singers in India. In 2011, Bhosle was officially acknowledged by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the most recorded artist in music history.&lt;ref name="indiatoday.intoday.in"/&gt;

===Iranian music===
[[File:Parisa.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Fātemeh Vā'ezi ({{lang-fa|فاطمه واعظی}}) (born 1950), commonly known by her stage name Parīsā ({{lang-fa| پریسا}}), is a [[Persian traditional music|Persian classical]] vocalist and musician.]]

Since the [[Iranian revolution]], Iranian female solo vocalists have been permitted to perform for female audiences. Female vocalists can perform for male audiences only as a part of a chorus. Traditionally, it has been difficult for female singers to appear publicly. Women were only allowed to perform for religious rituals, called [[Tazieh]], and men were generally forbidden to listen to women. Before the Revolution, [[Women's rights in Iran|Iranian women]] could only sing in private, while working, for other women, or during women's celebrations. [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]] (1905-1959) is one of the first female masters of Persian music. Notable female musicians include [[Delkash]] (1923-2004); [[Simin Ghanem]] (born 1944); [[Maryam Akhondy]] (born 1957), founder of Barbad Ensemble; Persian classical guitarist [[Lily Afshar]]; singer [[Shakila]], winner of Persian Academy Award; the conductor [[Soodabeh Salem]]; [[Afsaneh Rasaei]]; [[Pirayeh Pourafar]], founder of Nava Ensemble and Lian Ensemble; and [[Mahsa Vahdat]].

The classical singer [[Fatemeh Vaezi]] (commonly known by her stage name "Parisa") has given concerts accompanied by a female orchestra. After 1986 [[Maryam Akhondy]] started working with other Iranian musicians in exile. In 2000 Maryam Akhondy created the all-female a cappella group  Banu which sung old folk songs that were part of women's activities and celebrations. Singer [[Sima Bina]] has taught many female students. [[Ghashang Kamkar]] teaches both male and female students. Both Ghashang and Vaezi have criticized the patriarchal power structure in Iran for its treatment of female musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Javaheri, 'With These Problems of Life, There Is No Time for Art,' trans. Maryam Habibian, Zanan, No. 36 (1997), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian folk-music performers include [[Sima Bina]], [[Darya Dadvar]], [[Monika Jalili]], [[Ziba Shirazi]], [[Zohreh Jooya]], and [[Shusha Guppy|Shushā Guppy]]. Iranian pop performers include [[Googoosh]], [[Hayedeh]], [[Mahasti]], [[Leila Forouhar]], [[Pooran (singer)|Pooran]], and [[Laleh Pourkarim]].

==Music scholars and educators==

===Musicologists and music historians===
[[File:Rosetta Reitz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rosetta Reitz]] (1924–2008) was an American [[jazz]] historian and [[feminist]] who established a record label producing 18 albums of the music of the early women of jazz and the blues.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008. Accessed 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

Other notable women scholars include:

*[[Eva Badura-Skoda]]
*[[Margaret Bent]]
*[[Suzanne Cusick]]
*[[Ursula Günther]]

===Ethnomusicologists===
[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1957) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]] known for her studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[music]] and [[culture]].]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Notable ethnomusicologists include:

*[[Judith Becker]]
*[[Frances Densmore]]
*[[Ida Halpern]]
*[[Maud Karpeles]]

===Music educators===

{{Main|Women in music education}}
While music critics argued in the 1880s that "women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "to such a degree that women dominated music education during the latter half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860-1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction .&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

*{{ill|Cornelia Schröder-Auerbach|de}} (1900-1997), musician, musicologist, pianist and organist, studied musicology in [[Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität|Breslau]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], [[Friedrich Schiller Universitaet, Jena|Jena]] and [[Albert Ludwig's University of Freiburg|Freiburg in Breisgau]],&lt;ref&gt;Martina Drechsler and Uwe Scheithauer, „Cornelia Schröder-Auerbach“, in: ''Frauenspuren II: Porträts fast vergessener Frauen aus Steglitz-Zehlendorf'', Hildegard Josten und YOPIC e.V.

[[File:US Army 52342 Capt. Sharon Toulouse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|US Army Captain Sharon Toulouse leading a military music ensemble in 2008]]
The majority of professional orchestra [[Conducting|conductors]] are male; ''The Guardian'' called conducting "one of the last [[glass ceilings]] in the music industry".&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt; A 2013 article stated that in France, out of 574 concerts only 17 were conducted by women and no women conducted at the [[Paris National Opera|National Opéra in Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Victor Tribot Laspière | title=Une main ferme à l’Orchestre national de France | url=http://www.francemusique.fr/actu-musicale/ou-sont-les-femmes-dans-la-musique-7766 | work=France Musique | date=2013-10-02 | accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bachtrack'' reported that, in a list of the world's 150 top conductors that year, only five were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classical-music.com/article/11-of-best-female-conductors |title=11 of today's top women conductors |publisher=Classical-Music.com |date=2015-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of female conductors have become top-ranked international conductors. In January 2005, Australian conductor [[Simone Young]] became the first woman to conduct the [[Vienna Philharmonic]]. In 2008 [[Marin Alsop]], a protégé of [[Leonard Bernstein]], became the first woman to become the music director and principal conductor of a major US orchestra when she won the top job at the [[Baltimore Symphony]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture - Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were "protests from a large swathe of the Baltimore Symphony when she was first named Music Director", but since that time, "plaudits [have] roll[ed] in."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; In 2014, Alsop was the first woman conductor to lead the [[Last Night of the Proms]] concert–one of the most important classical music events in Britain–in its 118-year history.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;

[[Jeri Lynne Johnson]] was the first [[African-American]] woman to win an international conducting prize when she was awarded the Taki Concordia conducting fellowship in 2005. She is the founder and music director of the Black Pearl Chamber Orchestra, the first multi-ethnic professional [[orchestra]] in [[Philadelphia]]. A graduate of [[Wellesley College]] and the [[University of Chicago]], she is a [[Conducting|conductor]], [[composer]] and [[pianist]]. From 2001-2004, she was the assistant conductor of The [[Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YtoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22jeri+lynne+johnson%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6vLxS8CJM8GB8gb0sZzvDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jeri%20lynne%20johnson%22&amp;f=false|title=Sisters in the Spotlight|date=March 2003|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has led orchestras around the world including the [[Colorado Symphony Orchestra|Colorado Symphony]], [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth Symphony]] (UK), and the Weimar Staatskapelle (Germany). Alongside prominent woman conductors [[Marin Alsop]] and [[JoAnn Falletta]], Ms. Johnson was heralded on the [[NBC]] [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]] as one of the nation's leading female conductors.

According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, "The music world has been happy to have female performers ...for a long time...[;]But owning authority and power in public is another matter. That's where female conductors have had a hard time. Our society is more resistant to women being powerful in public than to women being entertaining."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; The low percentage of women conductors is not because women do not study in [[music school]]; indeed, in 2009 and 2012 almost half of the recipients of [[Doctor of Musical Arts|conducting doctorates]] were women.&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;

===Sexism and gender discrimination===
Women conductors faced sexism and gender discrimination throughout the 19th century and 20th century. "To break down this apparent employment barrier, women created their own opportunities by founding and organizing all-female orchestras"; one example is the Fadette Women's Orchestra in Boston founded in 1888 by conductor Caroline B. Nichols.&lt;ref&gt;[http://symposium.music.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=2151:women-orchestral-conductors-in-america-the-struggle-for-acceptance%E2%80%94an-historical-view-from-the-nineteenth-century-to-the-present&amp;Itemid=124] {{dead link|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other all-women orchestras were founded in the early decades of the 20th century, and women conductors led these groups.

Women conductors continue to face sexism and gender discrimination in the early decades of the 21st century. In the 2010s, several notable male conductors and musicians made sexist statements about women conductors. In 2013, "[[Vasily Petrenko]], the principal conductor of the [[Oslo Philharmonic]] and the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]], provoked outrage when he told a Norwegian newspaper that 'orchestras react better when they have a man in front of them."&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Charlotte Higgins |author2=chief arts writer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/02/male-conductors-better-orchestras-vasily-petrenko |title=Male conductors are better for orchestras, says Vasily Petrenko &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "when women have families, it becomes difficult to be as dedicated as is demanded in the business".&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt; [[Bruno Mantovani]], the director of the [[Paris Conservatoire]], gave an interview in which he made sexist statements about women conductors. Mantovani raised the "problem of [[maternity]]" and he questioned the ability of women to withstand the physical challenges and stresses of the profession, which he claimed involve "conducting, taking a plane, taking another plane, conducting again."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; [[Yuri Temirkanov]], the music director of the [[St. Petersburg Philharmonic]], made sexist statements about women conductors in a September 2013 interview, stating that "The essence of the conductor's profession is strength. The essence of a woman is weakness."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt; Finnish conductor [[Jorma Panula]] made sexist statements about women conductors in 2014; he stated that "women [conductors are not]… getting any better – only worse", which he called a "purely biological question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaltoronto.org/2014/04/05/editorial-cbc-classical-music-gender-gap-article-poses-new-questions/ |title=Musical Toronto |publisher=Musical Toronto |date= |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music===
[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American pop music critic [[Ann Powers]] (pictured in 2007)]]
According to Anwen Crawford, the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago", which means that "[b]ooks by living female rock critics (or jazz, hip-hop, and dance-music critics, for that matter) are scant". Crawford notes that the "most famous rock-music critics—[[Robert Christgau]], [[Greil Marcus]], [[Lester Bangs]], [[Nick Kent]]—are all male".&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"/&gt;

Sociologist [[Simon Frith]] noted that pop and rock music "are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour".&lt;ref name=Frith2001&gt;Frith, Simon, "Pop Music" in S.

===Classical music===
[[File:Marion Lignana Rosenberg.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Marion Lignana Rosenberg]] (1961–2013) was a music critic, writer, translator, broadcaster and journalist. She wrote for many periodicals, including [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Playbill]]''.]]
"The National Arts Journalism Program (NAJP) at Columbia... completed a large study of arts journalism in America [in 2005]. They found that 'the average classical music critic is a white, 52-year-old male with a [[graduate degree]], but twenty-six percent of all critics writing are female.'" However, William Osborne points out that this 26% figure includes all newspapers, including low-circulation regional papers. Osborne states that the "large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics." The only female critics from major US papers are [[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'') and Wynne Delacoma (''Chicago Sun-Times''). Midgette was the "first woman to cover classical music in the entire history of the paper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/women-critics.htm |title=Women Music Critics |publisher=Osborne-conant.org |date=2005-06-11 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susannah Clapp]], a critic from ''The Guardian''–a newspaper that has a female classical music critic–stated in May 2014 that she had only then realized "what a rarity" a female classical music critic is in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/25/sexism-stage-critics-tara-erraught-glyndebourne |title=Time to bring down the curtain on stage critics' sexism &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=The Guardian |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ruth Saxelby's article "Why aren't more women becoming music producers?", she states that "beats aren't gendered, so why do women represent less than 5% of music producers and engineers"? Saxelby interviewed 13 women who work as music producers to seek the potential causes of this situation.&lt;ref name=Fader&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/30/why-arent-more-women-becoming-music-producers|title=Why aren't more women becoming music producers?|date=30 October 2014|work=The FADER|first=Ruth|last=Saxelby}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatima Al Qadiri from New York states that "women are expected to be the sexualized commercial object for sale in music, and production and engineering [are fields where women are] rarely [able to be] objectified for financial gain [by the music industry]"; as such, the industry does not use women producers or engineers.&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Qadiri said barriers to women in production and sound engineering include "misogyny, sexism, unequal pay,...[and] pressure to make your body (rather than your music) the central focus of your career."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Caroline Polachek from New York states that "an artist is not as likely to bring in a woman to produce his track as a man, not because of a bias against women per se, but because on some level it's playing safe: a killer producer, history tells us, looks like a man."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt;

[[WondaGurl]] from Toronto states that "there aren't many female producer and engineers, because they find this side of the business to be mostly male-dominated and many woman do not like to have to compete with men."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Holly Herndon from San Francisco states that "[m]usic, despite common misconceptions, is quite conservative. The archetypes don't seem to ever really change...Every year we get a diva, a dancer,...a girl next door, a fashion queen, a dainty songstress; all younger updates on a previous [year's] model. No room for new archetypes [such as women producers]." Herndon points out that [[Missy Elliott]] "exists outside of those narrow roles..."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Asma Maroof from Los Angeles says women are "intimidated by such a male-driven profession."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt;

Tokimonsta, also from Los Angeles, states that "our culture has systematically engrained this idea that technology is more of a man's thing."&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Ikonika from London, UK, states that the music industry is "sexist and racist".&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Anna Lunoe from Sydney, Australia, states that "more girls [should be] exposed to introductory production workshops" and "production mentoring programs that are... aimed at promising young female engineers".&lt;ref name=Fader/&gt; Leila from London, UK, states that "[t]here have been a fair few [female producers and engineers]", from [[Delia Derbyshire]] to [[Tina Weymouth]] to Susan Day to Missy Elliot to [[Zavoloka]]. Leila suggests that to increase the number of women in music production and sound engineering, girls should be given training in computers and software coding.

One of the first women to produce, engineer, arrange and promote music on her own [[rock and roll]] music label was [[Cordell Jackson]] (1923-2004). She founded the Moon Records label in Memphis in 1956 after a few years of recording demos at [[Sam Phillips]]' Memphis Recording Service and [[Sun Records Studio]]. Unable to break into the [[Sun Records]] label's stable of male artists, she received the advice and assistance of [[RCA Records]]' [[Chet Atkins]] in forming this new label to release her music. She began releasing and promoting on the label singles she recorded in her home studio, serving as engineer, producer and arranger. The artists recorded included her and a small family of early [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], and [[country music]] performers she recruited from several Southern states.

[[Gail Davies]] was the '...first female producer in [[country music]], delivering a string of Top 10 hits in the '70s and '80s including "[[Someone Is Looking for Someone Like You]]," "[[Blue Heartache]]" and "[[I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)]]."&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; When she moved to [[Nashville]] in 1976, men "didn't want to work for a woman" and she was told women in the city were "still barefoot, pregnant and [singing] in the vocal booth."&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; 
[[Wendy Waldman]], who became a producer after Davies, saw that Davies had a difficult time. When Jonell Polansky arrived in Nashville in 1994, with a degree in [[electrical engineering]] and recording experience in the Bay Area, she was told "[y]ou're a woman, and we already had one"–a reference to Waldman.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; 
KK Proffitt, who is a studio "owner and chief engineer" states that men in Nashville do not want to have women in the recording booth. At a meeting of the [[Audio Engineering Society]], Proffitt was told to "shut up" by a male producer when she raised the issue of updating studio recording technologies.&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt; Proffitt said she finds "finds sexism rampant in the industry".&lt;ref name="nashvillescene.com"/&gt;

===DJs and turntablists ===

[[File:FemaleDJ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A DJ mixing two record players at a live event]]
Women in music are often seen mainly in singing roles in [[popular music]] and there are relatively few women [[DJ]]s or [[turntablist]]s in [[hip hop music]], [[house music]], [[nu metal]] and other genres where DJs and turntablists participate. Indeed, all of these genres are very male-dominated. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs, such as audio engineering and production.  In 2007 Mark Katz's article "Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle," stated that "very few women battle; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years."&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=12 December 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states "the male-centricity of EDM culture" contributes to "a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces." &lt;ref name="Farrugia"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia |first=Rebekah |publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as "male technophilia."&lt;ref name="Katz" /&gt; Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: "an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field … is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put the burden of proof entirely on women and to blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values. An equally challenging question is why and how boys have come to love things technical, how boys have historically been socialized as technophiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oldenziel|first=Ruth A. |date=1997 |title=Boys and Their Toys: The Fisher Body Craftsman's Guild, 1930–1968, and the Making of a Male Technical Domain|url=|journal=Technology and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bands associated with the movement include [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[Cake Like]], [[Skinned Teen]], [[Emily's Sassy Lime]], [[Sleater-Kinney]], and also [[queercore]] groups like [[Team Dresch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223012118/http://www.hot-topic.org/node/13 |archivedate=23 February 2009|title=List of Riot Girl Bands |publisher=Hot-topic.org |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zqSn0jMJAQC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=Dickless%20riot&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q=Dickless&amp;f=false|first=Marisa|last=Meltzer|page=42 |title=Girl Power: The Nineties Revolution in Music|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9781429933285|date=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a [[Indie music scenes|music scene]] and [[genre]], riot grrrl is a [[subculture]] involving a [[DIY ethic]], [[zine]]s, art, political action, and activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = W.W.

The use of the word "girl" was meant to indicate a time when girls are least influenced by societal pressures and therefore have the strongest self-esteem – childhood. The anger behind the movement was noted by the alternate spelling of the word as "grrrl", which sounds like a growl.&lt;ref name="Schilt" /&gt;

They partook in a new type of punk feminism that promoted the idea of do-it-yourself, exchanging [[manifesto]]s and trading mixed tapes of favorite bands to get the word out.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 173–196"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Mimi Thi|date=2012-07-01|title=Riot Grrrl, Race, and Revival|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory|volume=22|issue=2-3|pages=173–196|doi=10.1080/0740770X.2012.721082|issn=0740-770X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were tired of women being erased from history or having their experiences misinterpreted and ignored by others. In, response to patriarchal violence, adultism, and [[heterocentrism]],&lt;ref name="Kearney"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Mary Celeste|year=1995|title=Riot Grrrl: It's Not Just Music, It's Not Just Punk|url=|journal=Spectator|volume=16|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrl engaged in negative emotional expressions and rhetoric similar to that of feminism and the punk aesthetic. The feminist argument that the personal is political was revisited in the image that Riot grrrl set forth, similarly to the culture of Punk that [[self-actualization]] is not to be found in external forces but rather through an individual's true self. By recognizing and reevaluating the institutional structures that affect individual experiences within social situations, an individual can gain the knowledge to better know herself and therefore know how to present herself to others so that they may know her accurately. Riot grrrl termed this movement to self-actualization, girl love – "girls learning to love themselves, and each other, against those forces that would otherwise see them destroyed or destroy themselves".

The accompanying slogan "every girl is a riot grrrl" reinforced the solidarity that women could find amongst themselves. This created an intimate aesthetic and sentimental politic well expressed in the production of zines (a shortened version of "fanzines").&lt;ref name="Schilt" /&gt; [[Zine]]s were handmade, crafted by individuals who wanted to connect directly with their readers, with simple items like scissors, glue, and tape. They called out injustices and challenged the norms that typically directed the expression of sexuality and domestic abuse, providing a space for women to exchange personal stories to which many others could relate. They challenged girls and women alike to stand up for themselves in a political atmosphere that actively sought to silence them.&lt;ref name="Kearney" /&gt; The shared personal stories were, at times, met with attitudes that reduced the communication to "it’s all just girls in their bedrooms, sprawled out writing in their diaries, and then they’ll send them to each other", while the choice to share in that way was an aesthetic one.

In the midst of this raising of awareness, riot grrrls had to address the generalizations that worked for them but that could not apply to women of color. Not all girls could be riot grrrl after all, for lack of privilege barred them from participating in such acts as writing "SLUT" across their stomach in an attempt to reclaim sexual agency.&lt;ref name="Nguyen 173–196"/&gt; While this performance is an earnest one, racism had already labeled women of color as that term. As observed by Kearny, "the gender deviance displayed by riot grrrls is a privilege to which only middle-class white girls have access."&lt;ref name="Kearney" /&gt; Another aspect of this need for inclusive [[discourse]] arose in the movement's preference for concrete knowledge and a disregard for the abstract that would foster theoretical inquiry.

===Festivals===
Women's music festivals, which may also be called [[womyn]]'s music festivals, have been held since the 1970s. Some women's music festivals are organized for [[lesbian]]s. The first women's music festival was held in 1973 at Sacramento State University. In May, 1974 the first National Woman's Music Festival was held in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, founded by [[University of Illinois]] student Kristin Lems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=DIL19740326.2.55&amp;srpos=6&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-national+women's+music+festival------|title=Daily Illini 26 March 1974 — Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|website=Idnc.library.illinois.edu|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It celebrated its fortieth year in Middleton, Wisconsin, from 2–5 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org|title=National Womens Music Festival - July 5-8, 2018     Middleton, Wisconsin|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, it is a four-day event that includes concerts, workshops, comedy, theatre, films and writing events that "promote and affirm the creative talents and technical skills of women" from diverse, multicultural communities, including women with disabilities. While most attendees are women, men can attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiaonline.org/wia/membership-and-donation/|title=Membership and Contributions - National Womens Music Festival|website=Wiaonline.org|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]] was created in 1976, and became the largest festival in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1999:28&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a festival that focuses on music is the Women in Music Festival held by the [[University of Rochester]]'s [[Eastman School of Music]]. The festival began in 2005 as a celebration of the contributions of women to composition, performance, teaching, scholarship, and music administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esm.rochester.edu/wmf|title=Women in Music Festival|website=Women in Music Festival|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its modest beginnings of Eastman students and faculty members performing music by women composers, the Festival has grown to include additional concerts and events throughout Rochester, NY and to host composers-in-residence, who have included [[Tania León]] (2007), [[Nancy Van de Vate]] (2008), [[Judith Lang Zaimont]] (2009), [[Emma Lou Diemer]] (2010), and [[Hilary Tann]] (2011). The festival has presented more than 291 different works by 158 composers.

Many other festivals have been created throughout the United States and Canada since the mid-1970s and vary in size from a few hundred to thousands of attendees. The [[Los Angeles Women's Music Festival]] began in 2007 with over 2500 attendees.  Events outside the US include the Sappho Lesbian Witch Camp, near Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada and the Sistajive Women's Music Festival in Australia. Some festivals are focused around the lesbian community, such as the Ohio Lesbian Festival, near Columbus Ohio, which was created in 1988; Christian Lesbians Out (CLOUT), which holds a gathering in early August in Washington, DC; The Old Lesbian Gathering, a festival in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and RadLesFes, an event held in the middle of November near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Feminist-oriented festivals include the Southern Womyn's Festival in Dade City, Florida; the Gulf Coast Womyn's Festival in Ovett, Missouri; Wiminfest in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Womongathering, the Festival of Womyn's Spirituality; the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, near Hart, Michigan; and the Midwest Womyn's Festival in DeKalb, Illinois.

While women's music festivals are centered on music, they support many other facets of [[lesbian]] and [[feminist]] culture.  Some festivals are designed to provide a [[safe space]] for women's music and culture. Many festivals are held on college campuses or in remote rural locations, where attendees stay in campsites. Many festivals offer workshops on arts, crafts, fitness, and athletic events that women may not be able find in mainstream culture.  In her book ''Eden Built by Eves'', Bonnie Morris describes how women's music festivals serve women throughout the stages of their lives. Since the festivals are organized by women, for women, daycare and childcare facilities are typically provided. Festivals often provide a safe space for [[coming of age]] rituals for young women, adult romance and commitment ceremonies, the expression of alternative perspectives on motherhood, and the expression of grief and loss.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lilith Fair====
[[File:Sarah McLachlan 29 July 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Lilith Fair]] co-founder [[Sarah McLachlan]]]]
[[Lilith Fair]] was a [[concert tour]] and travelling music festival that consisted solely of female solo artists and female-led bands. It was founded by Canadian musician [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Nettwerk Music Group]]'s [[Dan Fraser]] and [[Terry McBride (CEO)|Terry McBride]], and New York talent agent Marty Diamond. It took place during the summers of 1997 to 1999, and was revived in the summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128588089 |title=With Sales Lagging, Lilith Fair Faces Question of Relevance |last=Pellegrinelli |first=Lara |date=19 July 2010 |website=NPR |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLachlan organized the festival after she became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9807/28/lilith.fair/ | title=Lilith Fair: Lovely, lively and long overdue | first=Donna | last=Freydkin | publisher=CNN | date=28 July 1998 | accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and [[Paula Cole]]. At least one of their appearances together – in McLachlan's home town, on 14 September 1996 – went by the name "Lilith Fair" and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Michelle McAdorey]], formerly of [[Crash Vegas]].

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking ''Lilith'' from the medieval Jewish legend that [[Lilith]] was [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s first wife. In 1997, Lilith Fair garnered a $16&amp;nbsp;million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt; Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th highest grossing.&lt;ref name="cnn072898"/&gt;
The festival received several pejorative nicknames, including "Breast-fest", "Girlapalooza", and "Clam Jam".&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071698/fea_lilith.shtml]{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/music_popular,5.html |title=ARTS : Music: Popular |publisher=Glbtq.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Woz U''' is a tech education platform launched by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]] that focuses on both students and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/13/steve-wozniak-announces-tech-education-platform-woz-u/|title=Steve Wozniak announces tech education platform Woz U|last=Crook|first=Jordan|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woz U is Arizona-based with plans to launch physical locations for learning in more than 30 cities across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171013005008/en/Apple-Co-Founder-Steve-Wozniak-Forms-Woz-Reprogram|title=Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Forms 'Woz U' to Reprogram Tech Education, Address Skills Gap|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/13/16474170/apple-steve-wozniak-woz-u-launch-tech-education-online-university|title=Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak launches his own online tech education platform|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/13/steve-wozniak-created-online-university/|title=Steve Wozniak just created his own online university|work=Engadget|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the company is registered in Arizona,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ecorp.azcc.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInformation?businessId=885230|title=WOZ U EDUCATION LLC  - Arizona Corporations Commission|last=|first=|date=|website=ecorp.azcc.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; it works through its Texas-based partner, [[Southern Careers Institute|Southern Careers Institute.]] Less than a week after the launch announcement, the company came under scrutiny by state regulators about the lack of state accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2017/10/18/woz-u-arizona-state-regulators-have-questions-key-paperwork-unfinished/773509001/|title=Woz U: AZ state regulators have questions, key paperwork unfinished|last=Jeong|first=Yihyun|date=2017-10-18|work=azcentral|access-date=2018-10-13|last2=Ryman|first2=Anne|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall of 2018, a CBS News investigation of Woz U cast some doubts on the professionalism of the expensive curriculum. CBS interviewed two dozen current and former students and employees, who shared their dissatisfaction with the content quality, such as documentation typos leading to confusing program errors, while some promised live lectures were actually recorded and out-of-date. One student described the 33-week online program as "a $13,000 e-book". A former "enrollment counselor" described a high-pressure sales environment, which the company denied. In a prepared statement, Woz U president Chris Coleman admitted the documentation errors and said quality control efforts were being implemented, and said curriculum was reviewed by Wozniak. The founder declined interview requests, then dodged a reporter's unannounced appearance at a conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/woz-u-steve-wozniak-former-students-employees-raise-concerns/|title=Some former students, employees say Apple co-founder's Woz U doesn't live up to promises|last=|first=|date=2018-10-01|work=CBS News|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/steve-wozniaks-woz-u-is-a-13000-e-book-former-students-say/|title=Steve Wozniak’s Woz U is 'a $13,000 e-book,' former students say|last=Zhou|first=Marrian|date=2018-10-01|work=CNET|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
