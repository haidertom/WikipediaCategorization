'''Acharya Vamana''' (latter half of the 8th century - early 9th century)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VGxKTDT0h2kC&amp;pg=PA1582&amp;lpg=PA1582&amp;dq=riti+theory+of+vamana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RJDaIVX4p3&amp;sig=oeOTSMBArS0p8T3wQqWR4nC9YjQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7xbBUq3gJ87_rAeg1oHoAg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=riti%20theory%20of%20vamana&amp;f=false Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Pali Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; was an Indian [[Rhetoric|Rhetorician]].

Vamana's investigation into the nature of a [[Kāvya]] is known as theory of Riti.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yabaluri.org/TRIVENI/CDWEB/thephilosophyofritiapr69.htm The Philosophy of Riti - Yabaluri.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vamana’s [[Kavyalankara Sutra]] is considered as the first attempt at evolving a [[Philosophy of education|philosophy]] of literary [[aesthetics]]. He regarded that riti is the soul of Kavya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Vamana Vamana definition of Vamana in the Free Online Encyclopedia.]&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his formulations in the form of [[Sutras]].

'''Ajaz Anwar''' [ [[Urdu]]: اعجاز انور ] is a distinguished [[Painting|painter]] of [[Pakistan]]. He was a gold medalist at Punjab University &amp; he completed his M.A in Fine Arts from Punjab University. Later, he went to [[teacher|teach]] at [[National College of Arts]] [[Lahore]]. His [[watercolour]] [[paintings]] show the grandeur of the old buildings and the cultural life in [[Lahore]].

==Life==
Born in [[Ludhiana]] in 1946, his father was a [[cartoonist]] who apparently had stirred his passion from childhood and from whom he drew his inspiration. After obtaining his M.A. in [[Fine Arts]] and a [[Gold medal]] in 1967 from Punjab University (PUCAD) Lahore, he completed his Ph.D in [[Muslim]] architecture, in [[Turkey]] in 1978 and proceeded to do a course on Conservation of Cultural Property at [[UNESCO]], [[Rome]] in 1977. From 1972 he has been lecturing until he became Professor and Director of Art Gallery NCA, [[Lahore]] to date.

==Old buildings==
The old buildings of [[Lahore]] are the main theme of his paintings. He has tried to preserve those buildings in his paintings which are replaced by new style buildings or they are crumbling. These are the buildings of old Lahore; not all are historical, but common homes of common people are the centre of his attention. Natural lively colours bring the buildings to life.

==People in his paintings==
Although buildings are the main theme of his paintings and people are just there to make a normal life but the characters he used in his paintings are the quintessential of daily life in [[Lahore]] or [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. The characters are faceless but they represent the common people found in the bazaars: A Tonga rider, women walking in the bazaar, children playing, milkman, old people talking, and sellers of all kinds.

==Kites==
Kites are almost always present in his paintings. His main themes are common homes or buildings and on the roof of every building there is a kite lover and on the sky above there are lot of kites colouring the sky.

==Life in detail==
With close observation we find a detailed life in his paintings. A woman is peeping from the window or behind the curtain, a cock is searching for food bits in the garbage.

==Comments on his work==
"In my paintings, I highlight the parts of [[Lahore]] that must be preserved. I remove skyscrapers and instead incorporate tongas and sweetmeat shops," he said in an interview. The main focus of his paintings are not human figures. "The [[human]] figures are only used to bring these crumbling buildings to life. People are not important aspects of my art because they are born and reborn whereas these buildings, once destroyed, will be lost forever."

Ajaz Anwar was the recipient of the President’s "Pride of Performance in Painting" in 1997.

==Exhibitions==
[[Lahore]], [[Ankara]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Istanbul]], [[Rome]], [[Kampala]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Delhi]] and [[London]].

Ajaz Anwar leads Lahore Conservation Society and doing his utmost to preserve the [[Lahore]] as it was and preserving Lahore's heritage has become a personal crusade. "This is not in good taste and it does not resemble the original shape of these shops at all," said Ajaz Anwar to [[BBC]].

'''Amargosa Opera House and Hotel''' is a historic building and cultural center located in [[Death Valley Junction, California|Death Valley Junction]], in eastern [[Inyo County, California]] near [[Death Valley National Park]]. Resident artist [[Marta Becket]] staged dance and mime shows there from the late 1960s until her final show in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pvtimes.com/news/soiree-planned-for-beckets-final-stage-performance|title=Soiree Planned for Becket's Final Stage Performance|author=Dean, Charlene|date=10 February 2012|work=Pahrump Valley Times|accessdate=2012-04-15|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616113114/http://pvtimes.com/news/soiree-planned-for-beckets-final-stage-performance|archive-date=2013-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Death Valley Junction Historic District is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is owned by the [[nonprofit]] established by Becket for the preservation of the property.&lt;ref name="pvt201201" /&gt;

The theater was part of a [[company town]] designed by architect Alexander Hamilton McCulloch and constructed in 1923&amp;ndash;25 by the [[Pacific Coast Borax Company]]. The U-shaped complex of [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture]] style [[adobe]] buildings included company offices, employees' headquarters, a dormitory and a 23-room&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotelguides.com/hotels/california/shoshone/211340.html "Amargosa Opera House Motel Shoshone"].

''Amargosa Opera House (official website)''. Retrieved 2013-05-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When the town of Amargosa was booming due to the Borax mining business, and its position at the terminus of the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, about 350 people lived in the town. The hotel served as a very  nice place to stay for both company executives and visiting investors, who were met at the train with white-gloved valets after a long and hot train ride. In addition to the hotel rooms, the cafe and a restaurant within the hotel, other rooms were bunkhouses for workers, an infirmary, a general store and what is now the Opera House, which was mostly used for showing films. A large gas station and garage across from the cafe was the only location in the area for repairs of trucks hauling borax out of the mines, in addition to passenger car repairs. When the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad ceased to be economical in 1942, the tracks were torn up completely and sent to Egypt, where the railroad was set up again to aid the Allies military effort in Egypt. Once the railroad stopped, the Opera House, Hotel and about 250 acres of land changed hands many times, until Marta Becket arrived on the scene.

Marta Becket rented the recreation hall in 1967, when it was known as Corkhill Hall; she began repairs, created the sets, and painted murals on the adobe walls.&lt;ref name="pvt201201" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SantaMariaTimes2008" /&gt; She renamed it the Amargosa, the original name of the former mining town.&lt;ref name="metroactive" /&gt; In 1970, journalists from ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' discovered Becket doing a performance at the Amargosa Opera House without an audience. Their profile and another in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' led to an international interest in Becket and her theater.

In 1974, Becket completed her murals&lt;ref name="SantaMariaTimes2008" /&gt; and established the nonprofit Amargosa Opera House, Inc. to continue preservation of the property.&lt;ref name="pvt201201"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pvtimes.com/news/marta-becket-to-retire/|title=Marta Becket to retire|author=Dean, Charlene|date=13 January 2012|work=Pahrump Valley Times|accessdate=2012-05-21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130616113135/http://pvtimes.com/news/marta-becket-to-retire/|archive-date=2013-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[Trust for Public Land]], the nonprofit bought the town of Death Valley Junction, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 1981.&lt;ref name="amgTheOperaHse" /&gt; In 1983, the Opera House bought 120 theater seats from the Boulder City Theater in [[Boulder City, Nevada]] to replace the worn garden chairs&lt;ref name="amgTheOperaHse"&gt;[http://www.amargosa-opera-house.com/operahhouse.htm "The Opera House"].

Jenna McClintock saw a performance when she was six years old and was inspired to start training in ballet.  After a career with the Oakland Ballet, Jenna returned to thank Marta, and decided to stay and maintain the tradition. Jenna retired from the Amargosa Opera House in the spring of 2016.

Hilda Vazquez requested to perform for Marta Becket on her 92th birthday while visiting the Amargosa Opera House and Hotel on a road trip from Massachusetts, both unaware that Marta Becket had no dancer. Hilda Vazquez, a ballerina from Dominican Republic, was invited to perform in the Amargosa Opera House for 2 years by Marta Becket. Marta Becket and Hilda Vazquez rehearsed for many months. Marta Becket took Hilda as her student and gave her all the secrets to her performances repertoire created of ballet and pantomime. Marta Becket entrusted the legacy of the Opera House to Hilda Vazquez. They rehearsed and worked hard on the performances and on Marta Becket's last day they danced together on the sands of Death Valley.

The Amargosa Hotel is open year-round for visitors from all over the world. Beyond these maintained areas, the town of Death Valley Junction is almost a [[ghost town]]. There are no gas stations. The single restaurant, the Amargosa Cafe, was part of the Opera House and Hotel, and has recently re-opened with an Australian-American cook making very upscale, Australian-American fusion roadhouse/coffee shop meals, pastries and coffees from espresso to American drip.  The interior of the Cafe is like a time capsule, like most of the Amargosa Hotel, with an old counter and circular counter chairs.

There are few survivals of ancient Greek and Roman [[furniture]], but a number of images in [[relief]]s, painted pottery and other media. It was normally made of wood, but expensive examples were often fitted with metalwork elements, which have a better chance of survival. The styles were generally rather light and elegant in upper-class furniture, and by modern standards apparently not heavily upholstered. Some items entirely in metal, such as lampstands, braziers and stands for sacrifice, have survived, and some covered by the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] have either been carbonized or left hollows in the volcanic rock that can be used as moulds for [[plaster of Paris]], allowing a clear idea of their original form.  The rich had tables and chairs supported by marble, and some of these have survived. [[Wicker]] was widely used for [[armchair (furniture)|armchairs]].

==Greek furniture==
'''Ancient Greek furniture''' was typically constructed out of wood, though it might also be made of stone or metal, such as bronze, iron, gold and silver. Little wood survives from [[ancient Greece]], though varieties mentioned in texts concerning Greece and Rome include maple, oak, beech, yew, and willow.&lt;ref&gt;G.M.A. Richter, ''The Furniture of the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans'' (London: Phaidon, 1966), 122. First published in 1926 with an updated version in 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Pieces were assembled using [[Mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] joinery, held together with lashings, pegs, metal nails, and glue. Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, furniture could be veneered with expensive types of wood in order to make the object appear more costly,&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; though classical furniture was often pared down in comparison to objects attested in the East, or those from earlier periods in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanus T. A. M. Mols, ''Wooden Furniture in Herculaneum: Form, Technique and Function'', in  vol. 2 of Circumvesuviana (Amsterdam: Gieben, 1999), 10. These relatively simple varieties of furniture may be connected to ancient Greek sumptuary laws. The effects of these laws on craftsmen are discussed by Alison Burford in ''Craftsmen in Greek and Roman Society'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1972), 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extensive research was done on the forms of Greek furniture by [[Gisela Richter]], who utilized a typological approach based primarily on illustrated examples depicted in Greek art, and it is from Richter’s account that the main types can be delineated.&lt;ref&gt;See section on “Greek Furniture” in Richter, 13-84, in which the author describes Greek furniture and its typology.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek seating===
[[File:Parthenon frieze east IV fragment.JPG|thumb|left|Block IV from the east frieze of the Parthenon, with images of seated gods, ca. 447–433 BCE.]]

The modern word “[[throne]]” is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: θρόνος), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Less extravagant though more influential in later periods is the ''[[klismos]]'' (Greek singular: κλισμός), an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design. A fine example is shown on the grave stele of Hegeso, dating to the late fifth century B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Maria Gigante, “Funerary Art,” in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed. Michael Gagarin and Elaine Fantham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), 246.&lt;/ref&gt; As with earlier furniture from the east, the ''klismos'' and ''thronos'' could be accompanied by footstools.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of footstools outlined by Richter – those with plain straight legs, those with curved legs, and those shaped like boxes that would have sat directly on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of Greek seat was the backless stool, which must have been found in every Greek home. These were apparently known as [[Diphros|''diphroi'']] (Greek singular: δίφρος), and were easily portable.&lt;ref&gt;E. Guhl, and W. Koner, ''Everyday Life in Greek and Roman Times'' (New York: Crescent, 1989), 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze]] displays numerous examples, upon which the gods are seated.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Simpson, “Furniture,” in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed. Michael Gagarin and Elaine Fantham (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Several fragments of a stool were discovered in a fourth-century B.C.E. tomb in [[Thessaloniki]], including two of the legs and four transverse stretchers. Once made of wood and covered in silver foil, all that remains of this piece are the parts made of precious metal.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitra Andrianou, ''The Furniture and Furnishings of Ancient Greek Houses and Tombs'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009) 28-29, figure 6a.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Greek furniture 002.jpg|thumb|A Greek [[symposium]]]]

The folding stool, known as the ''diphros okladias'' (Greek singular: δίφρος ὀκλαδίας), was practical and portable. The Greek folding stool survives in numerous depictions, indicating its popularity in the Archaic and Classical periods; the type may have been derived from earlier Minoan and Mycenaean examples, which in turn were likely based on Egyptian models.&lt;ref&gt;Ole Wanscher, ''Sella Curulis: The Folding Stool, an Ancient Symbol of Dignity'' (Copenhagen: Rosenkilde and Bagger, 1980), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Greek folding stools might have plain straight legs or curved legs that typically ended in animal feet.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klinai===
[[File:Locri Pinax Persephone Opens Liknon Mystikon.jpg|thumb|Relief with [[Persephone]]]]
A couch or [[Klinai|''kline'']] (Roman singular: κλίνη) was a form used in Greece as early as the late seventh century B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kline'' was rectangular and supported on four legs, two of which could be longer than the other, providing support for an armrest or headboard. Three types are distinguished by Richter – those with animal legs, those with “turned” legs, and those with “rectangular” legs, although this terminology is somewhat problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 54; Richter defines “turned” (as in lathe-turned) legs on page 19 as being tripartite, with a middle “lozenge-shaped” portion capped by conical, “flaring” pieces at either end. This terminology is problematic in that it implies woodworking techniques, while the “turned” leg could have been executed in other materials, such as stone, metal, or ivory. Richter defines “rectangular” legs on page 23 as those that are “straight” though these can be curved and footed, and often decorated with palettes and volutes.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fabric would have been draped over the woven platform of the couch, and cushions would have been placed against the arm or headrest, making the Greek couch an item well suited for a [[symposium]] gathering. The foot of a bronze bed discovered in situ in the House of the Seals at [[Delos]] provides an indication of how the “turned” legs of a ''kline'' might have appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Andrianou, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous images of ''klinai'' are displayed on vases, topped by layers of intricately woven fabrics and pillows. These furnishings would have been made of leather, wool, or linen, though silk could also have been used. Stuffing for pillows, cushions, and beds could have been made of wool, feathers, leaves, or hay.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek tables===
In general, Greek tables (Greek singular: τράπεζα, τρἰπους, τετράπους, φάτνη, ὲλεóς) were low and often appear in depictions alongside ''klinai'' and could perhaps fit underneath.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of Greek table had a rectangular top supported on three legs, though numerous configurations exist. Tables could have circular tops, and four legs or even one central leg instead of three. Tables in ancient Greece were used mostly for dining purposes – in depictions of banquets, it appears as though each participant would have utilized a single table, rather than a collective use of a larger piece. On such occasions, tables would have been moved according to one's needs.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tables also would have figured prominently in religious contexts, as indicated in vase paintings. One example by the Chicago Painter from The Art Institute of Chicago, dating to around 450 B.C.E., shows an image of three women performing a Dionysian ritual, in which a table functions as an appropriate place to rest a ''kantharos'' – a wine vessel associated with Dionysus.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Painter, stamnos, ca. 450 B.C.E. [http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/177 The Art Institute of Chicago, 1889.22].&lt;/ref&gt; Other images indicate that tables could range in style from the highly ornate to the relatively unadorned.

==Roman furniture==
[[File:Herculaneum Casa del Tramezzo di Legno Letto.jpg|thumb|left|Carbonized bed from the Casa del Tramezzo di Legno in [[Herculaneum]]]]

To a large extent, the types and styles of ancient Roman furniture followed those of their Classical and Hellenistic Greek predecessors. Because of this it is difficult to differentiate Roman forms from earlier Hellenistic ones in many cases. [[Gisela Richter]]’s typological approach is useful in tracing developments of Greek furniture into Roman expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 97-116.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of Roman furniture is derived mainly from depictions in [[fresco]]es and representations in sculpture, along with actual pieces of furniture, fragments, and fittings, several of which were preserved by the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79. The most well-known archaeological sites with preserved images and fragments from the eruption are [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] in [[Italy]]. There are fine examples of reconstructed Roman furniture at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] as well as the [[Capitoline Museum]] in [[Rome]].

===Chairs===
The ''sella'', or stool or chair, was the most common type of seating in the Roman period, probably because of its easy portability. In addition, the ''sella'' in its simplest form was inexpensive to make. Both slaves and emperors used it, although those of the poor were surely plain, while the wealthy had access to precious woods, ornamented with inlay, metal fittings, ivory, and silver and gold leaf. Bronze ''sellae'' from Herculaneum were square in form and had straight legs, decorative stretchers, and a dished seat.&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Pirzio Biroli Stefanelli, ''Il bronzo dei romani: arredo e suppellettile'' (Rome: L’Erma" di Bretschneider, 1991), 140-142.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sella Curulis|''sella curulis'']], or folding stool, was an important indicator of power in the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Wanscher, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; There were ''sellae'' resembling both stools and chairs that folded in a scissor fashion to facilitate transport.&lt;ref&gt;Roger B. Ulrich, ''Roman Woodworking'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007), 221.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Triclinium - Archäologische Staatssammlung München.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed [[triclinium]] or dining room, with three ''[[klinai]]'' or couches]]
[[File:Brasero de Pompeya.jpg|thumb|Metal [[brazier]] with [[satyr]]s, from [[Pompei]]]]

The Roman ''cathedra'' was a chair with a back, although there is disagreement as to the exact meaning of the Latin term. Richter defines the ''cathedra'' as a later version of the Greek ''klismos'', which she says was never as popular as its Greek predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 101; Ulrich, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;  A. T. Croom, however, considers the ''cathedra'' to be a high-backed wickerwork chair that was typically associated with women. They have also been seen being used as early school teachers, pupils would sit around him in this chair while he taught. It showed who held the seat of power in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Croom, ''Roman Furniture'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire, Great Britain: Tempus, 2007), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  As with Greek furniture, the names of various Roman types as found in texts cannot always be associated with known furniture forms with certainty.

The Latin ''solium'' is considered to be equivalent to the Greek term ''thronos'' and thus is often translated as “throne.”&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 98; Ulrich, 215-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  These were like modern chairs, with backs and arm rests. Three types of ''solia'' based on Greek prototypes are distinguished by Richter: thrones with “turned” and “rectangular” legs and grandiose thrones with solid sides, of which several examples remain in stone.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 98-101.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, a type with a high back and arms, resting upon a cylindrical or conical base, is said to derive from Etruscan prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 10. According to Ulrich, Pliny uses the Greek term ''cathedra'' instead of ''solium'' for wicker armchairs, 215-218. Croom, however, refers to this chair as ''cathedra'' on p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Couches===
Few actual Roman couches survive, although sometimes the bronze fittings do, which help with the reconstruction of the original forms. While in wealthy households beds were used for sleeping in the bedrooms (''lectus cubicularis''), and couches for banqueting while reclining were used in the dining rooms (''lectus tricliniaris''), the less well off might use the same piece of furniture for both functions.&lt;ref&gt;Croom, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two types might be used interchangeably even in richer households, and it is not always easy to differentiate between sleeping and dining furniture. The most common type of Roman bed took the form of a three-sided, open rectangular box, with the fourth (long) side of the bed open for access.  While some beds were framed with boards, others had slanted structures at the ends, called ''fulcra'', to better accommodate pillows. The ''fulcra'' of elaborate dining couches often had sumptuous decorative attachments featuring ivory, bronze, copper, gold or silver ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, 232-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bench, or ''subsellium'', was an elongated stool for two or more users. Benches were considered to be “seats of the humble,” and were used in peasant houses, farms, and bathhouses. However, they were also found in lecture halls, in the vestibules of temples, and served as the seats of senators and judges. Roman benches, like their Greek precedents, were practical for the seating of large groups of people and were common in theaters, amphitheaters, odeons and auctions.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, 104; Croom, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''scamnum'', related to the ''subsellium'' but smaller, was used as both a bench and a footstool.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tables===
Types of Roman tables include the ''abacus'' and the ''mensa'', which are distinguished from one another in Latin texts. The term ''abacus'' might be used for utilitarian tables, such as those for making shoes or kneading dough, as well as high-status tables, such as sideboards for the display of silver.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;  A low, three-legged table, thought to represent the ''mensa delphica'', was often depicted next to reclining banqueters in Roman paintings. This table has a round tabletop supported by three legs configured like those of a tripod.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich, 225.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several wooden tables of this type were recovered from Herculaneum.

===Remainings===
The most important source for wooden furniture of the Roman period is the collection of carbonized furniture from [[Herculaneum]]. While the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 C.E. was tremendously destructive to the region, the hot liquid lava that engulfed the town of Herculaneum ultimately preserved the wooden furniture, shelves, doors, and shutters in carbonized form.&lt;ref&gt;Mols, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Their preservation, however, is imperiled, as some of the pieces remain in situ in their houses and shops, encased in unprotected glass or entirely open and accessible. Upon excavation, much of the furniture was conserved with paraffin wax mixed with carbon powder, which coats the wood and obscures important details such as decorations and joinery. It is now impossible to remove the wax coating without further damaging the furniture. Several wooden pieces were found with bone and metal fittings.&lt;ref&gt;Mols, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden shelving and racks are fund in shops and kitchens in the Vesuvian sites, and one house has elaborate wooden room dividers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1934">The '''Aotearoa Television Network (ATN)''' was the first, yet unsuccessful television station operating in the [[Māori language]].

What would eventually become ATN started out in early 1996, when [[Te Māngai Pāho]] started looking for tenders for a trial service operating on a UHF licence in Auckland. The winner of the TMP contract, led by Puhi Rangiaho, Tawini Rangahau, Morehu McDonald, Robert Pouwhare and Tukuroirangi Morgan, was announced on March 7 and broadcasting commenced on May 1. The pilot service became regular in October, becoming a normal regional station. TMP's budget only allowed a 500-watt transmitter which resulted in weak or no signal in the ATN catchment area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Middleton |first1=Julia |title=Television - Ka Rangona te Reo - The Development of Māori-language Television Broadcasting in Aotearoa New Zealand |url=http://tekaharoa.com/index.php/tekaharoa/article/viewFile/73/43 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 September 2015 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insufficient funding and related uncertainties resulted in the closure of this pilot service in early 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dunleavy |first1=Trisha |title=Television - Māori television |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/television/page-3 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=24 August 2015 |date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monthly journal '''''az-Zuhūr''''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الزهور; [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft|DMG]]: az-Zuhūr; [[English language|english]]: "Flowers") was published in [[Cairo]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. az-Zuhūr, 1910–1913.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1910 until 1913. Altogether, 40 issues exist. The editor Anṭūn al-Ǧumayyil (1887-1948) did already participate in the publication of the [[Beirut|Beirutian]] newspaper ''al-Bašīr'' (1870-1947) and the Egyptian newspaper ''[[Al-Ahram|al-Ahrām]]'' (1875-today).&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Glaß (2004): ''Der al-Muqtaṭaf und seine Öffentlichkeit. Aufklärung, Räsonnement und Meinungsstreit in der frühen arabischen Zeitschriftenkommunikation'', 2 Bde., Würzburg, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature and art were the main focus whereat the journal mainly tried to support young authors and to improve the relationship between arab writers from different regions.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Kendall (2006): ''Literature, Journalism and the Avant-Garde: Intersection in Egypt'', New York, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition ''az-Zuhūr'' wanted to keep the balance between European and contemporary Arabic literature like some other later popular journals.

Beside literary criticism, book reviews and news about the literary life in [[Egypt]], the authors stand up for the establishment and enhancement of the egyptian theatre. ''Az-Zuhūr'' was the first journal to publish in its series a play of [[Shakespeare]], [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]. Until the cut-off in 1913 the journal organized numerous writing competitions which helped to achieve more popularity.&lt;ref&gt; Elizabeth Kendall (2006): ''Literature, Journalism and the Avant-Garde: Intersection in Egypt'', New York, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually ''az-Zuhūr'' was able to add a significant contribution to the Egyptian literary life.

'''Azerbaijan Photographers Union''' (APU) is the public, creative, [[non-profit]] organization, based on the principles of [[open society]], [[voluntarism (action)|voluntariness]] and [[self-government]].

It acts under the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]] and Charter of the Union.

The Azerbaijan Photographers Union was registered in the Ministry of Justice of the [[Azerbaijan]] Republic on the 20 November 1998 by certificate number 1073.

At the beginning of 1990, with the collapse of the USSR, all working structures became worthless and it became apparent that there was need of an organization in which professional and amateur photographers — all those who are devoted to photographic art — would join together.

At that time a serious, uniting moment in the organization's establishment became preparation and holding of the ''Photographers of Azerbaijan'' exhibition in Nantes, France in November 1995, where 105 works by 24 photographers were presented.

After the exhibition in France, there were 3 years of debates, the charter's complying, overcoming obstacles, and the initiative group was formed to tackle this - registered the Union officially, although actually the Union already acted from 1994 on a voluntary basis, without legal status.

The main purposes and tasks of the APU are promotion to the national development of photo art, popularization of its achievements in the country and abroad, preservation and creative use of photographic heritage. With the purpose of promotion and development of photo art the Union organizes exhibitions, competitions, festivals, master classes, conferences and symposiums with the participation of the Azerbaijani and foreign photographers, as well as promotes the amateur movement.

10 years passed from the APU's establishment. During this period the members of the creative union have organized and taken part in more than 100 exhibitions, including more than 30 in foreign countries (USA, UK, France, Turkey, Germany, Belgium, Ukraine, Greece, Russia, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia etc.).

The Chairman of the Board is Mirnaib Hasanoglu.

'''Caffe Cino''' was an [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theater founded in 1958 by [[Joe Cino]]. The [[West Village, Manhattan|West Village]] coffeehouse, located at 31 Cornelia Street, was initially imagined as a venue for [[poetry]], [[folk music]], and [[Art exhibition|visual art exhibitions]]. The plays produced at the Cino, however, became most prominent, and it is now considered the "birthplace of Off-Off-Broadway".&lt;ref name="birthplace"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/theater/donation-to-library-opens-new-portal-to-caffe-cino.html|title=Portal to Off Off Broadway's Early Days|author=Steven McElroy|first=|date=December 7, 2001|work=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Many paragraphs from the [[Joe Cino]] page should be brought over or reworked into articles on this page. --&gt;

==Beginnings and early productions==
[[Joe Cino]] was born into an [[Italian-American]] family, and moved from [[Buffalo, New York]] to be a [[Dance|dancer]] in [[New York City]]. After ten years, he used his $400 in savings and opened the "Caffe Cino Art Gallery".&lt;ref name="gallery"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/caffe-cino-joe-cino-gay-off-off-broadway-theater|title=The Gay Coffeehouse Where Off-Off Broadway Theater Was Born|author=Natasha Frost|first=|date=February 9, 2018|work=Atlas Obscura|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Cino encouraged his friends to hang their artwork on the walls. That led to poetry readings, which led to [[Stage reading|staged readings]] and eventually to productions of plays.&lt;ref name="beginning"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thevillager.com/2015/12/02/magic-time-at-the-caffe-cino/|title='Magic Time' at the Caffe Cino|author=Dusica Sue Malesevic|first=|date=December 2, 2015|work=The Villager (Manhattan)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early days of the Cino, plays were produced on the floor. A makeshift 8x8-foot stage was later created using milk cartons and carpet remnants. Productions were initially limited to 30 minutes, and the audience could stand anywhere. The space was only 18x30-feet, and audience members often perched atop the [[cigarette machine]].&lt;ref name="gallery" /&gt; Admission was one dollar, and audience members were offered a coffee and an Italian pastry along with the show.&lt;ref name="beginning" /&gt;

== The fire (1965) and Joe Cino's death (1967) ==
On [[Ash Wednesday]] of 1965, a fire destroyed the interior of the Cino. The building's structure was not affected. A new lighting system had recently been installed, along with the fireproofing of the Caffe's ceiling, which prevented the fire from spreading to the rest of the [[tenement building]].&lt;ref name="fire"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/09/10/caffe-cino-goes-up-in-smoke/|title=Caffe Cino Goes Up in Smoke|author=Tony Ortega|first=|date=September 10, 2009|work=The Village Voice|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official cause of the fire was a [[gas leak]], but some suspected that Cino's lover [[Arson|set the fire]]. The community raised money by staging [[benefit performance]]s while the Caffe was closed for renovations.&lt;ref name="birthplace" /&gt; [[Ellen Stewart]], founder of [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]], offered Cino and his staff a space to continue Caffe Cino productions on Sunday and Monday nights at her theater.&lt;ref name="fire" /&gt;

Joe Cino died three days after an [[attempted suicide]] in 1967. Some{{who|date=November 2018}} suspected that the attempt was due to the death of Cino's lover, John Torrey, and to his drug use.&lt;ref name="gallery" /&gt;{{Not in citation given|date=November 2018}}

==Notable contributors==
The Caffe Cino was an incubator for first-time directors, playwrights, actors, and lighting or set designers. Many continued to work in stage, screen, or both after the Cino closed. Notable contributors include:

A '''coffin home''' ({{zh|t=義莊|s=义庄|cy=yih-jōng|p=yìzhuāng}}; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{nihongo||義荘|gisō}}) is a temporary [[coffin]] depository where the coffins containing the [[cadaver]]s of recently diseased people are temporarily stored while awaiting transport to the place of burial. The term is also losely used to refer to [[Bedspace apartment]]s.

''Yih-jong'' (義莊) literally means "mansion of righteousness" and originally referred to any [[charitable organization]]. These charities were typically established by prominent families to promote their standing in the community. The designation ''yih-jong'' was first used by Fan's Yih-Jong (范氏義莊), established by [[Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]] imperial chancellor [[Fan Zhongyan]] in his hometown [[Suzhou]]. Emulating Fan's model, many prominent families founded yih-jongs between the Song and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dyanasties to support their clansmen and local communities, offering charitable services such as [[Orphanage|orphanages]], free schools, [[Disaster response|disaster relief]], and [[Morgue|mortuaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jscz.gov.cn/pub/jscz/czwh/shzc/201409/t20140929_63427.html|title=清代民间慈善事业-史海摘萃|last=|first=|date=|website=江苏省财政厅|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.sohu.com/a/192738555_750828?_f=m-article_34_feeds_14|title=家族·慈善 {{!}} 北宋范仲淹创立的“范氏义庄”为何持续了800多年？-历史频道-手机搜狐|website=m.sohu.com|language=zh-cn|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''yih-jong'' eventually became a euphemism for "coffin home" or "morgue" by the late 19th century. This is because they were the ''de facto'' [[Funeral director|undertakers]] of dead people whose next of kin could not be found or were too poor to afford funeral services, and provided temporary storage and transport of the coffins and bodies of emigrants who desired burial in their place of origin. The establishment of [[Tung Wah Coffin Home]] in Hong Kong in 1875, named "Tung Wah Yih Jong" (東華義莊) in [[Cantonese|Cantonese Chinese]], firmly entrenched this euphemistic use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Coffin homes are primarily found in [[Greater China]] and places with substantial [[overseas Chinese]] populations. Most coffins that pass through the care of a coffin home are those of [[Migrant worker|migrant workers]] who die in their place of work but who desired burial in their home villages. Coffin homes also provide temporary storage for deceased persons who are unable to afford a [[funeral]] or whose relatives cannot be located.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hk01.com/%E7%A4%BE%E5%8D%80/75579/%E5%A4%A7%E5%8F%A3%E7%92%B0%E6%9B%BE%E6%98%AF%E9%9D%88%E9%AD%82%E4%B8%AD%E8%BD%89%E7%AB%99-%E5%8A%A9%E6%95%B8%E4%BB%A5%E8%90%AC%E8%A8%88%E8%8F%AF%E4%BA%BA%E6%AD%BB%E5%BE%8C-%E5%9B%9E%E5%AE%B6-%E7%9A%84%E6%9D%B1%E8%8F%AF%E7%BE%A9%E8%8E%8A|title=大口環曾是靈魂中轉站：助數以萬計華人死後「回家」的東華義莊|last=呂嘉麗|website=香港01|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kknews.cc/history/envgez.html|title=解放前，專門寄放棺柩屍體的義莊是什麼樣子的|access-date=2017-11-27|language=zh-tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2087">'''Columbia Artists Management, Inc.''' ('''CAMI''') is an international talent management [[talent agent|agency]].

==History==
Based in [[New York City]], it was formed in 1930 as Columbia Concerts Corporation by [[Arthur Judson]] and [[William S. Paley]], the then head of the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]], who helped merge seven independent concert bureaus in the United States.

During its existence, CAMI has represented a very large number of active classical artists worldwide, including singers [[Leontyne Price]], [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Mario Lanza]], [[Jussi Björling]], [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Paul Robeson]], and [[George London (bass-baritone)|George London]]; pianists [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli]], and [[Van Cliburn]]; violinists [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], and [[Tossy Spivakovsky]]; and conductors [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Herbert von Karajan]], and [[Otto Klemperer]].

Composers [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Aaron Copland]] were managed by CAMI when they appeared as performers.

British music commentator [[Norman Lebrecht]] has criticized CAMI and Wilford for what Lebrecht deems to be overly pervasive influence of them on conductor salaries and limited time spent by music directors with orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/01/24/banorm24.xml Norman Lebrecht, "Could Silver Fox, the manager of maestros, be losing his grip?".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8935">As used by copyright theorists, the term '''copynorm'''  (or more frequently '''copynorms''') is used to refer to a [[Norm (sociology)|normalized social standard]] regarding the [[Ethics|ethical]] issue of duplicating [[copyright]]ed material.  

Questions about the ethics of copying came to public attention as a result of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] systems, such as [[Napster]], [[Gnutella]], [[KaZaA]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[Direct Connect (file sharing)|Direct Connect]].  Survey research indicates that most users of filesharing systems do not believe that it is wrong to download [[MP3]] files of copyrighted [[music]], even though such downloading may be unlawful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} 

These questions are important to legal theory, because the ability of copyright law to control the copying of digital material may depend more on voluntary compliance than on hypothetical criminal or civil actions against individuals.

== Legal background ==
Copyright law is actually a collection of legal rules.  Typically, copyright statutes confer a bundle of legal rights on the author or proprietor of a work (writing, a musical composition or an image), including the exclusive right to make copies of the work, subject to the [[fair use]]. Legal rules carry legal consequences.  Violation of copyrights can give rise to [[Civil liability|civil]] and [[criminal liability]].  

In the [[United States]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] grants [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] power to secure exclusive rights of authors to their writings, and Congress has exercised that power in a comprehensive statutory scheme, codified in [[Title 17 of the United States Code]]. 

Each nation has its own copyright laws and international treaties set minimum standards for copyright legislation.  This entry focuses on the laws of the United States as an example.

== Social rules ==
Copynorms are informal [[social rules]].  Social norms include rules of etiquette as well as moral norms (such as the moral prohibitions on theft or murder) and quasi-moral norms (such as the social rules that create zones of privacy in public places).  Copynorms are simply the informal social norms that determine the social acceptability of copying works created by others.  Social norms are enforced by informal social sanctions, ranging from simple expressions of disapproval (mild) to shunning or vandalism (severe).

Copyright law and copynorms are interrelated but distinct.  Some copying that is not prohibited by copyright law violates copynorms—[[plagiarism]] of work in the [[public domain]] would be an example.  More significant to copyright theory and policy, copying that is prohibited by law may be considered socially acceptable.

== Real life examples ==
=== P2P impact ===
In the late 1990s and early in the 2000s, [[peer-to-peer filesharing]] over the [[Internet]] became increasingly popular.  The first P2P program to receive widespread attention in the media and popular consciousness was [[Napster]].  After the Napster service was shut down by an injunction issued by the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]], a variety of other P2P ([[Gnutella]], [[Bearshare]], [[Kazaa]], etc.) programs became popular.  Perhaps the most significant use of P2P programs involves the distribution of MP3 files created by ripping copyrighted music from a commercial Compact Disc.  The use of P2P to distribute digital copies of [[Digital Versatile Disc|DVD]] files has also grown in popularity.

There is considerable controversy over the application of the copyright laws to individual, noncommercial use of P2P programs to distribute MP3 files, but judicial opinion, so far, has sided with the music industry and held that an individual who copies and distributes an MP3 file containing copyrighted music violates federal copyright law.  Nonetheless, the use of P2P to share and download copyrighted music is considered socially acceptable.  Survey research supports this conclusion{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}, as does the use of P2P programs by tens or hundreds of millions of persons.

=== Other cases ===
Although P2P has been the focal point in discussions of copynorms, the phenomenon is more general in scope.  Some other contexts in which copynorms diverge from [[United States copyright law]] include the following:
*Videotape recording of copyrighted broadcast and cable television content for archival (as opposed to time shifting) use,
*Systematic photocopying of books and journal articles for academic and business use,
*Audiotape recording of live music concerts,
*The use of copyrighted digital images ([[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[JPEG]], etc.) on personal websites.

To varying degrees, in each of these cases, copying that violates the law is socially acceptable.  [[Anecdotal evidence]] suggests that illegal archiving of television programs is widely regarded as socially acceptable, and it is doubtful that many users of home Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs) are aware that this activity is unlawful in some countries.

== Causes of divergence ==
In the absence of [[social science]] research, theorizing about the causes of the divergence between copyright laws and copynorms is necessarily speculative.  Several tentative hypotheses have been suggested.  A simple rational choice model might suggest that illegal copying is accepted simply because it is in the self-interest of individuals who can obtain copyrighted materials for free with very little risk of getting caught.

Another possible factor is connected to technological change.  Copying technology was relatively centralized and expensive until after the middle of the twentieth century.  Until the advent of inexpensive audio tape recorders, the sharing of copyrighted recordings was very difficult and expensive.  The transition from reel-to-reel to 8-track cartridge and later cassette tape recorders reduced costs substantially, but a significant investment of time was required to make each copy.  Digital technology, the [[Internet]], and specialized P2P software in turn substantially reduced the costs of file sharing.  Social norms develop over time and necessarily emerge only with respect to conduct that is sufficiently feasible to become a social issue.

A third factor springs from the fact that most laypeople do not know the precise scope of the monopoly that a copyright grants to the author (or copyright holder).

A final factor concerns the perceived legitimacy or justice of copyright laws.  Many individuals may believe that copyright laws are unjust.  For example, many users of P2P programs believe that large music companies rather than artists are the beneficiaries of the [[economic rent]]s created by copyright laws.  The most fervent advocates will engage in public [[civil disobedience]] of those parts of copyright law that they believe unjust, in hope of getting an eventual [[jury nullification]] or otherwise bringing the issues to public attention.

Although the empirical research on copynorms is limited, important survey research has been done by the [[Pew Center on Internet and Society]].

== Implications ==
Implications of weak copynorms for copyright theory and policy are a large and complex question.  
The content of copyright law may affect the emergence of copynorms.  For example, if copyright law is perceived as fair and legitimate, this may strengthen copynorms.  Weak copynorms may prevent copyright law from achieving its policy goals.  For example, the music industry has argued that P2P has reduced sales, and hence investments in the industry's production of new music recordings.

Proposals for more vigorous enforcement of copyright laws against individual users may affect copynorms, although both the direction and magnitude are uncertain.  On one hand, more enforcement might strengthen copynorms by expressing social disapproval of illegal copying.  On the other hand, strict enforcement might cause a backlash, further weakening social support for the copyright laws.

This is a '''list of movies featuring recognizable dance forms''', demonstrating them, shedding light on their origin, or being the base of a plot.

This article is not about [[Dance film]] or [[Dance for camera]] which are separate genres. It is also not about [[Musical film]]s, although they often contain a significant amount of dancing. However, they are a specific form of art in itself, therefore their listings generally pertain to the articles specifically related to the topic of musicals. This by no means prevents musicals from being included here, but they are required to meet the outlined criteria. [[Fred Astaire]]'s and [[Gene Kelly]]'s filmographies may significantly contribute to these lists.

== Films with plot based on dance ==

'''''From Darkness, the Light''''' ({{lang-hu|Borura derü!}}) or '''''Allegory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences''''' ({{lang-hu|A Magyar Tudományos Akadémia allegóriája}}) is a monumental painting by [[Johann Ender]] in the Art Collection of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Budapest]]. It is also the official symbol of the institution, the main motif constituting its [[logo]].

==History==

The painting was made by Johann Ender in 1831 and it was signed by the artist on the lower right corner: Johann Ender pinx 1831. The allegorical painting was commissioned by the founder of the academy, Count [[István Széchenyi]] who donated the full annual income of his estates to establish the Hungarian Society of Learning in 1825. The scientific society came into being in 1830. There was a strong personal connection between the client and the artist who went on long journey together in the Mediterranean in 1818. Széchenyi gave many commissions to Ender in the next decades.&lt;ref&gt;Az Ender-ikrek magyar képei, Barátság, 8/3, 2001, p. 3230&lt;/ref&gt;

Ender had to implement the visual program of Széchenyi who closely followed the preparations. The artist made several preparatory drawings. When a serious disagreement broke out, Széchenyi consulted [[Friedrich von Amerling]], the most acclaimed painter in [[Vienna]] at the time. Amerling created an alternative draft but in the end Ender retained the assignment. The same composition was used on the coat of arms and the seal of the society.

On 4 June 1834 Széchenyi announced that he donated the "allegorical painting that constitutes the coat of arms of the society" to the institution. This is commemorated by the inscription in the lower left corner: "A' M. Accademiának emlékül G. Széchenyi István, 1834".

==Description==

The painting shows a young goddess wearing a white [[chiton (costume)|chiton]] and a purple cloak; there is a laurel wreath on her head. In her right hand she is holding up a gold cup, her other hand is resting on a large shield. The goddess is set in a dark landscape, where heavy clouds are gathering on the sky, but the first rays of the light are bursting through the gloom. Two eagles are coming, the first one is approaching the gold cup.

The painting supposedly portrays Count Széchenyi's lover, his later wife, Crescence Seilern. At time of its creation the goddess was identified as [[Minerva]] or [[Amphitrite]] but the composition originated in the very popular subject of Goddess [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] accompanied by the eagle of [[Jupiter]].

In the center of the shield the Hungarian coat-of-arms is flanked by Minerva and Hungaria, the latter woman is veiled but the goddess lifts up her shroud. This is another visual reference to the enlightenment that science could bring to the country. The reliefs of the shield depict a famous episode from ancient history, the meeting of [[Attila]], the ruler of the [[Huns]] with [[Pope Leo I]]. The inspiration for this scene was the famous painting by [[Raphael]] in the [[Apostolic Palace]], [[The Meeting of Leo the Great and Attila]]. At the time the Huns were generally considered the forefathers of the Hungarians.

The painting has the same elaborate [[Rococo]] frame as the contemporary monumental [[Count István Széchenyi (Friedrich von Amerling)|portrait of Count István Széchenyi]] by [[Friedrich von Amerling]].

In [[San Francisco]], Sasha Petrosevitch (Steven Seagal) is a Russian car thief who's brought in by criminal Nick Frazier (Ja Rule)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ja Rule|date=2018-08-11|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ja_Rule&amp;oldid=854451248|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; to work for crime boss Sonny Eckvall (Richard Bremmer), who apparently shot and killed Sasha's wife. After some time, FBI Special Agent Ellen "E. Z." Williams (Claudia Christian) and her team show up to nail Nick, but things go bad, and Sasha gets shot.

After eight months of recovery following his brief bout of being clinically dead from the shooting, Sasha is incarcerated along with Nick in the newly reopened Alcatraz prison. Run by the charismatic warden, Juan Ruiz "El Fuego" Escarzaga (Tony Plana), the place is known for its new state of the art death chamber where the condemned can choose from five different ways to die: lethal injection, gas chamber, hanging, firing squad, or electric chair.

Lester McKenna (Bruce Weitz), is the first death row prisoner brought to the new Alcatraz and also the first prisoner scheduled to be executed. An older man, he stole $200,000,000 worth of gold bricks in a heist that resulted in five deaths, and hid the loot at an unknown location. Federal Bureau of Prisons head Frank Hubbard ([[Stephen J. Cannell]]) and Supreme Court Justice Jane McPherson (Linda Thorson) have arrived to witness the execution, which is a result of June sentencing Lester.

But she's not the only one interested in Lester. A small but well equipped team of terrorists who call themselves the "49ers" have parachuted onto the Alcatraz island, and gained control of it. Led by 49er One, a.k.a. Hubbard's assistant Donny Johnson (Morris Chestnut), and 49er Six (Nia Peeples), the team finds Lester, and they want him to give up the location of his hidden stash of gold. When Lester will not tell them, Donny shoots a nearby priest (Eva-Maria Schönecker), and threatens to kill others if the information is not delivered.

Donny's plan is disrupted, however, when Sascha decides to step in and fight back. It turns out that Sasha is actually an undercover FBI agent who has been trying to use Nick to get to Sonny Eckvall. When Sasha rescues Lester, the 49ers strap Jane to the electric chair and threaten to kill her, all while Ellen and her team prepare a rescue plan from the mainland.

With the help of Nick and some of the other inmates such as Twitch (Kurupt) and Little Joe (Michael "Bear" Taliferro), Sasha sets out to rescue Jane and bring Donny down, before Alcatraz becomes everyone's final resting place.

'''Henry Condell''' (5 September 1576 ([[Baptism|baptised]]) – December 1627) was an actor in the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the playing company for which [[William Shakespeare]] wrote. With [[John Heminges]], he was instrumental in preparing and editing the [[First Folio]], the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623.&lt;ref&gt;Pogue, Kate. ''Shakespeare's Friends''. Greenwood Publishing Group (2006) {{ISBN|9780275989569}} pp. 129-136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Condell's early life is obscure. It appears that he may have been from [[East Anglia]], as his will mentions 'my Cosen Gilder late of [[New Buckenham|newe Buckenham]]’.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}{{sfn|Honigmann|993|p=159}} According to Edmond:{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;The only Henry Condell so far discovered at a suitable date in that part of England was the son of a Robert Condell of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, a fishmonger, and his wife, Joan, née Yeomans, of New Buckenham, a market town not far from Norwich. Henry Condell, presumably their son, was baptized at St Peter on 5 September 1576.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditionally, he is associated with the "Harry" who appears in the cast list for [[Richard Tarlton]]'s [[The Seven Deadly Sins (play)|''The Seven Deadly Sins'']], but this identification is little more than conjecture. If the connection is true, then Condell was an actor as early as 1590, acting in [[Lord Strange's Men]] alongside [[John Heminges]] and [[Augustine Phillips]]. Condell was definitely in London by 24 October 1596, when he married, at [[St Laurence Pountney]], Elizabeth Smart (d.1635), the only child of John Smart of the [[Strand, London|Strand]], gentleman.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}} They settled in [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], the parish in which Heminges lived. Condell, like Heminges, served as [[churchwarden]] in that church. Nine children were baptized there, born between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (baptized 26 October 1606), who married Herbert Finch; Henry (baptized 6 May 1610, died 1630); and William (baptized 26 May 1611).{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}{{sfn|Honigmann|Brock|1993|p=158}}

Details of Condell's mature life, as is usual for Renaissance actors, are few. His status within the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Lord Chamberlain's]] and [[King's Men (playing company)|King's]] companies appears to have been high; in official communications he is generally listed shortly after [[Richard Burbage|Burbage]] and Heminges. Actors' wills indicate that he was close to at least some of his colleagues in the company. Shakespeare and Phillips bequeathed him money for mourning rings; [[Nicholas Tooley]] and [[Alexander Cooke]] named him as trustee for their estates. Condell prospered enough in his profession to purchase a country home at [[Fulham]] in [[Middlesex]] and other property, including an estate called Brockhampton in [[Snowshill]], [[Gloucestershire]]. The indentures recording the latter purchase contain the only known example of Condell's signature or handwriting apart from his last will.{{sfn|Barnard|1930|p=1}}

In addition to ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' (1598) and ''[[Every Man Out of His Humour]]'' (1599), Condell is known to have performed in four more of [[Ben Jonson|Jonson's]] plays: ''[[Sejanus (play)|Sejanus]]'' (1603), ''[[Volpone]]'' (1605), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610), and ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy|Catiline]]'' (1611). He was the original Cardinal in [[John Webster]]'s ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' (c. 1613). And he was listed in eight of the cast lists that were added to the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] of [[1679 in literature|1679]]:

Condell appears to have ended his stage career around 1619. He signed each of the nine sheets of his last will and testament on 13 December 1627.{{sfn|Honigmann|Brock|1993|p=160}} He died at Fulham aged 51, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 29 December 1627.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}} His widow, Elizabeth, was buried there on 3 October 1635.{{sfn|Edmond|2004}}

Condell left an extensive estate, including shares in the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] and [[Blackfriars Theatre]]s.

[[File:Caged Bird cover.jpg|thumb|Cover from the first edition of ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'', published in 1969 by [[Random House]]]]

'''''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings''''' is a 1969 [[autobiography]] describing the early years of American writer and poet [[Maya Angelou]]. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a [[Bildungsroman|coming-of-age story]] that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome [[racism]] and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to [[Stamps, Arkansas]], to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of ''Caged Bird'', Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an [[inferiority complex]] into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.

Angelou was challenged by her friend, author [[James Baldwin]], and her editor, [[Robert Loomis]], to write an autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize ''Caged Bird'' as [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]] because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, and expand. The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women in the years following the [[Civil Rights Movement]]: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.

Angelou uses her autobiography to explore subjects such as [[Cultural identity|identity]], [[rape]], racism, and [[literacy]]. She also writes in new ways about women's lives in a male-dominated society. Maya, the younger version of Angelou and the book's central character, has been called "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America".&lt;ref name="tate-150"&gt;Tate, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the book, although it is presented briefly in the text. Another metaphor, that of a bird struggling to escape its cage, is a central image throughout the work, which consists of "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression".&lt;ref name="walker-19"&gt;Walker, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Angelou's treatment of racism provides a thematic unity to the book. Literacy and the power of words help young Maya cope with her bewildering world; books become her refuge as she works through her trauma.

''Caged Bird'' was nominated for a [[National Book Award]] in 1970 and remained on [[New York Times bestseller list|''The New York Times'' paperback bestseller list]] for two years. It has been used in educational settings from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.

==Background==
[[Image:Paul Laurence Dunbar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The book's title comes from a poem by [[African-American]] poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]]. The caged bird, a symbol for the chained [[slave]], is an image Angelou uses throughout all her writings.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Before writing ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' at the age of forty, Angelou had a long and varied career, holding jobs such as composer, singer, actor, civil rights worker, journalist, and educator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Lucinda|title=Growing Up Maya Angelou|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/growing-up-maya-angelou-79582387/?no-ist|accessdate=28 June 2015|work=Smithsonian Magazine|date=April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1950s, she joined the [[Harlem Writers Guild]], where she met a number of important African-American authors, including her friend and mentor [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]. After hearing civil rights leader [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] speak for the first time in 1960, she was inspired to join the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. She organized several benefits for him, and he named her Northern Coordinator of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]. She worked for several years in [[Ghana]], West Africa, as a journalist, actress, and educator. She was invited back to the US by [[Malcolm X]] to work for him shortly before his assassination in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie et al, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, King asked her to organize a march, but he too was [[Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination|assassinated]] on April 4, which also happened to be her birthday.  For many years, Angelou responded to King's murder by not celebrating her birthday, instead choosing to meet with, call, or send flowers to his widow, [[Coretta Scott King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Minzesheimer|first1=Bob|title=Maya Angelou Celebrates Her 80 Years of Pain and Joy|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-03-26-maya-angelou_N.htm|accessdate=29 June 2015|work=USA Today|date=26 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Younge|first1=Gary |title=No Surrender|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/biography/story/0,,720909,00.html|accessdate=28 June 2015|work=The Guardian|date=25 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelou was deeply depressed in the months following King's assassination, so to help lift her spirits, Baldwin brought her to a dinner party at the home of cartoonist [[Jules Feiffer]] and his wife Judy in late 1968.&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Dinitia |title=A Career in Letters, 50 Years and Counting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/books/23loom.html|accessdate=30 June 2015|work=The New York Times|date=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The guests began telling stories of their childhoods and Angelou's stories impressed Judy Feiffer. The next day she called [[Robert Loomis]] at [[Random House]], who became Angelou's editor throughout her long writing career until he retired in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Italie|first1=Hillel|title=Robert Loomis, Editor of Styron, Angelou, Retires|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/6/robert-loomis-editor-of-styron-angelou-retires/|accessdate=30 June 2015|work=The Washington Times|agency=Associated Press|date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "told him that he ought to get this woman to write a book".&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt; At first, Angelou refused, since she thought of herself as a poet and playwright.&lt;ref name="walker-17"&gt;Walker, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; According to Angelou, Baldwin had a "covert hand" in getting her to write the book, and advised Loomis to use "a little reverse psychology",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neary|first1=Lynn |title=At 80, Maya Angelou Reflects on a 'Glorious' Life|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89355359|accessdate=30 June 2015|work=National Public Radio|date=6 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported that Loomis tricked her into it by daring her: "It's just as well", he said, "because to write an autobiography as literature is just about impossible".&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt;  Angelou was unable to resist a challenge, and she began writing ''Caged Bird.''&lt;ref name="walker-17" /&gt; After "closeting herself"&lt;ref name="hagen-57"&gt;Hagen, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; in London, it took her two years to write it.  She shared the manuscript with her friend, writer [[Jessica Mitford]], before submitting it for publication.&lt;ref name="hagen-57"/&gt;

Angelou subsequently wrote six additional autobiographies, covering a variety of her young adult experiences. They are distinct in style and narration, but unified in their themes and stretch from Arkansas to Africa, and back to the US, from the beginnings of [[World War II]] to King's assassination.&lt;ref name="Lupton, p. 1"&gt;Lupton, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  Like ''Caged Bird'', the events in these books are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology. Later books in the series include ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'' (1974), ''[[Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas]]'' (1976), ''[[The Heart of a Woman]]'' (1981), ''[[All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes]]'' (1986), ''[[A Song Flung Up to Heaven]]'' (2002), and ''[[Mom &amp; Me &amp; Mom]]'' (2013, at the age of 85).  Critics have often judged Angelou's later autobiographies "in light of the first", and ''Caged Bird'' generally receives the highest praise.&lt;ref name="poetry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maya Angelou: 1929-2014|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/maya-angelou|website=Poetry Foundation|publisher=Poetry Magazine|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with ''Caged Bird'', Angelou used the same "writing ritual" for many years.&lt;ref name="lupton-15"&gt;Lupton, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; She would get up at five in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff were instructed to remove any pictures from the walls.  She wrote on yellow legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play [[solitaire]], ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]'', and the Bible, and left by the early afternoon.  She averaged 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarler|first1=Carol|editor1-last=Elliot|editor1-first=Jeffrey M.|title=Conversations with Maya Angelou|date=1989|publisher=University Press|location=Jackson, Mississippi|isbn=0-87805-362-X|page=217|chapter=A Life in the Day of Maya Angelou}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lupton stated that this ritual indicated "a firmness of purpose and an inflexible use of time".&lt;ref name="lupton-15"/&gt; Angelou went through this process to give herself time to turn the events of her life into art,&lt;ref name="lupton-15"/&gt; and to "enchant" herself; as she said in a 1989 interview with the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], to "relive the agony, the anguish, the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]''".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/133_wbc_archive_new/page2.shtml|title = Maya Angelou I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|date = October 2005|accessdate = 30 June 2015|work= World Book Club|publisher = BBC World Service|type = interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in ''Caged Bird'', to "tell the human truth" about her life. Critic Opal Moore says about ''Caged Bird'': "...Though easily read, [it] is no 'easy read'".&lt;ref name="moore-55"&gt;Moore, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Angelou stated that she played cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!"  She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in "telling the truth".&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

===Title===
When selecting a title, Angelou turned to [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], an Afro-American poet whose works she had admired for years. [[Jazz]] vocalist and civil rights activist [[Abbey Lincoln]] suggested the title.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Lyman B. Hagen, the title pulls Angelou's readers into the book while reminding them that it is possible to both lose control of one's life and to have one's freedom taken from them.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Angelou has credited Dunbar, along with [[Shakespeare]], with forming her "writing ambition".&lt;ref&gt;Tate, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the book comes from the third stanza of Dunbar's poem "Sympathy":{{refn|Angelou returned to Dunbar's poem for the title of her sixth autobiography, ''[[A Song Flung Up to Heaven]]'' (2002).|group=note}}

==Plot summary==
{{see also|List of characters in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings}}

''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' follows Marguerite's (called "My" or "Maya" by her brother) life from the age of three to seventeen and the struggles she faces – particularly with [[racism]] – in the [[Southern United States]]. Abandoned by their parents, Maya and her older brother Bailey are sent to live with their paternal grandmother (Momma) and crippled uncle (Uncle Willie) in [[Stamps, Arkansas]]. Maya and Bailey are haunted by their parents' abandonment throughout the book – they travel alone and are labeled like baggage.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lafayette County Arkansas Incorporated and Unincorporated areas Stamps Highlighted.svg|thumb|right|The community of [[Stamps, Arkansas]], is the setting for a large portion of the book.]]

Many of the problems Maya encounters in her childhood stem from the overt racism of her white neighbors. Although Mamma is relatively wealthy because she owns the general store at the heart of Stamps' Black community, the white children of their town hassle Maya's family relentlessly. One of these "powhitetrash" girls, for example, reveals her pubic hair to Momma in a humiliating incident. Early in the book, Momma hides Uncle Willie in a vegetable bin to protect him from [[Ku Klux Klan]] raiders. Maya has to endure the insult of her name being changed to Mary by a racist employer. A white speaker at her eighth grade graduation ceremony disparages the Black audience by suggesting that they have limited job opportunities. A white dentist refuses to treat Maya's rotting tooth, even when Momma reminds him that she had loaned him money during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. The Black community of Stamps enjoys a moment of racial victory when they listen to the radio broadcast of [[Joe Louis]]'s championship fight, but generally, they feel the heavy weight of racist oppression.

A turning point in the book occurs when Maya and Bailey's father unexpectedly appears in Stamps. He takes the two children with him when he departs, but leaves them with their mother in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Eight-year-old Maya is sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman. He is found guilty during the trial, but escapes jail time and is murdered, presumably by Maya's uncles. Maya feels guilty and withdraws from everyone but her brother. Even after returning to Stamps, Maya remains reclusive and nearly mute until she meets Mrs. Bertha Flowers, "the aristocrat of Black Stamps",&lt;ref&gt;Angelou, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; who encourages her through books and communication to regain her voice and soul. This coaxes Maya out of her shell.

Later, Momma decides to send her grandchildren to their mother in [[San Francisco, California]], to protect them from the dangers of racism in Stamps. Maya attends [[George Washington High School (San Francisco)|George Washington High School]] and studies dance and drama on a scholarship at the [[California Labor School]]. Before graduating, she becomes the first Black female [[streetcar]] conductor in San Francisco. While still in high school, Maya visits her father in southern California one summer and has some experiences pivotal to her development. She drives a car for the first time when she must transport her intoxicated father home from an excursion to Mexico. She experiences homelessness for a short time after a fight with her father's girlfriend.

During Maya's final year of high school, she worries that she might be a [[lesbian]] (which she confuses due to her sexual inexperience with the belief that lesbians are also [[hermaphrodites]]).  She ultimately initiates sexual intercourse with a teenage boy. She becomes pregnant, which on the advice of her brother, she hides from her family until her eighth month of pregnancy in order to graduate from high school. Maya gives birth at the end of the book.

==Style and genre==
[[File:Romola 1863.jpg|thumb|288x288px|In addition to being classified as an [[autobiography]], ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' has also been called a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'', like [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]''.]]
Angelou's prose works, while presenting a unique interpretation of the [[autobiography|autobiographical form]], can be placed in the long tradition of African-American autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development, however, often lead reviewers to categorize her books, including ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'', as [[autobiographical fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics, like Lupton, insist that Angelou's books should be categorized as autobiographies because they conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1983 interview with African-American literature critic [[Claudia Tate]], Angelou calls her books autobiographies.&lt;ref&gt;Tate, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, Angelou intended to return to poetry and play-writing after completing ''Caged Bird'' and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and so that she could "change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century". In a 1989 interview, she stated, "I think I am the only serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression".&lt;ref name="lupton-30"/&gt;  As she told journalist [[George Plimpton]] during a 1990 interview, "Autobiography is awfully seductive; it’s wonderful".&lt;ref name="plimpton"/&gt;  She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by [[Frederick Douglass]] in [[slave narratives]], she used the literary technique of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'".&lt;ref name="plimpton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plimpton|first1=George|title=Maya Angelou, The Art of Fiction No. 119|journal=The Paris Review|date=Fall 1990|volume=116|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2279/the-art-of-fiction-no-119-maya-angelou|accessdate=13 August 2015|format=Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Susan|chapter=Paths to Escape|editor1-last=Braxton|editor1-first=Joanne M.|title=I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings: A Casebook.|date=1999|publisher=Oxford Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511607-0|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholar [[Selwyn R. Cudjoe]] agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.&lt;ref&gt;Cudjoe, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Joanne M. Braxton sees ''Caged Bird'' as "the fully developed black female autobiographical form that began to emerge in the 1940s and 1950s".&lt;ref name="braxton-64"/&gt;  The book presents themes that are common in autobiography by Black American women: a celebration of Black motherhood; a criticism of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.&lt;ref name="braxton-64"&gt;Braxton (2004), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Angelou introduces a unique point of view in American autobiography by revealing her life story through a narrator who is a Black female from the South, at some points a child, and other points a mother.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, pp. 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Hilton Als]] calls Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices.&lt;ref name="songbird" /&gt; For example, Angelou was worried about her readers' reactions to her disclosure in her second autobiography, ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'', that she was a prostitute.  She went through with it, anyway, after her husband Paul Du Feu advised her to be honest about it.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelou has recognized that there are fictional aspects to her books, and that she tends to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth".&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;  Angelou discussed her writing process with Plimpton, and when asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she admitted that she had.  She stated, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about."&lt;ref name="plimpton" /&gt; Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen states, "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work".&lt;ref name="hagen-18"&gt;Hagen, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Hagen also states that Angelou "fictionalizes, to enhance interest".&lt;ref name="hagen-18" /&gt;  For example, Angelou uses the [[First-person narrative|first-person narrative voice]] customary with autobiographies, told from the perspective of a child that is "artfully recreated by an adult narrator".&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelou uses two distinct voices, the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book, whom Angelou calls "the Maya character". Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and the Maya character is "damned difficult", but "very necessary".&lt;ref name="tate-150"/&gt; Scholar Liliane Arensberg suggests that Angelou "retaliates for the tongue-tied child's helpless pain" by using her adult self's [[irony]] and wit.&lt;ref&gt;Arensberg, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, ''Caged Bird'' has been called a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' or coming-of-age story; critic Mary Jane Lupton compares it to other ''Bildungsromans'' like [[George Eliot]]'s novel ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]''. According to Lupton, the two books share the following similarities: a focus on young strong-willed heroines who have solid relationships with their brothers, an examination of the role of literature in life, and an emphasis on the importance of family and community life.&lt;ref name="lupton-30"&gt;Lupton, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
When Angelou wrote ''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' at the end of the 1960s,  one of the necessary and accepted features of literature, according to critic Pierre A. Walker, was thematic unity.  One of Angelou's goals was to create a book that satisfied this criterion, in order to achieve her political purposes, which were to demonstrate how to resist racism in America. The structure of the text, which resembles a series of short stories, is not chronological but rather thematic.&lt;ref name="walker-19"/&gt; Walker, in his 1993 article about ''Caged Bird'', "Racial Protest, Identity, Words, and Form", focuses on the book's structure, and describes how it supports her presentation of racism.  According to Walker, critics had neglected analyzing its structure, choosing to focus instead on its themes, which he feels neglects the political nature of the book.  He states, "One serves Angelou and ''Caged Bird'' better by emphasizing how form and political content work together".&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;  Angelou structures her book so that it presents a series of lessons about how to resist racism and oppression.  The progression Maya goes through thematically unifies the book, something that "stands in contrast to the otherwise episodic quality of the narrative".&lt;ref name="walker-19"/&gt;  The way in which Angelou constructs, arranges, and organizes her vignettes often undermined the chronology of her childhood by "juxtaposing the events of one chapter with the events of preceding and following ones so that they too comment on each other".&lt;ref name="walker-19"/&gt;

For example, the incident with the "powhitetrash" girls takes place in chapter 5, when Maya was ten years old, well before Angelou's recounting of her rape in chapter 12, which occurred when Maya was 8.  Walker explains that Angelou's purpose in placing the vignettes in this way is that it followed her thematic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Angelou's editor, [[Robert Loomis]], agrees, stating that Angelou could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.&lt;ref name="hagen-57"/&gt;  Hagen sees Angelou's structure somewhat differently, focusing on Maya's journey "to establish a worthwhile self-concept",&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and states that she structures the book into three parts: arrival, sojourn, and departure, which occur both geographically and psychologically.  However, Hagen notes that instead of beginning ''Caged Bird'' chronologically, with Maya and Bailey's arrival in Stamps, Angelou begins the book much later chronologically by recounting an embarrassing experience at church, an incident that demonstrates Maya's diminished sense of self, insecurity, and lack of status.&lt;ref name="hagen-57"/&gt;  Hagen explains that Angelou's purpose is to demonstrate Maya's journey from insecurity to her feelings of worth gained by becoming a mother at the end of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

In the course of ''Caged Bird'', Maya, who has been described as "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America",&lt;ref name="tate-150"/&gt; goes from being a victim of racism with an inferiority complex to a self-aware individual who responds to racism with dignity and a strong sense of her own identity. [[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist scholar]] Maria Lauret states that the "formation of female cultural identity" is woven into the book's narrative, setting Maya up as "a role model for Black women".&lt;ref name="lauret-97"&gt;Lauret, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholar Liliane Arensberg calls this presentation Angelou's "identity theme" and a major motif in Angelou's narrative.  Maya's unsettled life in ''Caged Bird'' suggests her sense of self "as perpetually in the process of becoming, of dying and being reborn, in all its ramifications".&lt;ref&gt;Arensberg, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; African-American literature scholar Dolly McPherson agrees, stating that Angelou creatively uses Christian mythology and theology to present the Biblical themes of death, regeneration, and rebirth.&lt;ref name="mcpherson-28" /&gt;

As Lauret indicates, Angelou and other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s used autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Up until this time, Black women were not depicted realistically in African-American fiction and autobiography, meaning that Angelou was one of the first Black autobiographers to present, as Cudjoe put it, "a powerful and authentic signification of [African-American] womanhood in her quest for understanding and love rather than for bitterness and despair".&lt;ref&gt;Cudjoe, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Lauret sees a connection between Angelou's autobiographies, which Lauret calls "fictions of subjectivity" and "feminist first-person narratives", and fictional first-person narratives (such as ''[[The Women's Room]]'' by [[Marilyn French]] and ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' by [[Doris Lessing]]) written during the same period.  As French and Lessing do in their novels, Angelou employs the narrator as [[protagonist]] and depends upon "the illusion of presence in their mode of signification".&lt;ref&gt;Lauret, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a displaced girl, Maya's pain is worsened by an awareness of her displacement.  She is "the forgotten child", and must come to terms with "the unimaginable reality" of being unloved and unwanted;&lt;ref name="mcpherson-28"&gt;McPherson, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced – her belief in her own ugliness was "absolute".&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson believes that the concept of family, or what she calls "kinship concerns", in Angelou's books must be understood in the light of the children's displacement at the beginning of ''Caged Bird''.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities throughout her books to illustrate how oppression and personal history are interrelated. For example, in ''Caged Bird'', Angelou demonstrates the "racist habit"&lt;ref name="lauret-97" /&gt; of renaming African Americans, as shown when her white employer insists on calling her "Mary".  Angelou describes the employer's renaming as the "hellish horror of being 'called out of [one's] name'".&lt;ref&gt;Angelou, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholar Debra Walker King calls it a racist insult and an assault against Maya's race and self-image.&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The renaming emphasizes Maya's feelings of inadequacy and denigrates her identity, individuality, and uniqueness. Maya understands that she is being insulted and rebels by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's favorite dish, but feels vindicated when, as she leaves her employer's home, Mrs. Cullinan finally gets her name right.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walker-26"/&gt; Another incident in the book that solidifies Maya's identity is her trip to Mexico with her father, when she has to drive a car for the first time. Contrasted with her experience in Stamps, Maya is finally "in control of her fate".&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  This experience is central to Maya's growth, as is the incident that immediately follows it, her short period of homelessness after arguing with her father's girlfriend. These two incidents give Maya a knowledge of self-determination and confirm her self-worth.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

Scholar Mary Burgher believes that female Black autobiographers like Angelou have debunked the stereotypes of African-American mothers as "breeder[s] and matriarch[s]", and have presented them as having "a creative and personally fulfilling role".&lt;ref&gt;Burgher, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Lupton believes that Angelou's plot construction and character development were influenced by the same mother/child motif as is found in the work of [[Harlem Renaissance]] poet [[Jessie Fauset]].&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first five years of her life, Maya thinks of herself as an orphan and finds comfort in the thought that her mother is dead.  Maya's feelings for and relationship with her own mother, whom she blames for her abandonment, express themselves in ambivalence and "repressed violent aggression".&lt;ref&gt;Arensberg, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Maya and her brother destroy the first Christmas gifts sent by their mother. These strong feelings are not resolved until the end of the book, when Maya becomes a mother herself, and her mother finally becomes the nurturing presence for which Maya has longed.&lt;ref&gt;Arensberg, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The two main maternal influences on Maya's life change as well; Vivian becomes a more active participant, while Momma becomes less effective as Maya, by becoming a mother herself, moves from childhood to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
[[Image:Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg|thumb|upright|For several years before writing ''Caged Bird'', Angelou worked with [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] during the 1960s to combat racism.]]

Kelley calls ''Caged Bird'' a "gentle indictment of white American womanhood";&lt;ref name="hagen-55"&gt;Hagen, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Hagen expands it further, stating that the book is "a dismaying story of white dominance".&lt;ref name="hagen-55" /&gt;

''Caged Bird'' has been called "perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying autobiography written in the years immediately following the Civil Rights era".&lt;ref name="braxton-4"&gt;Braxton (1999), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Pierre A. Walker expresses a similar sentiment, and places it in the African-American literature tradition of political protest.&lt;ref name="walker-19"/&gt; Angelou demonstrates, through her involvement with the Black community of Stamps, as well as her presentation of vivid and realistic racist characters and "the vulgarity of white Southern attitudes toward African Americans",&lt;ref name="lupton-63"&gt;Lupton, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; her developing understanding of the rules for surviving in a racist society. Angelou's autobiographies, beginning with ''Caged Bird'', contain a sequence of lessons about resisting oppression.  The sequence she describes leads Angelou, as the protagonist, from "helpless rage and indignation to forms of subtle resistance, and finally to outright and active protest".&lt;ref name="walker-19"/&gt;

}}

Walker insists that Angelou's treatment of racism is what gives her autobiographies their thematic unity and underscores one of their central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. For example, in Angelou's depiction of the "powhitetrash" incident, Maya reacts with rage, indignation, humiliation, and helplessness, but Momma teaches her how they can maintain their personal dignity and pride while dealing with racism, and that it is an effective basis for actively protesting and combating racism.&lt;ref name="walker-22"/&gt; Walker calls Momma's way a "strategy of subtle resistance"&lt;ref name="walker-22"&gt;Walker, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and McPherson calls it "the dignified course of silent endurance".&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelou portrays Momma as a realist whose patience, courage, and silence ensured the survival and success of those who came after her.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Maya responds assertively when subjected to demeaning treatment by Mrs. Cullinan, her white employer, and, later on in the book, breaks the race barrier to become the first black streetcar operator in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="walker-26"&gt;Walker, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Maya Angelou honored for her first job as a street car conductor in San Francisco|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/local/wp/2014/03/12/maya-angelou-honored-for-her-first-job-as-a-street-car-conductor-in-san-francisco/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2014-03-12|access-date = 2015-11-13|issn = 0190-8286|language = |first = DeNeen L.|last = Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions to withstand racism.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a Black child, evolves out of her "racial hatred",&lt;ref name="arensberg-116"&gt;Arensberg, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers. At first Maya wishes that she could become white, since growing up Black in white America is dangerous; later she sheds her self-loathing and embraces a strong racial identity.&lt;ref name="arensberg-116" /&gt;

===Rape===

}}

Angelou's description of being raped as an eight-year-old child overwhelms the autobiography, although it is presented briefly in the text.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Mary Vermillion compares Angelou's treatment of rape to that of [[Harriet Jacobs]] in her autobiography ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]''. Jacobs and Angelou both use rape as a metaphor for the suffering of African Americans; Jacobs uses the metaphor to critique slaveholding culture, while Angelou uses it to first internalize, then challenge, twentieth-century racist conceptions of the Black female body (namely, that the Black female is physically unattractive).&lt;ref&gt;Vermillion, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Rape, according to Vermillion, "represents the black girl's difficulties in controlling, understanding, and respecting both her body and her words".&lt;ref&gt;Vermillion, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arensberg notes that Maya's rape is connected to the theme of death in ''Caged Bird'', as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape was the first time he touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence.&lt;ref&gt;Vermillion, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; As Angelou later stated, "I thought if I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Healy|first1=Sarah|title=Maya Angelou Speaks to 2,000 at Arlington Theater|url=http://dailynexus.com/2001-02-21/maya-angelou-speaks-to-2000-at-arlington-theater/|accessdate=14 November 2015|work=The Daily Nexus|publisher=UC Santa Barbara|date=21 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African-American literature scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou's depiction of the rape "a burden" of ''Caged Bird'': a demonstration of "the manner in which the Black female is violated in her tender years and&amp;nbsp;... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence".&lt;ref&gt;Cudjoe, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Vermillion, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, "I can't remember a time when I wasn't loved by somebody."&lt;ref&gt;Braxton, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape.  She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.&lt;ref&gt;Braxton, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literacy===
[[File:Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Angelou has described [[William Shakespeare]] as a strong influence on her life and works, especially his identification with what she saw as marginalized people, claiming that "Shakespeare was a black woman".&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, Robert (2003). [https://books.google.com/?id=F82jtLKL0QwC&amp;printsec=copyright#PPA82,M1 ''Victorian Appropriations of Shakespeare'']. Cranberry, NJ: Associated University Presses. p. 82. {{ISBN|0-8386-3970-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, especially ''Caged Bird'' and its immediate sequel ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'', are "very much concerned with what [Angelou] knew and how she learned it". Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the "direct instruction of African American cultural forms".&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Angelou's quest for learning and literacy parallels "the central myth of black culture in America":&lt;ref name="hagen-63"/&gt; that freedom and literacy are connected. Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self-imposed muteness, including [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. Angelou states, early in ''Caged Bird'', that she, as the Maya character, "met and fell in love with William Shakespeare".&lt;ref&gt;Angelou, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's "[[The Rape of Lucrece]]", which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech.  Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem's identification with suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Vermillion, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape,&lt;ref name="arensberg-113"&gt;Arensberg, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; writing in ''Caged Bird'', "...I was sure that any minute my mother or Bailey or the [[The Green Hornet|Green Hornet]] would bust in the door and save me".&lt;ref&gt;Angelou, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walker, the power of words is another theme that appears repeatedly in ''Caged Bird''. For example, Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words. Mrs. Flowers, by introducing her to classic literature and poetry, teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The importance of both the spoken and written word also appears repeatedly in ''Caged Bird'' and in all of Angelou's autobiographies.{{refn|There are over 100 references to literary characters in Angelou's first six autobiographies.&lt;ref name="hagen-63"/&gt;|group=note}} Referring to the importance of literacy and methods of effective writing, Angelou once advised [[Oprah Winfrey]] in a 1993 interview to "do as West Africans do&amp;nbsp;... listen to the deep talk", or the "utterances existing beneath the obvious".&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson says, "If there is one stable element in Angelou's youth it is [a] dependence upon books". The public library is a "quiet refuge" to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis.&lt;ref name="arensberg-113" /&gt; Hagen describes Angelou as a "natural story-teller",&lt;ref name="hagen-19" /&gt; which "reflect[s] a good listener with a rich oral heritage".&lt;ref name="hagen-19"/&gt; Hagen also insists that Angelou's years of muteness provided her with this skill.&lt;ref name="hagen-19" /&gt;

Angelou was also powerfully affected by [[slave narratives]], [[spirituals]], poetry, and other autobiographies.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nBsaFf4qzRQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;sig=ACfU3U0XPBycQl_hVfY3SOgK_Is66pAtPw p. 32.]&lt;/ref&gt; Angelou read through the [[Bible]] twice as a young child, and memorized many passages from it.&lt;ref name="hagen-19"&gt;Hagen, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; African-American spirituality, as represented by Angelou's grandmother, has influenced all of Angelou's writings, in the activities of the church community she first experiences in Stamps, in the sermonizing, and in scripture.&lt;ref name="hagen-63"&gt;Hagen, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Hagen goes on to say that in addition to being influenced by rich literary form, Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions. In ''Caged Bird'', Mrs. Flowers encourages her to listen carefully to "Mother Wit",&lt;ref&gt;Angelou, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African-American community as expressed in [[folklore]] and humor.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Hagen, in his analysis of ''Caged Bird'', goes through the book and lists all the folk stories and jokes Angelou refers to and uses.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, pp. 30–45.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

Angelou's humor in ''Caged Bird'' and in all her autobiographies is drawn from Black folklore and is used to demonstrate that in spite of severe racism and oppression, Black people thrive and are, as Hagen states, "a community of song and laughter and courage".&lt;ref name="hagen-50"&gt;Hagen, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Hagen states that Angelou is able to make an indictment of institutionalized racism as she laughs at her flaws and the flaws of her community and "balances stories of black endurance of oppression against white myths and misperceptions".&lt;ref name="hagen-50" /&gt; Hagen also characterize ''Caged Bird'' as a "blues genre autobiography"&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; because it uses elements of [[blues music]]. These elements include the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Hagen also sees elements of African American sermonizing in ''Caged Bird''. Angelou's use of African-American oral traditions creates a sense of community in her readers, and identifies those who belong to it.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==

===Critical reception and sales===
''I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings'' is the most highly acclaimed of Angelou's autobiographies. The other volumes in her series of seven autobiographies are judged and compared to ''Caged Bird.''&lt;ref name="poetry" /&gt; It became a bestseller immediately after it was published.&lt;ref name="gillespie-101" /&gt; Angelou's friend and mentor, [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], maintained that her book "liberates the reader into life" and called it "a Biblical study of life in the midst of death".&lt;ref name="moore" /&gt; According to Angelou's biographers, "Readers, especially women, and in particular Black women, took the book to heart".&lt;ref name="gillespie-101" /&gt;

[[Image:Jamesbaldwin.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] (1955), Angelou's friend and mentor, called ''Caged Bird'' "a Biblical study of life in the midst of death".&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Moore, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;|upright]]
By the end of 1969, critics had placed Angelou in the tradition of other Black autobiographers. Poet James Bertolino asserts that ''Caged Bird'' "is one of the essential books produced by our culture". He insists that "[w]e should all read it, especially our children".&lt;ref&gt;Bertolino, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for a [[National Book Award]] in 1970, has never been out of print, and has been published in many languages.&lt;ref name="gillespie-101" /&gt; It has been a Book of the Month Club selection and an Ebony Book Club selection.&lt;ref name="hagen-56"/&gt; In 2011, ''Time Magazine'' placed the book in its list of 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Megan|title=All-Time 100 Nonfiction Books: I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-by-maya-angelou/|accessdate=30 November 2015|work=Time|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic Robert A. Gross called ''Caged Bird'' "a ''tour de force'' of language".&lt;ref name="mcpherson-23"&gt;McPherson, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Edmund Fuller insisted that Angelou's intellectual range and artistry were apparent in how she told her story.&lt;ref name="mcpherson-23" /&gt; ''Caged Bird'' catapulted Angelou to international fame and critical acclaim, was a significant development in Black women's literature in that it "heralded the success of other now prominent writers".&lt;ref&gt;Baisnée, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviewers have praised Angelou's use of language in the book, including critic E. M. Guiney, who reported that ''Caged Bird'' was "one of the best autobiographies of its kind that I have read".&lt;ref name="hagen-56" /&gt; Critic R. A. Gross praised Angelou for her use of rich and dazzling images.&lt;ref name="hagen-56" /&gt;

By the mid-1980s, ''Caged Bird'' had gone through 20 hardback printings and 32 paperback printings.&lt;ref name="hagen-56"&gt;Hagen, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The week after Angelou recited her poem "[[On the Pulse of Morning]]" at President [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1993 inauguration, sales of the paperback version of ''Caged Bird'' and her other works rose by 300–600 percent. ''Caged Bird'' had sold steadily since its publication, but it increased by 500 percent.  The 16-page publication of "On the Pulse of Morning" became a best-seller, and the recording of the poem was awarded a [[Grammy Award]]. The Bantam Books edition of ''Caged Bird'' was a bestseller for 36 weeks, and they had to reprint 400,000 copies of her books to meet demand. [[Random House]], which published Angelou's hardcover books and the poem later that year, reported that they sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, marking a 1,200 percent increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colford|first1=Paul D.|title=Angelou Journeys Onto the Bestseller List|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-10-28/news/vw-50568_1_maya-angelou|accessdate=30 November 2015|work=The New York Times|date=28 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gillespie-142"&gt;Gillespie et al, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brozan|first1=Nadine|title=Chronicle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/30/style/chronicle-575993.html|accessdate=30 November 2015|work=The New York Times|date=30 January 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's reception has not been universally positive; for example, author [[Francine Prose]] considers its inclusion in the high school curriculum as partly responsible for the "dumbing down" of American society. Prose calls the book "manipulative melodrama", and considers Angelou's writing style an inferior example of poetic prose in memoir. She accuses Angelou of combining a dozen metaphors in one paragraph and for "obscuring ideas that could be expressed so much more simply and felicitously".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prose|first1=Francine|title=I Know Why the Caged Bird Cannot Read|url=http://lcps.org/cms/lib4/va01000195/centricity/domain/2376/i%20know%20why%20the%20caged%20bird%20cannot%20read.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2015|work=Harper's Magazine|date=September 1999|pages=76–84|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many parents throughout the U.S. have sought to ban the book from schools and libraries for being inappropriate for younger high school students, for promoting premarital sex, homosexuality, cohabitation, and pornography, and for not supporting traditional values. Parents have also objected to the book's use of profanity and to its graphic and violent depiction of rape and racism.&lt;ref name="censorship" /&gt;

===Influence===
When ''Caged Bird'' was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African-American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. Up to that point, Black women writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called ''Caged Bird'' "a work of art that eludes description",&lt;ref name="songbird" /&gt; has insisted that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for African-American autobiography as a whole. Als insisted that ''Caged Bird'' marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as Als put it, "write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense".&lt;ref name="songbird" /&gt;  Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for blacks and women.&lt;ref name="poetry" /&gt; ''Caged Bird'' made her "without a doubt&amp;nbsp;... America's most visible black woman autobiographer".&lt;ref name="braxton-4" /&gt; Although Als considers ''Caged Bird'' an important contribution to the increase of Black [[feminist]] writings in the 1970s, he attributes its success less to its originality than to "its resonance in the prevailing [[Zeitgeist]]"&lt;ref name="songbird" /&gt; of its time, at the end of the American Civil Rights movement. Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, freed many other women writers to "open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world".&lt;ref name="songbird" /&gt;

Angelou's autobiographies, especially the first volume, have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches to [[teacher education]]. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at [[George Washington University]], has used ''Caged Bird'' and ''[[Gather Together in My Name]]'' when training teachers to appropriately explore racism in their classrooms. Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony causes readers of Angelou's autobiographies to wonder what she "left out" and to be unsure how to respond to the events Angelou describes. These techniques force white readers to explore their feelings about race and their privileged status in society. Glazier found that although critics have focused on where Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and her literary techniques, readers react to her storytelling with "surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glazier|first1=Jocelyn A.|title=Moving Closer To Speaking the Unspeakable: White Teachers Talking about Race|journal=Teacher Education Quarterly|date=Winter 2003|pages=73–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book ''Stories of Resilience in Childhood'', analyzed the events in ''Caged Bird'' to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did.&lt;ref&gt;Challener, Daniel D. (1997). ''Stories of Resilience in Childhood.'' London, England: Taylor &amp; Francis, pp. 22–23. {{ISBN|0-8153-2800-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used ''Caged Bird'' to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of [[child development]] topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Boyatzis, Chris J. (February 1992). "Let the Caged Bird Sing: Using Literature to Teach Developmental Psychology". ''Teaching of Psychology'' '''19''' (4): 221–222. {{doi|10.1207/s15328023top1904_5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caged Bird'' has been criticized by many parents, causing it to be removed from school curricula and library shelves. The book was approved to be taught in public schools and was placed in public school libraries through the U.S. in the early-1980s, and was included in [[advanced placement]] and [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted student]] curricula, but attempts by parents to censor it began in 1983.  It has been challenged in fifteen U.S. states. Educators have responded to these challenges by removing it from reading lists and libraries, by providing students with alternatives, and by requiring parental permission from students.&lt;ref name="censorship"&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Peaches M. |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Derek |title=Censorship: A World Encyclopedia, Volume 1-4 |publisher=Routledge Publishers |date=2001 |page=60 |chapter=Maya Angelou: I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings |isbn=978-1-57958-135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have been critical of its sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent religious depictions.&lt;ref&gt;Foerstel, pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caged Bird'' appeared third on the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 most frequently challenged books: 1990–1999|url=http://www.ala.org/bbooks/100-most-frequently-challenged-books-1990%E2%80%931999|website=Banned and Challenged Books|publisher=American Library Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; sixth on the ALA's 2000–2009 list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books: 2000-2009|url=http://www.ala.org/bbooks/100-most-frequently-challenged-books-1990%E2%80%931999|website=Banned and Challenged Books|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the ten books most frequently banned from high school and junior high school libraries and classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film version===

A [[Television movie|made-for-TV movie]] version of ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979 Film)|I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' was filmed in Mississippi and aired on April 28, 1979 on [[CBS]].  Angelou and Leonora Thuna wrote the screenplay; the movie was directed by [[Fielder Cook]]. Constance Good played young Maya. Also appearing were actors [[Esther Rolle]], [[Roger E. Mosley]], [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Ruby Dee]], and [[Madge Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079321/?ref_=ttco_co_tt|title = I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979)|date = |accessdate = 10 December 2015|website = Internet Movie Database|publisher= |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/24064/I-Know-Why-the-Caged-Bird-Sings/overview|title = I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1979): Overview|last = Erickson|first = Hal|date = |work = The New York Times|access-date = 10 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two scenes in the movie differed from events described in the book. Angelou added a scene between Maya and Uncle Willie after the [[Joe Louis]] fight; in it, he expresses his feelings of redemption and hope after Louis defeats a white opponent.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Angelou also presents her eighth grade graduation differently in the film. In the book, Henry Reed delivers the valedictory speech and leads the Black audience in the [[Lift Every Voice and Sing|Negro national anthem]]. In the movie, Maya conducts these activities.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''immortelle''' is a long-lasting flower arrangement placed on graves in cemeteries.

They were originally made from natural dried flowers (which lasted longer than fresh flowers) or could be made from artificial materials such as china and painted [[plaster of paris]] or beads strung on wire arrangements. Unless made of a highly durable material (e.g. china), they would often be enclosed in a glass container (known as globes) to protect them from the weather. In some cases, they were embedded into the grave itself (e.g. on the concrete over the grave) while others were merely placed on or by the grave.

[[File:Immortelles, from Life on the Mississippi by Mark Twain, 1883.jpg|thumb|left|Immortelles, from Life on the Mississippi by Mark Twain, 1883]]
In ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'', [[Mark Twain]] comments on burial practices in [[New Orleans]]: ''"They bury their dead in vaults, above the ground. ... Fresh flowers, in vases of water, are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults: placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and children, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder form of sorrow finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and ugly but indestructible 'immortelle'—which is a wreath or cross or some such emblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross's bars—kind of sorrowful breast-pin, so to say. The immortelle requires no attention: you just hang it up, and there you are; just leave it alone, it will take care of your grief for you, and keep it in mind better than you can; stands weather first-rate, and lasts like boiler-iron."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Twain, Mark | author2=Roy J. Friedman Mark Twain Collection (Library of Congress) | title=Life on the Mississippi : with over 300 illustrations | publication-date=1883 | publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10904097 | accessdate=27 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immortelles were popular in Australia in the early 20th century. Being more expensive than fresh flowers, immortelles were normally left on graves by close family. They were purchased from undertakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article121047009 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[Inglewood Advertiser]] |location=Vic. |date=4 February 1916 |accessdate=27 December 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article151064590 |title=FUNERAL. |newspaper=[[Maryborough Chronicle, Wide Bay and Burnett Advertiser]] |location=Qld. |date=12 September 1929 |accessdate=27 December 2014 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, plastic flowers have replaced immortelles as a long-lasting flower arrangement for use with graves. Therefore, immortelles will mostly only be seen on older graves.

'''InLiquid''' is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit member-based organization that provides free resources for the Philadelphia area arts community and serves to connect artists with curators, collectors, and the general public. Its website includes a local arts events calendar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dalzell|first1=Rebecca|title=The Five-Point Weekend Escape Plan: Soak Up the Art Scene in Philadelphia|url=http://nymag.com/travel/weekends/phillyart/index5.html|website=nymag.com|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; employment, grant, and exhibition opportunities listings, as well as directories of arts publications, galleries, arts centers, and educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cultural Asset: InLiquid connects artists with art lovers throughout the city|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/pace/usairways_march2013/#/108|accessdate=15 October 2014|issue=108|publisher=US Airways|date=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through hosting dialogues and exhibition series, InLiquid was an early contributor to the rejuvenation of the city’s arts scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rozsko|first1=Nikki|title=Breaking the Mold|url=http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/2002-05-09/artpicks2.shtml|accessdate=15 October 2014|publisher=Philadelphia City Paper|date=9 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the website hosts hundreds of artist portfolios,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tiger|first1=Caroline|title=Artist Friendly|url=http://inliquid.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/usair_2008.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2014|publisher=US Airways|date=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including recognizable names like photographer [[Zoe Strauss]], founder of the Philadelphia Public Art Project, and the artwork of internationally known jewelry designer John Wind,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Directory|url=http://inliquid.org/complete-artist-list/|website=inliquid.org|publisher=InLiquid|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose collections have been featured in [[O, The Oprah Magazine|O Magazine]] and [[Elle (magazine)|Elle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the News|url=http://www.maximalart.com/pages/in-the-news|website=maximalart.com|publisher=John Wind Maximal Art|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location ===
The organization has offices in the Crane Arts building, a warehouse-turned-art space originally built in 1906, and located at 1400 N. American Street in the [[Kensington, Philadelphia|Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stigale|first1=Theresa|title=Manufacturing a Good Time|url=http://hiddencityphila.org/2013/03/manufacturing-a-good-time/|website=hiddencityphila.org|publisher=Hidden City Philadelphia|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Year-round member exhibitions are held in neighborhoods throughout the city and the surrounding region. Regular InLiquid exhibition spaces include the [[Painted Bride Art Center]] in Old City, International House Philadelphia in University City, and the [[SundanceTV|Sundance TV]] offices in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=InLiquid Projects|url=http://inliquid.org/happenings/|website=inliquid.org|publisher=InLiquid|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past partnerships have included Gallery 543 at [[Urban Outfitters|URBN]] Headquarters, the Leonard Pearlstein Gallery at [[Drexel University]], project space de, Feast Your Eye’s Salon at Front+Palmer, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] Courtyard at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], Carpenter Square, minima, [[Bryn Mawr Film Institute]], [[West Elm|west elm]], the digital cube at the [[Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts]], the media wall at [[Commerce Square]], Spruce Street Harbor Park, James Oliver Gallery, Select Fair Miami, Select Fair New York, River's Edge Gallery at [[Bridgeton House]], Engagement Studios, bahdeebahdu, and Old City Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership Guidebook|url=http://inliquid.org/become-a-member/membership-guidebook/|website=inliquid.org|publisher=InLiquid|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programming ==

Other programming for the organization centers around two yearly events: the Benefit and Art for the Cash Poor. The Benefit and Silent Auction, held every February in the Crane Arts space, serves as a showcase for emerging and established visual artists as well as a fundraiser for InLiquid, with part of the proceeds going back to the artists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dillon|first1=HughE|title=InLiquid Benefit Party at Crane Arts|url=http://www.phillymag.com/the-scene/2013/02/19/photos-inliquid-benefit-party-crane-arts/|website=phillymag.com|publisher=Philadelphia Magazine|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art for the Cash Poor, a block-party style art sale, acts as its more affordable summer counterpart every June, with all artwork priced under $200 and a goal of fostering a new audience of art collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adkins|first1=Lynne|title=Fine Art For Budget-Friendly Prices At 'Art For The Cash Poor' This Weekend|url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/06/07/fine-art-for-budget-friendly-prices-at-art-for-the-cash-poor-this-weekend/|accessdate=15 October 2014|publisher=CBS Philly|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">'''Intellectual Reserve, Inc''' ('''IRI''') is a non-profit corporation based in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], United States. Founded in 1997, it is wholly owned and operated by the [[Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). It holds the church's [[intellectual property]], including [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rights and Use Information | work=lds.org | publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | url=http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,120-1-46-1,00.html | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRI owns over 60 trademarks associated with the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Intellectual Reserve, Inc. | work=Trademarkia | url=http://www.trademarkia.com/company-intellectual-reserve-inc-613675-page-1-2 | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mormon as a trademark==
In some countries, "Mormon" and some phrases including the term are [[registered trademarks]] owned by IRI.&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Mormon Tabernacle Choir" is registered as United States [http://tarr.uspto.gov/tarr?regser=registration&amp;entry=2766231&amp;action=Request+Status Federal TM Reg. No. 2766231], and "Mormon" is registered in the European Community serial number EC004306701, registered July 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the LDS Church applied for a trademark in the United States on "Mormon" as applied to religious services; however, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] rejected the application, stating that the term "Mormon" was too generic and is popularly understood as referring to a particular kind of church, similar to "[[Presbyterian]]" or "[[Methodist]]", rather than a service mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Offc Action Outgoing | work=Trademark Document Retrieval (TDR) | publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] | date=November 1, 2005 | format=Application number 78161091 | url=http://tmportal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow | accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application was abandoned as of August 22, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Latest Status Info | format=Federal TM Ser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">The '''Federal Junior Duck Stamp''' is an [[United States|American]] art competition sponsored by the United States government for students to draw, or paint a [[duck]] realistically. The national winner's design is used to create a (non-postal) stamp which is sold to raise funds for environmental education.&lt;ref name=girlreinstated /&gt;

==Background==
The program began in 1989 with a grant from the [[National Fish and Wildlife Foundation]] (NFWF) and was first recognized by the [[United States Congress]] in 1994 when the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program Act was enacted.&lt;ref name=fws&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the Junior Duck Stamp Program  |url=http://www.fws.gov/juniorduck/About.htm# |publisher=US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|accessdate=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Entries in the contest may be paintings or drawings. The program is designed to be "a dynamic arts curriculum that teaches wetlands and waterfowl conservation to students from kindergarten through high school".&lt;ref name=fws /&gt; The best of show winner form each state participates in a national tour of entries and is forwarded to the national competition.

There is also a Conservation Message contest, where contestants write their own conservation messages about [[wildlife]].  

Each year, Junior Duck Stamp State Coordinators in all 50 U.S. states, [[American Samoa]] and the [[US Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] help to bring the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program to more than 28,000 students.  To honor the most dedicated coordinators, the Junior Duck Stamp Program developed the Green Ribbon Award for State Coordinator of the Year.  We are pleased to recognize the 2011 State Coordinator of the Year, Marilyn Gamette of [[California]].  Gamette has been committed to the JDS program since its inception in 1989, working to expand the program in California and helping to break state and national records with 3,126 pieces of art submitted in 2011.  Throughout her career and into her retirement from the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex, Gamette has inspired children and adults with her dedication and educational efforts.

There was controversy in 2013 when the competition's youngest ever national winner, six-year-old Madison Grimm, was stripped of her win because of accusations of [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=fedsaccuse&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Dinan |title=Overview of the Junior Duck Stamp Program  |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/2/feds-accuse-6-year-old-plagiarism-strip-duck-stamp/?page=all |work=Washington Times |date=May 2, 2013 |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later she was reinstated as the winner, after the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service decided the competition had been fair, despite Madison using a tracing technique. Her design was used for the $5 stamp and she received a $5,000 scholarship.&lt;ref name=girlreinstated&gt;{{cite news|author=Victoria Taylor |title=Girl, 6, reinstated as duck stamp art contest winner |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/girl-6-reinstated-duck-stamp-contest-winner-article-1.1334642 |work=NY Daily News |date=May 3, 2013 |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karasu relief''', also known as the '''Süpürgüç relief''' after the earlier name of the nearby town of [[Akbudak]], is a [[rock relief]] located on a tributary of the [[Euphrates]] and derives from the [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite period]]. It depicts a protective god standing on a deer.  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Location and discovery ==
[[File:Karasu3.jpg|thumb|Location high above the river]]
[[File:Karasu1.jpg|thumb|vertical]]
The relief is located near the town of Gümüşpınar near Akbudak in the district of [[Araban]], [[Gaziantep Province]], [[Turkey]], on a cliff-face about 200 m above the [[Karasu river]], about three km from where it meets the [[Euphrates]]. Here the river has dug a deep gorge in the limestone of the ''Kartal Dağı''. A few metres below the top of the cliff is the relief on the east side of a rectangular outcrop. In the early first millennium BC the border between the [[Iron Age]] kingdoms of [[Kummuh]] (later [[Commagene]])  and [[Carchemish]] was located in the area. From the inscription on the late [[Assyria]]n relief at Kenk Boğazı, ten kilometres away, it appears that both reliefs were located within the kingdom of Kummuh.

The relief was discovered by geologists Krummanacher and Wilson in 1956 and first published by [[Charles Burney]] and G.R. Lawson in 1958.

== Description ==
The relief is 1.98 m high by 1.6 m wide. It shows a warrior standing on a deer. The deer is 1.2 m high, its back is 52 cm high and the body is 68 cm long. It faces left, with its head held high on a slender neck. The head with a slightly opened mouth is depicted in profile. A finely carved pair of antlers with two branches on each side is depicted front-on on top of the head. According to [[Frank Starke]] it is a [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus'').

On the back of the dear, there is a 1.2 m high male figure facing left and wearing a short kilt and shoes. He is armed with a spear in his right hand and holds a bow over his shoulder with his left hand. In 1976, the upper part of the cliff was blown away with dynamite by treasure hunters. Since then none of the head is visible except for the beard. On old illustrations show details of the face and the hair hanging down his neck. The wears the tall, round-topped hat of a god. A Sun symbol hovers above the figure. Although there is no inscription on the relief, the figure with the deer is clearly the protective god of the wild, [[Kurunta (god)|Kurunta or Tuntija]]. The motif of the "god on the deer" is already known attested at Assyrian trade outposts and the [[Hittite empire]] at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. In late Hittite times the motif is found on, for example, the [[Hacıbebekli stele]]. Inspection revealed traces of a late Hittite settlement in the area, which suggests that the relief depicts a protective god of the settlement.

[[Hansgerd Hellenkemper]] and Jörg Wagner assigned the work to the "traditional style" (1050-850 BC) on the basis of stylistic elements, while [[Winfried Orthmann]] dated it to the "Late Hittite II" period (950-850 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Orthmann: ''Untersuchungen zur späthethitischen Kunst.'' (=''Saarbrücker Beiträge zur Altertumskunde'' Vol. 8) Habelt, Bonn 1971, {{ISBN|978-3774911222}}, p.&amp;nbsp;487.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bridge ==
[[File:KarasuKöprüsü.jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge]]
About two kilometres upstream are the remains of a Roman bridge at Karasu, known in Turkish as Karasu Köprüsü. It was part of the military road which led from [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]] to [[Samosata]] and was located south of the [[Monumental graves at Elif, Hisar und Hasanoğlu]]. From the bridge it is about forty-five minutes walk up the plateau to the relief.

[[Image:Lanzon.JPG|thumb|150px|A replica of the Lanzón in Peru's [[Museum of the Nation]]]]

'''The Lanzón''' is the colloquial name for the most important statue of the central deity of the ancient [[Chavín culture]] of the central highlands of [[Peru]]. The Chavín religion was the first major religious and cultural movement in the [[Andes]] mountains, flourishing between 900 and 200 BCE. The Lanzón takes its name from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for "lance," an allusion to the shape of the sculpture.

The Lanzón is housed in the central cruciform chamber of a labyrinthine series of underground passages in the Old Temple of the ceremonial and religious center of [[Chavín de Huantar]]. Devotees would be led into the maze of pitch-black tunnels, eventually coming face to face with the sculpture's snarling mouth and upturned eyes. The worshipers' disorientation, in addition to the hallucinogenic effects of the [[San Pedro cactus]] they were given before entering, only heightened the visual and psychological impact of the sculpture.

The central image of the Lanzon functions as [[axis mundi]], or pivot linking the heavens, earth and underworld.  Position within the building also suggests centrality of image.

[[File:Le Ménestrel 1st Edition - 1 December 1833.jpg|thumb|242 px|Front page of the first edition of ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)]]
'''''Le Ménestrel''''' (The Minstrel) was an influential French music journal published weekly from 1833 until 1940. It was founded by Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry and originally printed by Poussièlgue. In 1840 it was acquired by the music publishers [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc#Heugel|Heugel]] and remained with the company until the journal's demise at the beginning of World War II. With the closure of its chief rival, ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' became France's most prestigious and longest-running music journal.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 2 and 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing history==
In 1827 [[François-Joseph Fétis]] had founded ''La Revue Musicale'', France's first periodical devoted entirely to classical music. By 1834 it had two serious competitors, ''Le Ménestrel'' established in 1833 and [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s ''Gazette Musicale'' established in 1834. ''Le Ménestrel'' was founded by the Paris publisher Joseph-Hippolyte l'Henry, with the first edition (printed by Poussièlgue) appearing on 1 December 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Gautier (1995) p. 156; ''Le Ménestrel'' (1 December 1833)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835, Schlesinger bought ''La Revue Musicale'' from Fétis and merged the two journals into ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris|La Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]''. Until ''La Revue et Gazette'' ceased publication in 1880, ''Le Ménestrel'' was to be its main rival in terms of influence and breadth of coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

E. D'Arlhac took over the directorship of ''Le Ménestrel'' in July 1835, but relinquished it the following March to the journalist and critic [[Jules Lovy]], who had been a writer for the journal since its foundation. By 1836 ''Le Ménestrel'' had a weekly print run of 600 copies, although as [[Katharine Ellis]] points out, the number of actual readers was probably much larger. At the time, Paris alone had over 500 ''[[cabinet de lecture|cabinets de lecture]]'', private reading rooms and precursors to the modern library popular in early 19th century France where for a small fee the public could read the latest issues of newspapers and journals.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis (2007) pp. 1-2 and 268-269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. Books: A Living History. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. p.105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitmore, Harry Earl. The "Cabinet de Lecture" in France, 1800-1850. The Library Quarterly, 48(1). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, the newly formed music publishing partnership of [[Jacques-Léopold Heugel]] and [[Jean-Antoine Meissonnier]] acquired ''Le Ménestrel''. Heugel became the director, and Jules Lovy stayed on as editor-in-chief until his death in 1863. Lovy was succeeded by the critic and music historian [[Joseph d'Ortigue]]. Later editors-in-chief included [[Arthur Pougin]] who served from 1885 to 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe (1948)&lt;/ref&gt; However, after d'Ortigue's death in 1866, only the Heugel name appeared on the [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]]. When Jacques-Léopold died in 1883, his son Henri-Georges Heugel took over as director. He was in turn succeeded by his own son Jacques-Paul who served as the director for the remainder of the journal's existence.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (3 February 1933) p. 52; Feurzeig (1994) p. 126; Nichols and Drake (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Ménestrel'' was published weekly for a period spanning 107 years, initially coming out on Sunday (later changed to Saturday and then Friday). The [[Franco-Prussian War]] caused publication to be suspended from late December 1870 through November 1871, and publication was suspended again for the duration of [[World War I]], with the first post-war issue appearing on 17 October 1919. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the journal carried on until the invasion of France. The 24 May 1940 issue announced that following the German attacks and the closure of theatres and concert halls in Europe and France as well as the [[Paris Conservatory]], the journal was suspending publication with the hope of resuming in the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Ménestrel'' (24 May 1940). Original text: "Nous souhaitons pouvoir reprendre, à l'automne, l'effort que nous nous sommes imposé pendant la première phase de la guerre, conscients d'avoir ainsi servi modestement, mais de notre mieux, la cause impérissable de la pensée et de l'art français."&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, it proved to be the last issue of ''Le Ménestrel''. The Heugel company continued to operate as an independent music publisher until 1980 when it was sold to [[Éditions Alphonse Leduc]].

Notable people who wrote for the journal include [[Henri Duponchel]], [[Max d'Ollone]], [[Alphonse Royer]] and [[Paul Collin]].

The [[Bible]] has been [[translation|translated]] into [[Bible translations by language|many languages]] from the [[biblical languages]] of [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]], [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]]. The Latin [[Vulgate]] translation was dominant in [[Western Christianity]] through the Middle Ages. Since then, the Bible has been translated into [[Bible translations by language|many more languages]]. [[English Bible translations]] also have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium.

Included when possible are dates and the source language(s) and, for incomplete translations, what portion of the text has been translated.  Certain terms that occur in many entries are linked at the bottom of the page.

Because different groups of Jews and Christians differ on the true content of the Bible, the "incomplete translations" section includes only translations seen by their translators as incomplete, such as Christian translations of the New Testament alone.  Translations such as Jewish versions of the [[Tanakh]] are included in the "complete" category, even though Christians traditionally have considered the Bible to consist properly of more than just the Tanakh.

|
| The RSV-2CE is a slight update of the 1966 Revised Standard Version - Catholic Edition.  It removes archaic pronouns (thee, thou) and accompanying verb forms (didst, speaketh), revises passages used in the lectionary according to the Vatican document Liturgiam authenticam and elevates some passages out of RSV footnotes when they reflect Catholic teaching. For instance, the RSV-2CE renders "almah" as "virgin" in Isaiah 7:14, restores the term "begotten" in John 3:16 and other verses, uses the phrase "full of grace" instead of "favored one" in Luke 1:28, and substitutes "mercy" for "steadfast love" (translated from the Hebrew hesed) throughout the Psalms. As with the original RSV, gender-neutral language is not used when it has no direct referent in original language of the text.

'''''Noite na Taverna''''' (in {{lang-en|A Night in the Tavern}}) is a [[short story]] collection written by [[Brazil]]ian [[Ultra-Romanticism|Ultra-Romantic]] author [[Álvares de Azevedo]] under the pen name '''Job Stern'''. It was published posthumously, in [[1855 in literature|1855]]; three years after Azevedo's death. The book is structured as a frame story containing five tales (as well as a prologue and an epilogue, thus totaling seven chapters) told by a group of five men sheltering in a [[tavern]]. It is one of the most popular and influential works of [[Gothic fiction]] in Brazilian literature.

It is said that the book was largely inspired by [[Spain|Spanish]] author [[José Cadalso]]'s 1790 work ''Noches lúgubres''.

==Plot==

===Chapter 1: "Uma Noite do Século"===
The first chapter of the book, "Uma Noite do Século" ("A Night of the Century"), introduces its setting – a tavern in an undisclosed location filled with prostitutes, drunkards and libertines. At a nearby table, influenced by the alcohol, a group of five friends – Solfieri, Bertram, Gennaro, Claudius Hermann and Johann – decide to share with each other certain events of their lives. The five tales have, in common, aspects such as unsuccessful love stories, [[cannibalism]], [[murder]]s, [[sexual violence]], [[Alcoholism|heavy drinking]], among others.

===Chapter 2: "Solfieri"===
When in [[Rome]], on a rainy night, Solfieri sees a shadow crying over a window. He realizes it is a beautiful woman. She leaves the house and Solfieri decides to follow her, and they ultimately arrive at a nearby cemetery. There, the woman cries, kneeling before a headstone, as Solfieri falls asleep watching her from afar.

One year later, Solfieri, wandering the streets of Rome after taking part in an [[orgy]], ends into a church inadvertently. He sees a coffin and, after listening to breathing noises inside, opens it, and sees the cemetery lady he met the year before inside it. After realizing that she is still alive (but in a [[catalepsy|catalepsic]] state), he carries her through the city. Arriving at his home, the woman dies two days later, of a very high fever. Solfieri buries her under the floorboards of his bedroom and pays a sculptor for a statuette built in the woman's likeness.

===Chapter 3: "Bertram"===
Bertram tells the story of his ill-fated love for a [[Spain|Spanish]] woman from [[Cádiz]], named Angela. Amidst their romance, Bertram's sick father, living in [[Denmark]], calls for him. He goes, returning two years later; however, during the time he was away, Angela marries another man, having a son with him. Despite this, Bertram tries to maintain his affair with her, but Angela's husband finds out everything. Before her husband kills her, she kills him and her child, and flees with Bertram.

One day, without further explanations, she leaves him. Bertram sinks into despair as he tries to forget Angela; subdued by woe, he faints in the middle of a street and is run over by a chariot. The passengers of the chariot, an old man and his 18-year-old daughter, help him and take him to their mansion so he can recover. Bertram gets in love with the lady and they flee together, but he ultimately gets bored with her and sells the lady to a pirate in a card game. Later, he would learn that the girl poisoned the pirate and threw herself in the sea.

Having moved to [[Italy]], Bertram decides to kill himself there, but when he is about to do it, he is saved by a sailor whom he kills unintentionally. Bertram spends some time in the sailor's ship (a [[corvette]]), where he gets in love with the [[Captain (naval)|captain]]'s wife, being requited.

In the midst of this affair, the ship is attacked by pirates and sinks, but not without making the other one sink too. The captain, his wife, Bertram and two other unnamed sailors are able to save themselves in a [[raft]]. Some time later, with no water or food, the two unnamed sailors being washed out by the sea, the three lot in order to discover who will be killed and serve as food for the others. The chosen one is the captain, but he does not accept his fate and fights for his life. He loses the fight however, and Bertram and the woman are obligated to eat him because of the lack of food, maintaining themselves for two days.

Arriving at a beach, both already weakened by hunger, the woman asks Bertram for a last moment of love before her death. Afraid of dying, Bertram strangles her and lives at the beach in complete solitude until he is found by a British [[brig]] that rescues him.

===Chapter 4: "Gennaro"===
The painter Gennaro reminisces of when he was the young apprentice of the famous Godofredo Walsh. Walsh had a young, beautiful wife named Nauza (whom Gennaro loved) and a young, beautiful daughter named Laura (who loved Gennaro). One day, Laura gets pregnant of Gennaro, but when she proposes marriage to him, he declines. Displeased, she gradually sinks into [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and dies, taking the baby with her.

The old painter, not knowing anything, visits his daughter's bedroom every night and, because of this, Gennaro starts sleeping with his wife. However, the painter is able to make Gennaro confess everything in a certain night. Days later, Godofredo takes Gennaro to a cliff and tries to kill him; however, he survives the fall and decides to return to Godofredo's house – initially planning to apologize, but later he changes his mind and decides to take his revenge on the painter and murder him. However, when he arrives at the painter's house, he finds both Nauza and Godofredo dead.

===Chapter 5: "Claudius Hermann"===
Claudius Hermann, an assiduous [[gambling|gambler]], spots the beautiful Duchess Eleonora at a [[horse racing|horse race]] and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets her once more in a [[theatre]] later on, and during an entire week he [[stalking|stalks]] her.

In a certain night, he [[bribery|bribes]] one of the duchess' lackeys for permission to enter her house for an hour, and also obtains a copy of her bedroom's keys. He puts [[sedative]] in the duchess' wine and has sex with her, returning for many nights.

One day, however, her husband, [[Duke]] Maffio, inadvertently drinks some of the sedative as well. Desperate and afraid of being caught, Claudius plans to kill him, but changes his mind and kidnaps Eleonora instead while she is still sleeping. Arriving in an [[inn]], she wakes up, and Claudius tells her everything, forcing her to stay with him. Optionless, she accepts.

Some days later, Claudius has to leave in order to take care of some affairs; when he returns home, he finds the duchess and her husband dead.

===Chapter 6: "Johann"===
Johann's story begins in a different tavern, located in [[Paris]]. He was playing a game of [[Carom billiards|carambole]] with a blond-haired man named Arthur. Johann was losing the game, while Arthur only needed to score one point to win. When it is Johann's turn to play, Arthur bumps into the table (accidentally or not), detouring Johann's ball, thus making him lose the game. Infuriated, he defies Arthur to a duel, which he accepts. They stop at a [[hotel]] to get the guns, and the blond man writes two letters. They head to a deserted and dark street. In there, they choose their guns – but only one is loaded.

They shoot. It is revealed that Johann's gun was the loaded one, and Arthur, before supposedly dying, hands Johann the letters he wrote. The first letter is addressed to Arthur's mother, and the other one is addressed to his girlfriend; he also hands Johann her address and an engagement ring. Pretending to be Arthur, Johann then decides to steal his girlfriend.

In the morning after they sleep together, Johann is attacked by a mysterious man. After a short struggle, he kills the man. However, after a close inspection, he discovers that the man he killed was his own brother, and Arthur's girlfriend was his sister.

===Chapter 7: "Último Beijo de Amor"===
In the last chapter, "Último Beijo de Amor" ("Last Love Kiss"), the orgy ends; everyone is sleeping. A mysterious hooded figure walks into the tavern and kills Johann, and then heads toward a man named Arnold.

The figure is revealed to be Giorgia, Johann's sister, and Arnold is actually Arthur (who was saved by a passerby after the duel) under a false name. Giorgia reveals to Arthur that she wanted to get her revenge on Johann, and having done so, the honor Johann stole from her when they slept together is finally restored.

After exchanging some love words with Arthur, both decide to commit suicide.

==Adaptations==
An [[Independent film|independent]] [[short film]] based on the book received a [[limited release]] around some Brazilian [[film festival]]s and [[arthouse cinema]]s on March 6, 2014.

[[File:Norbulingka Institute, with Dhauladhar range in the background.jpg|right|thumb|Norbulingka Institute, with [[Dhauladhar]] range in the background.]]
'''Norbulingka Institute''', founded in 1995 by Kelsang and [[Kim Yeshi]] at Sidhpur, near [[Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]], [[India]], is dedicated to the preservation of the Tibetan culture in its literary and artistic forms.

==Etymology==
The institute is named after [[Norbulingka]], the traditional summer residence of the [[Dalai Lama]]s, in [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]]. The ground plan is based on the proportions of Avalokitesvara, the thousand-armed god of compassion, with the temple as the head.

==Overview==
[[File:Thangkaschilder.jpg|220x220px|thumb|A [[thangka]] painter, Norbulingka Institute]]
Norbulingka is dedicated to handing down tradition and restoring standards by providing training, education and employment for Tibetans. It supports an environment in which Tibetan community and family values can flourish. It reconciles the traditional creatively and respectfully with the modern, and seeks to create an international awareness of Tibetan values and their expression in art and literature. Norbulingka produces high quality, traditionally crafted art objects, as well as clothing and home furnishings. Free guided tours of the institute are available to visitors every day except Sunday. Workshop are also offered for those wishing to study Tibetan arts. The institute also runs two guesthouses—Norling Guesthouse and Chonor House. All proceeds from all Norbulingka's projects go directly back into the institute to further our endeavors to preserve Tibetan culture.

Norbulingka's art studios include Tibetan statue making, [[thangka]] painting, screen-printing, applique and tailoring, woodcarving, wood painting, papermaking, and wood and metal craft.

The Academy of Tibetan Culture, established in 1997, offers a three-year course of higher education in traditional Tibetan studies, as well as English, Chinese, and world history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norlingaotc.org] Academy of Tibetan Culture Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Research Department of Norbulingka houses the team composing the official biography of the Dalai Lama, of which nine volumes in Tibetan have already been published. The research section is also compiling a comprehensive encyclopedia of Tibetan culture.

[[File:Seat of Happiness Temple, Norbulingka Institute, Dharamsala.jpg|right|thumb|''Seat of Happiness Temple'', Norbulingka Institute.]]
The institute also has the two-storeyed 'Seat of Happiness Temple' (Deden Tsuglakhang) built in 1985 and set amidst the Japanese inspired Norbulingka gardens. It is known for its 1,173 murals of Buddha, frescoes of all the [[Dalai Lama]]s and drawings chronicling the life of the [[14th Dalai Lama]]. In the main hall stands the 4 mt high gilded copper Buddha [[Sakyamuni]] statue, made by institute's master statue-maker, the late Chenmo Pemba Dorje, and one of largest such statues outside Tibet. Around the temple are workshops of artisans and apprentices that produce various art objects, which are sold at the Norbulingka Shop, for the benefit of Tibetan refugees.

The Losel Doll Museum has [[diorama]] displays of traditional Tibetan scenes, using miniature Tibetan dolls in traditional costumes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qMqBvtL_nI0C&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Norbulingka+Institute&amp;as_brr=0#PPA514,M1 Norbulingka Institute] ''Frommer's India'', by Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, Niloufer Venkatraman, Shonar Joshi.

'''Onomatopoeia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-onomatopoeia.ogg|ˌ|ɒ|n|ə|ˌ|m|æ|t|ə|ˈ|p|iː|ə|,_|-|ˌ|m|ɑː|-}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wells |first=John C. |year=2008 |title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary |edition=3rd |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-1-4058-8118-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Roach |first=Peter |year=2011 |title=Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary |edition=18th |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-15253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὀνοματοποιία;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29nomatopoii%2Fa ὀνοματοποιία], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; ὄνομα for "name"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29%2Fnoma ὄνομα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and ποιέω for "I make",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpoie%2Fw ποιέω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; [[adjectival form]]: "onomatopoeic" or "onomatopoetic") is the process of creating a word that [[phonetics|phonetically]] imitates, resembles, or suggests the sound that it describes. As such words are  [[uncountable noun]]s, ''onomatopoeia'' refers to the property of such words. Common occurrences of words of the onomatopoeia process include animal noises such as "oink", "miaow" (or "meow"), "roar" and "chirp". Onomatopoeia can differ between languages: it conforms to some extent to the broader [[natural language|linguistic]] system;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/new_literary_history/v027/27.3bredin.html Onomatopoeia as a Figure and a Linguistic Principle], Hugh Bredin, The Johns Hopkins University, Retrieved November 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://literarydevices.net/onomatopoeia/ Definition of Onomatopoeia], Retrieved November 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; hence the sound of a clock may be expressed as ''tick tock'' in [[English language|English]], ''tictac'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''dī dā'' in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], ''katchin katchin'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or "tik-tik" in [[Hindi language|Hindi]].

Although in the English language the term '''onomatopoeia''' means "the imitation of a sound", the compound word ''onomatopoeia'' (ὀνοματοποιία) in the Greek language means "making or creating names". For words that imitate sounds, the term ὴχομιμητικό (echomimetico) or [[echomimetic]]) is used. The word ὴχομιμητικό (echomimetico) derives from "ὴχώ", meaning echo or sound, and "μιμητικό", meaning mimetic or imitating.

== Uses ==
[[File:Noveltyitems.JPG|thumb|A bang flag gun, a humouristic [[novelty item]]]]
{{further|List of animal sounds}}

In the case of a [[frog]] croaking, the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds: [[Ancient Greek]] ''brekekekex koax koax'' (only in Aristophanes' comic play ''The Frogs'') probably for [[marsh frog]]s; English ''[[wikt:ribbit|ribbit]]'' for species of frog found in North America; English verb ''[[wikt:croak|croak]]'' for the [[common frog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/2000/5/00.05.11.x.html |title=Basic Reading of Sound Words-Onomatopoeia |publisher=Yale University |date= |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other very common English-language examples are ''hiccup'', ''zoom'', ''bang'', ''beep'', ''moo'', and ''splash''. [[Machine]]s and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia: ''honk'' or ''beep-beep'' for the horn of an automobile, and ''vroom'' or ''brum'' for the engine. In speaking of a mishap involving an audible [[electric arc|arcing]] of electricity, the word "zap" is often used (and its use has been extended to describe non-auditory effects generally connoting the same sort of localized but thorough{{clarify|date=May 2017}} interference or destruction similar to that produced in short-circuit sparking).

Human sounds sometimes provide instances of onomatopoeia, as when ''mwah'' is used to represent a kiss.&lt;ref name="mwah_ocford"&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mwah English Oxford Living Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt;

For animal sounds, words like ''[[Quack (sound)#Communication|quack]]'' ([[duck]]), ''moo'' (cow), ''[[Bark (utterance)|bark]]'' or ''woof'' (dog), ''[[Roar (utterance)|roar]]'' ([[lion]]), ''[[meow]]''/''[[miaow]]'' or ''[[purr]]'' (cat), ''cluck'' ([[chicken]]) and ''baa'' (sheep) are typically used in English (both as nouns and as verbs).

Some languages flexibly integrate onomatopoeic words into their structure. This may evolve into a new word, up to the point that the process is no longer recognized as onomatopoeia. One example is the English word  "bleat" for sheep noise: in [[medieval]] times it was pronounced approximately as "blairt" (but without an R-component), or "blet" with the vowel drawled, which more closely resembles a sheep noise than the modern pronunciation.

An example of the opposite case is "[[cuckoo]]", which, due to continuous familiarity with the bird noise down the centuries, has kept approximately the same pronunciation as in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] times and its vowels have not changed as they have in the word ''furrow''.

''[[Verbum dicendi|Verba dicendi]]'' ("words of saying") are a method of integrating onomatopoeic words and [[ideophone]]s into grammar.

Sometimes, things are named from the sounds they make. In English, for example, there is the universal fastener which is named for the sound it makes: the [[zipper|zip]] (in the UK) or [[zipper]] (in the U.S.) Many birds are named after their calls, such as the [[bobwhite quail]], the [[weero]], the [[morepork]], the [[killdeer]], [[chickadee]]s and [[jay]]s, the [[common cuckoo|cuckoo]], the [[common chiffchaff|chiffchaff]], the [[whooping crane]], the [[whip-poor-will]], and the [[kookaburra]]. In [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Malayalam]], the word for [[crow]] is ''kaakaa''. This practice is especially common in certain languages such as [[Māori language|Māori]], and so in names of animals borrowed from these languages.

=== Cross-cultural differences ===
Although a particular sound is heard similarly by people of different cultures, it is often expressed through the use of different consonant strings in different languages. For example, the ''snip'' of a pair of scissors is ''cri-cri'' in Italian, ''riqui-riqui'' in Spanish, ''terre-terre'' or ''treque-treque'' in Portuguese, ''krits-krits'' in modern Greek and ''katr-katr'' in Hindi.&lt;ref&gt;Earl Anderson, ''A Grammar of Iconism'', Fairleigh Dickinson, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "honk" of a car's horn is ''ba-ba'' ([[Han characters|Han]]: 叭叭) in Mandarin, ''tut-tut'' in [[French language|French]], ''pu-pu'' in Japanese, ''bbang-bbang'' in [[Korean language|Korean]], ''bært-bært'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], ''fom-fom'' in Portuguese and ''bim-bim'' in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

=== Onomatopoeic effect without onomatopoeic words ===
An onomatopoeic effect can also be produced in a phrase or word string with the help of [[alliteration]] and [[literary consonance|consonance]] alone, without using any onomatopoeic words. The most famous example is the phrase ''"furrow followed free"'' in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. The words "followed" and "free" are not onomatopoeic in themselves, but in conjunction with "furrow" they reproduce the sound of ripples following in the wake of a speeding ship. Similarly, alliteration has been used in the line ''"as the surf surged up the sun swept shore..."'', to recreate the sound of breaking waves, in the poem "I, She and the Sea".

== Comics and advertising ==
[[File:CRAC w.jpg|thumb|A sound effect of breaking a door]]
[[Comic strip]]s and [[comic book]]s make extensive use of onomatopoeia. Popular culture historian Tim DeForest noted the impact of writer-artist [[Roy Crane]] (1901–1977), the creator of ''[[Captain Easy]]'' and ''[[Buz Sawyer]]'':
:It was Crane who pioneered the use of onomatopoeic sound effects in comics, adding "bam," "pow" and "wham" to what had previously been an almost entirely visual vocabulary. Crane had fun with this, tossing in an occasional "ker-splash" or "lickety-wop" along with what would become the more standard effects. Words as well as images became vehicles for carrying along his increasingly fast-paced storylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=DeForest |first=Tim |title=Storytelling in the Pulps, Comics, and Radio: How Technology Changed Popular Fiction in America |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xAXWwYchscC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22wash+tubbs%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22wash%20tubbs%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[DC Comics]] introduced a villain named [[Onomatopoeia (comics)|Onomatopoeia]], an athlete, martial artist, and weapons expert, who often speaks pure sounds.

[[Advertising]] uses onomatopoeia for [[mnemonic]] purposes, so that consumers will remember their products, as in [[Alka-Seltzer]]'s "Plop, plop, fizz, fizz. Oh, what a relief it is!" jingle, recorded in two different versions (big band and rock) by [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]

[[Rice Krispies]] (US and UK) and [[Rice Bubbles]] (AU){{clarify|date=May 2017}} make a "snap, crackle,   pop" when one pours on milk. During the 1930s, the illustrator [[Vernon Simeon Plemion Grant|Vernon Grant]] developed [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] as gnome-like mascots for the [[Kellogg Company]].

Sounds appear in road safety advertisements: "clunk click, every trip" (click the seatbelt on after clunking the car door closed; UK campaign) or "click, clack, front and back" (click, clack of connecting the [[seat belt]]s; AU campaign) or "click it or ticket" (click of the connecting seat belt, with the implied penalty of a traffic ticket for not using a seat belt; US DOT (Department of Transportation) campaign).

The sound of the container opening and closing gives [[Tic Tac]] its name.

=== Manner imitation ===
{{Main|Ideophone}}
In many of the world's languages, onomatopoeic-like words are used to describe phenomena beyond the purely auditive. Japanese often uses such words to describe feelings or figurative expressions about objects or concepts. For instance, Japanese ''barabara'' is used to reflect an object's state of disarray or separation, and ''shiiin'' is the onomatopoetic form of absolute silence (used at the time an English speaker might expect to hear the sound of [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] chirping or a pin dropping in a silent room, or someone coughing). It is used in English as well with terms like ''[[bling]]'', which describes the glinting of light on things like gold, chrome or precious stones. In Japanese, ''kirakira'' is used for glittery things.

== Examples in media ==
* [[James Joyce]] in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) coined the onomatopoeic ''tattarrattat'' for a knock on the door.&lt;ref name="Joyce1982"&gt;{{cite book |author=James Joyce |title=Ulysses |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZdOUXIOBhwC&amp;pg=PT434 |year=1982 |publisher=Editions Artisan Devereaux |isbn=978-1-936694-38-9 |pages=434– |quote=...I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is listed as the longest [[palindromic]] word in ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref name="Booty2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=O.A.

* ''[[Whaam!]]'' (1963) by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] is an early example of [[pop art]], featuring a reproduction of comic book art that depicts a fighter aircraft striking another with rockets with dazzling red and yellow explosions.
* In the 1960s TV series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', comic book style onomatopoeic words such as ''wham!'', ''pow!'', ''biff!'', ''crunch!'' and ''zounds!'' appear onscreen during fight scenes.
* [[Ubisoft]]'s ''[[XIII (video game)|XIII]]'' employed the use of comic book onomatopoeic words such as ''bam!'', ''boom!'' and ''noooo!'' during gameplay for gunshots, explosions and kills, respectively. The comic-book style is apparent throughout the game and is a core theme, and the game is an adaptation of [[XIII (comics)|a comic book of the same name]].
* The chorus of American popular songwriter [[John Prine]]'s song "Onomatopoeia" cleverly incorporates onomatopoeic words (though as discussed, 'ouch!' is not the sound of pain):  "Bang! went the pistol. | Crash! went the window. | Ouch! went the son of a gun. | Onomatopoeia | I don't wanna see ya | Speaking in a foreign tongue."
* The marble game [[KerPlunk (game)|KerPlunk]] has an onomatopoeic word for a title, from the sound of  [[marbles]] dropping when one too many sticks has been removed.
* The [[Nickelodeon]] cartoon's title ''[[KaBlam!]]'' is implied to be onomatapoeic to a crash.
* Each [[List of Harper's Island episodes|episode]] of the TV series ''[[Harper's Island]]'' is given an onomatopoeic name which imitates the sound made in that episode when a character dies. For example, in the episode titled ''"Bang"'' a character is shot and fatally wounded, with the "Bang" mimicking the sound of the gunshot.
* ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' Magazine cartoonist [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]], already popular for his exaggerated artwork, often employed comic-book style onomatopoeic "sound effects" in his drawings (for example, "thwizzit" is the sound of a sheet of paper being yanked from a typewriter).  Fans have compiled [http://www.madcoversite.com/dmd.html ''The Don Martin Dictionary''], cataloguing each "sound" and its "meaning".

== Cross-linguistic examples ==
{{Main|Cross-linguistic onomatopoeias}}

== In linguistics ==
A key component of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent{{clarify|date=May 2017}}, as a word is a sound created by humans with attached meaning to said sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Assaneo |first=María Florencia |last2=Nichols |first2=Juan Ignacio |last3=Trevisan |first3=Marcos Alberto |date=2011-01-01 |title=The anatomy of onomatopoeia |journal=PLoS One |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=e28317 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028317 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=3237459 |pmid=22194825}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one can determine the meaning of a word purely by how it sounds. However, in onomatopoeic words, these sounds are much less arbitrary; they are connected in their imitation of other objects or sounds in nature. Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds doesn't necessarily gain meaning, but can gain symbolic meaning.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=RHODES |first=R |date=1994 |title=Aural Images |url= |journal=In J. Ohala, L. Hinton &amp; J. Nichols (eds.) Sound Symbolism. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press |volume= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this [[sound symbolism]] in the English language is the use of words starting with ''sn-''. Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose (''sneeze'', ''snot'', ''snore''). This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose, but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself. Onomatopoeia, while a facet of language, is also in a sense outside of the confines of language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?sid=a6add37f-bf5b-4b3d-a431-9adb50d76cd5@sessionmgr4006&amp;vid=12&amp;hid=4203&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=88455764&amp;db=ufh |title=The Study of Onomatopoeia in the Muslims' Holy Write: Qur'an: OneSearch for Articles, Books, and More |website=eds.a.ebscohost.com |language=en |access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In linguistics, onomatopoeia is described as the connection, or symbolism, of a sound that is interpreted and reproduced within the context of a language, usually out of mimicry of a sound.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bredin |first=Hugh |date=1996-08-01 |title=Onomatopoeia as a Figure and a Linguistic Principle |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/24304 |journal=New Literary History |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=555–569 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1996.0031 |issn=1080-661X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a figure of speech, in a sense. Considered a vague term on its own, there are a few varying defining factors in classifying onomatopoeia. In one manner, it is defined simply as the imitation of some kind of non-vocal sound using the vocal sounds of a language, like the hum of a bee being imitated with a “buzz” sound. In another sense, it is described as the phenomena of making a new word entirely.

Onomatopoeia works in the sense of symbolizing an idea in a phonological context, not necessarily constituting a direct meaningful word in the process.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Laing |first=C. E. |date=2014-09-15 |title=A phonological analysis of onomatopoeia in early word production |url=http://fla.sagepub.com/cgi/doi/10.1177/0142723714550110 |journal=First Language |language=en |doi=10.1177/0142723714550110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbolic properties of a sound in a word, or a [[phoneme]], is related to a sound in an environment, and are restricted in part by a language's own phonetic inventory, hence why many languages can have distinct onomatopoeia for the same natural sound. Depending on a language’s connection to a sound's meaning, that language’s onomatopoeia inventory can differ proportionally. For example, a language like English generally holds little symbolic representation when it comes to sounds, which is the reason English tends to have a smaller representation of sound mimicry then a language like Japanese that overall has a much higher amount of symbolism related to the sounds of the language.

== The evolution of language ==
In ancient Greek philosophy, onomatopoeia was used as evidence for how natural a language was: it was theorized that language itself was derived from natural sounds in the world around us. Symbolism in sounds was seen as deriving from this.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Osaka |first=Naoyuki |year=1990 |title=Multidimensional Analysis of Onomatopoeia -A note to make sensory scale from word |url=http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/52479/1/soa024_025.pdf |journal=Studia phonologica |volume= |pages=25–33 |via=Kyoto University Research Information Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some linguists hold that onomatopoeia may have been the first form of human language.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the development of a language, sounds that are associated with natural objects then go on to form words with related meanings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, ''gl-'' at the beginning of an English word can denote something that is shining or iridescent (e.g. glitter, glisten, gleam).{{dubious|date=May 2017}}

== Role in early language acquisition ==
When first exposed to sound and communication, humans are biologically inclined to mimic the sounds they hear, whether they are actual pieces of language or other natural sounds.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Assaneo |first=María Florencia |last2=Nichols |first2=Juan Ignacio |last3=Trevisan |first3=Marcos Alberto |date=2011-12-14 |title=The Anatomy of Onomatopoeia |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028317 |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=12 |pages=e28317 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0028317 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=3237459 |pmid=22194825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early on in development, an infant will vary his/her utterances between sounds that are well established within the phonetic range of the language(s) most heavily spoken in their environment, which may be called "tame" onomatopoeia, and the full range of sounds that the vocal tract can produce, or "wild" onomatopoeia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As one begins to acquire one's first language, the proportion of "wild" onomatopoeia reduces in favor of sounds which are congruent with those of the language they are acquiring.

During the native language acquisition period, it has been documented that infants may react strongly to the more wild-speech features to which they are exposed, compared to more tame and familiar speech features. But the results of such tests are inconclusive.

In the context of language acquisition, sound symbolism has been shown to play an important role.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The association of foreign words to subjects and how they relate to general objects, such as the association of the words takete and baluma{{Fix|text=are these arbitrary nonsense words which are used in tests?}} with either a round or angular shape{{clarify|date=May 2017}}, has been tested to see how languages symbolize sounds.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

== In other languages ==

=== Japanese ===
Onomatopoeia, or ''giongo'' in Japanese, is common in the Japanese language, from day to day conversation to serious news.&lt;ref&gt;Inose, Hiroko. "Translating Japanese Onomatopoeia and Mimetic Words." N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, onomatopoeia in Japanese can be categorized into three types:
* ''Giseigo'': mimics humans and animals. (e.g. ''WanWan'' for a dog's bark)
* ''Giongo'': mimics general noises in nature or inanimate objects. (e.g. ''zaazaa'' for rain on a roof)
* ''Gitaigo'': describes states of being, not sounds. (e.g. ''mushimushi'', uncomfortably warm)
Japanese also uses a system of sound symbolic words called mimetics. Though not entirely different from onomatopoeia, words that are mimetic are generally distinguished from onomatopoeia. Mimetic, or ''gitaigo'' in Japanese, words are a phonological representation of some kind of state of being, or something that doesn't exactly make sound.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

Sometimes Japanese onomatopoeia produces reduplicated words.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Malay ===
There is a documented correlation within the Malay language of onomatopoeia that begin with the sound bu- and the implication of something that is rounded. As well as with the sound of -lok within a word conveying curvature in such words like lok, kelok and telok (locomotive, cove and curve respectively).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=WILKINSON |first=R. J. |date=1936-01-01 |title=ONOMATOPOEIA IN MALAY |jstor=41559855 |journal=Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=14 |issue=3 (126) |pages=72–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arabic ===
Within the Qur'an, written in Arabic, instances of onomatopoeia are documented.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Out of about 77,701 words, there are 9 words that are onomatopoeic, 3 which are animal sounds (e.g. "mooing"), 2 which are sounds of nature (e.g. "thunder") and 4 that are human sounds (e.g. "whisper" or "groan").

The '''Prix Blumenthal''' (or ''Blumenthal Prize'') was a [[grant (money)|grant]] or [[stipend]] awarded through the philanthropy of [[Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] (1875–1930) &amp;mdash; and the foundation she created, ''Fondation franco-américaine Florence Blumenthal (Franco-American Florence Blumenthal Foundation)'' &amp;mdash; to discover young French artists, aid them financially, and in the process draw the United States and France closer together through the arts.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; 

Winners were designated by seven juries in the fields of the literature, painting, sculpture, decorative arts, structure, engraving and music &amp;mdash; to receive a [[prize money|purse]] of six thousand francs per year, given for two years.  The purse increased in 1926 until Blumenthal's death in 1930 to ten thousand francs for two years. 

Jurors included philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]; novelist [[Roland Dorgelès]]; novelist, essayist, diplomat and playwright [[Jean Giraudoux]]; writer [[Anna de Noailles]]; poet and essayist [[Paul Valéry]]; painter [[Paul Signac]],&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; painter and printmaker [[Édouard Vuillard]], sculptor [[Paul Landowski]], painter and sculptor [[Aristide Maillol]],&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; architect [[Auguste Perret]], composer [[Paul Dukas]], composer [[Maurice Ravel]] and composer/conductor [[Guy Ropartz]].

Composer [[Georges Migot]] served as vice-president and subsequently as president (1931–1935)&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;  of the foundation, as well as the archivist of the winners.&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;   

Beginning in 1919 the foundation awarded nearly two hundred grants, and on April 11, 1937, the Prix Blumenthal was declared ''d'utilité publique ("of public service")'', giving it a special tax classification.&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;  Awards were given through 1954.&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt;  At the time of the foundation's dissolution in 1973&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt; it was under the direction of [[:fr:Georges Huisman|Georges Huisman]], director of the [[école des Beaux-Arts]], along with author [[André Maurois]] and novelist [[Roland Dorgelès]].&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;  

In 2010 (May 14 – June 5), the [[Médiathèque]] of [[Haguenau]] hosted an exhibit of the Florence Blumenthal archives.&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt;

Florence Meyer Blumenthal had married international financier George Blumenthal in 1898 &lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; and in 1919, she organized what was originally called the ''La Fondation américaine Blumenthal pour la pensée et l’art français (American Foundation for French Art and Thought)'' &amp;mdash; a name suggested by her friend, [[Paul Valéry]], the poet and essayist&lt;ref name="mediatheque"/&gt; &amp;mdash; and what ultimately became ''Fondation franco-américaine Florence Blumenthal.''

Blumethal's younger brother [[Eugene Isaac Meyer|Eugene Meyer Jr.]] later become the president and publisher of the [[Washington Post]]&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"/&gt; &amp;mdash; and was the father of [[Katharine Graham]], editor of the [[Washington Post]] during [[Watergate]].&lt;ref name="paris residence"&gt;{{cite web

 |quote       = By today's standards, George and Florence Blumenthal would definitely be considered a power couple. With palatial homes in New York and Paris, and Mediterranean yachting vacations, the Blumenthals lived vibrantly in a vibrant time. In her autobiography, retired Washington Post editor Katharine Graham described her aunt, Florence Blumenthal, as her father's much-loved sister with the perfect figure. Known as Florie to the family, she was known for bringing home massive amounts of clothing from Paris. She was also related to the powerful Levi Strauss family through her older sisters, Rosalie and Elise, each of whom had married a nephew of Strauss'. Eccentric and generous, Mrs. Blumenthal endowed the Franco-American Foundation's Florence Blumenthal Prize, and had a street named for her in Paris.

In 1925, Blumenthal moved to Paris with her husband, later donating large sums to the [[Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital|Children’s Hospital in Paris]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. Blumenthal died in Paris in 1930, at age fifty-five,&lt;ref name="FMBlumenthal"&gt;{{cite web

==Impact of the Prix==
As an example of the impact of the Prix Blumenthal, textile artist [[Paule Marrot]] received the stipend in 1928, which allowed Marrot to open her workshop in [[Batignolles]] on rue Truffaut &amp;mdash; where she became widely known for furniture textiles.&lt;ref name="legion"&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher = Hayden Harnett, Haydenharnett.com
  | url = http://haydenharnett.com/?action=about_paule_marrot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marrot went on to experience strong popularity and commercial success in the U.S. after World War II, made a strong impact at Renault by [[Renault Dauphine#Paule Marrot|pioneering the company's textile and color division]], and redefined furnishing fabrics in [[France]]. In 1952 Marrot was awarded the French [[Légion d'honneur|Légion d'honneur (Legion of Honor)]], (''Chevalier'') &amp;mdash; and her textiles continue under license to diverse companies including  [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Urban Outfitters|Anthropologie]] and the handbag maker, [[Hayden-Harnett]].&lt;ref name="legion"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://furniture.about.com/od/furniturephotogalleries/ig/Rowe-Furniture/Chair-Paule-Marrot-Collection-.htm |title=Clayton Marcus chair for Rowe Furniture using Marrot Print |publisher=Furniture.about.com |date=2013-07-14 |accessdate=2013-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513032918/http://furniture.about.com/od/furniturephotogalleries/ig/Rowe-Furniture/Chair-Paule-Marrot-Collection-.htm |archivedate=2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://purchaze.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/nike_dunk_hi_spmg.jpg |title=Nike shoe using Marrot Print |date= |accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth''', or simply '''Professor''', is a fictional character in the American [[Animated series|animated television series]] ''[[Futurama]]''. Farnsworth is the [[mad scientist]] proprietor of the Planet Express delivery service, for whom the main characters work. He is the great (×30) [[Nephew and niece|nephew]] of [[Fry (Futurama)|Philip J. Fry]], the series' protagonist. He alternates between [[intelligence]] and [[Amorality|amoral]] [[Dementia|senility]] due to his greatly advanced age. He demonstrates a mastery of any field of science necessary for the series' plots, and is suggested to be one of the most brilliant [[inventor]]s on Earth. However, he falls asleep constantly, and he is implied to have routinely sent his former crews on [[suicide mission]]s.

==Character==
A self-described [[mad scientist]], the Professor is a [[senile]], amoral, deranged, and unpredictable old man (160 years old as of "[[A Clone of My Own]]"), with very thick glasses and a gift for creating doomsday devices and atomic supermen. He has put at least one [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] in peril with his inventions and visited dozens more (see "[[The Farnsworth Parabox]]").

The Professor teaches at [[Mars University]] and has worked for Momcorp on several occasions, but spends most of his time inventing ridiculous devices and sending the Planet Express delivery crew on [[suicide mission]]s. While at Momcorp, he fell in love with the CEO, [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]], only to leave her and Momcorp when she decided to weaponize his "Q.T. McWhiskers" toy. What he is a professor ''of'' is never explicitly stated. In the episode [[Mars University]] when asked what he is teaching, he responds: "The same thing I teach every semester, the mathematics of quantum neutrino fields. I made up the title so no student would dare take it"; however, this declaration has not precluded the professor from demonstrating mastery of whatever field of science is convenient for a given episode's plot, as shown in ''[[Bender's Big Score]]'' when he proclaims, "I can wire anything directly into anything! I am the Professor!", proceeding to link Hermes' disembodied head to the ship's computer. Approximately 100 years before the series' timeline, he taught a young [[List of recurring Futurama characters#Dr. Ogden Wernstrom|(not yet Professor) Wernstrom]], whom Farnsworth regarded as a prized student. After he returned a pop quiz to Wernstrom with a grade of A-minus (for poor [[penmanship]]), the two became bitter rivals (established in "[[A Big Piece of Garbage]]").

As [[Philip J. Fry]]'s great (x30) nephew, it is likely that he is the great (x29) grandson of Yancy Fry, Philip's brother from the 20th century. This would also make him the great (x28) grandson of Philip J. Fry II, Yancy's son, although his exact shared family members with Fry have not been stated. However, since Fry has become his own grandfather, he is also Fry's direct descendant, specifically his great (x32) grandson.

In "[[All the Presidents' Heads]]," he reveals that he is descended from [[Philo Farnsworth]] (widely credited as the original inventor of television); Dean Farnsworth, who created the [[Farnsworth Lantern Test]] to check for [[color vision]] problems in military aviators and sailors; and [[David Farnsworth]], a colonial-era counterfeiter who was eventually hanged for his crimes.

Many episodes' major plot points are introduced by Farnsworth announcing, "Good news, everyone!"—either to unveil his latest invention or describe the company's latest delivery assignment, which is usually a [[suicide mission]]; he acknowledges this in ''[[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|The Beast with a Billion Backs]]''.  On the very few occasions he has ''actual'' good news, he often opens with "Bad news, everyone!" After Fry resigns from his job in "[[Law &amp; Oracle]]", he states that he only says these phrases to make Fry "feel better about his pointless job." Another is his exclamation, "Sweet [[zombie]] [[Jesus]]!" He often says "Eh Wha?" when unaware of the situation, or when someone questions a statement he has just made. The Professor often makes mutually contradictory statements just moments apart; this happens especially often when briefing his employees, with the prevailing second statement canceling a much more reassuring first sentence.

The Professor rarely worries about the safety of the crew, viewing them as a means to an end, as evidenced in the first episode. After remarking that he was looking for a new crew for his intergalactic space ship, he was asked "What happened to your old crew?" His response was "Oh, those poor sons of... &amp;mdash; but that's not important! What is important is that I need a new crew!" Farnsworth's employees later discover that their predecessors died while gathering not-ordinary honey from Space Bees ("[[The Sting (Futurama)|The Sting]]"). The Professor issues his new crew the previous crew's career chips from a manila envelope labeled "Contents Of Space Wasp's Stomach" ("[[Space Pilot 3000]]").

Some of his more significant inventions include a hat that advanced a monkey to human-level intelligence, a race of mutant atomic supermen, a wide range of doomsday devices, and a pioneer in the development of the 'modern' robots used in the 31st century.

It was revealed in "[[Mobius Dick (Futurama)|Mobius Dick]]" that the first crew was ingested by a four-dimensional space whale in 2961, only returning to Earth when rescued by [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] in 3011. This appears to be the only crew the Professor showed some emotion towards, given his purchasing of a monument to honor the 50th year of their disappearance.

He frequently sends his crew on dangerous missions even when he has the foreknowledge that they will probably not make it back alive. His missions are typically those other delivery companies will not take, such as serving [[subpoena]]s to [[Mafia]]-controlled worlds or casual deliveries to [[virus]]-infested planets. Even the commercial that he had produced for his company makes several remarks to this effect, including "When other companies aren't crazy or foolhardy enough…" and "Our crew is replaceable, your package isn't."

In one episode when the crew and his ship are sent off to war, he immediately tries to hire another crew, going so far as to assign them similar character roles; he is clearly surprised to be interrupted by his old crew returning. Even his familial relationship to Fry does not dampen the glee with which he assigns dangerous delivery missions. When asked about the nature of his delivery "business", Farnsworth once clarified that he viewed his company more as "a source of cheap labor, like a family." He also frequently covets his employees' organs and blood; he keeps [[Amy Wong]] around because they share a blood type. In another episode, he tries to get [[Hermes Conrad]] to kill himself in a way that would not damage his liver because "other people need it".

It is established in the episode "[[Mother's Day (Futurama)|Mother's Day]]" that the Professor was once [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]]'s lover and employee. However, they could not maintain their relationship due to Mom's lust for power, prompting them to break up (this reportedly happened three times). When Mom takes control of all the world's robots to cause an uprising, her sons [[Mom (Futurama)#Sons|Walt, Larry, and Igner]] attempt to get the Professor to seduce Mom and retrieve the remote for the robots. They get back together briefly, but break up once more when Mom learns the Professor had been initially using her. It is revealed in ''[[Bender's Game]]'' that the Professor is the biological father of Mom's youngest son Igner&amp;nbsp;— the one whom Mom despises the most.

Many references to the pulp science fiction magazine ''[[Weird Tales]]'' indicate the Professor may be named in honour of its editor [[Farnsworth Wright]]. Another possibility is that he is named after the American inventor and television pioneer [[Philo Farnsworth]]  who appeared in the ''Futurama'' episode "[[All The Presidents' Heads]]" as an ancestor of the Professor and Philip J. Fry.

==Production==
Professor Farnsworth is voiced by [[Billy West]], using a combination of impressions of [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Frank Morgan]].&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite news |author= |work=[[Fresh Air]] |title=Billy West: The Many (Cartoon) Voices In His Head |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128490848 |quote='He sort of fades in and out. ...

Farnsworth's design has been compared to a combination of [[Mr. Burns]], [[Grampa Simpson]], and [[Professor Frink]] from [[Matt Groening]]'s other series, ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EFD61530F937A15752C0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2| title=Groening's New World, 1,000 Years From Springfield | author=Gates, Anita| date=1999-01-24| accessdate=2008-06-13| work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; West has stated that the voice for Farnsworth is meant to be a bit shaky and that when developing the voice he came up with "a combination of all the wizard-type characters you heard when you were a kid, Burgess Meredith and Frank Morgan in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''." &lt;ref name="Futurama-rama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/futurama-rama-welcome-back-to-the-world-of-tomorrow/| title=‘Futurama’-Rama: Welcome Back to the World of Tomorrow| author=Itzkoff, Dave| publisher= ''The New York Times''| date=2010-06-24| accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a direct nod to this in the episode "[[Anthology of Interest II]]", in which the Professor portrays the Wizard of Oz. In the initial storyboards of "[[Space Pilot 3000]]", Fry presumed that the Professor was descended from a supposed sister and a supposed brother-in-law named Eddie Farnsworth. In the first season, Farnsworth would excuse his unhelpfulness by saying that he was "already in his pajamas". This was an early attempt at a catchprase that was abandoned after the second episode, "[[The Series Has Landed]]".

In the "Action Delivery Force" segment of "[[Reincarnation (Futurama)|Reincarnation]]", Professor Farnsworth is voiced by [[David Herman]].&lt;ref name=VerroneStreamInterview&gt;{{cite web|last=Verrone|first=Patric|title=Futurama Writer/Co-Executive Producer Patric Verrone|url=http://thestream.tv/futurama-writerco-executive-producer-patric-veronne/|publisher=theStream.tv|accessdate=29 December 2011|quote='''Patric Verrone:''' Normally the voice of Professor Farnsworth, the leader of the Action Defense Team there, is played by Billy West. This was actually David Herman- who did the voice.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Resolution''' is a [[talent agent|talent and literary agency]] with headquarters in [[Los Angeles]], California.  It was formed by Jeff Berg, the former chairman of [[ICM Partners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=EXCLUSIVE: Jeff Berg Opens New Agency 'Resolution' Monday|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/01/jeff-berg-opens-new-agency-resolution-monday/|accessdate=February 23, 2014|newspaper=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Resolution represents artists including [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Roman Polanski]], [[Molly Ringwald]], [[David Duchovny]], [[Gina Gershon]], and [[Haley Joel Osment]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} As of 2014 it was one of the ten largest agencies in the United States.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Berg left ICM after the management buyout in October 2012, and opened Resolution on January 28, 2013.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/jeff-berg-unveils-resolution-agency-1118065308/ |title=Jeff Berg unveils Resolution agency |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new agency was capitalized with a $200 million investment from Jahm Najafi, a former [[Salomon Brothers]] banker active in private equity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jeff-berg-launches-talent-agency-415901 |title=Jeff Berg Launches Talent Agency |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
In March 2014, Bison Capital, a Chinese investment firm, made an investment in Resolution. During 2014, the agency saw the departure of several key agents.

'''Rider Spoke''' developed by [[Blast Theory]] in collaboration with the Mixed Reality Lab was first staged at the [[Barbican]], [[London]] in October 2007. Created for cyclists, it combines elements of [[theatre]], [[performance]], [[game play]] and state of the art technology. Rider Spoke was built in the IPerG project on the [http://equip.sourceforge.net/ EQUIP] [[Software architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh2013-Homepage"/&gt;

Rider Spoke has since been presented in [[Athens]] (2008), [[Brighton]] (2008), [[Budapest]] (2008), [[Sydney]] (2009, [[Adelaide]] (2009) and [[Liverpool]] (2010).

== Description ==
Three years after the events in ''[[Runemarks]]'', the Middle World has changed again. After the destruction of the Order, the surviving gods, having rescued their friends from the Black Fortress of Netherworld, have regrouped in the village of Malbry. The General is dead and chances of rebuilding Asgard seem remote. But a prophecy, coupled with the appearance of unnatural creatures in the Middle Worlds, reveal a breach in Chaos, which may lead to another Apocalypse. Once more, Maddy and her friends are forced to confront an enemy. This time, the enemy is one of their own, a renegade from World's End - Maddy's twin sister. They are both the daughters of [[Thor]].

'''Serindian art''' is the art that developed from the 2nd through the 11th century C.E. in [[Serindia]] or [[Xinjiang]], the western region of China that forms part of [[Central Asia]].

It derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Gandharan sculpture combined Indian traditions with Greek influences. Greek-influenced culture was most probably in existence prior to [[Alexander the Great]]'s invasions, Afghanistan natives retained this influence which was lost in Greece.{{Verify source|date=November 2017}}

Modern researchers hypothesize that Buddhist missionaries travelling on the [[Silk Road]] introduced this artistic influence, along with [[Buddhism]] itself, into Serindia, resulting in a style that is a hybrid of Greek, Chinese and Persian.

In modernity, Serindian art was rediscovered through the expeditions of [[Sir Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia at the beginning of the 20th century.

The '''Stained Glass Association of America''' (originally The National Ornamental Glass Manufacturers Association) is a trade association formed in 1903 to protect the United States ornamental and [[stained-glass]] industry from foreign competition by cheaper European glass imports into the United States. The organisation campaigned for decades for high import taxes to be imposed on European glass which was much cheaper than U.S. glass due to the much lower wage costs in Europe, which they described as "[[unfair competition]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://stainedglass.org/?page_id=167 ''History of the SGAA''] Stained Glass Association of America, 2012. Retrieved 1 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association published a journal, ''The Stained Glass Quarterly'' (formerly ''Stained Glass, the Bulletin of the Stained Glass Association of America'', ''The Ornamental Glass Bulletin'' and ''The Monthly Visitor'').

'''Symphony No. 2 in A major''', subtitled '''''Im Frühling''''' or '''''In Spring''''', is the second [[symphony]] by American composer [[John Knowles Paine]]. 

==History==

The symphony was composed in 1879 and published in Boston in 1880,&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth C. Roberts and John C. Schmidt. "John Knowles Paine". ''Grove Music'' online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ledbetter&gt;Steven Ledbetter, [http://www.newworldrecords.org/linernotes/80350.pdf  Liner Notes] to New World Records CD 80350 "John Knowles Paine, Symphony Nº. 2 in A-Major Im Frühling&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when few American composers were able to find publishers for symphonic works. It was also premiered in Boston in 1880, and was extremely well received, prompting [[handkerchief]]-waving and shouting at the first performance.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;Chase, Gilbert. ''America's Music''. 3rd rev. edn., 1992, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Louis Elson compared its final movement to [[Robert Schumann]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|Symphony in B flat]], which is also subtitled "Spring".&lt;ref name=chase/&gt;

==Structure==

The symphony is in four movements:

# [[Adagio sostenuto]] - "Departure of Winter" [[Allegro (music)|Allegro ma non troppo]] "Awakening of Nature"

'''''The Death of Klinghoffer''''' is an American [[opera]], with music by [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] to an English-language [[libretto]] by [[Alice Goodman]]. First produced in Brussels and New York in 1991, the opera is based on the [[Achille Lauro hijacking|hijacking of the passenger liner ''Achille Lauro'']] by the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] in 1985, and the hijackers' murder of 69-year-old [[Jewish-American]] passenger [[Leon Klinghoffer]], who was wheelchair bound.

The concept of the opera originated with theatre director [[Peter Sellars]],&lt;ref name="Christiansen 2003"&gt;[[Rupert Christiansen|Christiansen, Rupert]], "Breaking Taboos". ''Opera'', '''54(5)''', 543–548 (May 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; who was a major collaborator, as was choreographer [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]]. It was commissioned by five American and European opera companies, and the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].

The opera has generated controversy, including allegations by Klinghoffer's two daughters and others that the opera is [[antisemitic]] and glorifies terrorism. The work's creators and others have disputed these criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Michael|title=''Klinghoffer'' Protesters Flock to Met Opera House|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-forges-ahead-on-klinghoffer-in-spite-of-protests.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;version=LargeMediaHeadlineSum&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==
[[File:PeterSellarsOjai.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Sellars]], who originated the concept of the opera and directed its first performance]]
Theatre director [[Peter Sellars]] developed the concept of this opera&lt;ref name="Christiansen 2003"/&gt; and was a major collaborator, as was choreographer [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]]. The opera was originally commissioned through a consortium of six entities: the Brussels opera company [[La Monnaie]], the [[San Francisco Opera]], the [[Opéra de Lyon]] in France, the Los Angeles Festival (separate from that city's opera company), the [[Glyndebourne Festival]] in England, and the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The first performance took place at the Théatre Royal de la Monnaie, Brussels, Belgium, on March 19, 1991, directed by Sellars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Rockwell|title=From an Episode of Terrorism, Adams's ''Death of Klinghoffer''|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE113CF932A15750C0A967958260|work=The New York Times| date=March 21, 1991|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month, the [[Lyon]] premiere took place.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} This was followed by a [[Nonesuch Records|Nonesuch]] studio recording in that French city with the same cast.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The first US performance was at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] on September 5, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Edward Rothstein|title=Seeking Symmetry Between Palestinians and Jews|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEED9103EF934A3575AC0A967958260|work=The New York Times|date=September 7, 1991|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy ensued. An opening scene depicting a suburban family, the Rumors, was permanently cut from the score on grounds that it caused offense. The Nonesuch recording, released in 1992, does not include this music. Because of the reaction to the subject matter and philosophy of the opera, planned stagings at [[Glyndebourne]] and in [[Los Angeles]] were cancelled.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

When the original production was staged by [[San Francisco Opera]] in November 1992, the Jewish Information League mounted protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/node/151815 "Art Attack: John Adams, composer"], ''[[New Statesman]]'' (London), October 17, 2005: the anonymous contributor describes the opposition as "Jewish Information League", although there is no source for a group of that name. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007075512/http://www.newstatesman.com/node/151815 |date=October 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first staging in Germany took place in 1997 in [[Nürnberg]], followed by a second German production at the [[Opernhaus Wuppertal]] in 2005.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Synopsis==

===Prologue===
The [[prologue]] consists of two choruses, the "Chorus of Exiled Palestinians" and the "Chorus of Exiled Jews", each of which is a general reflection about the respective peoples and their history.

===Act 1===
''Scene 1''

The unnamed captain of the ''[[MS Achille Lauro]]'' recalls the events of the hijacking. Prior to that, most of the passengers had disembarked in Egypt for a tour of the Pyramids, and the ship set out to sea to return later for the touring passengers. The hijackers had boarded during the disembarkation. When the hijackers commandeer the ship, the passengers still on board are collected in the ship's restaurant. The narrative shifts to a Swiss grandmother, traveling with her grandson while the boy's parents are touring the pyramids. The ship's first officer, given the fictitious name of [[Giordano Bruno]], informs the Captain that [[terrorists]] are on the ship and one waiter has been wounded. The Captain and First Officer try to keep the passengers calm. Molqi, one of the hijackers, explains the situation to the passengers at gunpoint. The Captain and Molqi have an encounter, where the Captain orders food and drink to be brought, and offers to let Molqi choose the food for the Captain to eat.

''Scene 2''

Following the "Ocean Chorus", another hijacker, Mamoud, keeps guard over the Captain. Mamoud recalls his youth and songs he listened to on the radio. The Captain and Mamoud have a dialogue, in which the Captain pleads that individuals on the two sides of the Palestinian–Israeli conflict could meet and try to understand each other. Mamoud dismisses this idea. During this scene is a passenger narrative by the Austrian Woman, who locked herself in her cabin and remained hidden throughout the hijacking. Act 1 ends with the "Night Chorus."

===Act 2===
The "Hagar Chorus", relating to [[Hagar in Islam#Hagar in the desert|the Islamic story of Hagar and the Angel]] and [[Hagar#Hagar and Abram|the Biblical story of Hagar and Ishmael]] is sung. It represents the beginnings of Arab–Israeli tension, of which the hijacking is one historical result.

''Scene 1''

Molqi is frustrated that he has received no reply to his demands. Mamoud threatens all of the passengers with death. Leon Klinghoffer sings, saying that he normally likes to avoid trouble and live simply and decently, but going on to denounce the hijackers. Another hijacker, called "[[John Rambo|Rambo]]", responds in harsh terms about Jews and Americans. The passenger, the British Dancing Girl, recalls how well the fourth hijacker, Omar, treated her and the other passengers, for example, letting them have cigarettes. Omar sings of his desire for martyrdom for his cause. At the end of the scene, Omar and Molqi have a dispute, and Molqui takes Klinghoffer away. The "Desert Chorus" follows.

''Scene 2''

Marilyn Klinghoffer talks about disability, illness, and death. She thinks that her husband Leon was taken to the ship's hospital, but he was shot, off-stage. The hijackers have ordered the Captain to say they will kill another passenger every fifteen minutes. Instead, the Captain offers himself as the sole next person to be killed. Molqi appears and says that Leon Klinghoffer is dead. The "Aria of the Falling Body (Gymnopédie)", sung by Klinghoffer, follows.

The "Day Chorus" links scene 2 to scene 3.

''Scene 3''

After the hijackers have surrendered and the surviving passengers have disembarked safely in port, the Captain remains to tell Marilyn Klinghoffer about her husband's death. She reacts with sorrow and rage toward the Captain, for what she sees as his accommodation of the hijackers. Her final sentiment is that she wished that she could have died in her husband's place.

==Dramaturgy==
The general style of the opera's music resembles that of Adams' [[minimalist music]] period, in the vein also of music by [[Philip Glass]] and [[Steve Reich]]. Intervallic relationships such as ''[[affekt]]'' are used to evoke certain emotions. The drama is portrayed primarily in long monologues by individual characters, with commentary by the [[choir|chorus]], which does not take part in the action.

Both Adams and Sellars have acknowledged the affinity of the opera's dramatic structure to the sacred [[oratorio]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], in particular his ''[[Passions (Bach)|Passions]]''. The plot of the opera does not contain a detailed re-enactment of the events of the hijacking and the murder of Klinghoffer; the major events are not directly portrayed on stage and occur between the opera's staged scenes. The artists originally considered the opera as more of a "dramatic meditation" or "reflection", in the manner of an oratorio, rather than a conventional narrative opera driven by plot.

Based on this aspect, the opera has been criticized as undramatic and static, particularly in act 1, whereas act 2 is more "conventional" in terms of operatic narrative.&lt;ref name="Clements1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Clements|title=''The Death of Klinghoffer'' (Barbican, London)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/jan/21/artsfeatures.classicalmusicandopera|work=The Guardian|date=January 21, 2002|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defence of this unconventional structure, John Ginman has analysed the particular dramaturgy and structure of the opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a714040512&amp;db=all | last=Ginman | first=John | title=Opera as 'Information': The Dramaturgy of ''The Death of Klinghoffer'' | journal=Contemporary Theatre Review | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=51–59 | date=March 2004 | accessdate=January 23, 2011 | doi=10.1080/1026716032000152217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera's choral passages have been performed and recorded separately as ''Choruses from Klinghoffer''.

==Controversy and allegations of antisemitism==
Controversy surrounded the American premiere and other productions in the years which followed. Some critics and audience members condemned the production as antisemitic and appearing to be sympathetic to the hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Edward Rothstein | title=''Klinghoffer'' Sinks Into Minimal Sea | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/arts/classical-view-klinghoffer-sinks-into-minimal-sea.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | date=September 15, 1991 | accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, Goodman, and Sellars repeatedly claimed that they were trying to give equal voice to both Israelis and Palestinians with respect to the political background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=| title=Opera As A Source Of Healing | url=http://www.newsweek.com/1991/03/31/opera-as-a-source-of-healing.html | work=Newsweek | date=March 31, 1991 | accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Walsh | title=Art And Terror in the Same Boat | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972615,00.html | work=Time | date=April 1, 1991 | accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Klinghoffer and Ilsa Klinghoffer, the daughters of Leon and Marilyn Klinghoffer, anonymously attended the 1991 U.S. premiere of the opera in New York City. Afterward the Klinghoffer family released the following statement about the opera: "We are outraged at the exploitation of our parents and the coldblooded murder of our father as the centerpiece of a production that appears to us to be anti-Semitic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Allan Kozinn | title=Klinghoffer Daughters Protest Opera | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DD1E3CF932A2575AC0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | date=September 11, 1991 | accessdate=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dramatic expression of Palestinian historical grievances in a theatrical context generated some criticism of the opera's alleged sympathy with Palestinian terrorism. Others accused the creators of anti-Semitism for their portrayal of fictional Jewish-American neighbours of the Klinghoffers, the Rumors, in a scene in the original version. The couple were characterized in a way many Jews believed to be offensive and inappropriately satirical. ''[[New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Edward Rothstein]] was particularly scathing in describing the scene and its place in the play; he described it as expressing "scorn of American Jews and anybody else without mythic claims on the world's attention" while eliminating altogether the Israeli position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothstein|first1=Edward|date=September 15, 1991|title=Classical View; 'Klinghoffer' Sinks Into Minimal Sea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/15/arts/classical-view-klinghoffer-sinks-into-minimal-sea.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; asking rhetorically "Who could tell from this work just what the Jewish side really is{{snd}}a sort of touristy attachment to an ancient land?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothstein|first1=Edward|date=September 7, 1991|title=Review/Opera; Seeking Symmetry Between Palestinians and Jews|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/07/arts/review-opera-seeking-symmetry-between-palestinians-and-jews.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the American premiere, Adams deleted this scene, while revising his opera for all future productions.&lt;ref name="Fink"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FOPR%2FOPR17_02%2FS0954586705001989a.pdf&amp;code=ff08d1457e33990c799cf8f415584175 | last=Fink | first=Robert | title=''Klinghoffer'' in Brooklyn Heights | journal=Cambridge Opera Journal | volume=17 | issue=2 | pages=173–213 | date=July 2005 | accessdate=January 23, 2011 | doi=10.1017/s0954586705001989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11 attacks]], the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] cancelled a scheduled performance in November 2001 of extracts from the opera. This was partly in deference to a member of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus, who lost a family member on one of the hijacked planes, as well as due to perceptions that the work was overly sympathetic to terrorists. In a widely discussed ''New York Times'' article, [[Richard Taruskin]] defended the orchestra's action. He denounced Adams and the opera for "romanticizing terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Richard Taruskin | title=Music's Dangers And The Case For Control | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E6D8163CF93AA35751C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=4 | work=The New York Times | date=December 9, 2001 | accessdate=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Rockwell]] of ''The New York Times'', in a review of the Penny Woolcock film version, countered that the opera ultimately "shows unequivocally that murder is nothing more than that, vicious and unconscionable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Rockwell|title=Is ''Klinghoffer'' Anti-Semitic?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/04/movies/music-is-klinghoffer-anti-semitic.html|work=The New York Times|date=December 4, 2003|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams responded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anna Picard | title=John Adams: 'It was a rant, a riff and an ugly personal attack' | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/john-adams-it-was-a-rant-a-riff-and-an-ugly-personal-attack-751250.html | work=The Independent | date=January 13, 2002 | accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Taruskin's criticisms on a number of occasions, including this 2004 statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not long ago our attorney general, [[John Ashcroft]], said that anyone who questioned his policies on civil rights after September 11 was aiding terrorists; what Taruskin said was the aesthetic version of that. If there is an aesthetic viewpoint that does not agree with his, it should not be heard. I find that very disturbing indeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Martin Kettle | title=The witch-hunt | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/dec/15/books.guardianreview3 | work=The Guardian | date=December 15, 2001 | accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a more academic analysis, musicologist Robert Fink countered Taruskin's accusations of antisemitism, with particular reference to the deleted scene with the Rumor family. Fink has discussed how the removal of this scene disrupted the original dramaturgical structure of the opera, as the singers of the members of the Rumor family took on symbolically ironic later roles in the opera. Fink further posited that the reaction of American audiences to the portrayal of the Rumor family was partly because it was sociologically accurate. He discussed the scene in the historical context of past depictions in American popular culture of Jewish-American families.&lt;ref name="Fink" /&gt; A separate academic study by Ruth Sara Longobardi discusses the opera with respect to issues about depictions of Palestinians and Jews. She explores how the use of contemporary media in productions, such as the Penny Woolcock film of the opera, affects perception of the two sides of the political conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cambridgefluids.org/action/displayFulltext?type=6&amp;fid=5916288&amp;jid=SAM&amp;volumeId=3&amp;issueId=03&amp;aid=5916284&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1752196309990435 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725130501/http://cambridgefluids.org/action/displayFulltext?type=6&amp;fid=5916288&amp;jid=SAM&amp;volumeId=3&amp;issueId=03&amp;aid=5916284&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S1752196309990435 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=July 25, 2011 | last=Longobardi | first=Ruth Sara | title=Re-producing ''Klinghoffer'': Opera and Arab Identity before and after 9/11 | journal=Journal of the Society for American Music | volume=3 | issue=03 | pages=273–310 | year=2009 | accessdate=January 30, 2011 | doi=10.1017/s1752196309990435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 [[Juilliard Opera Center|Juilliard]] performance generated renewed controversy. A letter to ''The Juilliard Journal'' protested the opera as "a political statement made by the composer to justify an act of terrorism by four Palestinians." The school's president, [[Joseph W. Polisi]], responded with his own letter, stating that he was "a longtime friend of Israel and have visited the country on numerous occasions", as well as a recipient of the King Solomon Award from the [[America-Israel Cultural Foundation]]. He described ''Klinghoffer'' as "a profoundly perceptive and human commentary on a political/religious problem that continues to find no resolution." He added that Juilliard and other institutions "have to be responsible for maintaining an environment in which challenging, as well as comforting, works of art are presented to the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.juilliard.edu/journal/2008-2009/0902/articles/0902_letters.html|last=Polisi|first=Joseph W.|title=Letters to the Editor: On ''The Death of Klinghoffer''|journal=Juilliard Journal|volume=XXIV|issue=5|pages= |date=February 2009|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York cancelled an international simulcast and radio broadcast of this opera due to "an outpouring of concern" locally that it "might be used to fan global anti-semitism."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Rose, [https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2014/10/17/356889957/twenty-years-later-klinghoffer-still-draws-protests "Twenty Years Later, ''Klinghoffer'' Still Draws Protests"], on www.npr.org, October 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to cancelling both broadcasts, the company agreed to include a statement from Klinghoffer's daughters in the printed program of the production. [[Peter Gelb]], general manager for the Met, stated:
:"I'm convinced that the opera is not anti-Semitic, but I've also become convinced that there is genuine concern in the international Jewish community that the live transmission of ''The Death of Klinghoffer'' would be inappropriate at this time of rising anti-Semitism, particularly in Europe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Michaels |first1=Sean |last2=Tilden |first2=Imogen | title=New York's Met cancel The Death of Klinghoffer simulcast | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/18/new-york-metropolitan-opera-cancel-death-of-klinghoffer-simulcast | work=The Guardian | date=June 18, 2014 | accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an official statement, Adams said: "The cancellation of the international telecast is a deeply regrettable decision and goes far beyond issues of 'artistic freedom,' and ends in promoting the same kind of intolerance that the opera's detractors claim to be preventing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ng |first=David | title=John Adams decries cancellation of 'Klinghoffer' cinema broadcast | url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-80539900/ | work=Los Angeles Times | date=June 17, 2014 | accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2014 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine piece, critic [[Justin Davidson]] denied that ''The Death of Klinghoffer'' was anti-Semitic or glorified terrorism, stating that the title character is "the opera's moral core, the one fully functioning human being." He described the opera as "imperfect" and "politically troubling", writing that its attempt to show the historical justifications for both sides is both needlessly provocative and hampers the drama: "Explaining historical events is not an opera's job, and never has been. [...] What matters is how vast events frame a human drama, translated into musical form." He also said that the decision to model the opera on the Bach ''Passions'' "might actually be the most offensive thing about the opera, since a Jewish murder victim is conscripted to serve as a Christian symbol of redemption."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Trouble With Klinghoffer Isn't Quite What You Think |url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/09/trouble-with-klinghoffer.html |work=New York |first=Justin |last=Davidson |date=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[First Amendment]] expert [[Floyd Abrams]] wrote in October 2014 that, though there were no First Amendment issues: "the killers ... chose to commit their crime. So did [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], [[James Earl Ray]] and [[Osama bin Laden]]. We can expect no arias to be sung in their defense at the Metropolitan Opera, and there is no justification for any to be sung for the Klinghoffer killers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/floyd-abrams-klinghoffer-and-the-two-sides-of-terrorism-1413414330|title=Floyd Abrams: Klinghoffer and the 'Two Sides' of Terrorism|author=Floyd Abrams|date=October 15, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former New York City mayor and opera fan [[Rudy Giuliani]] wrote that while the Met had a First Amendment right to present the opera, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Equally, all of us have as strong a First Amendment right to ... warn people that this work is both a distortion of history and helped, in some ways, to foster a three decade long feckless policy of creating a moral equivalency between the Palestinian Authority, a corrupt terrorist organization, and the state of Israel, a democracy ruled by law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/20/rudy-giuliani-why-i-protested-the-death-of-klinghoffer.html|title=Rudy Giuliani: Why I Protested ''The Death of Klinghoffer''|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;American writer and feminist [[Phyllis Chesler]], an opera aficionado, conceded the legal and artistic right to perform the opera, but claimed that it "beatifies terrorism, both musically and in the libretto."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newenglishreview.org/blog_direct_link.cfm/blog_id/56957|title=Betrayal in the Metropolitan Opera Production of the Death of Klinghoffer|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In support of the production, [[Oskar Eustis]], the artistic director of the ''[[The Public Theater|Public Theater]]'' said: "It is not only permissible for the Met to do this piece – it's required for the Met to do the piece. It is a powerful and important opera."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/21/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-forges-ahead-on-klinghoffer-in-spite-of-protests.html?_r=0|title=Protests Greet Metropolitan Opera's Premiere of ''Klinghoffer''|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Fountain of Life''''' or '''''The Fountain of Grace and the Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue''''' are names given to an oil on [[panel painting]] completed c 1432. For most of its history the painting has been in Spain, where it is currently features in a special exhibition in the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.&lt;ref name="Eldiario"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.eldiario.es/cultura/fuente-Van-Eyck-recupera-Prado_0_827667671.html |title='La fuente de gracia' de Van Eyck recupera la gloria |date=2018 |access-date=11 November 2018 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically and thematically, the painting is related to the work of [[Jan van Eyck]], but it is unsigned and there have been competing theories as to whether it is by van Eyck himself.

The subject matter of the painting would have been of particular interest in 15th century Spain which had the world´s largest [[History of the Jews in Spain|Jewish community]].
There has been recent speculation that it was painted by van Eyck himself, possibly while he was on a diplomatic mission to the Iberian peninsula. However, technical analysis suggests that it was painted in the Netherlands, albeit possibly in response to a commission from Spain, in van Eyck's workshop.&lt;ref name="Eldiario" /&gt; 

''The Fountain of Life'' closely resembles passages in the 1432 ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' by Jan and his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is consensus among specialists that it is the product of a workshop, some attribute ''The Fountain of Life'' to a youthful Jan, his brother Hubert,&lt;ref&gt;Borchert, 71&lt;/ref&gt; or much later, and less likely, [[Petrus Christus]].&lt;ref name="F132"&gt;Ferrari, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is structured into three levels. The top terrace shows a [[Deesis|Deësis]] of [[God the Son]], the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and St. [[John the Evangelist]]. The middle section shows four groups of angels, while the lower level has two groups of holy men; with Christians led by a Pope and princes to the right, and Jews led by blindfolded high priests to the left. These two groups represent true believers and non true believers in Christ as the messiah respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Devonshire Jones et al, 213&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Fountain of Life]] is a symbol referring to baptism and or eucharist. The water that flows from the top to the lower terrace, is intended as a symbol of "the Grace that illuminates the Triumphant Church and blinds the Synagogue".&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;''[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/the-fountain-of-grace-and-the-triumph-of-the-church-over-the-synagogue/ The Fountain of Grace and the Triumph of the Church over the Synagogue]''. [[Museo del Prado]]. Retrieved 22 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting is organised into three horizontal levels or planes, each showing a terrace on which the figures are positioned.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt;

===Upper terrace===

}}
The top level shows a Deësis scene, with [[God the Father]] in the center, flanked by the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and St. [[John the Evangelist]]. This passage closely resembles a similar scene in the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]''.&lt;ref name="F132" /&gt; All three figures are seated in front of hanging [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|oriental style carpets]].

[[File:The Fountain of Life after van Eyck Detail3.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Detail showing the Virgin Mary]]
God holds a staff in his right hand, and holds up his left up in the act of blessing. He is enthroned within a tall, elaborate Gothic architectural setting. His throne contains symbols of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelists]], while the [[baldachin]] around and above him is decorated with illusionistic painted [[relief]]s of [[Old Testament]] prophets intended to look like sculptures. The lamb sits on a pedestal before God, on a structure through which the water of grace,&lt;ref name="c61"&gt;Colas, 61&lt;/ref&gt; symbolising the rite of baptism, flows before reaching the [[fountain of life]] in the lowest terrace.&lt;ref name="r56"&gt;Roth, 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary is seated and reading a red book, probably a [[book of hours]]. She wears a blue gown, the folds and cloth of which are closely detailed. She has blond hair which is unbranded and falls over her shoulders. In contrast to her depiction in the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', here her dress is plain, lacks any embroidery or gilded lining, while her book is not [[Girdle book|girdled]]. John is dressed in a green robe, also has blond hair and sits writing in a holy book.

===Middle terrace===
[[File:The Fountain of Life after van Eyck 9.jpg|thumb|260px|Detail showing musical angels]]
[[File:Jan van Eyck - The Ghent Altarpiece - Singing Angels (detail) - WGA07642.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail from the "Musical Angels" panel of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', before 1432]]
The middle level shows two groups of musical angels dressed in white robes and sitting on grass. Choirs of singing angels are positioned in towers on either side of them. This section is again similar to a panel in the ''Ghent Altarpiece''. The instruments include a [[harp]], a type of [[viol]] and a [[lute]].

===Lower terrace===
The lower section represents the triumph of the Church over the Jewish Synagogue, through the depiction of the Christians as collect as almost serene, and the Jews as chaotic, blinded and resistant. The fountain of life is positioned in the center, with a group of Christians to its left, including a Pope (possibly [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]]), members of his [[retinue|service]],&lt;ref name="r56" /&gt; an emperor and various princes.&lt;ref name="c61" /&gt;

[[File:The Fountain of Life after van Eyck 8.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Detail showing the blinded High Priest in the lower terrace]]
To the right is a grouping of "despairing Jews" who seem to be fleeing from the scene.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; The figure on the far left of this group is a high priest who has been blindfolded,&lt;ref name="F132" /&gt; symbolising his blinding to the true significance of Jesus.&lt;ref name="b163"&gt;Benjamin, 163&lt;/ref&gt; A rabbi in the immediate foreground holds a [[Torah]] scroll with, according to historian Norman Roth, "gibberish Hebrew writing", while another "Jew shows a scroll to a figure, apparently Christian, who tears his clothing at the sight". In contrast to the Christians, the Jews do not wear grand, ceremonious hats or badges.&lt;ref name="r56" /&gt;

They carry a variety of [[banner]]s, [[scroll]]s and [[parchment]]s, which contains texts that while illegible, can be recognised as mostly written in Hebrew, with some lettering that is almost nonsensical. The texts are arranged across the passage in a haphazard way, reflecting the disorder of the figures, and more generally within the Synagogue.&lt;ref name="b162"&gt;Benjamin, 162&lt;/ref&gt; This placement must be contrasted with those on the two level, where the books held by Mary and John rest stably on their laps.&lt;ref name="b163" /&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting's first documentary record is in the ''Libro becerro'' (vellum acquisitions register) of the [[Monastery of Santa María del Parral|Monastery of the Parral]] outside Segovia, which recorded it as the gift of King [[Henry IV of Castile]] in 1454. That year marked the beginning of Henry's reign, as well as a building programme at the monastery. He may have inherited the painting from his father [[John II of Castile|John II]].

It was secured to the wall of the [[Sacristy|vestry]], being gradually painted into the wall as the vestry was redecorated down the centuries, until it was removed in 1838 as part of the [[Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal|secularisation of the monasteries]]: parts of the border were lost in the removal but the painting is generally in good condition. The painting was moved to the Trinidade monastery opposite the Atocha station in Madrid, used as a general store for the religious wealth collected.

The painting was photographed in 1859 by [[Jean Laurent (photographer)|Jean Laurent]].&lt;ref name="Eldiario" /&gt; Its first formal attribution was in 1870 when it was transferred to the Prado, dating it as 1454 on the strength of the entry: however, it was stylistically anachronistic, an accurate dating should have read "before 1454", a mistake which has caused no end of confusion in the 130 years following as scholars attempted to identify a non-existent atelier or pupil/follower of van Eyck's. Following a dendrochronological study undertaken by the Prado in the late 1990s, which dated the felling of the wood to 1418, it was dated to "after 1428" after allowing a standard ten years for seasoning: the Prado currently attributes it to c1432. During the time in the Parral, it became highly influential and was widely copied, one copy was later housed in [[Palencia Cathedral]]. Today it is in the collection of the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; The Prado version was the star of an exhibition of its reassessments in 2003, and it was previously the subject of the 1957 Utrecht doctoral thesis of Josua Bruyn, who went on to become Professor of the History of Art at Amsterdam and establish the Rembrandt Foundation.

'''''The Introduction of the Cult of Cybele at Rome''''' is a glue-[[tempera]] on canvas painting measuring 73.5 cm by 268 cm. It was produced in 1505–1506 by [[Andrea Mantegna]] and is now in the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/andrea-mantegna-the-introduction-of-the-cult-of-cybele-at-rome|title=Catalogue page|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like much of Mantegna's output after 1495 it is in [[monochrome]], linked to contemporary sculpture and also part of the trend for illusion and [[trompe l'oeil]] favoured by the Mantuan court and especially by [[Isabella d'Este]].

==History==
It was commissioned in 1505 by cardinal [[Marco Cornaro (cardinal)|Marco Cornaro]] for the study of his brother [[Francesco Cornaro (cardinal)|Francesco]], a patrician of [[Venice]]. The Cornaro family was said to be descended from the [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelia]] [[gens]] of ancient Rome - the same cardinal signed himself "Marcus Cardinalis Cornelius" in a letter asking [[Francesco II Gonzaga]] for a work from Mantegna, who was the latter's court painter at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Alberta De Nicolò Salmazo, ''Mantegna'', Electa, Milano 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The chosen subject was from the history of the Cornelii, specifically the arrival of [[Cybele]]'s image in Rome during the [[Second Punic War]], as told in [[Ovid]], [[Appian]] and [[Livy]]. [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] had consulted the [[Sibylline Books]] and ordered the image brought from [[Mount Ida]]. The [[Delphic Oracle]] requested that the most worthy Roman be sent to collect it and so the senate had chosen Africanus' cousin [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica|Scipio Nasica]] for the role. The ship carrying the image back got stuck in the shallows of the [[River Tiber]], but the [[Vestal Virgin]] [[Claudia Quinta]] proved her virginity by helping to free it.&lt;ref&gt;Tatjana Pauli, ''Mantegna'', serie ''Art Book'', Leonardo Arte, Milano 2001. {{ISBN|9788883101878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andrea Mantegna 113.jpg|thumb|left|Detail]]
[[File:Andrea_Mantegna_112.jpg|thumb|right|The shepherd]]
Mantegna showed a scene after the image had been brought ashore, just as it arrives at the temple built in Rome for it. He based it on ancient Roman sarcophagi, then starting to be rediscovered and entering collections such as the [[Gonzaga collection]] in Mantua. He painted the scene as if it was carved into a piece of marble with two differently mottled layers, one forming the scene and the other the background. Two pyramid tombs to the left bear the names of Nasica's father [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus]] and Africanus' father [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] - Gnaeus and Publius were brothers. 

The two bearers in front of the image are turbaned like [[Moors]], and the bearded pair at the back wear [[papal tiara|tiara]]-like hats. One of the two rear bearers also holds a laurel branch, as used in a [[Roman triumph]], as does a young slave crouching in front of the bust. The bust wears a [[corona turrita]] and stands on a sphere on a precious carpet, with the sphere representing universality. Behind it is a ritual torch, whilst Nasica is shown as a young man kneeling before the bust - his words welcoming it are shown on the lower border. Behind him is another senator, probably Africanus, who is speaking to another man, possibly his fellow-consul [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius Crassus Dives]]. The furthest right figure is a shepherd, wearing a [[Phrygian cap]], playing a flute and drum and standing on the steps of the temple to which the image is being brought - a trumpet protrudes from the temple doors.

[[Giovanni Bellini]]'s ''[[Continence of Scipio (Bellini)|Continence of Scipio]]'' ([[National Gallery of Art, Washington]]) was painted as a pendant for it, but two other intended paintings were never produced. Garavaglia cites a spoken assertion by [[Roberto Longhi]] that the painting could have been accompanied by the two smaller monochrome works ''[[Sofonisba (Mantegna)|Sofonisba]]'' and ''[[Tuccia (Mantegna)|Tuccia]]'' – they are certainly the same height as ''The Introduction'', but they are on panel not canvas and no documents support the theory.

[[Pietro Bembo]] wrote a letter to [[Isabella Gonzaga]] in 1505, referring to arguments about payment between the commissioner and the painter, which meant it was still mentioned in the inventory of Mantegna's studio contents after his death in 1506, which refers to it as "principiata" (ie begun but incomplete). It was completed by Mantegna's son Francesco, by Bellini or another painter. Like other works in Mantegna's studio upon his death, it was acquired by cardinal [[Sigismondo Gonzaga]], who in 1507 finally delivered it to Francesco Cornaro.&lt;ref&gt;Ettore Camesasca, ''Mantegna'', in AA.VV., ''Pittori del Rinascimento'', Scala, Firenze 2007. {{ISBN|888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Three Stories''''' ({{lang-ru|Три истории|Tri istorii}}) is a 1997 Russian-Ukrainian [[comedy film]] directed by [[Kira Muratova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vokrug.tv/product/show/tri_istorii/|publisher=VokrugTV|title=Три истории}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seance.ru/n/15/rezhisser-film-kritik-3/tri-istorii/|publisher=[[Seance]]|title=Сеансу отвечают: Три истории}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was entered into the [[47th Berlin International Film Festival]]. The picture won the Special Jury Prize at [[Kinotavr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinotavr.ru/ru/history/winners/|publisher=[[Kinotavr]]|title=Призеры 1991-2005 гг.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film consists of three novellas the plot of which is based on criminal stories that do not have usual logical motives. The people who become killers in all these episodes are the ones who at first glance seem to be completely incapable of murder.

===The First Story "Boiler Room No. 6"===

A modest employee brings a cupboard to the [[Heat-only boiler station|boiler room]] for his friend, Tikhomirov. He works as a [[Fireman (steam engine)|stoker]], writes poetry in his spare time and rents out a place for intimate pleasure to local homosexuals.

During a normal conversation between old acquaintances, Tikhomirov time after time returns to the story of his unbearable neighbor who does not let him live in peace and even comes to his workplace in order to compromise him ... Tikhomirov gets interrupted and is not able to get to the point of his request by frequenters of the depraved corner, who by the way also see him as an object for pleasure and even offer money to him...

In the closet lies the naked corpse of Tikhomirov's neighbor (she walked around the house like this), which he intends to burn in the boiler room.

===The Second Story "Ophelia"===

Ofa works in a hospital archive. She does not like men, women, or children: "I would rate this planet as zero." Her attention is especially directed towards those mothers who abandon their children in a [[maternity hospital]].

A [[Gynaecology|gynecologist]] makes advances towards Ofa whom she uses for an alibi at the moment she commits the murder of a disowning mother.

Her literary ideal is Shakespeare's [[Ophelia]], whose fate Ofa arranges for a single woman – her own mother, Alexander Ivanovna Ivanova, who many years ago gave her up.

===The Third Story "Girl and Death"===

An elderly man in a wheelchair operates a coffee grinder. A little girl who lives nearby plays with him, irritating and annoying the old man from time to time. From the mouth of the baby resonates the neighbor's expectation, that after his death she together with her mother will get his room.

The old man teaches the girl how to play [[chess]], reads a book to her, and she in turn brings a glass of water containing [[Rodenticide|rat poison]]. After drinking a cup of water, the old man dies.

==Cast==
* [[Sergey Makovetskiy]] as Tikhomirov
* [[Leonid Kushnir]] as Gena
* [[Jean-Daniel]] as Venia
* [[Renata Litvinova]] as Ofa; Ofelia
* [[Ivan Okhlobystin]] as Doctor
