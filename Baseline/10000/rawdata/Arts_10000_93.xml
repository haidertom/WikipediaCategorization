'''''A Flag is Born''''' is a 1946 play that advocated the creation of a [[homeland for the Jewish people]] in the ancient [[Land of Israel]]—at the time of the play's release [[Mandatory Palestine]], under British administration. With a cast including [[Paul Muni]], [[Celia Adler]] and [[Marlon Brando]], it opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on September 4, 1946.  It was written by [[Ben Hecht]] and directed by [[Luther Adler]], with music by [[Kurt Weill]].  ''A Flag is Born'' was produced by the American League for a Free Palestine, an organization headed by [[Hillel Kook]] (known in America by the anglicized name Peter Bergson), to raise money for Zionist causes.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"&gt;{{cite web

==Synopsis==
''A Flag is Born'' has three principal characters, with other actors playing bit roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=A Flag is Born
|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=1452
|work=[[Internet Broadway Database]]
|location=New York
|publisher=[[The Broadway League]]
|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tevye and Zelda (played on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] by [[Paul Muni]] and [[Celia Adler]], major stars at the time) are survivors of the [[Treblinka]] death camp who are attempting to travel to British-administered [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], the ancient [[Land of Israel]]. David ([[Marlon Brando]]) is an angry young [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor.

The play opens with Tevye and Zelda ushering in the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]] on a Friday night somewhere on their journey. Zelda lights [[Shabbat candles|candles]] on a broken tombstone. After reciting the Sabbath prayers, Tevye dreams of the town where he was born, as it was before the Nazis destroyed it.  A dream sequence follows in which Tevye has visions of the biblical kings [[Saul]] and [[David]], then imagines himself standing before the [[United Nations Security Council]] pleading for the formation of a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish homeland]] in Palestine; he is ignored.

Tevye awakens to find that Zelda has died in the night. He recites ''[[kaddish]]'', a Jewish memorial prayer, then welcomes the [[Destroying angel (Bible)|Angel of Death]], who has come for him too. He bids David farewell. As David considers committing suicide, three Jewish soldiers (representing the [[Haganah]], [[Irgun]], and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]) suddenly appear and implore him to join them: "Don't you hear our guns David? We battle the English, the sly and powerful English. We speak to them in a new Jewish language, the language of guns. We fling no more prayers or tears at the world. We fling bullets. We fling barrages&amp;nbsp;... We promise to wrest our homeland out of the British claws."&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Kai: ''Divided City: Coming of Age Between the Arabs and Israelis''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wertheim&gt;Wertheim, Albert: ''Staging the War: American Drama and World War II'', p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

In the play's finale, David delivers a fiery pro-Zionist speech, moves across a bridge into Palestine, and with the mixed sounds of "[[Hatikvah]]" and gunfire in the background, raises Tevye's [[Tallit|prayer shawl]] as a makeshift flag and marches off to war.&lt;ref name=Wertheim/&gt;

==Zionist causes==
[[File:ExodusSh2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jews, largely [[Holocaust survivors]], sailing for [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] aboard the [[SS Exodus|SS ''Exodus'']] in 1947. ''A Flag is Born'' was produced to support such migrants.]]
''A Flag is Born'' was produced by the pro-Zionist American League for a Free Palestine (ALFP) to raise financial and political support for Zionist causes, including the transport of Jews from Europe. The AFLP was entirely open about its political motivations—publicity materials read: "'A Flag is Born' is not ordinary theatre. It was not written to amuse or beguile. 'A Flag is Born' was written to make money—to make money to provide ships to get Hebrews to Palestine&amp;nbsp;... and [to] arouse American public opinion to support the fight for freedom and independence now being waged by the resistance in Palestine."&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;

In promoting the play, the [[Bergson Group]] attempted to equate the Zionist organizations in Palestine with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] of the [[American Revolution]].  The cover of the program showed three Zionists—one with a rifle, one with a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]], and one with a Zionist flag—superimposed over three American Revolutionary figures.  Advertisements used the slogan "It's 1776 in Palestine!", portrayed members of the Irgun as "modern-day [[Nathan Hale]]s," alluded to "taxation without representation" in Palestine, and quoted [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s phrase, "Resistance to tyranny is obedience to God."  When Tevye dreams about addressing the United Nations, he compares Palestine in the 1940s with the American colonies in the 1770s.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt; ''A Flag is Born'' played in six North American cities and raised more than $400,000 for the ALFP, the largest block of funds it ever attained.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;

Brando had already been voted "Broadway's Most Promising Actor" for his role as an anguished veteran in ''[[Truckline Café]]'', but that play was not a commercial success and Brando was still young, relatively unknown and impecunious.  Brando contended that the survivors of the Holocaust deserved to have their own land where they could live freely; he accepted only the [[Actor's Equity]] minimum payment so more of the proceeds from ''A Flag is Born'' could go towards Zionist causes.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Reception and impact==

After the play proved extremely popular,{{fact|date=May 2015}}{{weasel-inline|date=May 2015}} the Broadway run was extended and a tour was arranged.{{fact|date=May 2015}}  The sponsoring committee included many prominent people, including composer [[Leonard Bernstein]], novelist [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], New York City Mayor [[William O'Dwyer]], and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].{{fact|date=May 2015}}

Following the Broadway run, ''A Flag is Born'' traveled to Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Boston. It was also scheduled to play at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theater]] in Washington, D.C.  However, in an early action of the [[civil rights movement]], Americans who opposed racial discrimination began a boycott to oppose the practice of barring blacks from attending Washington theaters, and the committee moved the play to the [[Maryland Theater (Baltimore)|Maryland Theater]] in [[Baltimore]].  A special train brought members of Congress to the performance.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;  The American League for a Free Palestine and the [[NAACP]] cooperated to use the occasion to force the management of the Maryland Theater to abrogate its segregation policy (blacks restricted to the balcony) for the duration of the play's run which, in the context of the times, was considered a victory for civil rights.&lt;ref name="wymaninstitute.org"/&gt;

The '''Academy of San Carlos''' ({{lang-es|Academia de San Carlos}}) is located at 22 Academia Street in just northeast of the [[Zocalo|main plaza]] of [[Mexico City]]. It was the first major [[art school|art academy]] and the first [[art museum]] in the [[Americas]]. It was founded in 1781 as the School of Engraving and moved to the Academia Street location about 10 years later. It emphasized classical European training until the early 20th century, when it shifted to a more modern perspective. At this time, it also integrated with the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], eventually becoming the [[Faculty of Arts and Design]], which is based in [[Xochimilco]]. Currently, only graduate courses of the modern school are given in the original academy building.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/| title= Academia de San Carlos| language= Spanish| accessdate= 2009-03-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409140215/http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/| archivedate= 2009-04-09| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=70–72 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Gerónimo Antonio Gil - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]], portrait of Jerónimo Antonio Gil, director of the academy]]
The Academy of San Carlos was founded in 1781 under the name of the School of Engraving.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; From that time to the present, it has been renamed many times to The Royal Academy of the Three Noble Arts of San Carlos (Real Academia de la Tres Nobles Artes de San Carlos) (1783),&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; Academia Nacional de San Carlos de México (1821); Academia Imperial de San Carlos de México (1863); Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (1867) and Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (1929).&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;  

Mexican painter [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] iterated the need for an art academy as early as 1753 but attempts by him and other prominent Mexican artists of the time to gain royal permission for such was never obtained.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt; The School of Engraving was begun later in the building that used to be the [[mint (coin)|mint]], and would later become the modern-day [[National Museum of Cultures]]. Ten years later, it moved to the former Amor de Dios Hospital, where it remains to this day.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The street it is located on was renamed from Amor de Dios Street to Academia Street in its honor.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;

The Academy was originally sponsored by the [[Spanish Crown]] and a number of private patrons.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The academy was inaugurated on 4 November 1781 on the saint's day of [[King Carlos III]],&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; operating for its first ten years in the old mint building (now the [[National Museum of Cultures]]).&lt;ref name="GTM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Turistica de Mexico – Distrito Federal Centro 3 |last= Bueno de Ariztegui (ed) |first=Patricia |year=1984 |publisher=Promexa |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-34-0319-0 |pages=94–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not obtain its royal seal until 1783 and was not fully functional until 1785.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The school moved into the old "Hospital del Amor de Dios" building in 1791, where it has remained ever since.&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt; The academy was the first major art institution in the Americas.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;

[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tolsá - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Manuel Tolsá]], by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]]]]
The school's first director, Italian Jeronimo Antonio Gil, was appointed by Carlos III and gathered prominent artists of the day including José de Alcíbar, [[Santiago Sandoval]], Juan Sáenz, [[Manuel Tolsá]] and [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]].  Tolsá and Ximeno would later stay on to become directors of the school.  The new school began to promote [[Neoclassicism]], focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture, advocating European-style training of its artists.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt; To this end, plaster casts of classic Greek and Roman statues were brought to Mexico from Europe for students to study.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;
[[File:UpperfloorSanCarlosDF.JPG|thumb|Upper floor of the building]]
Since its founding, it attracted the country's best artists, and was a force behind the abandonment of the [[Baroque]] style in Mexico, which had already gone out-of-fashion in Europe.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, the academy was closed for a short time due to the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. When it reopened, it was renamed the National Academy of San Carlos and enjoyed the new government's preference for Neoclassicism, as it considered the Baroque reminiscent of colonialism. Despite the school's association with the independent Mexican government, [[Emperor Maximilian I]] (installed in Mexico by the French) protected the school during his reign, although foreign artists were shunned there.  When [[Benito Juárez]] ousted the emperor and regained the presidency of Mexico, he was reluctant to support the school and its European influence, which he considered to be a vestige of colonialism.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

The academy continued to advocate classic, European-style training of its artists until 1913. In that year, a student and teacher strike advocating a more modern approach ousted director [[Antonio Rivas Mercado]]. It was also partially integrated into University of Mexico (now UNAM) at that time, although it initially kept a large degree of autonomy.  In 1929, the architecture program was separated from the rest of the academy,&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt; and in 1953, this department was moved to the newly built [[Ciudad Universitaria|campus of UNAM]] in the south of the city. The remaining programs in painting, sculpture and engraving were renamed National School of Expressive Arts [[National School of Arts (UNAM)|Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas]]. Later, the undergraduate fine arts programs were moved to a facility in [[Xochimilco]], leaving only some graduate programs in the original Academy of San Carlos building.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

==Associated artists==
[[Image:Jose Maria Velasco.jpg|thumb|left|[[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]] ''Self-portrait'' (1894). Velasco dominated 19th c Mexican landscape painting.]]
Some of its most famous first teachers included [[Miguel Constanzó]] in architecture, [[José Joaquín Fabregat]] in metal engraving, Rafael Ximeno y Planes in painting and Manuel Tolsá in sculpture. Another notable teacher here was [[Pelegrí Clavé]], who was noted for his expertise in creating portraits of heroes and biblical figures.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

[[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Antonio Fabres]] was a dominant force at the Academy during early 20th century. He would mentor later Mexican artists such as [[Saturnino Herrán]], [[Roberto Montenegro]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

[[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]] is considered the greatest artist associated with the Academy, famous for his landscapes of the [[Valley of Mexico]] and a mentor of Diego Rivera. Other artists linked to the Academy are [[Manuel Rodríguez Lozano]], [[Alfredo Zalce]], [[Andrés José López]], [[José Chávez Morado]], [[Francisco Moreno Capdevila]], [[Luis Sahagún Cortés]], [[Gabriel Fernández Ledesma]] and [[Jorge Figueroa Acosta]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; [[Matusha Corkidi]] studied at the Academy after emigrating from Egypt.&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G.

==Building==
[[File:AfricanartExpoSanCarlosDF.JPG|thumb|Exhibition of children's art from Africa on 25 May 2009]]
The building originally was as the Amor de Dios Hospital, which had closed by the time the School of Engraving decided to move there from the mint building. Founding director Jeronimo Antonio Gil took charge of the restoration and remodeling work. Artist [[Javier Cavallari]] created the Academy's Neoclassic facade, which is embellished with six medallions. Four of these represent the Academy's founders: Carlos III, [[Carlos IV]], Jeronimo Antonio Gil and [[Fernando José Manguino]], and the other two are of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].  Cavallari also finished the patio, the conference room and the painting and sculpture galleries. The painting gallery contains portraits by [[Ramon Sagredo]] and the sculpture room contains works by [[José Obregón]] and [[Manuel Ocaranza]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

A number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain were brought here for teaching purposes. These casts still exist and can be seen on display in the Academy's central patio. Some of these statues include casts of statues from the [[Medici]] tombs, [[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses by Michelangelo]], The [[Victory of Samothrace]] and [[Venus de Milo]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

==Gallery==
[[File:Antiguadireccionacademiasancarlos.jpg|thumb|Old photo of the dean's office]]
The academy once had a very large collection of art in the Gallery of the San Carlos Academy, considered the first museum of art in the Americas.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mexicocity.ciudadmexico.com.mx/attractions/san_carlos.htm |title=Nacional Museum of San Carlos |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203151944/http://mexicocity.ciudadmexico.com.mx/attractions/san_carlos.htm |archivedate=2008-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its art collection began with plaster casts of original Greek, Roman and European works used as teaching aids. It also gained other European works such as engravings from the 16th to 19th centuries from Spain, France, England, Italy, Germany, and Holland. The school also collected works from students and teachers from its founding to beginning of the 20thcentury. However, the collection outgrew the original academy building as it received donations from private sources and purchases made by the Mexican government after independence. The collection was divided, some going to the [[Museo Universitario de la Academia]], also in the historic center of town, some going to the [[National Museum of San Carlos]], northeast of the historic center and the rest remaining in the original building.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plaster"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plastercastcollection.org/en/database.php?d=lire&amp;id=109 |title= Academia San Carlos, Mexico City |accessdate=2009-03-30 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503210030/http://www.plastercastcollection.org/en/database.php?d=lire&amp;id=109| archivedate= 3 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Altarpiece of the Saints John'''''  is a painting by [[Bernat Martorell]] conserved at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional 

d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The ''Altarpiece of the Saints John'' from [[Vinaixa]] was commissioned in 1432 from the [[Tarragona]] painter [[Ramon de Mur]], but in the end it was painted by Martorell. The MNAC keeps most of the panels from this altarpiece. The main panel is kept at the [[Museu Diocesà de Tarragona]], a side compartment is kept at the [[Musée Rolin]] d'[[Autun]] ([[France]]), and the whereabouts of another compartment is unknown. The two Saints John feature in the scenes in the lateral lanes of the altarpiece and two more on the predella, respectively. The topmost compartment depicts the Calvary. The predella shows signs of old damage, especially scratches, on figures who were considered negative, such as the executioner (who cuts Saint John's head off), Herod and Herodias (crowned, behind the panel) and the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=47ebcd8e6d370c6926ffc938f57f3dd871295ffedac166160908977bcfde952b?inventoryNumber=064045-CJT  The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anjumani-shuara''' (Persian - "Poets council") was a literary council of the 19th century in [[Azerbaijan]].
It was first held by Sheykhali khan Kangarli in 1831 in [[Ordubad]]. From 1870-80 the council was led by Haji agha Fagir Ordubadi. Later this mission was obliged to Mohammad Taghi Sidgi. The council’s activity operated with different intervals and there were lots of well-known writers and poets. After the death of Fagir and shifting of Sidgi in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] the council was weakened and suspended its activities in 1890-1895.&lt;ref&gt;http://azerbaijans.com/content_1787_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book censorship''' is when some authority, government or otherwise, takes measures to prevent access to a book or to part of its contents. It can be enacted at the national or subnational level, and can carry legal penalties. Books may also be [[Challenge (literature)|challenged]] at a local community level, although successful bans do not extend outside that area. Similarly, religions may issue lists of banned books—a historical example being the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''—which do not always carry legal force.

==Background==
"Almost every country places some restrictions on what may be published, although the emphasis and the degree of control differ from country to country and at different periods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/censorship-of-books/1|title=CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS|work=teara.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of reasons for which books may be banned. Materials are often suppressed due to the perceived notion of obscenity. This obscenity can apply to materials that are about sexuality, race, drugs, or social standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/bbooks/about|title=About Banned &amp; Challenged Books|work=ala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship of literature on the charge of obscenity appears to have begun in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="universityofsouthflorida"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0000696290&amp;site=eds-live|title=USF NetID Single-SignOn - University of South Florida|author=University of South Florida|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the middle class, who had evangelical backgrounds, brought about this concern with obscenity.&lt;ref name="universityofsouthflorida"/&gt;

Governments have also sought to ban certain books which they perceive to contain material that could threaten, embarrass, or criticize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/banned-books.html|title=Banned Books Online|work=upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leaders outside the government have banned books, including religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 | title = Index Librorum Prohibitorum
 | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church leaders who prohibit members of their faith from reading the banned books may want to shelter them from perceived obscene, immoral, or profane ideas or situations or from ideas that may challenge the teaching of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=54091811&amp;site=eds-live|title=USF NetID Single-SignOn - University of South Florida|author=University of South Florida|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But even religious materials have been subject to censorship. For example, various [[religious text|scriptures]] have been banned (and sometimes burned at several points in history). The [[Bible]], and other religious scriptures have all been subjected to censorship and have been banned by various governments. Similarly, books based on the scriptures have also been banned, such as [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', which was banned in the [[Russian Empire]] for being [[anti-establishment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sitemaker.umich.edu/globalnonviolence/files/tolstoy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Banning of a book often has the effect of making people [[Streisand effect|seek the book]].&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/20/224427254/could-banning-books-actually-encourage-more-readers|title=Could Banning Books Actually Encourage More Readers?|date=20 September 2013|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of banning the book creates an interest in the book which has the opposite effect of making the work more popular.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

==Book burning==
[[Book burning]] is the practice of destroying, often ceremonially, books or other written material. It is usually carried out in public, and is generally motivated by moral, religious, or political objections to the material, with a desire to censor it.

'''''Brihad-bhagavatamrita''''' is a [[sacred text]] for followers of [[Hindu]] tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]]. Along with ''[[Hari-bhakti-vilasa]]'', it is one of the most important works of [[Vaishnava]] [[theologian]] [[Sanatana Goswami]].  While ''Hari-Bhakti-Vilasa'' sets out guidance for Vaishnava behavior and [[ritual]], ''Brihad-bhagavatamrita'' contains an analysis of the teachings of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]] from an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] perspective. 

Sri Brhad-bhagavatämåta is divided in two cantos: Pürva-khaëòa,
or first, and Uttar-khaëòa, or last. The name of the First Canto is Çré
Bhagavat-kåpä-sära-nirdhäraëa khaëòa – Ascertaining the Essence of the
Mercy of the Supreme Lord. The Second Canto is known as Çré Golokamähätmya-
nirüpaëa khaëòa – Ascertaining the Glories of Çré Goloka.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Śrī Brhat Bhāgavatāmta Second Canto by Sri Srimad Bhakti vedänta Narayana
Gosvämi Mahäräja&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.purebhakti.com/resources/ebooks-a-magazines-mainmenu-63/books-for-e-readers/1428-brhad-bhagavatamrta.html|title=Brhad-bhagavatamrta|website=www.purebhakti.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first part of ''Brihad-bhagavatamrita'' Sanatana Goswami has described a conversation between [[Parikshit]] and his mother, [[Uttarā (Mahabharata)|Uttara]]. It took place after Parikshit heard the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' from [[Śuka]]. Uttara asked her son to explain the essence of ''Bhagavata Purana'', and Parikshit revealed to her the stages of confidential [[Bhakti]]. He told her a story about how [[Narada]] was looking for greatest devotee of [[Krishna]]. The Great [[Rishi]] began his search with devotees of Krishna whose [[Bhakti]] was mixed with [[karma]] and [[jnana]] ([[Brahma]] and [[Shiva]]), then went up to [[Shanta-rasa]]  ([[Prahlada]]), [[Dasya-rasa]] ([[Hanuman]]), [[Sakhya-rasa]] ([[Arjuna]]), and finally came to the greatest devotee of Krishna - [[Uddhava]], who always longed to be in [[Vrindavan]], and showed that the highest level of Bhakti is the love of the [[gopi]]s for Krishna. 

The second part of ''Brihad-bhagavatamrita'' tells us about the glory and bliss of the spiritual abode [[Goloka]], as well as of the process of renunciation of the material world, true knowledge, [[Bhakti Yoga]], love for Krishna and implementation of the higher purpose of life. The second part contains the narrative of a wandering shepherd boy, who received a mantra from a resident of Vrindavan, travelling from one planetary system to another, exploring the different levels of consciousness of living beings. His spiritual odyssey covers [[Vaikuntha]], [[Brahmaloka]], [[Shivaloka]] and the heavenly planets. 

Second Canto contains four chapters:

(1) Vairägya – Renunciation
(2) Jïäna – Knowledge
(3) Bhajana – Devotional Service
(4) Vaikuëöha – The Spiritual World
Each of the two cantos of this scripture is a separate history. Our
worshipful author has not merely written two histories. Rather, for
facilitating the worship of the divine couple, Çré Çré Rädhä-Kåñëa,he has thoroughly analyzed Their Lordships’ fundamental reality and nature.

Çrémad-Bhägavatam is the essence of all scriptures, such as the
Vedas, Vedänta, Puräëas, Itihäsas, and so on. By churning that essence,
this book, aptly named Çré Båhad-bhägavatämåta – the Essential Nectar
of the Bhägavatam – has become manifest. Throughout this book, all
topics regarding devotional service to Bhagavän have been presented.
The original discourse of the book between Çré Jaimini and
Janamejaya is based on a conversation between Çré Parékñit and
Uttarä. After Çré Parékñit had heard Çrémad-Bhägavatam from the lips
of Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé, and before the snake-bird Takñaka arrived,
Parékñit’s mother, Çré Uttarä-devé, said to him, “O my dear son, please
narrate to me, in simple, easy-to-understand language, the essence
of what you have heard from Çré Çukadeva Gosvämé.” Çré Båhadbhägavatämåta
begins with this inquiry.

In the Second Canto, the author examines all the manifestations
and incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, beginning
with Çré Çälagräma Bhagavän and ending with Çré Nandanandana,
the beloved son of Çré Nanda Mahäräja. This volume begins with the
history of Gopa-kumära. Gopa-kumära receives the gopäla-mantra from
his gurudeva. Due to the influence of this gopäla-mantra, it becomes
possible for him to travel to all abodes without restriction. First, he
takes darçana of the manifestations of Bhagavän that appear in this
earthly realm, or Bhü-maëòala, such as Çré Çälagräma Bhagavän; the
Deity manifestation of the Lord who is ensconced in the palace of the
king; and the ancient Deity of Çré Jagannäthadeva.He sequentially
describes their progressively greater glories. Then, by the influence of
the chanting of his mantra, he reaches the planets of Svarga, Mahar,
Janas, Tapas, and Satya, where one by one he has divine vision of
the worshipable manifestations of the Lord who manifest in those
abodes. Thus he also experiences Their transcendental excellences in
succession. Yet Gopa-kumära does not experience complete happiness
in those places.

Thereafter, he takes darçana of the manifestations of Bhagavän
that are present in the eight coverings of the universe and arrives in the abode of liberation. In mukti-loka, the realm of liberation, Gopakumära
sees the manifestation of the brilliance of the Supreme Person,
but still, complete satisfaction eludes him. After this, in accordance
with regulative principles, he performs saìkértana of the holy name,
the most prominent of the nine processes of bhakti. By the potency of
näma-saìkértana, he travels first to Vaikuëöha, then to Ayodhyä, and
then to Dvärakä-puré. However, because in those realms the mood of
aiçvarya, or awe and reverence for the Lord, is prominent, he cannot
freely associate with the worshipful manifestations of the Supreme
Person there.

Finally, Gopa-kumära returns to Våndävana manifest on earth,
where he executes rägänugä bhakti, spontaneous devotional service
that follows the moods of the eternal associates of Vraja. By the potency
of his practice of rägänugä bhakti, he attains Goloka-Våndävana.
There, he obtains his cherished goal – service to Çré Kåñëa, the son of
the king of Vraja.

One should not conclude from this history that there is any
difference in the tattva, or fundamental truth, of the various
manifestations of Bhagavän. All manifestations of the Lord are
complete, from Çré Çälagräma Bhagavän to Çré Nandanandana
(Kåñëa, the darling son of Nanda Mahäräja). From the perspective
of tattva, They are one, yet from the perspective of rasa, or the
sweetness of transcendental relationships, Çré Nandanandana is the
most excellent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''Brihad-bhagavatamrita'' contains descriptions of the various categories of devotees of Krishna: close devotees, and devotees of the closest devotees. [[Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] in his comments to the ''[[Chaitanya-charitamrita]]'' (Adi Lila, 5.203) writes that anyone who wants to learn about the devotees and about devotional service to Krishna should read ''Brihad-bhagavatamrita''.

The awards committee selects awards from each category, while the Best Tall Building Overall is selected from the four regional winners. Initially only the special awards such as The Lynn S. Beedle Lifetime Achievement Award, and Fazlur Khan Lifetime Achievement Medal were given. In 2007 the CTBUH started awarding the skyscraper awards and in 2012 added a new award (Innovation Award). In 2013 a new 10 Year Award was added. In 2014 the Urban Habitat and Performance awards were issued for the first time.

==Awards Criteria==

The CTBUH uses the following award criteria for skyscrapers.&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*The project must be completed and occupied (topped out architecturally, fully clad, and at least partially occupied), no earlier than 1 January of the previous year, and no later than 1 October of the current awards year.
*The project advanced architectural form, structure, building systems, sustainable design strategies, and provides life safety for its occupants.
*The project must exhibited sustainable qualities at a broadest level.
*The project must have achieved a high standard of excellence and quality.
*The site planning and response to its immediate context must ensure rich and meaningful urban environments.
*The contributions of the project should be generally consistent with the values and mission of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH).

The criteria for the Innovation Award:&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*Demonstrate a specific area of innovation within design or construction.
*Should be applicable to other tall building projects.
*Single innovative element (single project can be nominated multiple times for different innovations)
*Building can also be submitted for Best Tall Building Award

The criteria for the 10 Year Award:&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*Demonstrate successful performance over time.
*Must have been completed between 10–12 years since the current award year (In the inaugural year submissions of buildings completed between 10–15 years since the current award year will be considered).

The criteria for The Lynn S. Beedle Lifetime Achievement Award:&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*The award recognizes an individual who has made extraordinary contributions to the advancement of tall building and the urban environment during his or her professional career.
*The candidate may be from any area of specialization, including, but not limited to: architecture, structure, building systems, construction, academia, planning, development or management.
*The contributions of the award recipient should be generally consistent with the values and mission of the CTBUH and its founder, Dr. Lynn S. Beedle.
*The award is not intended to be awarded posthumously, although it may be so awarded in some cases.

The criteria for Fazlur Khan Lifetime Achievement Medal:&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

*The award recognizes an individual for his/her demonstrated excellence in technical design and/or research that has made a significant contribution to a discipline for the design of tall buildings and the built urban environment.
*The candidate may or may not be a member of the Council.
*The personal attributes of the award recipient should be of high professional integrity and individual's contributions generally be consistent with the mission of the CTBUH.

The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat bestowed a new award for Burj Khalifa at its annual "Best Tall Buildings Awards Ceremony" on 25 October 2010 when Burj Khalifa honored as first recipient of CTBUH's new Tall Building "Global Icon" Award. According to CTBUH the new "Global Icon" award recognizes those very special supertall skyscrapers that make a profound impact, not only on the local or regional context, but on the genre of tall buildings globally. Which is innovative in planning, design and execution, the building must have influenced and re-shaped the field of tall building architecture, engineering, and urban planning. It is intended that the award will only be conferred on an occasional basis, when merited by an exceptional project perhaps every ten or fifteen years.&lt;ref name="ctbuh.org"/&gt;

Former CTBUH Awards Chair Gordon Gill, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture said:

"There was discussion amongst members of the jury that the existing 'Best Tall Building of the Year' award was not really appropriate for the Burj khalifa. We are talking about a building here that has changed the landscape of what is possible in architecture a building that became internationally recognized as an icon long before it was even completed. 'Building of the Century' was thought a more appropriate title for it."&lt;ref name="ctbuh.org"/&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''Capital, Volume III''''', subtitled ''The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole'', is the third volume of ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]''. It was prepared by [[Friedrich Engels]] from notes left by [[Karl Marx]] and published in 1894. 

==Contents==
Volume III is in seven parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital, Volume 3|isbn=0-7178-0490-9|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|publisher=International Publishers Co, Inc.|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The conversion of Surplus Value into Profit and the rate of Surplus Value into the rate of Profit
# Conversion of Profit into Average Profit
# The Law of the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall]]
# Conversion of Commodity Capital and Money Capital into Commercial Capital and Money-Dealing Capital (Merchant's Capital)
# Division of Profit Into Interest and Profit of Enterprise, Interest Bearing Capital.
# Transformation of Surplus-Profit into [[economic rent|Ground Rent]].
# Revenues and Their Sources

The work is best known today for part 3, which in summary says that as the organic fixed capital requirements of production rise as a result of advancements in production generally, the [[rate of profit]] tends to fall. This result, which orthodox Marxists believe is a principal contradictory characteristic leading to an inevitable collapse of the capitalist order,&lt;ref&gt;"At any rate, it is but a requirement of the capitalist mode of production that the number of wage-workers should increase absolutely, in spite of its relative decrease. Labour-power becomes redundant for it as soon as it is no longer necessary to employ it for 12 to 15 hours a daily. A development of productive forces which would diminish the absolute number of labourers, i.e. enable the entire nation to accomplish its total production in a shorter time span, would cause a revolution, because it would put the bulk of the population out of the running. This is another manifestation of the specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain point it comes into collision with this development. This collision appears partly in its [[Late 2000s recession|periodical crises]], which arise from the circumstances that now this and now that portion of the labouring population becomes redundant under its old mode of employment. The limit of capitalist production is the excess time of the labourers. The absolute spare time gained by society does not concern it. The development of productivity concerns it only in so far as it increases the surplus labour-time of the working class, not because it decreases the labour time for material production in general. It moves thus in a contradiction. " Ch. XV ''Exposition of the Internal Contradictions of the Law'', &amp;sect; IV Supplementary Remarks. p 263 Institute of Marxism Leninism, Moscow translation. The reference to hours worked per day reflects [[full employment]] norms [[eight-hour day|of the 19th century]].&lt;/ref&gt; was held by Marx and Engels to, as a result of  various contradictions in the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], result in [[Crisis (Marxian)|crises]] whose resolution necessitates the emergence of an entirely new [[mode of production]] as the culmination of the same historical dialectic that led to the emergence of [[capitalism]] from [[feudalism|prior forms]].&lt;ref&gt;"... This transformation stems from the development of the productive forces under capitalist production, and from the ways and means by which this development takes place." Ch. XV ''Exposition of the Internal Contradictions of the Law'', &amp;sect; IV Supplementary Remarks. p 264 &amp;para; 2 Institute of Marxism Leninism, Moscow translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 3 is subtitled "The process of capitalist production as a whole" and is concerned primarily with the internal differentiation of the capitalist class. The first three parts are concerned with the division of surplus value amongst individual capitals, where it takes the form of profit. The following parts are concerned with merchants' capital, interest-bearing capital and landed capital. The last part draws the whole account together. The aim of the volume as a whole is to 'locate and describe the concrete forms which grow out of the movements of capital as a whole...The various forms of capital,
as evolved in this book, thus approach step by step the form which they assume on the surface of society, in the action of different capitals on one another in competition, and in the ordinary consciousness of the agents of production themselves." (25) (Clarke).{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Work==
Carrier was the Champney Family Professor in the department of art and art history at [[Case Western Reserve University]] and was a professor of philosophy at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. He is the author of ''Principles of Art History Writing'' (Penn State University Press, 1991), ''The Aesthete in the City: The Philosophy and Practice of American Abstract Painting in the 1980s'' (Penn State University Press, 1994), ''High Art: Charles Baudelaire and the Origins of Modernist Painting'' (Penn State University Press, 1996), ''A World Art History and Its Objects'' (Penn State University Press, 2009), ''The Aesthetics of Comics'' (Penn State University Press, 2000), and ''Museum Skepticism: A History of the Display of Art in Public Galleries'' (Duke University Press, 2006), and ''Wild Art'' with his partner [[Joachim Pissarro]] (Phaidon Press), among others.

He has written about the history and philosophy of art writing, raising questions about the relativism of art writing in different eras by comparing texts written about the same artwork and analyzing changing styles of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Jonathan|title=David Carrier's Art History|journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Winter 1995|volume=53|issue=1|pages=39–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eleanor Antin''' (née '''Fineman'''; February 27, 1935) is an American [[performance art]]ist, [[film-maker]], [[installation art]]ist, [[conceptual art]]ist and [[feminist art]]ist.&lt;ref name=Meeker2009/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Eleanor Fineman was born in the [[Bronx]] on February 27, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/antin-eleanor "Eleanor Antin"], Jewish Women's Archive; retrieved February 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Sol Fineman and Jeanette Efron, were Polish Jews who had recently immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name=Meeker2009/&gt;

She attended the Music and Art High School in New York,&lt;ref name=Meeker2009/&gt; [[The New School|New School for Social Research]], and then the [[City College of New York]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-02/entertainment/ca-50055_1_art-world|title=ART : Ever the 'Wicked Little Girl' : Eleanor Antin's works may be on the fringe, but her audience isn't. Her latest alter ego is a demonic little angel.|last=Ollman|first=Leah|date=April 2, 1995|work=LA Times|access-date=February 2, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/people/eleanor-antin/|title=Eleanor Antin, Artist|last=|first=|date=|website=The Getty|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There she met [[David Antin]], a poet who would become her husband in 1961.&lt;ref name=Handy1989/&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"/&gt; She studied acting and had some roles, including performing in a staged reading with [[Ossie Davis]] at the first [[NAACP]] convention.&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"/&gt; She and her husband moved to San Diego in 1968.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She taught at the [[University of California at Irvine]] from 1974–79, and from 1979 was professor of visual arts at the [[University of California at San Diego]].&lt;ref name=DWA1997/&gt;

== Career ==
When she began her artistic career in New York, she started off as a painter and later turned to making assemblages, but starting in the 1960s she began to do the conceptual projects that would become her focus. The first was ''Blood of a Poet Box'' (1965-1968), in which she took blood samples from poets and put them on slides. The work, which was inspired by [[Jean Cocteau]]’s film ''Blood of a Poet'', eventually held 100 samples, including blood from [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]],&lt;ref name=Knight1999 /&gt; and is in the collection of the [[Tate Modern]].&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"/&gt;

In 1969, she created a portrait, ''Molly Barnes'', out of "a lush lavender bath rug, a noisy electric Lady Schick razor, a patch of spilled talcum powder and a scattering of pink and yellow pills."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: Sourcebook of Artist Writings|edition=Second|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=9780520257184|location=Berkeley|pages=892–894}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Molly Barnes'' was just one of a series of "semantic portraits of people, sometimes real, some-times fictional, [made] out of configurations of brand-new consumer goods" that Antin created.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''100 Boots'' is Antin's best-known [[conceptual art|conceptual work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleanor Antin profile|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/people/eleanor-antin|publisher=Pacific Standard Time at the Getty Center|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this project, she set up 100 boots in various configurations and settings, photographed them, and created 51 postcards of the images that were mailed to hundreds of recipients around the world from 1971-73.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Boots|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/worksofart/100-boots|publisher=Pacific Standard Time at the Getty Center|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''100 Boots'' relied on the recipients to remember and construct the boots' adventures, as the postcards were mailed out at intervals ranging from 3 days to 5 weeks "depending upon what [Antin] took to be the 'internal necessities' of the narrative."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It documents the boots in a mock picaresque photo [[diary]], beginning at the [[Pacific Ocean]] and ending in New York City, where their journey was presented in an exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

In a famous performance work of 1972, ''Carving: A Traditional Sculpture'', Antin photographed her naked body at 148 successive stages during a month of crash-dieting.&lt;ref name=Stein1989/&gt; The somber, almost classical work is a staple of early feminist art, according to the New York Times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ''The Eight Temptations'', 1972, Antin poses in mock histrionic gestures, resisting the temptation to eat [[snack food]]s that would violate her diet. In the 1970s/80s, she created several videos in which she played invented personae, including an Elizabethan-style king, a Romantic-era ballerina, a contemporary black movie star called Eleanora Antinova, and Eleanor Nightingale, a character that is a combination of [[Florence Nightingale]] and the artist herself.&lt;ref name=Knight1999/&gt;

In 1974, Antin described these impersonations as part of her overarching interest in the transformational nature of the self: "I was interested in defining the limits of myself. I consider the usual aids to self-definition—sex, age, talent, time and space—as tyrannical limitations upon my freedom of choice."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From the 70s until the 90s Antin embodied multiple alter egos in a project that she called "Selves" that implemented through several art forms. This project encompassed  four videos: ''The King'' (1972), ''The Ballerina and the Bum'' (1974), ''The Adventures of a Nurse'' (1976), and ''From the Archives of Modern Art'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/artists/8183|title=Eleanor Antin {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Antin completed two large scale photographic series inspired by Roman history and mythology: ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', 2002, and ''Roman Allegories'', 2005. Her work was profiled in Season Two of the [[PBS]] series [[Art:21]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleanor Antin|work=Art in the Twenty First Century|url=https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/eleanor-antin|publisher=Art21, Inc.|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has had dozens of [[solo exhibition]]s and has been represented in countless group exhibitions, including at the [[Hirshhorn Museum]], the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles, the [[Kunsthalle Wien]], and [[documenta]] 12 in Kassel.&lt;ref name="brooklynmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art: Feminist Art Base: Eleanor Antin |publisher=Brooklyn Museum|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/gallery/eleanorantin.php|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is in the permanent collections of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]], and the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleanor Antin profile|url=http://visarts.ucsd.edu/faculty/eleanor-antin|publisher=University of California at San Diego|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work is largely concerned with issues of identity and the role of women in society.&lt;ref name=Stein1989/&gt; "I was determined to present women without pathos or helplessness," she wrote in a feminist artist statement for the Brooklyn Museum.&lt;ref name="brooklynmuseum.org"/&gt;

In a 2009 interview, Antin described her path to becoming an artist: "When I was a kid, I didn't know what kind of artist I was. I knew I was an artist, I just didn't know if I was an actor, I didn't know if I was a writer, I didn't even know if I was a painter. I was fortunate that I grew up as an artist in a time when all the barriers were falling down. It was a time of invention and discovery. I was lucky."&lt;ref name="aaa.si.edu"/&gt;

In 2013, Antin published an autobiographical novel, ''Conversations with Stalin'', about "a young girl's struggle to find her way from her crazy dysfunctional family of first generation Jewish Stalinist immigrants", and "her desperate, endearing, often hilarious quest for art, self, revolution and sex, abetted by a kindly avuncular Stalin dispensing bizarre advice."&lt;ref name=Hoberman2014/&gt;

'''''Elseworlds''''' was the publication [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] for [[American comic books]] produced by [[DC Comics]] for stories that took place outside the [[DC Universe]] [[Canon (fictional)|canon]].&lt;ref name="comicsthroughtime"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booker|first1=M.

From 1942 to the mid-1980s, particularly during the 1960s — the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] era — DC Comics began to make a distinction between the continuity of its fictional universe and stories with plots that did not fit that continuity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} These out-of-continuity stories eventually came to be called ''Imaginary Stories''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The title page of "Superman, Cartoon Hero!" stated that the story was "Our first imaginary story", and continued to say: "In 1942, a series of Superman shorts started showing throughout the U.S.! So, with tongue firmly in cheek, the DC team turned out this story of what might have happened if [[Lois Lane]] had decided to see... Superman, Cartoon Hero!".&lt;ref name="Superman"&gt;''Superman'' #183 (Jan. 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; The story opens with Lois determined to learn Superman's secret identity and going to the theater to see the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Max Fleisher ''Superman'' short]] "[[Superman (animated short)|Mad Scientist]]" in hopes of seeing the animated Man of Steel reveal his secret identity. In addition to other things, when the opening credits roll and state that the cartoons are based on DC Comics, Lois Lane states that she has never heard of DC Comics. [[Clark Kent]] then wonders if the people there are clairvoyant. In the final panel, Clark Kent exchanges a knowing wink with the image of himself as [[Superman]] on the movie screen.&lt;ref name="Superman"/&gt;

[[Craig Shutt]], author of the ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' column ''Ask Mr. Silver Age'', states that true imaginary stories differed from stories that were dreams and hoaxes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Dreams and hoaxes were "gyps" on account of "not having happened" whilst true imaginary stories were canonical at least unto themselves. Also, since they were "just" imaginary and thus had no bearing on the characters’ regular stories, imaginary stories could show things like people dying and the victory of evil.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In the optimistic and hopeful Silver Age of Comics, such stories usually would not be told; this was hinted with writers telling readers how such an Imaginary Story often reassured the readers that it did not really happen.{{or|date=March 2015}}

Most of these imaginary stories featured [[alternate histories]] of characters, such as "[[Superman Red/Superman Blue|The Amazing Story of Superman-Red and Superman Blue!]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} There, readers saw possible pasts that could have happened, but did not happen. One such story has Superman being raised by apes in imitation of [[Tarzan]], an idea that would be recycled into a later ''Elseworlds'' tale where Tarzan and Superman were switched at birth. Possible present times were shown, such as one story where [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], touched by pity, adopt a recently orphaned [[Bruce Wayne]] and raise him along with their own son, Clark. Thus, the present shows Superman and Batman as brothers, with Clark protecting Gotham and working for the ''Gotham Gazette'' instead of living in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and [[Batman]] inviting his foster parents, the Kents, to live with him in Wayne Manor. In keeping with the fact that imaginary stories allowed for much grimmer stories than usual, the story ended with [[Lex Luthor]] killing the Kents and Batman trying to murder him in revenge.

{{rquote|right|This Super-Wedding is REAL!&lt;br&gt;The marriage is not a HOAX!&lt;br&gt;The bride and groom are not ROBOTS!&lt;br&gt;This romance is not a DREAM of LOIS LANE or SUPERMAN!|''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' #15 (Feb. 1960)}}
Possible futures that "could very well happen" were explored, such as [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|Clark Kent revealing to Lois Lane his secret identity and marrying her]]. Futures that "perhaps never will" happen were also examined, such as the permanent death of Superman. ''Imaginary Stories'' appeared often enough that some comics – such as ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #15 (February 1960), the cover of which appears to depict Superman marrying Lois Lane – had to assure readers that their contents were not "imaginary". The cover of ''Lois Lane'' #59 (August 1965), by contrast, promised that its depiction of Lois as romantic rival of [[Lara (comics)|Lara]], [[Jor-El]]'s girlfriend and future mother of Superman, was "real--'''not''' imaginary!".

A few ''Imaginary Stories'' appeared in other DC publications. Batman editor [[Jack Schiff]] supervised stories in which the Dark Knight starts a family or loses his identity, though these were revealed at the end of the story to be stories written by [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #131 (April 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #135 (Oct. 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff's stories were notable for the first appearance of the [[Bruce Wayne Junior|original Bruce Wayne Junior]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Writer/editor [[Robert Kanigher]] supervised [[Wonder Woman]]'s own series of ''Imaginary Stories'' called ''Impossible Tales'' which featured the same principle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} There, Wonder Woman appeared along with her younger selves, [[Wonder Girl]] and [[Wonder Tot]]. However, the majority of ''Imaginary Stories'' were published in various Superman comics under the guidance of Superman editor [[Mort Weisinger]], the "King of Imaginary Stories".{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} This was in part because, according to Shutt, Weisinger aimed for younger readers instead of older ones.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Later editors such as [[Julius Schwartz]] rarely used the ''Imaginary Stories'' concept.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Alan Moore]]'s "[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow]]?" two-part story in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #423 and ''[[Action Comics]]'' #583 in 1986 was the last Pre-''Crisis'' story to use the ''Imaginary Stories'' label.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===''Elseworlds'' imprint===
The first ''Elseworlds'' title was ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]'' (1989), written by [[Brian Augustyn]] and drawn by [[Mike Mignola]], which featured a [[Victorian Age]] version of the [[superhero]] Batman hunting [[Jack the Ripper]], who had come to [[Gotham City]]. The title was not originally published as an ''Elseworlds'' comic, but its success led to the creation of the ''Elseworlds'' imprint and this title was retroactively declared the first ''Elseworlds'' story.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The first book to feature the ''Elseworlds'' logo was ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'' in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1994, the ''Elseworlds'' imprint was used as the theme for the [[annual publication|annual edition]] comic books of that summer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

DC sporadically published various ''Elseworlds'' titles from 1989 to 2003. In August 2003, editor Mike Carlin mentioned that DC had scaled back the production of ''Elseworlds'' books in order to "put the luster back on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Michael Patrick|title=CHICAGO DAY 2: New 'Challengers of the Unknown,' Richard Corben Monthly Announced, DC Teams with Aspen|url=http://www.cbr.com/chicago-day-2-new-challengers-of-the-unknown-richard-corben-monthly-announced-dc-teams-with-aspen/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2015-03-10|date=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several titles that were announced as ''Elseworlds'' books prior to this, such as ''Superman &amp; Batman: Generations IV'' and ''The [[Teen Titans]] Swingin' Elseworlds Special'', were cancelled.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} The planned ''Teen Titans'' tale was released in January 2008 as the ''Teen Titans Lost Annual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schedeen|first1=Jesse|title=Teen Titans: The Lost Annual Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/09/teen-titans-the-lost-annual-review|website=IGN|accessdate=2015-03-10|date=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, [[Dan DiDio]] revealed the return of the ''Elseworlds'' imprint as a series of Prestige Format books, with the approach of taking the basic concepts and origins of DC characters and twisting them in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Vaneta|title=20 Answers &amp; 1 Question with Dan Didio|url=http://www.newsarama.com/3834-20-answers-1-question-with-dan-didio-9-14-09.html|website=Newsarama|date=2009-09-14|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only ''Elseworlds'' story released under the initiative was the three-issue miniseries ''Superman: The Last Family of Krypton'', published from August to October 2010, which told the story of baby Kal-El reaching Earth with his mother and father and how the world handles the emergence of a superpowered family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/comics/superman-the-last-family-of-krypton |title=Superman: The Last Family of Krypton Comics |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship to DC continuity====
Although the ''Elseworlds'' imprint was created to feature stories separate from DC continuity, concepts from various ''Elseworlds'' stories were incorporated into DC continuity at various times.

''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]'' miniseries in 1999 brought the ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries into DC continuity as part of a series of alternate timelines known as [[Hypertime]], which included some of the alternate worlds depicted in various ''Elseworlds'' titles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kingdom'' #2 (Feb. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] was introduced at the conclusion of the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' weekly series that includes alternate worlds that were previously seen in various ''Elseworlds'' titles.&lt;ref&gt;''52'' Week Fifty-Two (May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other media ==
The fifth annual crossover of the [[Arrowverse]] series is set to be titled "[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]", and will include ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''. This crossover will introduce [[Batwoman]], [[Gotham City]], [[Nora Fries]], and [[Lois Lane]] to the Arrowverse, and is set to air on December 9–11, 2018 on [[The CW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/09/26/arrowverse-crossover-elseworlds-theme-batwoman-gotham/|title=Arrowverse Crossover Theme Is 'Elseworlds,' Casts Multiverse Observer|last=Mitovitch|first=Matt Webb|work=[[TV Line]]|date=September 26, 2018|accessdate=September 26, 2018|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/72jANcl1y|archivedate=September 26, 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frederic Lloyd''', [[OBE]] (1 July 1918 – 27 July 1995), was an English theatre manager.  Most notably, Lloyd was the General Manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] from 1951 until its closure in 1982.

==Biography==
Lloyd was born into an ecclesiastical family near [[Oxford]], England.  During the [[Second World War]] he worked with the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts, the precursor of the [[Arts Council]].&lt;ref name=Times&gt;''[[The Times]]'' obituary, 23 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 he was a director of the [[Festival of Britain]],&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; and in September of that year he was appointed General Manager of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and of the [[Savoy Theatre]], in succession to Alfred Nightingale.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix, p. v&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his D'Oyly Carte duties, Lloyd was a member of the council of management of the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and played an important part in saving the orchestra's tour of [[Americas|America]] in 1963 at a critical time in the RPO's fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1961 to 1982, Lloyd was also secretary of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust.  In 1966 he was elected President of the Theatrical Managers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 December 1966, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

With D'Oyly Carte's closure, Lloyd retired from theatre management, although he continued to sit on numerous committees.  He was chairman of the governors of the [[Royal Academy of Music]], 1980-83, and trustee and chairman of the general committee of the [[Garrick Club]], 1976-84.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  He wrote articles on [[Elgar]] and [[Beethoven]], and he collaborated with [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin Wilson]] on an official history of the D'Oyly Carte Company in 1984.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

On his retirement, he moved from his London home in [[St John's Wood]] to the village of [[Strathpeffer]], Scotland, near [[Inverness]], where he became a lay-preacher at his local church.  His wife Valerie died in 1991.  They had two sons.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;

Lloyd died in Inverness at age 77.&lt;ref&gt;obituary: ''The Independent'' (London), 9 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genre painting''', also called '''petit genre''', depicts aspects of [[everyday life]] by portraying ordinary people engaged in common activities. One common definition of a '''genre scene''' is that it shows figures to whom no identity can be attached either individually or collectively—thus distinguishing ''petit genre'' from [[history painting]]s (also called ''grand genre'') and [[portrait]]s. A work would often be considered as a genre work even if it could be shown that the artist had used a known person—a member of his family, say—as a model. In this case it would depend on whether the work was likely to have been intended by the artist to be perceived as a portrait—sometimes a subjective question. The depictions can be realistic, imagined, or romanticized by the artist. Because of their familiar and frequently sentimental subject matter, genre paintings have often proven popular with the [[bourgeoisie]], or [[middle class]].
[[Image:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 014.jpg|thumb|280px|right|''Peasant Dance'', c. 1568, oil on wood, by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]] the Elder]]

Genre subjects appear in many traditions of art. Painted decorations in [[Art of Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] [[tomb]]s often depict banquets, recreation, and agrarian scenes, and [[Peiraikos]] is mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] as a [[Hellenistic]] panel painter of "low" subjects, such as survive in [[mosaic]] versions and provincial wall-paintings at [[Pompeii]]: "barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Book XXXV.112 of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval [[illuminated manuscripts]] often illustrated scenes of everyday peasant life, especially in the [[Labours of the Months]] in the calendar section of [[books of hours]], most famously the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].

==To 1800==
[[File:Merry company, by Dirck Hals.jpg|thumb|''Merry Company'', a [[Merry company]] scene, by [[Dirck Hals]]]]

The [[Low Countries]] dominated the field until the 18th century, and in the 17th century both [[Flemish Baroque painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] produced numerous specialists who mostly painted genre scenes.  In the previous century, the Flemish [[Renaissance]] painter [[Jan Sanders van Hemessen]] painted innovative large-scale genre scenes, sometimes including a moral theme or a religious scene in the background in the first half of the 16th century.  These were part of a pattern of "[[Mannerist]] inversion" in [[Antwerp]] painting, giving "low" elements previously in the decorative background of images prominent emphasis.  [[Joachim Patinir]] expanded [[landscape painting|his landscapes]], making the figures a small element, and [[Pieter Aertsen]] painted works dominated by spreads of [[still life]] food and genre figures of cooks or market-sellers, with small religious scenes in spaces in the background.  [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] made peasants and their activities, very naturalistically treated, the subject of many of his paintings, and genre painting was to flourish in Northern Europe in Brueghel's wake. 
[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - Interieur met naaiende vrouw.jpg|thumb|''Interior with Sewing Woman'', c. 1800-1810 by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] ]] [[Adriaen van Ostade|Adriaen]] and [[Isaac van Ostade]], [[Jan Steen]], [[Adriaan Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]], [[Aelbert Cuyp]], [[Johannes Vermeer]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]] were among the many painters specializing in genre subjects in the Low Countries during the 17th century. The generally small scale of these artists' paintings was appropriate for their display in the homes of middle class purchasers. Often the subject of a genre painting was based on a popular ''emblem'' from an [[Emblem book]]. This can give the painting a double meaning, such as in [[Gabriel Metsu]]'s [[:Image:Gabriel Metsu 003.jpg|''The Poultry seller'', 1662]], showing an old man offering a [[rooster]] in a symbolic pose that is based on a lewd engraving by Gillis van Breen (1595–1622), with the same scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/jong076erot01_01/jong076erot01_01_0001.htm | title=E. de Jongh, 'Erotica in vogelperspectief. De dubbelzinnigheid van een reeks zeventiende-eeuwse genrevoorstellingen'· dbnl |first=| last=DBNL| date=| website=DBNL |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[merry company]]'' showed a group of figures at a party, whether making music at home or just drinking in a tavern. Other common types of scenes showed markets or fairs, village festivities ("kermesse"), or soldiers in camp.

In Italy, a "school" of genre painting was stimulated by the arrival in [[Rome]] of the Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] in 1625. He acquired the nickname "Il Bamboccio" and his followers were called the ''[[Bamboccianti]]'', whose works would inspire [[Giacomo Ceruti]], [[Antonio Cifrondi]], and [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] among many others.

[[Le Nain|Louis le Nain]] was an important exponent of genre painting in 17th-century France, painting groups of peasants at home, where the 18th century would bring a heightened interest in the depiction of everyday life, whether through the [[romanticism|romanticized]] paintings of [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], or the careful [[realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin|Chardin]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (1725–1805) and others painted detailed and rather sentimental groups or individual portraits of peasants that were to be influential on 19th-century painting.

In England, [[William Hogarth]] (1697–1764) conveyed comedy, social criticism and moral lessons through canvases that told stories of ordinary people ful of narrative detail (aided by long sub-titles), often in serial form, as in his ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', first painted in 1732–33, then engraved and published in print form in 1735.

Spain had a tradition predating ''[[The Book of Good Love]]'' of social observation and commentary based on the Old Roman Latin tradition, practiced by many of its painters and [[illuminated manuscript|illuminators]].  At the height of the Spanish Empire and the beginning of its slow decline, many [[picaresque]] genre scenes of street life—as well as the kitchen scenes known as ''[[bodegones]]''—were painted by the artists of The [[Spanish Golden Age]], notably [[Velázquez]] (1599–1660) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] (1617–82). More than a century later, the Spanish artist [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828) used genre scenes in painting and [[printmaking]] as a medium for dark commentary on the human condition. His ''[[The Disasters of War]]'', a series of 82 genre incidents from the [[Peninsular War]], took genre art to unprecedented heights of expressiveness.

==19th century==
[[File:Wassilij Grigorjewitsch Perow 004.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Vasily Perov]], ''The Hunters at Rest'' (1871), [[Tretyakov Gallery]]]]
[[File:Jagerswoning Rijksmuseum SK-A-1157.jpeg|thumbnail|280px|[[Henry Voordecker]], ''[[Hunter's Home]]'' (1826)]]
[[File:1820-Country-Wedding-John-Lewis-Krimmel.jpg|thumb|280px|[[John Lewis Krimmel]], ''Country Wedding'' (1820)]]

With the decline of religious and historical painting in the 19th century, artists increasingly found their subject matter in the life around them. [[Realism (art)|Realists]] such as [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–77) upset expectations by depicting everyday scenes in huge paintings—at the scale traditionally reserved for "important" subjects—thus blurring the boundary which had set genre painting apart as a "minor" category. Realist paintings on such a scale, and the new type showing people at work, emphasizing the effort involved, would not normally be called "genre paintings".  Both monumental scale and the depiction of exhausting work are exemplified by ''[[Barge Haulers on the Volga]]'' ([[Ilya Repin]], 1873). [[History painting]] itself shifted from the exclusive depiction of events of great public importance to the depiction of genre scenes in historical times, both the private moments of great figures, and the everyday life of ordinary people. In French art this was known as the [[Troubador style]].  This trend, already apparent by 1817 when [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] painted ''Henri IV Playing with His Children'', culminated in the [[pompier]] art of French academicians such as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) and [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] (1815–91).  In the second half of the century interest in genre scenes, often in historical settings or with pointed social or moral comment, greatly increased across Europe.

[[William Powell Frith]] (1819–1909) was perhaps the most famous English genre painter of the Victorian era, painting large and extremely crowded scenes; the expansion in size and ambition in 19th-century genre painting was a common trend. Other 19th-century English genre painters include [[Augustus Leopold Egg]], [[Frederick Daniel Hardy]], [[George Elgar Hicks]], [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  Scotland produced two influential genre painters, [[David Allan (painter)|David Allan]] (1744–96) and [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] (1785–1841). Wilkie's ''The Cottar's Saturday Night'' (1837) inspired a major work by the French painter [[Gustave Courbet]], ''[[After Dinner at Ornans]]'' (1849). Famous [[Russia]]n realist painters like [[Vasily Perov]] and [[Ilya Repin]] also produced genre paintings.

In Germany, [[Carl Spitzweg]] (1808–85) specialized in gently humorous genre scenes, and in Italy [[Gerolamo Induno]] (1825–90) painted scenes of military life. Subsequently, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], as well as such 20th-century artists as [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Itshak Holtz]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[David Park (painter)|David Park]] painted scenes of daily life. But in the context of modern art the term "genre painting" has come to be associated mainly with painting of an especially anecdotal or sentimental nature, painted in a traditionally realistic technique.

The first true genre painter in the United States was the German immigrant [[John Lewis Krimmel]], who learning from Wilkie and Hogarth, produced gently humorous scenes of life in Philadelphia from 1812–21. Other notable 19th-century genre painters from the United States include [[George Caleb Bingham]], [[William Sidney Mount]], and [[Eastman Johnson]]. [[Harry Roseland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4may/art0512.html|title=ART / 4 / 2DAY|first=John F.|last=Canu|date=|website=www.safran-arts.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on scenes of poor African Americans in the post-American Civil War South,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/158/5/970.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rogers (sculptor)|John Rogers]] (1829–1904) was a sculptor whose small genre works, mass-produced in cast plaster, were immensely popular in America.  The works of American painter [[Ernie Barnes]] (1938–2009) and those of illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]] (1894–1978) could exemplify a more modern type of genre painting.

== Sam Harkleroad==
Sam Harkleroad was born on October 20, 1909, and grew up on a farm in [[Fresno]].  His education ended with high school.  He lived much of his life in  Marin County.  Harkleroad died on June 12, 1993, at the age of 83.

Harkleroad was a contractor, who liked to use recycled materials.

The Harkleroad structures are on a street named Harkle Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Novato—Did You Know? |publisher=Marin Magazine |date=2009 |url=http://www.marinmagazine.com/Annual-2009/Novato/ |accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Round house==
The round house once appeared in a Popular Mechanics article, which explained how the house was able to rotate 320 degrees, while the plumbing and electrical systems continued to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Carousel House Spins for a View |publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]] |date=1964 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PuMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=Sam+Harkleroad&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qahiscguOw&amp;sig=jk_yJFl9fcgfKCMEFkuaOR-p7b0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlrLjDmafPAhXMsh4KHd1XBtQQ6AEIMTAI |accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the three buildings has a [[saddle roof]] made of 2 by 4 lumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This is the House that Sam Built |date=May 11, 1956 |publisher=[[Marin Independent Journal|Daily Independent Journal]] |page=22 |location=San Rafael, California |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/72400630/ |accessdate=August 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harkleroad Taco house.jpg |700px|center|Harkleroad Taco house]]

This house was for sale in 1959, with a minimum bid of $32,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Novato—50 Years Ago |author=Bill Almeida and Tonie Brown |date=June 1959 |publisher=Novato History Museum |work=The Novato Historian |url=http://www.novatohistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Historian-Vol.-33-No.-2-news-section.pdf |accessdate=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workshop==
The roof of the workshop has a wind turbine.  The turbine once provided electricity for the workshop, however, it is no longer used for electricity.  Instead, it provides an novel sight for travelers along [[U.S. Route 101]] in [[Marin County, California]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21968">The '''International Magicians Society''' ('''IMS''') is the world's largest [[magic (illusion)|magic]] society as recorded in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. The IMS began in 1968 and now has over 41,000 members worldwide. It was created to help promote and preserve the art of magic and provide a format where magicians could share their secrets and ideas.

The IMS named [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]] as the Magicians of the Century in 2000 and named [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Doug Henning]], [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.]], [[Criss Angel]] and [[David Blaine]] as the most influential magicians of the past 25 years. The organization awards the Merlin Awards, every three years. "Every three years, the International Magicians Society hosts a banquet dinner, where those magicians who have achieved the highest level in their craft are awarded the coveted Merlin Award. The voting members begin with approximately one hundred names and narrows down to a handful. The criteria that the voting members consider are talent, showmanship, originality, skills, and above all the rare ability to entertain under any conditions."&lt;ref name=imswebsite&gt;[http://imsmagic.com/Merlin_Award.php "Merlin Awards"], Retrieved 2 Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merlin Award==
The '''Merlin Award''' is given to magicians in recognition of their contributions to the performance and creation of magic around the world. While sometimes called the [[Academy Award]]s of magic, the Merlin Award lacks much of the oversight that enhance the credibility of awards in other industries.&lt;ref name=unofficialarchive&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellis|first=Tim|title=Merlin Awards: Controversy|url=http://merlinawards.wordpress.com/controversy/|publisher=The Unofficial Archives of the Merlin Awards|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was created by [[Tony Hassini]] and his International Magicians Society and is given out to invited guests at triennial banquets as well as in person by Hassini himself with greater frequency.&lt;ref name=merlineawards&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassini|first=Tony|title=Merlin Awards|url=http://merlinawards.wordpress.com/controversy/|publisher=International Magicians Society|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imsmagic.com/Merlin_Award.php |title=Merlin award Criteria- IMS|publisher=imsmagic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The award is intended to be a recognition for magicians who perform at the highest level of skills on national and international stages. Merlin award can be obtained in three ways.One is to attend Merlin Award banquet dinner on invitation, after being voted to receive the prize. Another is by participating and winning a Merlin Award competition organized by IMS and held in different countries. Third way is for the organizers to travel to the magician’s country to present the award there. The criteria considered are talent, showmanship, originality, skills, and an ability to entertain under any conditions.

===Design===
The award statue was commissioned to over 100 art students in a nationwide search. The winning design was created by Carol Michaud, a New York University art student, in 1968.

===List of Merlin Award recipients===

====2015 awards====
Zenia Bhumgara. Her passion and enthusiasm for this offbeat career paid off on the third week of September when she was awarded the prestigious Merlin award by the International Magicians Association in Mumbai, India.

Handy Altan. He is known for one of the outstanding close up magician in Indonesia. His passion and enthusiasm in teaching magic to the lay people, developing the art itself, and his art-movement to unite magic art enthusiast in Indonesia has been an excellent example. For this, on October 2015 he was awarded the prestigious Merlin Award by the International Magicians Society for the Best Magic Movement.

====2016 awards====
in May 2016, Hany show received the Prestigious Merlin Award as " Best Stage Magic Middle East 2016.

Merlin Awards are not listed with either category or date:

''"Sometimes, I am asked why don’t we publish the year and category for each magician’s Merlin Award on our website. The fact is that when the magician receives his award, during the press conference, we announce the category. Thereafter, it serves no purpose to publish the category or the year on our website. Because some categories might sound more glorious than the others, there’s no point of hyping or diminishing anyone’s award or the year they received it. And there’s no point in dating their awards either. The bottom line is everyone who received the Merlin Award is a Merlin Award Recipient period and is entitled to enjoy the glory for the rest of their life without dating or categorizing it.”'' - '''Tony Hassini'''

It has been suggested that the Merlin Awards exist purely to generate publicity for the artist and income for the IMS. Tony Hassini clarifies this in the FAQ page of The International Magicians Society.

''"I’m also asked how do we consider a nominee for the Merlin Award? A magician must send to the IMS World Headquarters a videotape or DVD of his complete act for our Board of Directors to consider. (No promo DVD’s or online videos are accepted.) The other question I am asked is “Are there any costs to receive the Merlin Award?” First, I must say that the Merlin Award is not for sale at any cost. Regarding the actual out-of-pocket cost, this varies from situation to situation. There are three ways a magician can receive the Merlin Award. One is to attend our Merlin Award banquet dinner; this is by invitation only, after the recipient was voted to receive the Merlin Award. Two is to participate and win a Merlin Award competition in different countries, which is organized by IMS with the event and convention organizers. And three is for us to travel to the magician’s country and present the Merlin Award to them in their own country. So let’s look at the cost of the first scenario, which is where the magician must obtain a visa from the American embassy to travel to the USA. He must purchase airline tickets, other travel related costs and fees, hotels, meals, and $500 US dollars per plate at the Merlin Award banquet dinner. In the second scenario, again the magician must travel to the event where the Merlin Award competition is taking place. He pays all of the same travel expenses as mentioned in the first scenario and pays for the entrance fee to the convention or to the competition, whichever applies. In the third scenario, where we have to travel from the USA to the magician’s country, either the magician or the magician’s producer pays for all of the travel expenses, hotels, meals, airlines, and other related expenses. Within any of these three scenarios, it’s always a trade when it comes to the cost. Within any of the three scenarios, our main focus is to generate as much PR as possible with the general public. A good example of this is when we were going to present the Merlin Award to Louis Yan in Hong Kong, we could have presented the award to him in our Hong Kong IMS office. Or we could have had our IMS members meet at a nice Chinese restaurant and present the award to him there. Then we came up with an idea. We approached one of the largest shopping malls in Hong Kong. Not only did they build a custom stage and provided enough seating for the audience, they also provided guards for crowd control. The mall management, with their media contacts, were able to invite newspapers, radio, and television to cover the event. Both the mall and Louis Yan received tremendous PR and public awareness."'' - '''Tony Hassini'''

''"A YouTube promotional video...also touts the Merlin Awards, which are handed out by a frizzy-haired Marty Allen look-alike named Tony Hassini. Casanova, meet every other magician in town!"'' - '''Mike Weatherford, Las Vegas Review Journal'''  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/mike-weatherford/construction-may-keep-tourists-away |title=Construction may keep tourists away - Las Vegas Review Journal|publisher=reviewjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2008-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2018 awards ====
Tony Hassini visited Guam on January 4, 2018 to present magicians Chris &amp; Ryan Zubrick the famed Merlin Award for “Best Family Magic Show” for their show “Zubrick”, currently running at the SandCastle Dinner Theater.

During the presentation ceremony Toni Hassini was quoted saying, “We look for originality. We look for showmanship and above all we look for magicians who can perform under any circumstances. And for the first time we are presenting the Merlin Award on Guam and to very fine and very talented two magicians, [The] Zubricks,” said Hassini.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pacificnewscenter.com/sandcastles-zubrick-illusionist-duo-win-magic-industries-most-prestigious-honor/|title=Sandcastle’s Zubrick illusionist duo win magic industries most prestigious honor {{!}} PNC News First|last=Ridgell|first=Clynt|website=pacificnewscenter.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Khaled Akil was born in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite news|title=Artist Khaled Akil imagines Pokémon Go in ravaged Syria|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/07/artist-khaled-akil-imagines-pokmon-ravaged-syria-160722172024059.html|agency=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a family with a long history of artistic and political influence. His father is the renowned painter Youssef Akil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.janetradyfineart.com/artist/Khaled_Akil/biography/|website=janetradyfineart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His great maternal grandfather is the Syrian author and historical figure [[Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi]].

Khaled’s first exhibition was held in 2009, when at the time he was completing his bachelor's degree in Law.&lt;ref name=NYTIMES /&gt; His experience in law, politics and human rights played a major role in his artistic development and projections. Most of his works deal with topics related to the social, political, and religious discrepancies he witnessed around the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHOTOGRAPHY.

In 2012, he held a solo exhibition “The Legend of Death”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAREWELL IS NOT GOOD-BYE|url=http://www.mantlethought.org/arts-and-culture/farewell-not-good-bye|website=mantlethought.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Istanbul, where he resides today&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=You Need to Be Looking at 'Pokémon Go in Syria'|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/pokemon-go-in-syria-photographs-isis|website=The Creator Project.Vice}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the escalation of the war in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Middle East's managing editor caught up with celebrated Syrian artist Khaled Akil who currently resides in Istanbul. |url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/qa-with-Syrian-artist-khaled-akil_15437 |website=yourmiddleeast.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021030126/http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/features/qa-with-syrian-artist-khaled-akil_15437 |archivedate=2015-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technic ==
His work is a hybrid of photography and painting, with a digital final product.  various layers, created in direct relation with the photographic work and the issue presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW: KHALED AKIL|url=http://www.artfridge.de/2014/02/interview-with-khaled-akil.html|website=artfridge.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What one sees when looking into Akil's images is a dual universe wherein creatures and symbols merge with the visual fragments of war and abandonment.

Khaled Akil subjects his original photographs to countless layers of manual intervention that ultimately result in digital prints. With their mixture of photography, painting, and sometimes Arabic calligraphy, the dense surfaces of the works make them expressive and strongly palpable.

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - The Triumphal Chariot of Maximilian I (The Great Triumphal Car) (plate 1 of 8).jpg|thumb|right|The left-most of eight prints comprising the ''Large Triumphal Carriage'']]
The '''''Large Triumphal Carriage''''' or '''''Great Triumphal Car''''' (in German, ''Triumphwagen'') is a large 16th-century [[woodcut]] [[Old master print|print]] by [[Albrecht Dürer]], commissioned by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. The work was originally intended to be the central part of a {{convert|54|m|ft}} long print of a ''[[Triumphal Procession]]'' or ''Triumph of Maximilian'', depicting Maximilian and his court entourage in a procession.

The work is one of three huge prints created for Maximilian, the other being a ''[[Triumphal Arch (woodcut)|Triumphal Arch]]'' (1512–15, 192 woodcut panels, {{convert|3.0|m|ft|0}} high and {{convert|3.7|m|ft}} wide) also designed by [[Albrecht Dürer]], and the ''[[Triumphal Procession]]'' (1516–18, 137 woodcut panels, {{convert|54|m|ft}} long). The monumental projects reflect Maximilian's position as Holy Roman Emperor, and link him to the [[triumphal arch]]es and [[Roman triumph|triumphs]] of [[Ancient Rome]]. Only the ''Triumphal Arch'' was completed before Maximilian's death in 1519, and distributed as Imperial [[propaganda]] as he intended.

The completed ''Large Triumphal Carriage'' is a composite image [[printing|printed]] from 8 separate [[Woodblock printing|wood blocks]] created by [[Willibald Pirckheimer]]. It measures approximately {{convert|0.46|m|ft|1}} high {{convert|2.4|m|ft|0}} long. Two blocks depict a large carriage or chariot in which Maximilian sits alone, holding a sceptre and a palm and wearing the imperial robes and the crown of the Holy Roman Empire and surrounded by the four [[cardinal virtues]] - Iustitia (justice), Fortitudo (fortitude), Prudentia (prudence) and Temperantia (temperance). The emperor sits under the crown held aloft by a [[Victory]], whose feathered wings bear the names of Maximilian's military campaigns: "Gallis" (France), "Ungaris" (Hungary), "Bohemis" (Bohemia), "Elvetiis" (Switzerland), "Germanis" (Germany) and "Venetis" (Venice). The other six plates each show a pair of horses with luxurious harnesses, pulling the carriage along. Many parts of the print are labelled to explain the complex iconography: the wheels are marked "Magnificentia" (magnificence), "Dignitas" (dignity), "Gloria" (glory) and "Honor" (honour); one rein is marked "Nobilitas" (nobility) and the other "Potentia" (power). The driver of the carriage is "Ratio" (reason). Each horse is attended by a female figure carrying a wreath: from rear to front, "Providentia" (providence) and "Moderatio" (moderation), "Alacritas" (quickness) and "Opportunitas" (opportunity), "Velocitas" (speed) and "Firmitudo" (firmness), "Acrimonia" (sharpness/keen-ness/vigor) and "Virilitas" (virility), "Audacia" (audacity) and "Magnanimitas" (magananiminty), and "Experientia" (experience) and "Solertia" (skill). The carriage is also attended by four female figures: "Gravitas" (gravity), "Perserverantia" (perseverance), "Fidentia" (fidelity) and "Securitas" (security). Lettering above explains the iconography, and the front pair of horses are accompanied by a text recording the commission from Maximilian to Pirckheimer dated Innsbruck, 1518.

Dürer's allegorical figures are based on prints of dancing nymphs by [[Andrea Mantegna]].

The work was originally intended to be the central part of the ''Triumph of Maximilian'', a work that was proposed in 1512, when Maximilian made his last visit to Nuremberg, and met Dürer. Dürer's first design drawings of 1512–13 are held by the [[Albertina]] in Vienna, and show a much smaller carriage. A watercolour of a second more elaborate scheme drawn in 1518 by Dürer with suggestions by [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] is also held by the Albertina. In the earlier works, Maximilian is accompanied in the carriage by members of his family, but they were omitted in the final print.

After Maximilian's death in 1519, and the ending of the annual pension of 100 florins paid to Dürer under Maximilian, Dürer published the prints of the completed carriage as a separate work in 1522, with text in German, dedicated to Maximilian and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. This may have been an attempt by Dürer to raise funds by selling the prints, or as a demonstration of his loyalty to encourage the restoration of his stipend. The remaining parts of the ''Triumphal Procession'', mostly designed by [[Hans Burgkmair]] from about 1512, were first published in 1526 on the orders of Archduke Ferdinand.

The original blocks were used to print seven editions of the print. The first edition was published in Nuremberg by Dürer himself, with explanatory text by Pirckheimer in German in 1522, with a second edition in Latin in 1523. A third and fourth edition in German and Latin was published in around 1559, and a fifth edition was published in Venice in 1589 by the German printer [[Jacubus Chinig]]. Examples of the fifth edition are held by the [[British Museum]] and the [[Library of Congress]]. A sixth and seventh edition were printed before 1601, by which time the woodblocks were becoming very worn. The original blocks are also held in the collection of the Albertina.

I think you might even hear an 'Och aye!' in there as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You're Devotion by Pilot|publisher=|url=http://www.thelibrarydoor.com/blackbox/blackbox.htm|accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Plasmatics]]
| "Coup d'État" &lt;small&gt;([[Coup d'Etat (Plasmatics album)|album]])&lt;/small&gt;
| "The brainwashed do not know they are being brainwashed"

| "Hello, how are you? I'm fine. 'Cause I know that the Lord is coming soon. Coming, coming soon", followed by thirty-seven "hah"s.&lt;ref name="revealed" /&gt;
| At the end of the track with the sound of rain and wind. The message appears to be in sharp contrast to the rest of the sexually laden song&lt;ref name="ev" /&gt; but is more likely a simple double-entendre.
|-
||[[The Prodigy]]
| "Full Throttle" &lt;small&gt;([[Music for the Jilted Generation|album]])&lt;/small&gt;

| The backmasked portion is actually sampled from the film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''. It appears backmasked on the album ''[[Music for the Jilted Generation]]'', but a version of the song featuring the unbackmasked sample appears as the B-side to their single "[[One Love (The Prodigy song)|One Love]]".

| "Daydreaming" &lt;small&gt; ([[A Moon Shaped Pool|album]])&lt;/small&gt;
| "Half of my life."
| Repeated frequently in the last minute of the song, in a lowered pitch and a lowered formant. It's to symbolise how long that the band's frontman, [[Thom Yorke]] had spent with his separated and now late wife, [[Rachel Owen]]. At the time of [[A Moon Shaped Pool]]'s release, Yorke was 47 and he had been married with Owen for 23 years.

| Found prior to the bridge at around 1:13. As The Rutles are themselves a parody of The Beatles, this parodies the numerous purported backwards messages in Beatles songs.
|-

| "665" &lt;small&gt;([[Ultramega OK|album]])&lt;/small&gt;
| "[[Santa Claus|Santa]], I love you baby. My [[Christmas]] king. Santa, you’re my king. I love you, Santa baby. Got what I need."&lt;ref name="modernrock" /&gt;

| "I choked her to death, then cut her in small pieces so I could take the meat to my rooms, cook, and eat it. How sweet and tender her little ass was roasted in the oven. It took me 9 days to eat her entire body. I did not fuck her, though I could have if I wished. She died a virgin."
| At the end of the song, You can hear a voice of a man speaking backwards. The reversed message is a portion of the letter that was sent to Grace Budd's parents as a corresponding note to her murder by American serial killer, [[Albert Fish]].

| After the first verse, at around 0:36. Never Die was a song on the band's first LP, and "Tiger Army Never Die" has since become the band's motto. The title of Tiger Army's third release, III: Ghost Tigers Rise was taken from this message as well.

The '''Madonna of Zahražany''' is a sculpture of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[Infant Jesus]] which comes from the former convent of the [[Sisters of the Magdalene Order]] in [[Most-Zahražany]] (1281-1442). It was created before 1380 and is on permanent display at the [[National Gallery in Prague]]
[[File:Madona ze Zahražan, Národní galerie v Praze.jpg|thumb|''Madonna of Zahražany'', [[National Gallery in Prague]]]]
== Description and context ==
The 84&amp;nbsp;cm tall sculpture is made of lime wood, with traces of the original polychromy. The strikingly S-shaped figure of the Madonna holds the [[Christ Child|Infant Jesus]] in her right arm. Putting his finger to his lips, [[Jesus]] symbolises the nuns’ vow of silence. The [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary’s]] garments fit closely around her body, accentuating its natural movement and, on the right-hand side, compositionally balancing the figure of the child. The drapery is elaborated into an intricate system of folds and combines transverse deep hollows and the complex pleating of the merging bottom edges of her clothes. The use of perspectival shortening and the downward views of both Mary and the Infant Jesus indicate that the sculpture was originally located on a high console or in the uppermost part of an altar.

The Madonna of Zahražany is related to several wooden ''Enthroned Madonnas'' of the 1370s (such as those from Hrádek and Konopiště) and also to the stone sculpture of the "Madonna of the Old Town Hall" in Prague (1380) and the triforium bust of [[Blanche of Valois]] that were made by the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] workshop. A figural type that corresponds with the Madonna of Zahražany appears in book painting ("The Gospel Book of Jan of Opava", 1368).&lt;ref&gt;Kutal A, 1970 p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The compositional scheme has a forerunner in the "[[Liber Viaticus]]" (1354–64) and is repeated in a number of murals ([[Karlštejn]], the [[Emmaus monastery]]) as well as in the figure of St Catherine in a panel painting from the [[Vyšší Brod Monastery|Cistercian monastery in Vyšší Brod]] (''Madonna between St Catherine and St Margaret'', c. 1360).&lt;ref&gt;Mudra A, 2004, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;

The Madonna of Zahražany is exceptional high-quality and stylistically well-defined carving that, in the context of Central European sculpture of the third quarter of the 14th century, has no parallel in other workshop pieces. It represents an important stage of development and a stylistic shift in Bohemian [[Gothic sculpture]] from the [[Madonna of Michle]] towards the Madonnas of the [[International Gothic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Mudra A, 2004, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Gibbon by Henry Walton cleaned.jpg|thumb|Edward Gibbon, by Henry Walton, 1773]]
'''''Memoirs of My Life and Writings''''' (1796) is an account of the historian [[Edward Gibbon]]'s life, compiled after his death by his friend [[John Baker Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]] from six fragmentary autobiographical works Gibbon wrote during his last years.  Lord Sheffield's editing has been praised for its ingenuity and taste, but blamed for its unscholarly aggressiveness.  Since 1896 several other editions of the work have appeared, more in accordance with modern standards.  Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' are considered one of the first autobiographies in the modern sense of the word, and have a secure place in the canon of English literature.

== Synopsis ==

Gibbon begins with an account of his ancestors before moving on to his birth and education, which was partly private and partly at [[Westminster School]].  He matriculated as a student at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], an institution which he found at a low ebb.
&lt;blockquote&gt;To the university of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen months at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]]; they proved the fourteen months the most idle and unprofitable of my whole life.{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=22}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of one of his tutors Gibbon says that he "well remembered that he had a salary to receive, and only forgot that he had a duty to perform."{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=27}}  Gibbon's father took alarm on learning that he had converted to Roman Catholicism and, in order to bring him back to the Protestant fold, sent him to live with a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister in [[Lausanne]].  Gibbon made good use of his time in [[Switzerland]], meeting [[Voltaire]] and other literary figures, and perfecting his command of the French language.  He also fell in love with a Swiss girl, [[Suzanne Curchod]], but his wish to marry her was implacably opposed by his father.  "I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son."{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=48}}  On returning to England he published his first work, the ''Essai sur l'étude de la littérature''.  The next major event Gibbon mentions was his taking a commission in the [[67th (South Hampshire) Regiment of Foot|Hampshire militia]], an experience which he tells us was later to be of advantage to him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The discipline and evolutions of a modern battalion gave me a clearer notion of the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] and the [[Roman legion|legion]]; and the captain of the Hampshire grenadiers (the reader may smile) has not been useless to the historian of the Roman empire.{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=62}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He then details his travels through France and on to Lausanne, where he formed a friendship with John Holroyd, later Lord Sheffield, which was to last for the rest of his life.  Gibbon crossed the Alps into Italy and eventually reached Rome.  He had for some time wanted to begin writing a history, without being able to choose a subject, but now, he tells us, the exciting experience of walking in the footsteps of the heroes of antiquity gave him a new idea:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the bare-footed friars were singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.{{sfn|Sheffield|1837|p=82}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After returning to England Gibbon engaged in several other literary exercises before finally beginning to write [[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|his Roman history]].  The ''Memoirs'' now give a detailed account of the years he spent producing its successive volumes, and of the many hostile criticisms his work attracted.  These labours were diversified by his experiences as a [[Member of Parliament]], and his writing, at the request of the Government, a "Mémoire justificatif" asserting the justice of [[France in the American Revolutionary War|British hostilities against France]] at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]].  During the course of writing the ''Decline and Fall'' Gibbon moved back to Lausanne.  Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' end with a survey of the factors he considered had combined to bring him a happy and productive life.

== Composition and manuscripts ==

Gibbon wrote a short account of his life in French in 1783.{{sfn|Bowersock|2009|p=47}} For five years he made no attempt to add to this, but in June 1788, one month after the last volumes of ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' were published, he began work on the ''Memoirs'' by writing to the [[College of Arms]] for information about his ancestry.  For the remaining years of his life he struggled with the task of recording his life in a satisfactory way, and his death in 1794 came before he could resolve the problem.  Six attempts at an autobiography have survived, conventionally identified by the letters '''A''' to '''F''':{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=188–189}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''A''': ''The Memoirs of the life of Edward Gibbon with various observations and excursions by himself'' (1788–1789).  40 [[quarto]] pages (6 missing).&lt;br/&gt;'''B''': ''My own Life'' (1788–1789).  72 quarto pages.  Describes the first 27 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''C''': ''Memoirs of the life and writings of Edward Gibbon'' (1789).  41 [[folio]] pages plus insert.  Describes the first 35 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''D''': [Untitled] (1790–1791).  13 folio pages.  Describing the first 35 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''E''': ''My own Life'' (c. 1792–1793).  19 folio pages of text, and twelve of notes.  Describing the first 54 years of his life.&lt;br/&gt;'''F''': [Untitled] (1792–1793).  41 folio pages of text, and 7 of notes.  Describing the first 16 years of his life.{{sfn|Smith|1989|p=29}}{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=189, 191}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the drafts of the work succeeded each other Gibbon in some passages varied the emphasis, and even changed the facts, but where he was satisfied with the words of the previous version he simply transcribed them.{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwardgibbonstudies.com/EG-MiscWorks5.htm |title=Edward Gibbon – Miscellaneous Works |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Edward Gibbon Studies |accessdate=11 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130914105442/http://www.edwardgibbonstudies.com/EG-MiscWorks5.htm |archivedate=14 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''E''' is the only version to cover his whole life, and perhaps the only one he wrote with a view to publication during his own lifetime,{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=209}} but it omits many things included in the other versions.  As he wrote to Lord Sheffield,
&lt;blockquote&gt;A man may state many things in a posthumous work, that he might not in another; the latter often checks the introduction of many curious thoughts and facts.{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=210}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Gibbon's struggles with his autobiography were ended by his death in 1794.  All six manuscripts then fell into the hands of his literary executor, Lord Sheffield, who used them to produce his own composite edition.  They remained undisturbed in the possession of his family, until in 1871 his son [[George Holroyd, 2nd Earl of Sheffield]], lent them to the medical writer [[William Alexander Greenhill]], who established their chronological order of composition and gave them the letters by which they are now always identified.  In 1895 the manuscripts were sold by the [[Henry Holroyd, 3rd Earl of Sheffield|3rd earl]] to the [[British Museum]], where they were bound together. They remain in the [[British Library]] as Add. MS. 34874.{{sfn|Bonnard|1964|p=207}}{{sfn|Smith|1989|pp=17, 29–30}}{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}

== Editing and publication ==

Attempting to bring the manuscripts into a publishable state, Lord Sheffield found himself in a quandary.  Of all the versions available to him, only '''E''' could be called a complete narrative of Gibbon's life up to the 1790s, yet this one was very short on detail, and by no means a substantial work.  The other manuscripts were more circumstantial, but all left the story unfinished.  His solution was to produce a composite version, taking passages or individual sentences from each, especially from '''F''', and shaping them into an artistically satisfying whole.{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=239}}  Choosing the title ''Memoirs of My Life and Writings'', he made the resulting work the centerpiece of a collection of inedited Gibboniana published in 1796 in two quarto volumes as ''[[Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon|Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon Esquire]]''.{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=7}}{{sfn|Gawthrop|1999|pp=196–197}}  The work was reprinted many times through the 19th century, and remained the only published form of Gibbon's autobiography until 1896, when the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] produced an edition giving the full text of all six manuscripts.{{sfn|Anon.|1897|p=210}}  Two years later the American scholar [[Oliver Farrar Emerson]] edited the manuscripts along similar lines.{{sfn|Bonnard|1964|p=207}}  In 1966 Georges Bonnard returned to Lord Sheffield’s plan of producing an [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|eclectic]] edition, though with far greater scholarly conscientiousness.{{sfn|Burgess|1966|p=521}}  The last major new edition of Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' was the work of [[Betty Radice]], and appeared in the Penguin English Library series in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Craddock |first1=Patricia B. |authorlink1=Patricia Craddock |title=Edward Gibbon: A Reference Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=4ZYnUpSXK5CXhQeD7oAw&amp;id=yoXgAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22memoirs+of+my+life%22+gibbon+radice+bonnard&amp;q=radice+harmondsworth#search_anchor |accessdate=11 September 2013 |year=1987 |publisher=G. K. Hall |location=Boston |isbn=0816182175 |page=427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

So high is the critical repute of Gibbon's ''Memoirs'' that ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature|The Cambridge History of English Literature]]'' declared it had "by general consent…established itself as one of the most fascinating books of its class in English literature".{{sfn|Ward|1913|p=299}}  One reason for this is the candour and openness with which Gibbon speaks of himself.  "Few men, I believe," Lord Sheffield wrote, "have ever so fully unveiled their own character".{{sfn|Fenton|2006}}  Again, Gibbon broke new ground in making it a truly "philosophical", that is to say analytical, autobiography; as the novelist [[Anthony Burgess]] wrote, "the sense of intellectual control, of a life somehow grasped as a concept, is unmatched".{{sfn|Burgess|1966|p=521}}  It is widely held that Gibbon's ''Memoirs'', along with the ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], brought the modern autobiography into being.{{sfn|Carnochan|1987|p=4}}{{sfn|Fenton|2006}}

In recent years much has been written by critics on Gibbon's failure to reach a final recension of his autobiography.  It has been explained in various ways: as a sign of Gibbon's wrestling with difficulties of literary form; as a result of disagreements between Gibbon and Sheffield as to how far the ''Memoirs'' should follow [[Edmund Burke]]'s interpretation of the [[French Revolution]]; or in psychoanalytic terms as the reflection of an uncertainty in Gibbon's mind as to his own identity.{{sfn|Womersley|2002|pp=207–240}}

When, with the publication of Murray's edition, it became possible to judge Sheffield's role in conflating the different versions of the ''Memoirs'', some critics accorded him praise moderated by their shock at finding how large a part he had played.  The historian [[Frederic Harrison]]'s opinion was that he had performed his task with "great skill and tact, but with the most daring freedom";{{sfn|Ward|1913|p=299}} and an anonymous writer in the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' said of Sheffield that
&lt;blockquote&gt;with an ingenuity which, in spite of its perversity, cannot but be admired, he concocted out of the six [manuscripts] a patchwork narrative, which has since always passed as Gibbon's autobiography. In reality it was nothing of the kind, and should have been called not ''Gibbon's Autobiography'' but ''Selections from the Autobiographical Remains of Edward Gibbon''.{{sfn|Anon.|1987|p=210}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
20th and 21st centuries critical opinions of Sheffield's work as an editor have diverged widely.  In 1913 the ''Cambridge History of English Literature'' called it "extraordinarily skillful", and in the 1960s Anthony Burgess wrote of "Six holograph sketches, out of which Lord Sheffield stitched not a patchwork but a tasteful and well-fitting suit of clothes."{{sfn|Ward|1913|p=299}}{{sfn|Burgess|1966|p=521}}  The academic W. B. Carnochan called Sheffield's editing "brilliant though high-handed",{{sfn|Carnochan|1987|p=125}} and pointed out that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Were it not for his unremitting labors, we would not think of Gibbon as having written a great autobiography; rather, we would think of him as a historian who tried to write an autobiography but failed.{{sfn|Carnochan|1987|p=4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The academic David Womersley has written in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' that Sheffield did the job "With equal judgement, freedom, and shrewdness", but elsewhere he has conceded that "From our standpoint…Sheffield's handling of Gibbon’s manuscript was scandalous.".{{sfn|Womersley|2004–2013}}{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=362}}  This last judgement has been endorsed by the historian [[Glen Bowersock]], while the Gibbon scholar Jane Elizabeth Norton said that "By all the standards of scholarship, Lord Sheffield's conduct was deplorable."{{sfn|Bowersock|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Womersley|2002|p=362}}

'''Music licensing''' is the [[license]]d use of [[copyright]]ed [[music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scherer|first1=Dana A.|title=Money for Something: Music Licensing in the 21st Century|date=January 19, 2016|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43984.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Music licensing is intended to ensure that the owners of copyrights on musical works are compensated for certain uses of their work. A purchaser has limited rights to use the work without a separate agreement.

==Definitions==
The following words and phrases appear in discussion of music licensing:
;license : the right, granted by the copyright holder or his/her agent, for the broadcast, recreation, or performance of a copyrighted work. Types of licensing contracts can include: 1) a flat fee for a defined period of usage, or 2) royalty payments determined by the number of copies of the work sold or the total revenues acquired as a result of its distribution. In addition to a basic fee, most music licensing agreements require additional payments to the copyright owner when the work in which it is included (movie, play) is financially successful above a certain threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rMFSUTNWRzgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=music+licensing&amp;ots=RJTlocjJkp&amp;sig=JtOtE3R0_M2oAOLUrSUOyxyWEns#v=onepage&amp;q=music%20licensing&amp;f=false |title=Kohn on music licensing - Al Kohn, Bob Kohn - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2002-01-15 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
;licensor : the owner of the licensed work
;licensee : the person or entity to whom the work is licensed
;performance : the public performance of a musical piece, whether live or recorded, performed by the original artist or someone else, whether the performance keeps to the original version or is adapted or changed in some manner. Playing a music CD (or tape, etc.) in public is "performing" the work. 
;broadcast : playing live or recorded works, including radio, TV, [[webcasting]], [[podcasting]], etc., to multiple listeners in a setting such as a bar or bookstore. (Using that definition and the previous one leads to phrases like 'live broadcast performance'.)
;performing rights organization : large companies that hold performance rights for copyrighted musical works. The best-known are [[ASCAP|American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP), [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI), [[SESAC|Society of European Stage Authors and Composers]] (SESAC), and La Asociación de Compositores y Editores de Música Latinoamericana (The Association of Composers and Publishers of Latin American Music, ACEMLA),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acemla.com/ Retrieved 2014-12-30&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK, the [[PRS for Music]], and [[Phonographic Performance Limited]] for licensing recordings and music videos. The companies license public performance on a nonexclusive basis of the music they own or hold under contract using a complex weighting formula to distribute the fees to the respective rights holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain |first=Marshall |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/music-licensing3.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "How Music Licensing Works" |publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com |date=2003-08-22 |accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license may be a blanket license, but individual licenses may be negotiated.

Rights organizations sample radio and television broadcasts, offer blanket licenses to broadcasters, and investigate complaints to detect and prevent unauthorized performances.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the history of the origin and practices of ASCAP, see Jeff Lunden, Collecting Money for Songwriters, A 100-Year Tug of War, NPR (Feb. 13, 2014); https://www.npr.org/2014/02/13/275920416/collecting-money-for-songwriters-a-100-year-tug-of-war; Retrieved Jan. 5, 2015. A less flattering view of the practices of such organizations can be found in Harvey Reid, ASCAP &amp; BMI – Protectors of Artists or Shadowy Thieves? http://www.woodpecker.com/writing/essays/royalty-politics.html; Retrieved Jan. 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, ASCAP and BMI hire field agents to monitor public performances. The field agents may act as agents for the organization, negotiating a fee for a blanket license, but individuals may negotiate directly with the organization. The fee may be presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, but in case of disagreement, the fee may be appealed to the Federal District Court in the Southern District of New York.

;pre-cleared music: music that is covered under a prior agreement allowing distribution and legal use under specific circumstances. The license may be for use in film, video, television (commercials and programs), Internet, events in live venues, video games and multimedia productions.
;copyright : literally, 'the right to copy.' The owner of a [[copyright]] has five exclusive rights: reproduction (copying), preparing derivative works (adaptation), distributing copies to the public, performing the work publicly, and displaying the work in public. Prior to 1886, no effective international law of copyright existed. The first major international copyright law conventions were the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] created in 1886. In the US, for works created in 1977 and after the work is protected by copyright when it is "fixed in any tangible medium of expression," without the need to register it with the US Copyright Office.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §102(a)&lt;/ref&gt; A work must be registered, however, before a copyright owner may bring suit for infringement.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 411(a)&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[synchronization rights|synchronization licensing]] : the licensing of musical works to be synchronized with moving pictures as background in a motion picture, television program, video, DVD, etc.
;master use licensing: the licensing of the recording of a musical work to be performed as a soundtrack, bumper, lead-in or background to a motion picture.
;publisher : for the purposes of copyright, a publisher is the owner of the copyrighted work. It is now standard practice for songwriters of even the slightest prominence to form a publishing company as a separate legal entity to hold the rights to their work. Continued use of the, now somewhat anachronistic, term "publisher" reflects the state of media at the time of the Berne Convention, when all music distribution was done on paper as sheet music or player piano rolls.

==Broadcasting==

Broadcasting, in the context of music licensing, means the playback of recorded or live music for groups of people beyond what might be normally expected in a social setting. Legal claims are filed frequently against bookstores, bars, and live music venues that broadcast music without first obtaining a performance license.

The music broadcast in grocery stores and elevators is a service purchased from one of many organizations that offer it (the largest is [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]]). Part of the fee paid for the service is used to cover licensing costs. Except in very narrowly defined circumstances, noted below under the Section 110 "small business exception," a business, restaurant, or store that plays radio broadcasts or shows TV programs in the premises does not pay a licensing fee.

Radio stations pay fees to licensing bodies for nonexclusive rights to broadcast music.  Radio stations and businesses typically pay a flat rate once a year, called a blanket license, which can vary based on the size of the audience, value of the advertising revenues, and amount and nature of music usage. As part of the license contract a radio station may conduct periodic audits of the music being played, with the audit results submitted to the licensing body.

==Home video==

Licensing issues are encountered when [[television]] shows or [[films]] using [[copyrighted]] music are released on [[DVD]] format.

When a song is cleared for usage on a TV show, historically to save money, the clearance typically applies only to television airings of the show in question. Thus, when the show is considered for DVD distribution to the home video market, the rights to the song must be renegotiated in order for the song in question to be included on the DVD. Most producers/production companies now include the rights for DVDs or "all media now known or hereafter devised," which assures production companies of the right to re-release without incurring additional licensing fees.

If the process of clearing the rights to the song is prohibitively expensive for the home video distributor, or clearance is refused by the copyright holders of the original song, the affected song is either replaced with a similar one, or the footage containing the copyrighted song is edited out. In a few cases, television shows, with extensive use of copyrighted music whose cost of "after-market" licensing is high, are withheld from release on DVD; notable examples include ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[Third Watch]]'' (beyond its first two seasons), and ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', some of which were eventually released after long delays. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/articles/holdup.cfm  - The "What's The Hold-up?"

== Live performance ==

With certain exceptions, live performances must be licensed. In the US, the owner of a bar, cafe, or restaurant who wants to have live music usually will obtain a blanket license from ASCAP or BMI to play musical selections which they control. If a license is obtained from one company but not the other, only the music from that company may be performed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barbusinessowner.com/public/Music-Licensing-for-Bars-and-Restaurants.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; The Association for Concert Bands (ACB)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acbands.org/&lt;/ref&gt; offers a blanket license to community bands that covers both ASCAP and BMI lists. At the end of the year, the band completes a spreadsheet showing how often each song was played during the year, which the ACB submits to the rights organizations.

== Performance Licensing ==
Purchasing a copy of the sheet music for a copyrighted work does not give the purchaser the right to perform the music. A separate performance license must be obtained. Someone who listens to a piece of music and learns to play it must obtain a performance license before performing it in public in a commercial setting. A new arrangement for a copyrighted work is a derivative work.

Permission of the rights holder is required before the work may be published, copied, or performed in public. (There now may be two copyrights, one on the original work and a second copyright on the "new" material contributed by the arranger.) An arrangement of a traditional song or piece of music will be protected by copyright even if the original piece is in the public domain. Every new arrangement receives a copyright.&lt;ref&gt;ASCAP has over 40 arrangements of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata under license, and nearly 80 versions of Row, Row, Row Your Boat. Harvey Reid, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some exceptions to the requirement for a performance license. One set of exceptions come under the [[Fair use]] doctrine. Another set of exceptions are situations covered under Section 110 of the copyright statute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110 and http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#110&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fair use exemption ===

The fair use exemption is an ill-defined, fact-based doctrine, decided by courts on a case-by-case basis. It has very limited applicability in the area of music performance and makes a weak defense in an infringement case. The use of a copyrighted work "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright." &lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 107&lt;/ref&gt; There is no way in which the public, unlicensed performance of an entire piece of music can be brought under the protection of Section 107. In spite of folk wisdom to the contrary, there is no "three second rule" for copying or sampling recorded music. There is no rule that "four notes" can be copied without penalty. Instances under the fair use exception might include criticism or comment. Criticism need not be negative: if a jazz soloist quotes a phrase from a well-known solo by another player, it might be viewed as an homage.&lt;ref&gt;However, see Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc., 585 F.3d 267 (6th Cir. 2009), in which the court rejected the "fair use" argument that the use of music sampling was an "homage" to the original recording.&lt;/ref&gt; Music sampling has been aggressively pursued by copyright holders as a form of "free riding" but might be interpreted as a transformative use.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Rinkerman, Sampling Unleashed? Migrating Visual Art Fair Use Principles Into the Music Space. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2540345. Accessed Jan. 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Section 110 exemptions ===

Section 110 sets out eleven situations in which performance of a work, including broadcast, "are not infringements of copyright" &lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110; available at https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/110&lt;/ref&gt; The major exemptions are outlined in paragraphs 1 to 5. Paragraphs 1 and 2 cover face-to-face instruction, or "distance learning," in non-profit educational settings. Paragraph 3 applies to performance or display in religious settings as part of a worship service. Paragraph 4 applies to non-dramatic literary or musical works (but not plays or video) performed by non-profit groups such as a community band or orchestra. Paragraph 5 is the "small business" exemption.

A performance license need not be obtained if the work is performed or displayed "by instructors or pupils in the course of face-to-face teaching activities of a nonprofit educational institution."&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

A film shown as part of a fundraiser, or a film series might not qualify as "face-to-face teaching activities." Instruction given to corporate or government employees would not qualify as a "nonprofit educational institution."

Paragraph 2 creates a similar exemption for distance learning. A work may be performed or displayed through transmission to students enrolled in a course, or to government employees as part of their duties, without requiring a performance license.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C.§ 110(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption does not apply to works produced and sold for online distance learning. The performance or display must be made under the direction of the instructor and directly related to, and in aid of, what is being taught: it cannot be used as a pretext for transmission of other works. Nondramatic literary or musical works may be performed in their entirety. For other works, such as display of a film or painting, the performance must be "reasonable and limited." The exemption applies only to distance learning that is part of scheduled classes. Works that are simply posted by an instructor would not be protected. The educational institution must meet certain additional conditions. It must provide information to faculty, students, and relevant staff members describing US copyright law and promoting compliance. For digital transmissions, the institution must take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized retention or further distribution of copies of the work such as not interfering with any technological means the copyright owner may have used to prevent copying.

Paragraph 3 creates an exemption for performance of nondramatic literary works, musical works, or dramatico-musical works of a religious nature, or display of a work, as part of religious services at a place of worship or religious assembly.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. 110 § 110(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 110 (4) creates an exemption for non-profit groups for performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work (but not a play or an opera) if four conditions are met:
	1) the work may be performed but may not be transmitted to the public,
	2) none of the performers, organizers, or promoters are paid,
	3) there is no direct or indirect commercial advantage, and,
	4) there is no admission charge, ''or'', after deducting for reasonable expenses the proceeds are used exclusively for educational, religious, or charitable purposes.
	The last condition may not be met if the copyright owner has objected by serving written notice to the performing organization which conforms to requirements outlined in the statute.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(4)((B)(i through iii)&lt;/ref&gt; A performance by a non-profit may be recorded and the recording may be privately shared.  But posting the recording on a public service such as YouTube constitutes "transmission" within the terms of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The recording is "transmitted" when it is posted, whether or not anyone ever plays it.&lt;ref&gt;In re Cellco Partnership, SDNY 2009, 663 F.Supp.2d 363, 92 USPQ 2d 1113.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not a trivial consideration.  Popular cell phone apps, such as Shazam, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.shazam.com/ Last checked 10/17/17.&lt;/ref&gt; and other readily available programs make it possible to automate identification of music posted on public sites.

Paragraph 5 is the "small business exemption," which allows bars, cafes, and restaurants to play the radio or show television programming as "background" in their business. It does not authorize playing recorded music such as using a CD player, or live musical performances.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(5); Todd B. Tatelman, Copyright Law’s ‘Small Business Exception": Public Performance Exemptions for Certain Establishments. CRS Report RS21107, http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/crsreports/crsdocuments/rs21107.pdf, updated December 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption covers reception of a public transmission on a single receiving apparatus of a kind commonly used in the home if no direct charge is made and the performance is not further transmitted to the public. Very specific limitations are outlined in the statute, such as number of loudspeakers permitted and square footage of the establishment.

A governmental body, or a nonprofit agricultural or horticultural organization, may perform nondramatic musical works in the course of an annual agricultural or horticultural fair without obtaining a performance license.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(6)&lt;/ref&gt;

A public vending establishment may perform nondramatic musical works to promote the sale of copies of the work if there is no admission charge. The performance may not be transmitted beyond the immediate area the sale occurs.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(7)&lt;/ref&gt;

A nondramatic literary work may be performed or transmitted to blind persons or other handicapped persons who are unable to read normal printed material, or to deaf or other handicapped persons who are unable to hear the aural signals accompanying a transmission of visual signals if the performance is made without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage and the transmission is made through the facilities of a governmental body, a non-commercial educational broadcast station, a "subcarrier" of an FM broadcast station or a cable system.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(8)&lt;/ref&gt;

A single performance of a dramatic literary work may be transmitted specifically for the blind or other handicapped persons if the work was published at least 10 years before the date of the performance, there is no direct or indirect commercial advantage, and the transmission is made through an FM radio subcarrier as defined in paragraph 8.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §110(9)&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of a nondramatic literary or musical work in the course of a social function organized and promoted by a nonprofit veterans’ organization or a nonprofit fraternal organization is exempt. Social functions of college or university sororities or fraternities are not included under the exemption unless the social function is held solely to raise funds for a specific charitable purpose.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(10)&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 11 permits muting or skipping limited portions of the audio or video portions of a motion picture which is transmitted to a household for private viewing. Creating or providing a computer program which facilitates muting or skipping is also permitted, provided no alteration is made in the content, and provided no fixed copy of the altered version is created.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 110(11)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Happy Birthday to You"==
The song "[[Happy Birthday to You]]" is one of the best known songs in the world and generated over $2 million in royalties each year for its purported copyright owners even though the copyright has now been ruled invalid.  In September 2015, a judge ruled that the copyright was invalid, and on February 8, 2016, [[Warner/Chappell Music]]  agreed to settle a class action lawsuit brought to challenge these fees. After mediation, Warner will pay more than $14 million to the "thousands of people and entities" who had paid licensing fees to use the song since 1949, plus $4.6 million to attorneys for the plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/021216/happy-birthday-you-belongs-everyone-now.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==ASCAP and Girl Scouts==
In 1995,  [http://www.ascap.com/ The American Society of Composers(ASCAP)] ordered [[American Camp Association|The American Camping Association]] to pay royalties for campfire songs sung at any of their 2300 camps. Girl Scout camps were included in the request, but only a small number of Girl Scout camps actually paid the $250 agreed upon yearly fee. The ''New York Times'' reported, "Among the 256 Girl Scout camps on its list, 16 did."&lt;ref name="nytimes-19961217-1"/&gt; In March 1996, ASCAP sent letters to the Girl Scouts to pay copy right fees for campfire songs written or published by ASCAP sung in "public performance."&lt;ref name="nytimes-19961217-2"/&gt; ASCAP  expected to be paid license fees for any of the  4 million songs included list sung publicly.

The songs on this list include "Puff the Magic Dragon" and "This Land is your land."&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;

In August 1996, The ''Wall Street Journal'' published a frontpage article, "Ascap Cautions the Girl Scouts: Don't Sing 'God Bless America,'" describing the scene at Diablo Day Camp in [[Lafayette, California]], as a troupe of Girl Scouts danced to the ''[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]'' in silence for fear of copyright infringement.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; A public relations situation for ASCAP occurred, as the video performance of Girl Scouts silently dancing made its way onto mainstream news.

ASCAP confronted the Girl Scouts because of the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], which established that any song used in public performance would be able to receive royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins III|first1=Julien H.|title=When in Doubt, Do Without: Licensing Public Performances By nonprofit Camping or Volunteer Service Organizations Under Federal Copyright Law|journal=Washington University Law Review|date=1997|volume=75|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Journal'' describes the law as this: "The law defines a public performance as 'where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.'"

ASCAP quickly sent a press statement claiming that it never intended on receiving royalties and ''has never brought nor threatened to bring suit against the Girl Scouts.''&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; ASCAP promised to reimburse any Girl Scout camp for the royalty fees that they may have paid. It was also reported that "in 1940 [[Irving Berlin]] had donated all future royalties from "God Bless America" to the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts." &lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt;

By September 1996, Girl Scout executives in New York said they believed "this unfortunate situation is resolved."&lt;ref name="nytimes-19961217-2"/&gt;

[[File:OnceOnATime.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]])]]
'''''Once On A Time''''' is a [[fairy tale]] created by [[A. A. Milne]].

Written in 1917, Milne's own introduction begins 'This is an odd book', and indeed it is very difficult to classify.  Ostensibly a typical fairytale, it tells the story of the war between the kingdoms of Euralia and Barodia and the political shenanigans which take place in Euralia in the king's absence, all supposedly rewritten by Milne from the writings of the fictional historian "Roger Scurvilegs".

Milne created the story to contain believable, three-dimensional characters, rather than the stereotypes which will satisfy children. Hence the book introduces us to a princess who is far from helpless; a prince who, whilst handsome, is also pompous and vain; an enchantment which is almost entirely humorous; a villain who is not entirely villainous and receives no real comeuppance; a good king who is not always good; an evil king who is not always evil, and so on.  The result is a book which children may not enjoy as much as adults.

The book was written by Milne partly for his wife, upon whom the character of the Countess Belvane was partially based.

==Plot summary==

When the King of Barodia receives a pair of [[seven-league boots]] as a birthday present, his habit of flying over the King of Euralia's castle during breakfast provokes a series of incidents which escalate into war.  While the King of Euralia is away, his daughter Hyacinth tries to rule in his stead and counter the machiavellian ambitions of the king's favourite, the Countess Belvane.

==Characters==

'''King Merriwig of Euralia''':  fat, jolly if occasionally pompous and easily led.  He nevertheless can show great strength of mind, as related in an anecdote in which he outwitted a fairy, mostly by sheer stubbornness.

'''Princess Hyacinth''':  Merriwig's daughter.  Rather more savvy than her father, she is nevertheless at first out of her depth when trying to rule the kingdom in his absence.  Despite this, she grows into the role.

'''The King of Barodia''':  Bombastic, proud and arrogant, and takes inordinate pride in his moustache.

'''The Countess Belvane''':  A difficult character.  Beautiful, proud and haughty, she is inclined to melodramatics and emotional self-indulgence.  Ostensibly the villain of the piece, her motives are complex and subtle.

'''Lady Wiggs''':  Hyacinth's closest friend;  helpful and dreamy.

'''Lady Woggs''':  A palace servant;  well-meaning but terribly dim.

'''Prince Udo of Araby''':  Prince of a neighbouring realm, invited by Hyacinth to help her in her troubles with Belvane.  He turns out to be very little help at all, partly due to suffering an embarrassing enchantment, but mostly due to his personality.

'''Coronel''':  Udo's companion-at-arms and best friend.  Far more laid-back and likeable than the prince.

'''Roger Scurvilegs''':  Noted historian of Euralia, author of the monumental work ''Euralia Past and Present''.  The narrator gives him credit for the basic facts of the story whilst gently lampooning him for his stuffiness.

==Themes and issues==

Milne himself resisted characterising the book.  In his foreword to the 1922 edition he wrote of it:

"For whom, then, is the book intended?  That is the trouble. Unless I can say, "For those, young or old, who like the things which I like," I find it difficult to answer. Is it a children's book? Well, what do we mean by that? Is ''[[Wind in the willows|The Wind in the Willows]]'' a children's book? Is ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]''? Is ''[[Treasure Island]]''? These are masterpieces which we read with pleasure as children, but with how much more pleasure when we are grown-up. In any case, what do we mean by "children"? A boy of three, a girl of six, a boy of ten, a girl of fourteen - are they all to like the same thing? And is a book "suitable for a boy of twelve" any more likely to please a boy of twelve than a modern novel is likely to please a man of thirty-seven;  even if the novel be described truly as "suitable for a man of thirty-seven"? I confess that I cannot grapple with these difficult problems.  But I am very sure of this: that no one can write a book which children will like, unless he write it for himself first. That being so, I shall say boldly that this is a story for grown-ups. [...]  But, as you see, I am still finding it difficult to explain just what sort of book it is. Perhaps no explanation is necessary. Read in it what you like; read it to whomever you like;  be of what age you like; it can only fall into one of the two classes. Either you will enjoy it, or you won't.

"It is that sort of book.&lt;ref&gt;Milne, A.A.: "Once On A Time" pp vi-viii, 1922 US ed. published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap (New York)&lt;/ref&gt;".

'''Pericles' Funeral Oration''' is a famous speech from [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.34–2.46. Greek [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0199%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D34 text] and English [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D34 translation] thereof available online at the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was delivered by [[Pericles]], an eminent Athenian politician, at the end of the first year of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404 BC) as a part of the annual public [[funeral]] for the war dead.

== Background ==
{{main|Funeral oration (ancient Greece)}}

It was an established Athenian practice by the late 5th century to hold a public funeral in honour of all those who had died in war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.34.1–6. See also [[Plato]], ''[[Menexenus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the dead&lt;ref&gt;The bodies of the dead were cremated soon after death. The bones were kept for the funeral at the end of the year.&lt;/ref&gt; were left in a tent for three days so that offerings could be made. Then a funeral procession was held, with ten cypress coffins carrying the remains, one for each of the Athenian [[Phyle|tribes]], and another for the remains that could not be identified. Finally they were buried at a public grave (at [[Kerameikos]]). The last part of the ceremony was a speech delivered by a prominent Athenian citizen.

Several funeral orations from classical Athens are still extant, which seem to corroborate [[Thucydides]]' assertion that this was a regular feature of Athenian funerary custom in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;The funeral orations of [[Lysias]], [[Demosthenes]], and [[Hyperides]]. Additionally [[Plato]] authored a possibly satirical version of a funeral oration, the ''[[Menexenus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Funeral Oration'' was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his famous ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Although Thucydides records the speech in the first person as if it were a word for word record of what [[Pericles]] said, there can be little doubt that he edited the speech at the very least.  Thucydides says early in his ''History'' that the speeches presented are not verbatim records, but are intended to represent the main ideas of what was said and what was, according to Thucydides, "called for in the situation".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 1.22.1.&lt;/ref&gt;  We can be reasonably sure that [[Pericles]] delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war, but there is no consensus as to what degree Thucydides' record resembles Pericles' actual speech.&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography on this topic is enormous.  See {{cite book|last=Ziolkowski|first=John|title=Thucydides and the Tradition of Funeral Speeches at Athens|isbn=0-405-14057-6|publisher=Arno Press|year=1981}}, {{cite book|last=Loraux|first=Nicole|title=The Invention of Athens|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another confusing factor is that Pericles is known to have delivered another funeral oration in 440 BC during the [[Samian War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Pericles]]'', 28.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that elements of both speeches are represented in Thucydides' version.  Nevertheless, Thucydides was extremely meticulous in his documentation, and records the varied certainty of his sources each time.  Significantly he begins recounting the speech by saying: "Περικλῆς ὁ Ξανθίππου ... ἔλεγε ''τοιάδε''", i.e. "Pericles, son of Xanthippos, spoke ''like'' this".  Had he quoted the speech verbatim, he would have written "τάδε" ("this", or "these words") instead of "τοιάδε" ("like this" or "words like these").

== Content of the speech ==

The Funeral Oration is significant because it differs from the usual form of Athenian funeral speeches.&lt;ref&gt;On the degree of departure, see {{cite book|last=Ziolkowski|first=John|title=Thucydides and the Tradition of Funeral Speeches at Athens|isbn=0-405-14057-6|publisher=Arno Press|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Cartwright describes it as "a eulogy of Athens itself...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartwright|first=David|title=A Historical Commentary On Thucydides|isbn=0-472-08419-4|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech glorifies Athens' achievements, designed to stir the spirits of a state still at war.

=== Proemium (2.35) ===

The speech begins by praising the custom of the public funeral for the dead, but criticises the inclusion of the speech, arguing that the "reputations of many brave men" should "not be imperilled in the mouth of a single individual".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.35.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Pericles argues that the speaker of the oration has the impossible task of satisfying the associates of the dead, who would wish that their deeds be magnified, while everyone else might feel jealous and suspect exaggeration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.35.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Praise of the dead in war (2.36–2.42) ===

Pericles begins by praising the dead, as the other Athenian funeral orations do, by regard the ancestors of present-day Athenians (2.36.1–2.36.3), touching briefly on the [[Delian League|acquisition of the empire]].

At this point, however, Pericles departs most dramatically from the example of other Athenian funeral orations and skips over the great martial achievements of Athens' past: "That part of our history which tells of the military achievements which gave us our several possessions, or of the ready valour with which either we or our fathers stemmed the tide of Hellenic or foreign aggression, is a theme too familiar to my hearers for me to dwell upon, and I shall therefore pass it by."&lt;ref name="T2_36_4"&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.36.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Pericles proposes to focus on "the road by which we reached our position, the form of government under which our greatness grew, and the national habits out of which it sprang".&lt;ref name="T2_36_4"/&gt; This amounts to a focus on present-day Athens; Thucydides' Pericles thus decides to praise the war dead by glorifying the city for which they died.

==== The greatness of Athens ====

"If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences...if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our neighbour for doing what he likes..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.37.1–2.37.2.&lt;/ref&gt; These lines form the roots of the famous phrase "[[equal justice under law]]." The liberality of which Pericles spoke also extended to Athens' foreign policy: "We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien acts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing, although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our liberality..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.39.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Athens' values of equality and openness do not, according to Pericles, hinder Athens' greatness, indeed, they enhance it, "...advancement in public life falls to reputations for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit...our ordinary citizens, though occupied with the pursuits of industry, are still fair judges of public matters...at Athens we live exactly as we please, and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.37.1, 2.40.2, 2.39.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the climax of his praise of Athens, Pericles declares: "In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas; while I doubt if the world can produce a man, who, where he has only himself to depend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a versatility as the Athenian."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.41.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Pericles links his praise of the city to the dead Athenians for whom he is speaking, "...for the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the heroism of these and their like have made her...none of these men allowed either wealth with its prospect of future enjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of freedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger. No, holding that vengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal blessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they joyfully determined to accept the risk... Thus, choosing to die resisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from dishonour..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]],'' 2.42.2, 2.42.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion seems inevitable: "Therefore, having judged that to be happy means to be free, and to be free means to be brave, do not shy away from the risks of war". With the linkage of Athens' greatness complete, Pericles moves to addressing his audience.

=== Praise for the military of Athens ===
In his speech, Pericles states that he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the citizens of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers whom he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/pericles-funeralspeech.asp|title=Thucydides (c. 460/455–c. 399 BCE): Pericles' Funeral Oration  from the Peloponnesian War (Book 2.34-46)|last=Thucydides|first=|date=August 2000|website=Ancient History Sourcebook: Thucydides (c. 460/455–c. 399 BCE): Pericles' Funeral Oration from the Peloponnesian War (Book 2.34–46)|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians.&lt;ref name="Internet History Sourcebooks"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/pericles-funeralspeech.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt in the mind of the doubtful.&lt;ref name="Internet History Sourcebooks"/&gt; He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen.&lt;ref name="Internet History Sourcebooks"/&gt; He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.&lt;ref name="Internet History Sourcebooks"/&gt;

=== Exhortation to the living (2.43–2.44) ===

Pericles then turns to the audience and exhorts them to live up to the standards set by the deceased, "So died these men as becomes Athenians. You, their survivors, must determine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field, though you may pray that it may have a happier outcome."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]], ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', 2.43.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epilogue (2.45–2.46) ===

Pericles ends with a short epilogue, reminding the audience of the difficulty of the task of speaking over the dead. The audience is then dismissed.

== Language and translations ==

Thucydides' [[Classical Greek|Greek]] is notoriously difficult, but the language of ''Pericles Funeral Oration'' is considered by many to be the most difficult and virtuosic passage in the ''History of the Peloponnesian War''.{{Citation needed|reason=This sentence refers to many considering it to be the most difficult, but no specific translators or scholars with this opinion are mentioned.|date=December 2013}} The speech is full of [[rhetorical devices]], such as [[antithesis]], [[anacoluthon]], [[asyndeton]], [[anastrophe]], [[hyperbaton]], and others; most famously the rapid succession of [[proparoxytone]] words beginning with ''e'' ("τὸ εὔδαιμον τὸ ἐλεύθερον, τὸ δ' ἐλεύθερον τὸ εὔψυχον κρίναντες" [judging courage freedom and freedom happiness]) at the climax of the speech (43.4). The style is deliberately elaborate, in accord with the stylistic preference associated with the [[sophists]]. There are several different [[History of the Peloponnesian War#Translations|English translations of the speech]] available.

== Modern parallels of the Pericles' Funeral Oration ==

[[American Civil War]] scholars Louis Warren and [[Garry Wills]] have addressed the parallels of Pericles' funeral oration to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s famous [[Gettysburg Address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Louis Warren, "Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address: An Evaluation" (Charles E. Merrill Publishing Co. 1946), p. 18 |url=https://archive.org/details/abrahamlincolns0warr }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garry Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'' (New York: Simon and Schuster 1992) pp. 182, 212 and appendix IIIb. {{ISBN|0-671-76956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = McPherson | first = James | title = The Art of Abraham Lincoln | journal = The New York Review of Books | volume = 39 | issue = 13 | date = July 16, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's speech, like Pericles': 
* Begins with an acknowledgement of revered predecessors: "Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent..."
* Praises the uniqueness of the State's commitment to [[democracy]]: "..a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal...government of the people, by the people, and for the people..."
* Addresses the difficulties faced by a speaker on such an occasion, "...we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground"
* Exhorts the survivors to emulate the deeds of the dead, "It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the great task remaining before us"
* Contrasts the efficacy of words and deeds, "The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract...The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New York Review of Books: The Art of Abraham Lincoln |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2852 |accessdate=2005-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708235652/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2852 |archivedate=July 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is uncertain to what degree, if any, Lincoln was directly influenced by ''Pericles' Funeral Oration''. Wills never claims that Lincoln drew on it as a source, though [[Edward Everett]], who delivered a lengthy oration at the same ceremony at Gettysburg, began by describing the "Athenian example".&lt;ref&gt;Garry Wills, ''Lincoln at Gettysburg'' (New York: Simon and Schuster 1992) {{ISBN|0-671-76956-1}} pp. 41–42, appendix IIIa.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Samut khoi''''' ({{lang-th|สมุดข่อย}}, {{IPA-th|sā.mùt kʰɔ̀j|pron}}; {{lang-lo|ສະໝຸດຂ່ອຍ}}; "''khoi'' books") or '''''samut thai''''' ({{lang-th|สมุดไทย|links=no}}, {{IPA-th|sā.mùt tʰāj|}}) are a type of folding-book [[manuscript]] which were historically widely used in many buddhist cultures, including [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Thailand]], as well as in [[Myanmar]], where they are known as ''[[parabaik]]''. The techniques used in their production came probably from the ancient kingdom of Ceylon (today's Sri Lanka). They are usually made with the paper of the [[Streblus asper|Siamese rough bush]] or ''khoi'' tree, and are not [[Bookbinding|bound]] like Western books but are folded in an accordion style. ''Samut khoi'' are made either with black paper (in Thailand known as ''samut thai dam''), or with white paper (''samut thai khao''). The use of ''samut khoi'' in Thailand dates to the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Paper|publisher=Nakorn Phanom National Library (Thailand)|url=http://www.finearts.go.th/nakhonphanomlibrary/parameters/km/item/ตำนานกระดาษ}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually used for secular texts including royal chronicles, legal documents and works of literature, while [[palm-leaf manuscript]]s were more commonly used for religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=สมุดข่อย และคัมภีร์ใบลาน กรุสมบัติจากบรรพชน|trans-title=''Samut khoi'' and palm-leaf manuscipts: treasure troves from our ancestors|url=http://www.ayutthayastudies.aru.ac.th/content/view/627/32/ |publisher=Ayutthaya Studies Institute, Ayutthaya Rajabhat University|accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book: A Global History|chapter=Southeast Asia (2): The Mainland |first=Jana |last=Igunma |editor-first1=Michael F.|editor-last1=Suarez|editor-first2=H.

== Khmer paper books ==
Paper books has a long history in the [[Khmer Empire]], predating the Ayutthaya Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The paper used for the Khmer books, known as ''kraing'', was made from the bark of the [[mulberry]] tree. In what we now know as Cambodia, the ''kraing'' literature was stored in pagodas across the country. During the [[Cambodian civil war]] and the subsequent [[Democratic Kampuchea|Khmer Rouge regime]] of the 1960s and 1970s, as much as 80% of the pagodas in Cambodia were destroyed, including their libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/palm-leaves-preserving-history |title=Palm leaves preserving history |author=Sen David and Thik Kaliyann |newspaper=The Phnom Penh Post |volume=6|date=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cambodia, only a tiny fraction of the original ''kraing'' of the Khmer Empire has survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Khmer Medical Text "''The Treatment of the Four Diseases''" Manuscript |author=Prof. K.

At his gallery, "Seth Siegelaub Contemporary Art", operating between the Fall 1964 and April 1966, for one exhibition Siegelaub encouraged visitors to lounge on couches and chairs to appreciate the show as an overall environment and hosted a four-day [[happening]] featuring the artist Arni Hendin.&lt;ref name=Alberro10&gt;Alexander Alberro, ''Conceptual Art and the Politics of Publicity'', MIT Press, 2003, pp10-11. {{ISBN|0-262-51184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an aggressive promoter and paid as much attention to press and publicity as to the content of exhibitions, showing that even unconventional art work could be sold.&lt;ref name=Alberro10/&gt;

After the close of the gallery he gradually became, in [[Joseph Kosuth]]'s words, a "curator-at-large".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'', in Alexander Alberro and Blake Stimson, ''Conceptual Art: A Critical Anthology'', MIT Press, 1999, p.177 {{ISBN|0-262-51117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first exhibition organizer to specialize in dealing with [[conceptual art]], holding group exhibitions that had no existence outside of the catalogue., and was an active "independent curator", organizing 21 art exhibitions, books, catalogues and projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://egressfoundation.net/egress/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=310/ "21 art exhibitions, books, catalogues and projects"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723114254/http://egressfoundation.net/egress/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=310%2F |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the USA, Canada and Europe between February 1968 and July 1971 in a wide range of new and original formats, including several important group shows, such as "The Xeroxbook" in December 1968, and "January 5–31, 1969" exhibition, which contained no objects, no paintings and no sculptures.

He was also the originator and author, with lawyer Robert Projansky, of "The Artist's Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement," published in 1971, which has been translated and published in French, Italian, German and Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primaryinformation.org/index.php?/projects/siegelaubartists-rights/ "The Artist's Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the 21st century he founded the Stichting Egress Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egressfoundation.net/ "The Stichting Egress Foundation"]&lt;/ref&gt; in Amsterdam to bring together his varied range of projects: contemporary art, textile history, time &amp; causality research, and left communications study.

'''Shakuntala''' or '''Shakuntala looking for Dushyanta''' is an epic painting by celebrated Indian painter, [[Raja Ravi Varma]].

[[Raja Ravi Varma|Ravi Varma]], depicts [[Shakuntala]], an important character of [[Mahabaratha]], pretending to remove a thorn from her foot, while actually looking for her husband/lover, [[Dushyantha]], while her friends call her bluff.

Tapati Guha Thakurta, an art historian, wrote;
{{Pull quote|[T]his very gesture – the twist and turn of head and body – draws the viewer into the narrative, inviting one to place this scene within an imagined sequence of images and events. On its own, the painting stands like a frozen tableau (like a still from a moving film), plucked out of an on-running spectacle of episodes. These paintings also reflect the centrality of the "male gaze" in defining the feminine image. Though absent from the pictorial frame, the male lover forms a pivotal point of reference, his gaze transfixes Shakuntala, as also Damayanti, into "desired" images, casting them as lyrical and sensual ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=V4-Su0whKa0C&amp;pg=PA69 | title=India's Immortal Comic Books: Gods, Kings, and Other Heroes | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Karline McLain | year=2009 | pages=69 | isbn=9780253220523}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men. [[Webiorg]] was also inspired with the same spirit, and was attended by Bo (Bui) Bramason and Brat the Jute, thirsting for war.|[[Saxo Grammaticus]]&lt;ref name=Saxo&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elton|first1=Oliver|title=THE DANISH HISTORY,  BOOKS I-IX by  Saxo Grammaticus|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1150|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==Archaeology==
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenordic.com/don’t-underestimate-viking-women|title=Don’t underestimate Viking women|date=2 January 2013|first=Arild S.|last=Foss|website=sciencenordic.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norse immigrant graves in [[England]] and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands and wives, while some of the women were buried with weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Warriors and women: the sex ratio of Norse migrants to eastern England up to 900 AD | last = McLeod | first = Shane | work = Early Medieval Europe | publisher = Wiley | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 332–353 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0254.2011.00323.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Invasion of the Viking women unearthed | url = http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/07/invasion-of-the-viking-women-unearthed/1?csp=34news#.U6xrxBwcqs8 | date = July 19, 2011 | publisher = [[USA Today]] | last = Vergano | first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a tie-in special to the TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'' Neil Price showed that a 10th Century [[Birka]]-burial excavated in the 1970s containing a large number of weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström.&lt;ref name="history.com"/&gt; In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female&lt;ref name=jonson2017&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23308|title=A female Viking warrior confirmed by genomics|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|year=2017|last1=Hedenstierna-Jonson|first1=Charlotte|last2=Kjellström|first2=Anna|last3=Zachrisson|first3=Torun|last4=Krzewińska|first4=Maja|last5=Sobrado|first5=Veronica|last6=Price|first6=Neil|last7=Günther|first7=Torsten|last8=Jakobsson|first8=Mattias|last9=Götherström|first9=Anders|last10=Storå|first10=Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the so called [[Birka female Viking warrior]], but others including respected scholar of the Vikings, Judith Jesch says that conclusion is premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

The '''Society of Architectural Illustration''' was founded by Eric Monk (as the '''Society of Architectural Illustrators''') in 1975 to encourage the use of the [[architectural perspective]] or model as a valuable part of the communication process between [[architect]] and the general public. It changed its name to the Society of Architectural and Industrial Illustrators in the 1980s in a bid to increase membership. This did not work and the name was finally changed, after a protracted debate, to the '''Society of Architectural Illustration''' in the 1990s. This last name change was at the behest of the Charities Commission who insists that the Society exists for the benefit of the art and not the artist!

The SAI was the first organisation worldwide to provide the services of a [[professional body]] to the public and practitioners in Architectural Illustration and this lead has been followed in other major countries, most notably by the American Society of Architectural illustrators. SAI members work in several disciplines including illustration, animation, model making and photography.

The objectives of the SAI are to:
* Foster the use of the Architectural Perspective as a necessary communication medium between Designer and Layman.
* Acknowledge the time-honoured status of Architectural Illustration and formalise its position as that of a separate discipline.
* Establish high standards and the conferring of a [[Professional certification|professional qualification]] to those meeting such requirements.
* Make regular distribution of details of members to potential clients and provide a clients' advisory service.
* Hold exhibitions and meetings as required by the membership. Issue journals and newsletters for the exchange of ideas between members.
* Provide guidance and help in matters of contracts, copyright and other legal and business affairs.
* Provide an effective human instrument of friendship and co-operation between members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sai.org.uk/index.php5?page=about&amp;language=en&lt;/ref&gt;

The present Patron of the Society is British painter [[Ben Johnson (artist)|Ben Johnson]]. Previous patrons include Sir [[John Betjeman]], Sir [[Hugh Casson]] and [[Gordon Cullen]].

The president of the Society is Don Coe FSAI, previously chairman of the Society for some 25 years.
Chairman of the SAI is Richard Rees FSAI. Richard took to the chair at the 2015 AGM

The '''''Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich''''' is a [[Poland|Polish]] Writers' Association, an organization of Polish [[writer]]s, [[poet]]s, [[playwright]]s, critics and [[translator]]s. SPP, established in 1989 is a continuation of the Professional Union of Polish Writers, founded in 1920 on the initiative of [[Stefan Żeromski]] which was deactivated during [[World War II]].

The foundation of the association was possible due to the [[collapse of communism|historical and political transformations]], which took place in 1989 in Poland. The majority of the most prominent and influential writers and former members of the [[Polish Writers' Union]] officially joined the organization, which was formed in 1984, and because of the decision of the [[communism in Poland|communist]] authorities, remained illegal up until 1989. [[Czesław Miłosz]] became the first formal member of the new institution.

The headquarters of Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich is located in the House of Literature at [[Krakowskie Przedmieście]] 87/89 in [[Warsaw]]. At present, the association has got 11 major branches located in the following cities: [[Warsaw]], [[Lublin]], [[Katowice]], [[Kraków]], [[Wrocław]], [[Szczecin]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Łódź]], [[Olsztyn]] and [[Poznań]].

'''Straftaten gegen die öffentliche Ordnung – Gegen ein Verbot von Action-Computerspielen''' ({{literal translation|''Offenses against public order - Against a ban on action computer games''&lt;!-- Needs a better translation though; any German-speaking folk here want to help? --&gt;}}) is a successful German [[petition]] launched on June 5, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://epetitionen.bundestag.de/index.php?action=petition;sa=details;petition=4958|title=Petition: Straftaten gegen die öffentliche Ordnung - Gegen ein Verbot von Action-Computerspielen vom 05.06.2009| accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; meant to reverse a government plan to ban violent games from the country. The German government eventually reversed its decision and sided with the gamers.&lt;ref name="guard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/28/germany-violent-videogames|title=Online petition stalls plan to ban violent videogames in Germany|accessdate=August 11, 2011|date=July 28, 2009| publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
A "string of unrest in Germany over violence in video games" prompted the German government to work on a bill to ban violent video games.&lt;ref name="jystk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/07/28/64k-signature-petition-delays-german-govts-game-banning-bill/|title=64K signature petition delays German govt's game-banning bill|accessdate=August 11, 2011| last=Athab| first=Majeb| date=August 11, 2011| publisher=[[Joystiq]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, "the country's 16 interior ministers asked the Bundestag to ban the creation and distribution of games involving violent acts against human or human-like characters. Government criticism of video games had been growing since a school shooting in March was linked to online-shooter Counter-Strike".&lt;ref name="guard" /&gt; This plan drew ire from the German gaming community, which resulted in an online petition to challenge the German government decision.

The petition itself reads (in an English translation):
{{Cquote|The German Bundestag should decide against the decision of the interior minister conference from the 5th of June, that aims for a ban of action computer games. As an adult citizen and a person eligible to vote, I beg you firmly;

To erase the irritating and discriminating term of 'killerspiele' [killer game] from political discussion.

To strengthen the trust of the public in existing national youth protection mechanics.

To improve and warrant the execution of existing laws, that ensure kids and the youth only get access to video games and computer games rating according to the USK.

To support parents and educationally responsible persons in the advancement of media competence.

To promote the computer games and video games industry in Germany and especially the training of these promising professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gamepolitics.com/2009/07/27/german-government-consider-petition-filed-gamers |title=German Government To Consider Petition Filed by Gamers| date=July 27, 2011 | publisher=[[GamePolitics]] | accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Aftermath ==
The e-petition eventually reached 73,000 signatures, prompting a government review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/germany-retreats-from-violent-games-ban|title=Germany retreats from violent games ban|accessdate=August 11, 2011|date=May 20, 2010| publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials have stated that the German government will focus on "educating citizens about the country's USK game ratings standard", instead of changing the current legislation.

A '''style guide''' (or '''manual of style''') is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field.  (It is often called a '''style sheet''', though that term has other meanings.)

A style guide establishes and enforces [[wikt:style#Noun|style]] to improve [[communication]]. To do that, it ensures [[wikt:consistency#Noun|consistency]] within a document and across multiple documents and enforces [[best practice]] in [[usage]] and in [[Composition (language)|language composition]], [[Composition (visual arts)|visual composition]], [[orthography]] and [[typography]]. For [[Academic publishing|academic]] and [[Technical communication|technical]] documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in [[ethics]] (such as [[authorship]], [[research ethics]], and [[:wikt:disclosure|disclosure]]), [[pedagogy]] (such as [[expository writing|exposition]] and clarity), and compliance ([[Technical standard|technical]] and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]]).

Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[Academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and specific industries. '''House style''' refers to the internal style manual of a particular publisher or organization.

==Varieties==
Style guides vary widely in scope and size.

===Sizes===
This variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, in a way analogous to how styles cascade [[style sheet (web development)|in web development]] and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|in desktop publishing]] (e.g., how inline styles in [[HTML]] cascade over [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles).

A short style guide is often called a ''style sheet''. A comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a ''style manual'' or ''manual of style'' (''MOS'' or ''MoS'').  In many cases, a project such as one [[book]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[monograph]] series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a [[publishing]] company, whose content is usually called ''house style''. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an ''industry-wide or profession-wide style manual'' that is even more comprehensive. Some examples of these industry style guides include the following: 
* [[AP Stylebook|AP style]] for journalism and most forms of corporate communications
* [[United States Government Printing Office#GPO's Style Manual|USGPO style]] or [[Australian Government Publishing Service|AGPS style]] for government publications 
* [[Hart's Rules|Oxford style]] and [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago style]] for academic publishing and readership 
* [[APA style]] and [[ASA style]] for the social sciences 
* [[CSE style]] for various physical sciences 
* [[ACS style]] for chemistry 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] for medicine 
* [[Bluebook]] style for law

Finally, these reference works cascade over the [[orthography|orthographic]] norms of the language in use (for example, [[English orthography]] for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety such as [[comparison of American and British English|the different varieties of American English and British English]].

=== Topics ===
Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as [[graphic design]], including [[typography]]. Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects along with text.

Style guides that cover [[usage]] may suggest ways of describing people that avoid [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]]. Guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover [[nomenclature]], which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear, standardized, and [[ontology|ontologically]] sound (e.g., [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[chemical nomenclature]], and [[gene nomenclature]]).

==Updating==
Most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and [[usage]]. The frequency of updating and the [[revision control]] are determined by the subject matter. For style manuals in [[reference work]] format, new [[edition (book)|editions]] typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the [[AP Stylebook]] is revised annually, and the Chicago, APA, and ASA manuals are in their 17th, 6th, and 4th editions, respectively. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.

==Examples==
{{further|List of style guides}}

===International===
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. One example is [[ISO 215]] ''Documentation &amp;mdash; Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4086 |title=ISO 215:1986 - Documentation - Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[European Union]] publishes an ''Interinstitutional style guide''—encompassing [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|24 languages]] across the European Union. This manual is "obligatory" for all those employed by the institutions of the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-360400.htm|title= Interinstitutional Style Guide|author= Publications Office of the European Union|date= 24 July 2008|work= Europa|publisher= European Union12 May 2010|ref= Eur08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] of the [[European Commission]] publishes its own ''English Style Guide'', intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, but aiming to serve a wider readership as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/english-resources-english-style-guide_en|title= English Style Guide|author= Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|publisher= European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most public-facing corporate communication and journalism writing is written with styles following ''[[The Associated Press Stylebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;June Casagrande, ''Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite'' (New York: Penguin, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Book publishers and authors of journals requiring reference sections generally choose the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], while scholarly writing often follows the ''[[The MLA Style Manual|MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/style "What Is MLA Style?"], ''[[Modern Language Association|mla.org]]'', [[Modern Language Association]], 2011, Web, 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the most popular grammar guides used in third-person writing is ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. The Associated Press Stylebook is written to be used together with The Elements of Style to provide a very complete grammar and English style reference with no conflicts.

Despite the near uniform use of the Bluebook, nearly every state has appellate court rules that specify citation methods and writing styles specific to that state  - and the Supreme Court of the United States has its own citation method.  However, in most cases these are derived from the Bluebook.

There are also several other citation manuals available to legal writers in wide usage in the United States.  Virtually all large law firms maintain their own citation manual and several major publishers of legal texts (West, Lexis-Nexis, Hein, ''et al.'') maintain their own systems.

'''''Tahitian Women on the Beach''''' ({{Lang-fr|Femmes de Tahiti}}) is an 1891 painting by [[Paul Gauguin]]. The painting depicts two women on the Pacific island of [[Tahiti]] on the beach.

The painting is currently in the collection of the [[Musée d'Orsay]], located in Paris, France.

In 1892 Gauguin painted a similar painting ''Parau api'', (''Two Women of Tahiti'') which is in the collection of the [[Galerie Neue Meister]] in Dresden. In Tahitian, "parau" means word and "api" means new. Thus "parau api" means news. A common greeting is "Eaha te parau api", or what's new?

'''Temple Bar Gallery + Studios''' ('''TBG+S''') is located in the centre of [[Temple Bar, Dublin]]. 

==Description==
The organisation was founded in 1983 and the original studios and gallery were located in a former shirt factory. The current building is a mid-nineties structure that was built on the same site as part of the Temple Bar Architectural Framework Plan. The building is designed by Irish architects McCullough/Mulvin, who were one of the architectural practices involved in the Group 91 consortium that wrote the plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/tag/group-91-architects/|title=Group '91 Architects Archives – Archiseek – Irish Architecture|website=Archiseek – Irish Architecture|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The building contains a [[contemporary art|contemporary visual art]] gallery and thirty artists studios.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiseek.com/2010/1994-temple-bar-gallery-studios/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dublinculturetrail.ie/Venue.aspx?id=124bc173-a5de-4b8d-ab1d-7568d9a34b17 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908025902/http://www.dublinculturetrail.ie/Venue.aspx?id=124bc173-a5de-4b8d-ab1d-7568d9a34b17 |archivedate=8 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Temple Bar Gallery + Studios is a limited company with charitable status that is artist-led.  The voluntary Board is formally elected by the artist membership and comprises four artist members and five external professionals with different expertise and business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Board members :: Temple Bar Gallery + Studios :: Dublin Ireland.|url = http://www.templebargallery.com/info/about/board|website = ''templebargallery.com''|accessdate = 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple Bar Gallery + Studios is a [[Non-profit organization|not for profit]] registered charity and receives its core funding from [[Arts Council of Ireland|the Arts Council of Ireland]]. TBG+ S is part of a residency exchange programme with HIAP International Residency Exchange Programme. The gallery has been chosen to receive funding of an exchange of a student in Finland. In 2008 the Finnish photographer [[Heli Rekula]] spent her year here.&lt;ref name=kias&gt;[http://www.finnish-institute.org.uk/en/articles/240-heli-rekula Irish/Finnish Artist Exchange Award 2008], Finnish Institute, 2008. Retrieved 14 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a sculpture by Irish artist [[Garrett Phelan]] consisting of a metal arch bearing the words ''Our Union Only in Truth'' was added to the roof of the building. The commission was funded through an online crowd funding campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Union Only in Truth: Garrett Phelan on Dublin's newest landmark|url = http://totallydublin.ie/arts-culture/our-union-only-in-truth-garrett-phelan-on-dublins-newest-landmark/|website = Totally Dublin|accessdate = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Temple Bar Gallery + Studios – For Impact Learning {{!}} Newstream|url = http://www.businesstoarts.ie/newstream/blog/temple-bar-gallery-studios-for-impact-learning/|website = www.businesstoarts.ie|accessdate = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, this section should be 400-700 words long.--&gt;
Ohio high-schooler [[Cassie Sullivan]], armed with an [[M4 carbine]], emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned [[gas station]]. Upon entering, she hears a male voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they each put their weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him. He was holding a [[Christian cross]] and the screen cuts to black to show her [[backstory]].

A city-sized alien spaceship is circling Earth, containing extraterrestrials referred to as "The Others". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that permanently destroys all electrical power. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate&lt;!--- the method is not explained in the film, but in the novel --&gt; the planet's geology and fault lines, causing [[earthquakes]] and [[megatsunamis]] that destroy coastal cities and islands. For the 3rd Wave, The Others weaponize a strain of [[Avian influenza|avian flu virus]], with birds carrying the infectant across the planet. Cassie's mother is one of the casualties.

Cassie, her father and her younger brother Sam, find a summer camp in use as a refuge in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an Army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The unit's commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 4th Wave and they will take the children to safety at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the Army massacring all the adults, her father included.

Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by an unseen shooter and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a young man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.

At the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind.

Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base.  Ben's squad is reunited and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 15% based on 131 reviews and an average rating of 4.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "With unimpressive effects and plot points seemingly pieced together from previous dystopian YA sci-fi films, ''The 5th Wave'' ends up feeling like more of a limp, derivative wriggle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_fifth_wave/ |title= The 5th Wave (2016) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 33 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-5th-wave |title=The 5th Wave reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/box-office-dirty-grandpa-the-5th-wave-the-boy-during-storm-jonas-1201688827/ |title=‘The Revenant’ No. 1, ‘Ride Along’ Skids On Ice |work=deadline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey M. Anderson of ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' said of the film, "Every plot turn and every line of dialogue has been borrowed from somewhere else, and everything is utterly, totally predictable", noting how the film "steals material from (but does not stop at) the ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|Hunger Games]]'' and ''[[Divergent (film)|Divergent]]'' franchises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jeffrey M.|title=‘5th Wave’ slogs through ridiculous, predictable plot|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/5th-wave-slogs-through-ridiculous-predictable-plot/|accessdate=26 June 2017|work=The San Francisco Examiner|date=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Lane]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' faulted the film as a "marketing wheeze dressed up as an art form, and stupendously summarized by the image of Cassie hurrying through the woods carrying both an assault rifle and a [[Teddy bear]]", adding that the film "appears to have been designed by some crazed [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] wing of the [[National Rifle Association|N.R.A.]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lane|first1=Anthony|title=The Current Cinema - Tough Girls: "Jane Got A Gun" and "The Fifth Wave"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/02/01/tough-girls|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=26 June 2017|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Vaux of the Sci-Fi Movie Page gave the film one star out of five, saying, "The YA adaptation craze hits a low point with this aimless, purposeless alien invasion story that wastes a fine cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifimoviepage.com/the-5th-wave-movie-review/|title=The 5th Wave — Movie Review|work=Sci-Fi Movie Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=June 2017}} In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] wrote, "rarely does a movie that fails so utterly start so well", falling apart ahead of the fifth wave. As to a possible trilogy, "if we’re not really vigilant, and look to the skies, and prepare, they’re going to make at least two more of these things. We’ve got to beat back the invasion now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|author-link=Mick LaSalle|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/movies/article/The-5th-Wave-at-least-the-apocalypse-6774520.php|title=''The 5th Wave'': At least the apocalypse starts well|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Cockrell of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review, saying, "''The 5th Wave'' is an effectively decent post-apocalyptic, young adult, world-in-the-balance survival thriller" with an "arrestingly original spin on trendy genre tropes", although he suggested that fans of the book may have "issues with what has been edited".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/the-5th-wave-review-chloe-grace-moretz-1201679744/|title=‘The 5th Wave’ Review: A Decent Adaptation of Rick Yancey’s Novel - Variety|author=Eddie Cockrell|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Truitt of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film a positive review, stating that it "is an inviting sci-fi invasion" and "nicely stokes the imagination of a new generation of science-fiction movie nerds". He praised Moretz and Robinson as "equally strong" co-leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/01/21/review-the-5th-wave-movie/79013726/|title=Review: '5th Wave' is an inviting sci-fi invasion|publisher=USA Today|author=Brian Truitt|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon Harvey of ''[[The West Australian]]'' also gave the film a positive review, writing, "It’s actually got a lot going for it, from acting prodigy Chloe Grace Moretz as the kind of tough but fragile heroine you can cheer for to handsome production values, several plot twists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/a/30601034/the-5th-wave-too-familiar-to-be-thrilling/|title=The 5th Wave too familiar to be thrilling. - The West Australian|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Patterson of ''[[Moviepilot]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling it a "thrilling story of survival".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/reviews/3749541|title=The 5th Wave: A Thrilling Story of  Survival!|author=Michael Patterson|date=January 23, 2016|work=moviepilot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Dangerous Summer''''' is a nonfiction book by [[Ernest Hemingway]] published posthumously in 1985 and written in 1959 and 1960. The book describes the rivalry between [[Spanish-style bullfighting|bullfighters]] [[Luis Miguel Gonzalez Lucas|Luis Miguel Dominguín]] and his brother-in-law, [[Antonio Ordóñez]], during the "dangerous summer" of 1959. It has been cited as Hemingway's last book.&lt;ref name="publishers note"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hemingway|first=Ernest |title=The Dangerous Summer|year=1985|page=ix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''The Dangerous Summer'' is an edited version of a 75,000-word manuscript Hemingway wrote between October 1959 and May 1960 as an assignment from ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE Magazine]]''. Hemingway summoned his close friend [[Will Lang Jr.]] to come to Spain to deliver the story to ''LIFE Magazine''. The book was edited from the original manuscript by his American publisher [[Charles Scribner's Sons]].&lt;ref name="publishers note"/&gt; A 30,000-word extract from the script was published in three consecutive installments in ''LIFE'' during September 1960.&lt;ref name="publishers note"/&gt;  

Popular author James Mitchener (''Tales of the South Pacific'', ''Hawaii'', ''Centennial'', ''The Source'', ''Poland'') wrote the 33-page introduction which includes Michener's personal knowledge of bullfights and famous matadors, a comprehensive glossary of terms related to each stage of a bullfight, and unvarnished personal anecdotes of Hemingway.

==Account of the season==
[[File:Antonio Ordonez and Ernest Hemingway, Spain, 1959.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Antonio Ordóñez and [[Ernest Hemingway]], 1959 [[Málaga, Spain]].]]
The book charts the rise of Antonio Ordóñez (the son of [[Cayetano Ordóñez]], the bullfighter whose technique and ring exploits Hemingway fictionalized in his novel, ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'') during a season of bullfights during 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; During a fight on May 13, 1959, in [[Aranjuez]], Ordóñez is badly gored but remains in the ring and kills the bull, a performance rewarded by trophies of both the bull's ears, its tail, and a hoof.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), pp. 43–47&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Luis Miguel Dominguín is already famous as a bullfighter and returns to the ring after several years of retirement. Less naturally gifted than Ordóñez, his pride and self-confidence draw him into an intense rivalry with the newcomer, and the two meet in the ring several times during the season.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Starting the season supremely confident, Dominguín is slowly humbled by this competition.  While Ordóñez displays breathtaking skill and artistry in his fights, performing highly dangerous, classical passés, Dominguín often resorts to what Hemingway describes as "tricks", moves that look impressive to the crowd but that are actually much safer.&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Dominguín is gored badly at a fight in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], and Ordóñez is gored shortly afterwards.  Less than a month later, the two bullfighters meet in the ring again for what Hemingway described as "one of the greatest bullfights I have ever seen",&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; "an almost perfect bullfight unmarred by any tricks."&lt;ref name="Hemingway 1985 109"&gt;Hemingway (1985), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; From the six bulls which they fight, the pair win ten ears, four tails and two hooves as trophies, an extraordinary feat.&lt;ref name="Hemingway 1985 109"/&gt; Their final meeting takes place in [[Bilbao]], with Dominguín receiving a near-fatal goring and Ordóñez demonstrating absolute mastery by performing the ''recibiendo'' kill, one of the oldest and most dangerous moves. Ordóñez's ''recibiendo'' requires three attempts, displaying the fighter's artistry and bravery that Hemingway likens to that of legendary bullfighter [[Pedro Romero]].&lt;ref&gt;Hemingway (1985), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mystery of Oberwald''''' ({{lang-it|'''Il mistero di Oberwald'''}}) is a 1980 Italian drama film written, directed, and edited by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and starring [[Monica Vitti]], [[Paolo Bonacelli]], and Franco Branciaroli. Based on the 1946 play ''[[L'Aigle à deux têtes]]'' by [[Jean Cocteau]], the film is about a man who breaks into the castle at Oberwald to kill the queen but faints before doing so. The man's physical resemblance to the murdered king leads to a strange turn of events.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Oberwald |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081165/ |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mystery of Oberwald'' received the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon in 1982.&lt;ref name="imdbawards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for The Mystery of Oberwald |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081165/awards |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
During the nineteenth century, a young radical poet named Sebastian (Franco Branciaroli) breaks into an old dilapidated castle in Oberwald on a dark stormy night intending to kill the queen and free his country. The queen ([[Monica Vitti]]) has been in mourning for ten years for her husband the king who was assassinated on their wedding day. Sebastian, who faints before he can kill the queen, is the spitting image of the assassinated king. Sebastian and the queen talk, and the queen discovers that Sebastian once wrote a subversive poem that she liked, even though it was attacking her. The queen dares Sebastian to kill her, otherwise she vows to kill him.

==Reception==
Upon its theatrical release, ''The Mystery of Oberwald'' received generally negative reviews. In his review in ''The New York Times'', Vincent Canby called it "a movie that probably wouldn't last five minutes in front of an audience in control of its wits and with no more than a passing interest in Art for its own sake."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Antonioni's 'The Mystery of Oberwald' |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=September 30, 1981 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/30/movies/antonioni-s-mystery-of-oberwald.html |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canby concluded, "The only thing that makes ''The Mystery of Oberwald'' bearable is watching the Italian director's attempts to use video color techniques that are supposed to make more dramatic a fairly conventional narrative."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

On the review aggregator web site ''Rotten Tomatoes'', the film holds a 57% positive rating from critics based on 7 reviews, and a 35% positive audience rating based on 339 user ratings.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Oberwald |publisher=''Rotten Tomatoes'' |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystery_of_oberwald/ |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Claude Monet - The Seine at Argenteuil 1873.jpg|thumb|''The Seine at Argenteuil'', 1873]]
'''''The Seine at Argenteuil''''' is an 1873 oil painting by [[Claude Monet]], one of a series of paintings the artist made of the area.

The painting is held in a private collection.

==In popular culture==
''The Seine at Argenteuil'' was featured in and provided (along with other Monet paintings) the title inspiration for the 2001 film ''[[Vanilla Sky]]''. In the film the main character, David ([[Tom Cruise]]), owns the painting, and his subconscious makes use of its depiction of the sky.

The '''Tomb of the Unknown Confederate Soldier''' is a [[tomb]] on the grounds of [[Beauvoir (Biloxi, Mississippi)|Beauvoir]] in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Harrison County, Mississippi]], that holds the remains of an unidentified [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldier of the [[American Civil War]]. 

The remains were discovered in late 1979 by Ben Akselson of Beaumont, TX, member of the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans|SCV]], and Rick Forte, Chairman of the Combined Boards of Beauvoir, on a battlefield of the [[Vicksburg Campaign]]. The discovery led to the establishment of the Tomb of the Unknown Confederate Soldier in the Confederate Veterans Cemetery at [[Beauvoir (Biloxi, Mississippi)|Beauvoir]], in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].  The soldier's remains were buried there in a cypress casket in 1980.  The tomb, inscribed "Known but to God", was dedicated on June 6, 1981.

The remains were carefully authenticated from artifacts accompanying them, but the identity of the soldier, his unit, and his place of origin are not known. Approval of the plan and official designation was sought and received from all recognized Confederate organizations, including the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]], [[Military Order of the Stars and Bars]], and [[Children of the Confederacy]].

On June 6, 1981, the Tomb of the Unknown Confederate Soldier was unveiled. Its two sides are inscribed: The Unknown Soldier of the Confederate States of America. The head of the tomb bears the inscription: ''Known but to God''.   Atop of the tomb is the Great Seal of the Confederate States of America, and at its foot is a stanza from the poem ''CSA'' by [[Abram Joseph Ryan|Father Abram Joseph Ryan]], poet-priest of the Confederacy.

:Ah! fearless on many a day for us,
:They stood in front of the fray for us,
:And held the foeman at bay for us;
:And tears should fall
:Fore'er o'er all
:Who fell while wearing the Gray for us.

The [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] held ceremonies on May 1, 1983, to award the [[Confederate Medal of Honor]] to the Unknown Soldier. The awarding of this medal began in 1976 as a project of the Sons of Confederate Veterans to complete a process begun, but never consummated, by the Confederate Congress. During the war, the Congress had passed measures to honor valor on the battlefield and elsewhere, with [[Jefferson Davis|President Jefferson Davis]]' approval, but medals were never awarded. Conditions for the award were similar to those governing the United States Medal of Honor. The Unknown Soldier represents the intrepidity and gallantry at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty, by unnumbered Confederate soldiers to defend the Confederacy. The Unknown Soldier also represents all who lie in unknown places, and who may be deserving of this medal, although their names and services will never be known. The medal awarded to the Unknown Soldier was on display in the Beauvoir Confederate Museum.

'''UMKC Theatre''' is a graduate and undergraduate [[academic department]] of the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]] (UMKC) that provides both educational and professional training in multiple areas of theatrical production, including [[acting]], [[scenic design]], [[lighting design]], [[costume design]], [[sound design]], [[dramaturgy]] and historical research, [[playwriting]], and [[stage management]],&lt;ref&gt;The University of Missouri-Kansas City. "2013-2014 UMKC Catalog, College of Arts and Sciences, Theatre."&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains a strong connection with the [[Kansas City Repertory Theatre]] (KCRT), the leading regional theatre in the [[Kansas City]] area.&lt;ref&gt;The Kansas City Repertory Theatre.

==History==

Theatrical production at the University of Missouri-Kansas City began almost immediately after the institution was founded as the [[University of Kansas City]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré. "A Brief History of the UMKC Department of Theatre." Archived within the Patricia McIlrath Center for Mid-American Theatre, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 4949 Cherry Street, Kansas City, MO, 64110, Room 408. Accessed 10/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt; The first play produced on the university campus was [[Rachel Crothers]]' ''Mary the Third'' in the summer of 1934, followed by [[Sophocles]]' classic tragedy ''Antigone'' in the winter of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond R. Gould. "Department of Theatre, University of Missouri in Kansas City, A History of Productions." pg. 1. Located within the Patricia McIlrath Center for Mid-American Theatre, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 4949 Cherry Street, Kansas City, MO, 64110, Room 408. Accessed 10/1/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, a permanent theatre structure was constructed on campus by adapting an abandoned camp theatre building left over from a deactivated [[United States Air Force]] base, and Dr. John Newfield was hired to serve as the first professional director of the new University Playhouse. A former director of theatre and opera whose work had been produced throughout New York City and Europe, Newfield inaugurated the university's first [[Master of Arts]] degree in Theatre as a component of its Department of English upon his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré. "A Brief History of the UMKC Department of Theatre." Archived within the Patricia McIlrath Center for Mid-American Theatre, University of Missouri-Kansas City, 4949 Cherry Street, Kansas City, MO, 64110, Room 408. Accessed 10/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was not until the university hired Dr. [[Patricia McIlrath]] in 1954 as Newfield's replacement that an academic department sovereign from the Department of English was established to take on the dual responsibility of producing theatre on campus and training students in the history and methodology of theatrical production.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Lapham. "The Woman Behind Missouri Repertory Theatre." ''The Kansas City Star Magazine.'' June, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially serving as chair of the Department of Speech, McIlrath was selected to lead a newly formed Department of Speech and Theatre after the private University of Kansas City was inducted into the public University of Missouri system in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond R. Gould. "Department of Theatre, University of Missouri in Kansas City, A History of Productions." pg. 34.

Accessed 10/1/2013&lt;/ref&gt; As the head of UMKC Theatre, McIlrath played a paramount role in the development of [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatre]] in the Kansas City area, founding the UMKC Summer Repertory Theatre in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;"Repertory Team is Recruited by U.

Pgs. 618-621.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, UMKC Theatre became a founding member of the National Association of Schools of Theatre in 1965 and a founding member of the University/Resident Theatre Association in 1969, two institutions with which it still maintains accreditation. Following McIlrath's retirement as Founding Chair of the UMKC Theatre in 1984 and Founding Artistic Director of the Missouri Repertory Theatre in 1985, the responsibilities of leading the academic department of UMKC Theatre and of directing the professional company of Missouri Repertory Theatre (Kansas City Repertory Theatre) were separated, but the two institutions remain closely linked to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré.

Since its establishment in the 1960s, the department has had numerous alumni go on to find success in the fields of stage, film, and television.

==Degrees Offered==

The UMKC Theatre offers degrees at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Its [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree program in Theatre focuses on providing undergraduate students with a broad educational experience that includes all aspects of theatrical production, but allows students to select a specific field of emphasis, such as performance or design. In the early 1980s, the University of Missouri-Kansas City was granted the authority to offer the only [[Master of Fine Arts]] degrees in theatre in the State of Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Felicia Hardison Londré.
