This example discusses the general principle using [[Visible spectrum|visible light]] as a specific example.  A white beam [[light source|source]] – emitting light of multiple [[wavelength]]s – is focused on a sample (the [[complementary color]] pairs are indicated by the yellow dotted lines). Upon striking the sample, [[photons]] that match the energy gap of the [[molecule]]s present (green light in this example) are ''absorbed'' in order to excite the molecule.  Other photons transmit unaffected and, if the radiation is in the visible region (400-700nm), the sample color is the complementary color of the absorbed light.  By comparing the [[attenuation]] of the transmitted light with the incident, an absorption spectrum can be obtained.]]

'''Absorption spectroscopy''' refers to [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] techniques that measure the [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]], as a function of [[frequency]] or [[wavelength]], due to its interaction with a sample. The sample absorbs energy, i.e., photons, from the radiating field. The intensity of the absorption varies as a function of frequency, and this variation is the [[Absorption spectroscopy#Absorption spectrum|absorption spectrum]]. Absorption spectroscopy is performed across the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

Absorption spectroscopy is employed as an [[chemical analysis|analytical chemistry]] tool to determine the presence of a particular substance in a sample and, in many cases, to quantify the amount of the substance present. [[Infrared spectroscopy|Infrared]] and [[ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy]] are particularly common in analytical applications. Absorption spectroscopy is also employed in studies of molecular and atomic physics, astronomical spectroscopy and remote sensing.

There are a wide range of experimental approaches for measuring absorption spectra. The most common arrangement is to direct a generated beam of radiation at a sample and detect the intensity of the radiation that passes through it. The transmitted energy can be used to calculate the absorption. The source, sample arrangement and detection technique vary significantly depending on the frequency range and the purpose of the experiment.

A material's absorption spectrum is the fraction of incident radiation absorbed by the material over a range of frequencies. The absorption spectrum is primarily determined&lt;ref&gt;Modern Spectroscopy (Paperback)
by J. Michael Hollas {{ISBN|978-0-470-84416-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symmetry and Spectroscopy: An Introduction to Vibrational and Electronic Spectroscopy (Paperback)
by Daniel C. Harris, Michael D. Bertolucci {{ISBN|978-0-486-66144-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spectra of Atoms and Molecules by Peter F. Bernath {{ISBN|978-0-19-517759-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] composition of the material. Radiation is more likely to be absorbed at frequencies that match the energy difference between two [[quantum state|quantum mechanical states]] of the molecules. The absorption that occurs due to a transition between two states is referred to as an [[spectral line|absorption line]] and a spectrum is typically composed of many lines.

The frequencies where absorption lines occur, as well as their relative intensities, primarily depend on the [[electronic structure|electronic]] and [[molecular structure]] of the sample. The frequencies will also depend on the interactions between molecules in the sample, the [[crystal|crystal structure]] in solids, and on several environmental factors (e.g., [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[electric field|electromagnetic field]]). The lines will also have a [[spectral linewidth|width]] and [[spectral line#Spectral line broadening and shift|shape]] that are primarily determined by the [[spectral density]] or the [[density of states]] of the system.

===Theory===
Absorption lines are typically classified by the nature of the quantum mechanical change induced in the molecule or atom. [[Rotational spectroscopy|Rotational lines]], for instance, occur when the rotational state of a molecule is changed. Rotational lines are typically found in the microwave spectral region. [[Vibrational spectroscopy|Vibrational lines]] correspond to changes in the vibrational state of the molecule and are typically found in the infrared region. Electronic lines correspond to a change in the electronic state of an atom or molecule and are typically found in the visible and ultraviolet region. X-ray absorptions are associated with the excitation of [[Electronic structure#Shells and subshells|inner shell]] electrons in atoms. These changes can also be combined (e.g. [[rovibrational coupling|rotation-vibration transitions]]), leading to new absorption lines at the combined energy of the two changes.

The energy associated with the quantum mechanical change primarily determines the frequency of the absorption line but the frequency can be shifted by several types of interactions. Electric and magnetic fields can cause a shift. Interactions with neighboring molecules can cause shifts. For instance, absorption lines of the gas phase molecule can shift significantly when that molecule is in a liquid or solid phase and interacting more strongly with neighboring molecules.

The width and shape of absorption lines are determined by the instrument used for the observation, the material absorbing the radiation and the physical environment of that material. It is common for lines to have the shape of a [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] or [[Lorentzian distribution|Lorentzian]] distribution. It is also common for a line to be described solely by its intensity and [[spectral linewidth|width]] instead of the entire shape being characterized.

The integrated intensity—obtained by [[integral|integrating]] the area under the absorption line—is proportional to the amount of the absorbing substance present. The intensity is also related to the temperature of the substance and the quantum mechanical interaction between the radiation and the absorber. This interaction is quantified by the [[transition moment]] and depends on the particular lower state the transition starts from, and the upper state it is connected to.

The width of absorption lines may be determined by the [[spectrometer]] used to record it. A spectrometer has an inherent limit on how narrow a line it can [[spectral resolution|resolve]] and so the observed width may be at this limit. If the width is larger than the resolution limit, then it is primarily determined by the environment of the absorber. A liquid or solid absorber, in which neighboring molecules strongly interact with one another, tends to have broader absorption lines than a gas. Increasing the temperature or pressure of the absorbing material will also tend to increase the line width. It is also common for several neighboring transitions to be close enough to one another that their lines overlap and the resulting overall line is therefore broader yet.

===Relation to transmission spectrum===
Absorption and transmission spectra represent equivalent information and one can be calculated from the other through a mathematical transformation. A transmission spectrum will have its maximum intensities at wavelengths where the absorption is weakest because more light is transmitted through the sample. An absorption spectrum will have its maximum intensities at wavelengths where the absorption is strongest.

===Relation to emission spectrum===
[[Image:Emission spectrum-Fe.png|thumb|400px|&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Emission spectrum of [[iron]]&lt;/span&gt;]]

[[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] is a process by which a substance releases energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Emission can occur at any frequency at which absorption can occur, and this allows the absorption lines to be determined from an emission spectrum. The [[emission spectrum]] will typically have a quite different intensity pattern from the absorption spectrum, though, so the two are not equivalent. The absorption spectrum can be calculated from the emission spectrum using appropriate theoretical models and additional information about the quantum mechanical states of the substance. {{citation_needed|date=August 2016}}

===Relation to scattering and reflection spectra===
The scattering and reflection spectra of a material are influenced by both its [[index of refraction]] and its absorption spectrum. In an optical context, the absorption spectrum is typically quantified by the [[refractive index#Dispersion and absorption|extinction coefficient]], and the extinction and index coefficients are quantitatively related through the [[Kramers-Kronig relation]]. Therefore, the absorption spectrum can be derived from a scattering or reflection spectrum. This typically requires simplifying assumptions or models, and so the derived absorption spectrum is an approximation.

==Applications==
[[Image:Identification of Ices in the Solar System.jpg|thumb|300px|The infrared absorption spectrum of NASA laboratory [[sulfur dioxide]] ice is compared with the infrared absorption spectra of ices on [[Jupiter]]'s moon, '''[[Io (moon)|Io]]''' credit NASA, Bernard Schmitt, and [[UKIRT]].]]

Absorption spectroscopy is useful in chemical analysis&lt;ref&gt;James D. Ingle, Jr. and Stanley R. Crouch, ''Spectrochemical Analysis'', Prentice Hall, 1988, {{ISBN|0-13-826876-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its specificity and its quantitative nature. The specificity of absorption spectra allows compounds to be distinguished from one another in a mixture, making absorption spectroscopy useful in wide variety of applications. For instance, [[Infrared gas analyzer]]s can be used to identify the presence of pollutants in the air, distinguishing the pollutant from nitrogen, oxygen, water and other expected constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/apti/course422/ce4b4.html |title=Gaseous Pollutants – Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy |accessdate=2009-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023233506/http://www.epa.gov/apti/course422/ce4b4.html |archivedate=2012-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specificity also allows unknown samples to be identified by comparing a measured spectrum with a library of reference spectra. In many cases, it is possible to determine qualitative information about a sample even if it is not in a library. Infrared spectra, for instance, have characteristics absorption bands that indicate if carbon-hydrogen or carbon-oxygen bonds are present.

An absorption spectrum can be quantitatively related to the amount of material present using the [[Beer-Lambert law]]. Determining the absolute concentration of a compound requires knowledge of the compound's [[absorption coefficient]]. The absorption coefficient for some compounds is available from reference sources, and it can also be determined by measuring the spectrum of a calibration standard with a known concentration of the target.

===Remote sensing===

One of the unique advantages of spectroscopy as an analytical technique is that measurements can be made without bringing the instrument and sample into contact. Radiation that travels between a sample and an instrument will contain the spectral information, so the measurement can be made [[remote sensing|remotely]]. Remote spectral sensing is valuable in many situations. For example, measurements can be made in toxic or hazardous environments without placing an operator or instrument at risk. Also, sample material does not have to be brought into contact with the instrument—preventing possible cross contamination.

Remote spectral measurements present several challenges compared to laboratory measurements. The space in between the sample of interest and the instrument may also have spectral absorptions. These absorptions can mask or confound the absorption spectrum of the sample. These background interferences may also vary over time. The source of radiation in remote measurements is often an environmental source, such as sunlight or the thermal radiation from a warm object, and this makes it necessary to distinguish spectral absorption from changes in the source spectrum.

To simplify these challenges, [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy]] has gained some popularity, as it focusses on differential absorption features and omits broad-band absorption such as aerosol extinction and extinction due to rayleigh scattering. This method is applied to ground-based, air-borne and satellite based measurements. Some ground-based methods provide the possibility to retrieve tropospheric and stratospheric trace gas profiles.

===Astronomy===

[[Image:Cumulative-absorption-spectrum-hubble-telescope.jpg|thumb|Absorption spectrum observed by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]|400px|right]]

[[Astronomical spectroscopy]] is a particularly significant type of remote spectral sensing. In this case, the objects and samples of interest are so distant from earth that electromagnetic radiation is the only means available to measure them. Astronomical spectra contain both absorption and emission spectral information. Absorption spectroscopy has been particularly important for understanding [[interstellar clouds]] and determining that some of them contain [[molecular cloud|molecules]]. Absorption spectroscopy is also employed in the study of [[extrasolar planets]]. Detection of extrasolar planets by the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit method|transit method]] also measures their absorption spectrum and allows for the determination of the planet's atmospheric composition,&lt;ref name="Khd"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Khalafinejad |first=S. |last2=Essen |first2=C. von |last3=Hoeijmakers |first3=H.

===Atomic and molecular physics===

Theoretical models, principally [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] models, allow for the absorption spectra of atoms and molecules to be related to other physical properties such as [[electronic structure]], [[atomic mass|atomic]] or [[molecular mass]], and [[molecular geometry]]. Therefore, measurements of the absorption spectrum are used to determine these other properties. [[Microwave spectroscopy]], for example, allows for the determination of bond lengths and angles with high precision.

In addition, spectral measurements can be used to determine the accuracy of theoretical predictions. For example, the [[Lamb shift]] measured in the [[hydrogen atom|hydrogen]] atomic absorption spectrum was not expected to exist at the time it was measured. Its discovery spurred and guided the development of [[quantum electrodynamics]], and measurements of the Lamb shift are now used to determine the [[fine-structure constant]].

==Experimental methods==

===Basic approach===

The most straightforward approach to absorption spectroscopy is to generate radiation with a source, measure a reference spectrum of that radiation with a [[photodetector|detector]] and then re-measure the sample spectrum after placing the material of interest in between the source and detector. The two measured spectra can then be combined to determine the material's absorption spectrum. The sample spectrum alone is not sufficient to determine the absorption spectrum because it will be affected by the experimental conditions—the spectrum of the source, the absorption spectra of other materials in between the source and detector and the wavelength dependent characteristics of the detector. The reference spectrum will be affected in the same way, though, by these experimental conditions and therefore the combination yields the absorption spectrum of the material alone.

A wide variety of radiation sources are employed in order to cover the electromagnetic spectrum. For spectroscopy, it is generally desirable for a source to cover a broad swath of wavelengths in order to measure a broad region of the absorption spectrum. Some sources inherently emit a broad spectrum. Examples of these include [[globar]]s or other [[black body]] sources in the infrared, [[mercury lamp]]s in the visible and ultraviolet and [[x-ray tube]]s. One recently developed, novel source of broad spectrum radiation is [[synchrotron radiation]] which covers all of these spectral regions. Other radiation sources generate a narrow spectrum but the emission wavelength can be tuned to cover a spectral range. Examples of these include [[klystron]]s in the microwave region and [[laser]]s across the infrared, visible and ultraviolet region (though not all lasers have tunable wavelengths).

The detector employed to measure the radiation power will also depend on the wavelength range of interest. Most detectors are sensitive to a fairly broad spectral range and the sensor selected will often depend more on the sensitivity and noise requirements of a given measurement. Examples of detectors common in spectroscopy include [[heterodyne receiver]]s in the microwave, [[bolometer]]s in the millimeter-wave and infrared, [[mercury cadmium telluride]] and other cooled [[semiconductor]] detectors in the infrared, and [[photodiode]]s and [[photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]] in the visible and ultraviolet.

If both the source and the detector cover a broad spectral region, then it is also necessary to introduce a means of [[spectral resolution|resolving]] the wavelength of the radiation in order to determine the spectrum. Often a [[spectrometer#Spectrographs|spectrograph]] is used to spatially separate the wavelengths of radiation so that the power at each wavelength can be measured independently. It is also common to employ [[interferometer|interferometry]] to determine the spectrum—[[Infrared spectroscopy#FTIR|Fourier transform infrared]] spectroscopy is a widely used implementation of this technique.

Two other issues that must be considered in setting up an absorption spectroscopy experiment include the [[optics]] used to direct the radiation and the means of holding or containing the sample material (called a [[cuvette]] or cell). For most UV, visible, and NIR measurements the use of precision quartz cuvettes are necessary. In both cases, it is important to select materials that have relatively little absorption of their own in the wavelength range of interest. The absorption of other materials could interfere with or mask the absorption from the sample. For instance, in several wavelength ranges it is necessary to measure the sample under [[vacuum]] or in a [[rare gas]] environment because gases in the [[earth's atmosphere#Composition|atmosphere]] have interfering absorption features.

'''Action assembly theory''' ('''AAT''') is a [[communication theory]] that emphasizes [[psychology|psychological]] and social influences on human action. The goal is to examine and describe the links between the [[cognition]] and [[behavior]] – how an individual's thoughts get transformed into action. It was developed by John Greene.&lt;ref&gt;Em Griffen. ''A First Look at Communication Theory''. "Chapter 11: [http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/action.pdf Action Assembly Theory of John Greene]." McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Action assembly theory describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: 
* the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory, and
* the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken.
* Action Assembly Theory (AAT) seeks to explain message behavior (both verbal and nonverbal).  AAT is a communication theory that emphasizes psychological and social influences on human action.  The goal is to examine and describe the links between the cognition and behavior-how an individuals thoughts get transformed into action.  According to the psychology wiki, AAT describes the production of behavior in two essential processes: the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory, and the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken. For example, assembly is considered a top-to-bottom process that begins with more general strategy and goes to a more specific idea about communicating the specific message.

== Retrieval of procedural elements ==
The idea of procedural record is at the center of action assembly.  These records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations.  These records are locked in the individual’s memory where it remembers past behaviors for the future.

A procedural record is at the center of action assembly. It is a personal nugget of truth about past behavior stockpiled for future use, part of an individual's memory system in which information about how to execute various behaviors is stored. Procedural records contain information about action, outcomes, and situations; for example, traveling at excessive speed (action) in a zone that specifies low speed limit (situation)can result in the issuance of a ticket (outcome).

Procedural records have different levels of strength. Some are mere scratches that barely leave a trace in the mind, while others are well-worn into long-term memory.

A central aspect of the action assembly theory is specifying the processes that link procedural records to behavioral representations. The activation process is the process used to select particular procedural records. For example, if a parent disciplined a child for stealing, all procedural records relevant to this goal and situation would be activated. In turn, if a common disciplinary tactic was to take away toys and play items, a procedural record of that would be activated quickly.

== Organization of procedural elements ==
It is also important to consider the process of assembly, which organizes records into a behavioral representation. For example, assembly is considered a top-down process that begins with general strategy and goes to more specific ideas about communicating the specific message.

Action assembly theory has been useful for topics such as speech onset latency and hesitations during speaking. These concepts are assumed to be indicators of cognitive processing. Another use is the study of planning – individuals who plan more effectively are more fluent than those do not, because planning reduces the cognitive load at the time of message production.

When an interaction situation has multiple goals, the theory finds increased demands on an individual's information processing capacity. Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goals may be incompatible with behaviors associated with the other goals. In turn, multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitations and latencies. The utilization of Action Assembly theory can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble  goals more careful to mitigate the effect.

== Use of AAT==
When an interaction situation has multiple goals, the theory finds increased demands on an individual’s information processing capacity.  Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goal may be incompatible with behaviors associated with each other goals.  In turn, multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitation.  The utilization of AAT can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble goals more careful to ease the effect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4342">An '''Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance''', '''APFO''', or '''Concurrency Regulation''' is a legislative method to tie public infrastructure to growth for a region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cost of Concurrency: A Legal and Empirical Analysis of Adequate Public|author =Dustin Cole Read|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APFOs take into account the availability of infrastructure. They can affect growth, but are considered separate from growth controls such as building [[moratorium (law)|moratoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing Community Growth|author =Eric D. Kelly|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Gazette|title=Gardner says moratorium will not hurt building industry|date=10 January 2008|author =Sherry Greenfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

APFO regulations take into affect some or all of a jurisdiction's infrastructure requirements, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adequate Public Facilities Ordinances and Transportation Management|author =S. Mark White|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Transportation planning|Transportation]]
*School facilities
*Water supply
*Water treatment
*Roads

Other elements include:
*CIP – Capitol Improvement Programs
*Service Level Standards

==Scope==
APFO regulations are typically applied to a jurisdiction which has legislative control of a given area. In America, this can be at a state, county, or city level. A conflict can occur when APFO regulations differ in scope between jurisdictions where there is shared funding and legislative authority (such as a city located inside a county that funds schools).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Gazette|title= Calvert County finds northern school populations inadequate Multiple schools closed to future district development|author =Sara Newman|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While APFOs are intended to mitigate infrastructure shortcomings for a particular area, the mitigation may apply to areas offsite of the development project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Driveway Regulation Practices|author =Kristine Williams|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; APFO regulations usually apply to individual projects on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Land Use Law|author =Daniel R. Mandelker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:Parris Glendening speaking, September 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Maryland Governor Parris Glendening advocating Smart Growth in 2006]]
Traditional opponents of APFO legislation include industries affected by moratoria or fees, including [[Real estate broker|realtors]], [[Real estate development|developers]], and some [[Smart Growth]] advocates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Center for Smart Growth|url=http://smartgrowth.umd.edu/APFOMaryland.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home costs for some locations that have enacted APFO have experienced increases in housing prices affecting affordable housing, in conjunction with positive effects of relief from school capacity shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cost of Concurrency: A Legal and Empirical Analysis of Adequate Public|author =Dustin Cole Read|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4819">The '''American Association of Public Health Dentistry''' (AAPHD), founded in 1937, focuses upon addressing the public health challenges to oral health at the population level. Its open membership for everyone who seeks improvement in oral health of the general public. supports developing and supporting effective programs of oral health promotion and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/ Home page for the American Association of Public Health Dentistry (AAPHD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/abdph American Board of Dental Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is headquartered in [[Springfield, Illinois]].

== Mission ==
[[Public health]] dentistry is defined as by [[TheFreeDictionary.com]] as "that specialty of dentistry concerned with the prevention and control of dental diseases and promotion of oral health through organized community efforts."

== Organization ==

The American Association of Public Health Dentistry was founded in 1937.  AAPHD publishes a newsletter for AAPHD members and a journal, the Journal of Public Health Dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1752-7325 Journal of Public Health Dentistry. Wiley Online Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  It offers online continuing education courses for public health dentists in oral health literacy, dental public health policy and advocacy, and professional dental ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaphd.org/online-dental-public-health-courses Dental Public Health online courses]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 2014, Julie Frantsve-Hawley, PhD,&lt;ref&gt;Genetics, Biological and Biomedical Sciences program, Harvard University, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; has been the Executive Director of AAPHD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-frantsve-hawley-b376b631/ LinkedIn article for Julie Frantsve-Hawley, PhD]&lt;/ref&gt;  She had been with [[American Dental Association]] before and had edited journals in [[evidence-based dentistry]].

Each year it plans a National Oral Health Conference® (NOHC) in the United States, which next will be held from April 16–18, 2018 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NationalOralHealthConference.com AAPHD's NOHC Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Services Contingent''' was the [[Australian Army]] contribution to the [[United Nations Transition Assistance Group]] (UNTAG) [[peacekeeping]] mission to [[Namibia]] in 1989 and 1990. Australia sent two contingents of over 300 engineers each to assist the [[Special Representative of the Secretary General]], [[Martti Ahtisaari]], in overseeing free and fair elections in Namibia for a [[Constituent Assembly of Namibia|Constituent Assembly]] in what was the largest deployment of Australian troops since the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=53}}

The Australian mission was widely reported as successful. [[Colonel]] John Crocker, commander of the second Australian contingent (2ASC), wrote that the November 1989 election was UNTAG's ''raison d'être'' and observed that "the Australian contingent's complete and wide-ranging support was critical to the success of that election and hence the mission – a fact that has been acknowledged at the highest level in UNTAG".{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=7}} [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], wrote to [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] (Australia's [[Foreign Minister]]) about the "remarkable contribution made by the Australian military and electoral personnel", saying that their "dedication and professionalism had been widely and deservedly praised".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=142}} Although a total of 19 UN personnel lost their lives in Namibia, the two Australian contingents achieved their mission without sustaining any fatalities – one of the few military units in UNTAG to do so.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=137}}

Overall, the UNTAG mission assisted Namibia in transitioning to a democratic government after the racial segregation of the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] system. The military forces did not fire a shot during the operation,{{sfn|Sitkowski|2006|p=84}} and Mays called it "possibly the most successful UN peacekeeping operation ever fielded";{{sfn|Mays|2011|p=29}} Hearn called it "one of the major successes of the United Nations".{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=1}} Almost 20 years later, in a message to the annual session of the [[United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization]] on 28 February 2008, [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] noted  that "facilitating this process" constituted "one of the proudest chapters of our Organization's history".{{sfn|Tsokodayi|2011|p=23}}

Southwest Africa has a [[History of Namibia|rich history]] encompassing colonisation, war and genocide. The first European to set foot on Namibian soil was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Diogo Cão]] in 1485.{{citationneeded|date=January 2018}} Over the next 500 years, the country was [[colony|colonised]] by the Dutch, English and Germans. Namibia was a [[Germany|German]] colony ([[German South-West Africa]]) from 1884 until its annexation by [[South Africa]] during [[World War I]]. After the war, it was [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] to South Africa by the [[League of Nations]]. After [[World War II]] the [[United Nations]] (UN) asked South Africa to place Namibia under [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|UN trusteeship]], but South Africa refused. Legal arguments continued until 1966 when the [[UN General Assembly]] resolved to end the mandate, declaring that henceforth South-West Africa was the direct responsibility of the UN.{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=9}}

At the height of the [[Cold War]] in 1965, conflict escalated across the border with the [[Cuban intervention in Angola]]. Cuba formed an alliance with the [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA) ({{lang-pt|Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola – Partido do Trabalho}}), which led to the deployment of more than 25,000 Cuban soldiers to the region in the [[Angolan War of Independence]].{{sfn|George|2005|p=i}}

The next year the [[Namibian War of Independence]] began when the South-West Africa People's Organisation's ([[SWAPO]]) military wing – the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN) – began guerrilla attacks on South African forces, infiltrating from bases in [[Zambia]]. The first attack was the battle at [[Omugulugwombashe]] on 26 August, and the war was a classic insurgent-counterinsurgent operation. PLAN initially established bases in northern Namibia; they were later forced out of the country by the [[South African Defence Force]] (SADF), subsequently operating from bases in southern Angola and Zambia. The intensity of cross-border conflict escalated, becoming known as the [[South African Border War]] and the Angolan Bush War.{{sfn|Sibeene|2009|p=}}

The principal protagonists were the SADF and the PLAN. Other groups involved included the [[South West African Territorial Force]] (SWATF) and [[National Union for Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA) (both aligned with the SADF) and the [[People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA) and [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]] (both aligned with SWAPO).{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=26}} The South African-aligned forces consisted of regular army (SADF), [[South West African Police]] forces and the South West Africa Police Counter-Insurgency Unit (SWAPOL-COIN), including the paramilitary-trained SWAPOL police [[counter-insurgency]] unit known as [[Koevoet]].{{sfn|Hooper|1988|p=232}}

From a Namibian perspective, the nature of the closely intertwined Angolan War of Independence, Namibian War of Independence and South African Border War was typically cross-border conflict. This was overshadowed by two large-scale Cuban military interventions in the Angolan War of Independence. The first was in November 1975 (on the eve of Angola's independence),{{sfn|George|2005|pp=i–ix}} which further intensified with the escalation of the [[Angolan Civil War]] in 1985. In that conflict, South Africa provided support across the northern border to UNITA. In opposition, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]] financially backed an estimated two motorised infantry divisions of Cuban troops in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-led the [[People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola]] (FAPLA) offensive against UNITA in what became known as the second Cuban intervention in Angola. In September 1987, Cuban forces came to the defence of the besieged Angolan Army (FAPLA) and stopped the advance of the SADF at the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale]] (the largest battle in Africa since World War II). General [[Magnus Malan]] wrote in his memoirs that this campaign marked a great victory for the SADF. [[Nelson Mandela]] disagreed; Cuito Cuanavale, he asserted, "was the turning point for the liberation of our continent—and of my people—from the scourge of apartheid".{{sfn|Joseph|2007|p=128}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|2007|p=}} This battle led to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 602|UN Security Council Resolution 602]] of 25 November 1987, demanding the SADF's unconditional withdrawal from Angola by 10 December.{{sfn|Chicago Sun-Times|1987}} When the UN force deployed to Namibia in April 1989, there were 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989d}}

During the 20-year war the SADF mounted many cross-border operations against PLAN bases, some of which extended {{convert|250|km}} into Angola. SADF units frequently remained in southern Angola to intercept PLAN combatants on their way south, forcing PLAN to move to bases far from the Namibian border. Most PLAN insurgency operations took the form of small [[Raid (military)|raids]] on political activists, armed propaganda activity, [[Military recruitment|recruitment]], raids on white settlements and disruption of essential services.{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=344}}

===United Nations Transition Assistance Group===
{{main article|United Nations Transition Assistance Group}}
The process leading to Namibia's independence began with UN General Assembly Resolution 2145 (XXI) of 27 October 1966.{{sfn|UN Resolution 2145|1966}} This was followed by the passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 264|UN Security Council Resolution 264]], adopted on 20 March 1969. In that resolution the UN assumed direct responsibility for the territory and declared the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia illegal, calling upon the [[Government of South Africa]] to withdraw immediately. International negotiations for a peaceful solution to the Namibian problem increased.{{sfn|UN Resolution 264|1969}} In December 1978, in what was known as the [[Brazzaville]] Protocol, South Africa, Cuba and Angola formally accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435|UN Security Council Resolution 435]] outlining a blueprint for Namibian independence. The protocol envisioned a phased withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola over a two-year period, set 1 April 1989 as the date for the resolution's implementation and planned to reduce South African forces in Namibia to 1,500 by June 1989. The resolution established UNTAG, approving a report by the Secretary-General and outlining its objective: "the withdrawal of South Africa's illegal administration from Namibia and the transfer of power to the people of Namibia with the assistance of the United Nations". Resolution 435 authorised a total of 7,500 military personnel as UNTAG's upper limit.{{sfn|UN Resolution 435|1978}}

It was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to implement the resolution, signing the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]] (an agreement between Angola, Cuba and South Africa) at [[UN headquarters]] in New York City. The accord recommended that 1 April 1989 be set as the date for implementation of Resolution 435,{{sfn|Wellens|1990|pp=200}} and was affirmed by the Security Council on 16 January 1989. As Hearn noted, "The first characteristic of peacekeeping is that the consent of the disputants must be secured before a force is deployed".{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=10}} With the accord in place (principally with South Africa), UNTAG was then formally established in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 632|Resolution 632]] on 16 February 1989.{{sfn|UN Resolution 632|1978}}

The key participants in the UN process were the South African government (represented in Namibia by the Administrator General) and the UN. Hearn wrote that South Africa had a "desire for a smooth transition"; this resulted in negotiations occurring locally (between the Special Representative and the Administrator General), directly with the South African government in Pretoria and at the UN (via the Secretary General and Security Council). The outcome of these negotiations with South Africa included draft electoral laws (enabling free and fair elections) and the disbanding of the Koevoet force.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=222}} The elections were carried out by the South African Administrator General, under UN supervision.{{sfn|Sitkowski|2006|p=79}} The UNTAG operation ultimately involved over 100 countries, the highest ever for a UN operation. The UN had a high level of credibility, and were recognised as the legitimate body to bring independence to Namibia.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=224}}

==Australian political context==
In the ''[[Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations]]'', author [[David Horner]] stated that the Australian government led by [[Robert Menzies]] was loath to criticise South Africa during the 1950s. At that time Australia generally opposed anti-colonial movements (which were often supported by the Soviets or China), believing them part of a worldwide communist offensive.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=55}} Indeed, as late as 1961 Australia (and Britain) abstained from a vote to condemn South Africa in the UN.{{sfn|Hansard – Chaney|1961}}

It was not until 1962 that Australia voted for a UN resolution condemning South Africa for its actions in South-West Africa, a change in policy led by External Affairs Minister [[Garfield Barwick]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=55}} Initially in opposition, until he was [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]] was a vocal advocate of independence for Namibia. Over the following two decades, Australia played a small (but significant) role in supporting Namibian independence. Political leaders from both benches of Parliament, including Prime Ministers Whitlam and [[Malcolm Fraser]], were active internationally in their support of independence for Namibia while in office. As a result, Australia was involved in the UN process almost from the start. In 1972 Australia voted in favour of a UN trust fund, and two years later it was elected to the UN Council for Namibia.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=56}} Australia pledged support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia with Resolution 435 in September 1978,{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=58}} and made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia while a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.{{sfn|Hansard – B.

Behind the scenes, the composition of the force Australia would contribute was not agreed in principle until late 1978; options discussed at the time were a logistic force and an [[infantry]] [[battalion]] group.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=59}} By October 1978 Prime Minister Fraser had publicly stated that he wanted to send a [[peacekeeping]] force to Namibia;{{sfn|Killen|1985|p=13}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=62}} however, this was not broadly supported. A November 1978 article in ''[[The Bulletin]]'' claimed that the Defence Department was "dead against" a commitment, and in January 1979 ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' reported that Fraser, [[Andrew Peacock]] (Foreign Affairs) and [[Jim Killen]] (Defence) were "involved in a row" over the plan.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=63}} The following month, a Cabinet submission stated that the UN proposal had a "reasonable prospect" of success, and Cabinet approved the commitment of an engineer force of 250 officers and men and a national headquarters and support element of 50 on 19 February.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=64}} Horner noted that there was very little criticism of this decision in the press at the time, and the decision was accepted without question.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=64}}

After leaving government, Fraser continued to play an important role in international relations with respect to independence for Namibia. In 1985, he chaired UN hearings in New York on the role of multinationals in South Africa and Namibia. Fraser also co-chaired the [[Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group]] from 1985 to 1986, campaigning for an end to apartheid in South Africa.{{sfn|CEDA|2011|}}{{sfn|Uni. of Melbourne|2007|p=2}}

[[Bob Hawke]]'s government continued the policy of the Fraser and Whitlam governments to support independence for Namibia. In the ''Official History'', Horner stated that Australian peacekeeping "blossomed" after Gareth Evans was appointed Foreign Minister in September 1988; Evans reconfirmed Australia's willingness to participate in UNTAG in October 1988, a month after his appointment.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=45}} Horner also said that the commitment was "unusual" because it occurred a decade after the government's initial decision to participate in February 1979.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=54}} After more than 10 years of consideration, the government reconfirmed its commitment of a force of 300 engineers to Namibia on 2 March 1989.{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}}

{{Quote box|width=30%|align=left|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Our contribution to UNTAG and our involvement in the Namibian settlement makes Australia party to what may be one of the United Nations' most substantial achievements for many years. We have been involved in this process from the start. Australia has been a member of the UN Council for Namibia since 1974. We pledged our support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia in 1978. Australia also made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia during our recent term on the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.

There were many concerns about the size of the commitment and its risks. Before the deployment, Prime Minister Hawke said in Parliament that Namibia was a "very large and important commitment" comprising "almost half of the Army's construction engineering capability". He went on to say, "our effort in Namibia will be the largest peacekeeping commitment in which this country has ever participated. It may also be the most difficult".{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}} Unlike the commitment of soldiers to [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Vietnam]] over 20 years earlier, the deployment to Namibia had [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] support.{{sfn|Hansard – T. Fisher|March 1989}}

Prior to the deployment, South African authorities threatened to veto the involvement of Australian peacekeeping troops because of doubts about their impartiality. This followed the establishment by the Australian Government of a Special Assistance Program for South Africans and Namibians (SAPSAN) in 1986 to assist South Africans and Namibians disadvantaged by apartheid. The focus of SAPSAN was on education and training for the people of South Africa and Namibia, and some humanitarian assistance had also been provided. A total of $11.9&amp;nbsp;million was spent under SAPSAN from 1986 to 1990.{{sfn|Hansard – G. Evans|1991}}{{sfn|Hansard – N. Blewett|1991}}

In the ''Official History'', Horner described the Australian deployment to Namibia as a "vital mission": the first major deployment of troops to a war zone since the Vietnam War. In 1988 Australia had only 13 military personnel deployed on multinational peacekeeping operations, and with few exceptions the number of Australians committed to such activities had  changed little in over 40 years (since the [[Military history of Australia during the Korean War|Korean War]]). The successful deployment of over 600 engineers to Namibia in 1989 and 1990 was pivotal in changing Australia's approach to peacekeeping, paving the way for much-larger contingents sent to [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|Cambodia]], [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|Rwanda]], [[Operation Solace|Somalia]] and [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|East Timor]]. The deployment of a significant force to Namibia profoundly affected Australia's defence and foreign policies.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=53}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=143}}

===Command===
UNTAG was a large operation, with nearly 8,000 men and women deployed to Namibia from more than 120 countries to assist the process. The military force numbered approximately 4,500,{{sfn|United Nations|2012}} and was commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Dewan Prem Chand]] of [[India]]; the main military UNTAG Headquarters was in [[Windhoek]], Namibia's capital and largest city.{{sfn|Condell|2003|}} The commanders of the Australian contingents were Colonels Richard D. Warren (1ASC){{sfn|Sampson|1989|p=}}{{sfn|RUSI|1989|p=}} and John A.

Kelly|1989}} and Brendan Sowry (2ASC).{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}}{{sfn|Getz|3 April 1989}}

===Mission and role of UNTAG===
UNTAG's mission was to monitor the ceasefire and troop withdrawals, to preserve law and order in Namibia and to supervise elections for the new government.{{sfn|Hawke|1989b|p=1}} In the ''Official History'', Horner described it as "an extremely complex mission".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=102}}

The role of UNTAG was to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary General (SRSG), Martti Ahtisaari, in overseeing free and fair elections in Namibia for a [[Constituent Assembly]]. The elections were to be carried out by the South African Administrator General, under UN supervision and control,{{#tag:ref|Sitkowski noted that this was a political compromise, because the South African administration was considered illegal.{{sfn|Sitkowski|2006|p=79}}|group=Note}} and this Assembly would then draw up a constitution for an independent Namibia. UNTAG was tasked with assisting the SRSG in ensuring that all hostile acts ceased; South African troops were confined to base, and ultimately withdrawn; discriminatory laws were repealed, and political prisoners released; Namibian refugees were permitted to return (when they were known as returnees); intimidation was prevented, and law and order maintained.{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=1}}{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=172}}{{sfn|United Nations|1989}}

UNTAG was the first instance of a large-scale, multidimensional operation where the military element supported the work of other components concerned with border surveillance: monitoring the reduction and removal of the South African military presence; organising the return of Namibian exiles; supervising voter registration and preparing, observing, and certifying the results of national elections.{{sfn|Fomerand|2007|p=xxiii}}{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=162}}

==={{anchor|Role of the Australian contingent to UNTAG}}Role of Australian contingent===
The role of the Australian force was broad for an Army engineering unit, requiring the unit to "provide combat and logistic engineer support to UNTAG"; this included the UN civilian and military components. Its role included construction, field engineering and (initially) deployment as infantry.{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=10}}

Prime Minister Hawke said in Parliament at the time that "the settlement of the long and complex issue of Namibian independence is an important international event. It is an event in which Australia has played, and will continue to play, a substantial part&amp;nbsp;... Namibia is a large, arid, sparsely populated and underdeveloped country which has been a war zone for many years. Our engineers will build roads, bridges, airstrips and camps for UNTAG. They will have the very serious task of clearing mines which have been laid by the various contending forces along the border between Angola and Namibia".{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}}

==={{anchor|Organisation and composition of the contingents}}Organisation and composition of contingents===
The Australian force was structured as follows:{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=18}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|pp=77–78}}
*A Headquarters (Chief Engineer ASC UNTAG) with operations, works, accommodations, communications, finance, logistics and personnel cells
*A Construction Squadron group based on the [[17th Construction Squadron (Australia)|17th Construction Squadron]] ([[Royal Australian Engineers]]) with two construction troops (the 8th and 9th Troops), the 14th Field Troop, a Resources Troop, a [[Heavy equipment|Plant]] Troop and the attached [[Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] Workshop

There were two contingents, each of which contained over three hundred soldiers and deployed for about six months:
*1ASC consisted of 304 members, and was principally drawn from the 17th Construction Squadron, the Workshop and the 14th Field Troop from the 7th Field Squadron in Brisbane. The contingents also included soldiers from the [[Royal Australian Corps of Signals]], [[Royal Australian Army Pay Corps]], [[Australian Army Legal Corps]], [[Royal Australian Corps of Military Police]], [[Royal Australian Corps of Transport]], [[Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps]], [[Australian Army Catering Corps]] and the [[Royal Australian Army Medical Corps]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=120}}
*2ASC consisted of 309 personnel, with members of 78 different units. The second contingent included the 15th Field Troop from the 18th Field Squadron in [[Townsville]], fourteen members of the [[Corps of Royal New Zealand Engineers]] (RNZE), five [[Australian Army Reserve]] (ARES) members and one [[Royal Australian Air Force]] officer ([[Flight Lieutenant]] Craig Forster). The New Zealand engineers (under [[Lieutenant]] Jed Shirley) were spread throughout the squadron. The second contingent also included a detachment from the [[Royal Australian Corps of Military Police]], led by Sergeant Tim Dewar.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=120}}

In addition to the military force, a number of other Australians served with UNTAG (including 25 observers from the [[Australian Electoral Commission]]).{{sfn|Sawer|2001|p=176}} For the duration of the deployment, the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] and Defence had agreed to jointly fund a temporary Australian Liaison Office in Windhoek manned by two DFAT personnel and headed by [[Nick Warner]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=80}}

The parade was reviewed by Prime Minister Bob Hawke.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989b}}]]
[[Australian Army]] involvement in UNTAG was formalised in February 1979 by Cabinet, which approved the plan to commit the 17th Construction Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers and Workshop as the main force for deployment.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=64}} The squadron was to be supplemented by a Field Troop and by members posted from other units throughout the Army, bringing the squadron to a deployment strength of 275. A headquarters was to be formed, supporting the Chief Engineer at the UNTAG Military Headquarters. The total strength of the force was to be over 300 of all ranks, in what was known as Plan Witan.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=66}} The unit had been placed on eight weeks' notice in July 1978, which was reduced to a week's notice to move in February 1979.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=66}}

There was no agreement (or settlement) between South Africa and SWAPO, so an order to move was never issued. The ''Official History'' noted, "as the weeks passed the unit found it difficult to continue training because all its vehicles, equipment and plant were either in boxes or in a state ready for transhipment".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=67}} The notice to move reverted to 30 days in June and pushed out to 42 days in September 1979, when the unit was formally released from standby.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=68}} The notice to move was increased to 60 days in March 1982, and 75 days in November 1986. In July 1987, all remaining specific readiness requirements were removed.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=69}}

===Activation===
Horner wrote that the government had been following the course of negotiations, "but in view of the history of false alarms they were not inclined to react until Angola, Cuba and South Africa signed the protocol in Geneva" in August 1988.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=75}} Two weeks later the UN wrote, asking Australia to reconfirm its previous commitment; within a month, Cabinet reaffirmed the commitment of a decade earlier. [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (CDF) [[Peter Gration|General Peter Gration]] then placed the unit on 28 days' notice to move.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=76}}

After the notice was reactivated, detailed planning recommenced (essentially from scratch). Changes made to the organisation of the force approved ten years earlier were only minor.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=77}} After many years of notice, there was still skepticism that the deployment would ever occur. The government and army were cautious about the timing of the commitment of funds; significant funding was only released in late 1988, a few months before deployment. The squadron's equipment deficiencies were valued at $16&amp;nbsp;million, and there was a need to buy $700,000 of equipment immediately.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=78}} The UN initially estimated the cost of the entire operation at $US1&amp;nbsp;billion, equivalent to its own budget.{{sfn|Ashton|9 December 1988}} The reluctance to commit funds ultimately reduced training of the deployed forces; Senator [[Jo Vallentine]] said in Parliament that the Namibia operation nearly fell apart due to a lack of advance funding, and Senator [[Jocelyn Newman]] called it disgraceful.{{sfn|Hansard – J. Vallentine|1991}}{{sfn|Hansard – J. Newman|1989a}} The UN General Assembly did not approve the UNTAG budget until 1 March 1989, less than two weeks before the advance party deployed and after the deployment of the start-up team.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=80}} Gration authorised Operation Picaresque on 3 March 1989.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=80}}{{#tag:ref|Gration, the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] at the time issued two directives in the first week of March, one to the Chief of the General Staff, [[Lawrence O'Donnell (general)|Lieutenant General Lawrence O'Donnell]] (CDF Directive 1/1989), ordering him to provide an engineer force to Namibia in an operation to be known as ''Operation Picaresque''. The second directive (CDF 2/1989) was to Warren, appointing him commander of the Australian contingent, a "national command appointment" in which he was to report directly to the CDF on matters relating to national policy.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=80}}|group=Note}} In addition to a lack of funds, there was little intelligence on Namibia; the region was "generally unknown to the Australian public, the policy-makers and to the troops and civilians who deployed there".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=45}}

==={{anchor|Build up and deployment}}Buildup and deployment===
The first staff were posted to the new contingent headquarters at [[Holsworthy Barracks]] in September 1988. At the same time, Major J.J. Hutchings was deployed as liaison officer to UN HQ in New York.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=77}}{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989a|p=}} In October, the CDF formally tasked the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS) to raise, train, equip and support the force for Namibia.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=77}} By December the two units comprising 1ASC had been raised from more than thirty different units of the Australian Army, and were being trained and prepared for deployment.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=78}} Equipment, vehicles and weapons were procured, transferred from across the army and prepared at Moorebank; this included the painting of all vehicles and major equipment items in UN livery and packing items for transport to Namibia. During the buildup it was recognised that the families required support during the deployment, and Network 17 was established to support the mostly Sydney-based soldiers' and officers' families.{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=46}}

Hutchings was sent to Namibia as a member of the start-up team, arriving in Windhoek on 19 February 1989.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=77}} Warren attended the contingent commanders' briefing at UN HQ from 22 to 24 February 1989,{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=78}} and then flew with Prem Chand to Frankfurt, West Germany to meet the other senior members of UNTAG.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=79}}

The 1ASC advance party, comprising 36 officers and men, were deployed by USAF [[C-5 Galaxy]] via [[RAAF Learmonth]] and [[Diego Garcia]] to Windhoek. They arrived at 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 11 March 1989 and were met by Australian Ambassador to South Africa Colin MacDonald, Warren and Hutchings. The 17th Construction Squadron advance party of ten deployed by road to [[Grootfontein]] on 13 March 1989. The squadron's advance echelon, comprising 59 personnel (including the 14th Field Troop), arrived by USAF C5 Galaxy at Grootfontein on 14 March 1989.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=84}} The remainder of 1ASC were commended by Prime Minister Bob Hawke at a farewell parade at Holsworthy Barracks on 5 April 1989. The main body then deployed by [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] [[Boeing 707]] aircraft on 14 April.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=85}}

The force deployed with a large quantity of construction and other equipment, including 24 [[Land Rover]]s, 19 [[Unimog]] all-terrain vehicles, 26 heavy trucks, 43 trailers, eight bulldozers and a variety of other road-building equipment such as graders, scrapers and rollers. The support workshop added a further 40 vehicles, and over 1,800 tonnes of stores were shipped with the contingent's equipment.{{sfn|Hansard – B. Hawke|1989a}} There was a total of over 200 wheeled and tracked vehicles and trailers and a large quantity of dangerous cargo (demolition explosives and ammunition). The UN hired the MV ''Mistra'' for the deployment. It departed Sydney on 23 March; the equipment was unloaded at [[Walvis Bay]] in mid-April, moving by road and rail to the South African Defence Force Logistics Base at Grootfontein.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=100}}

By 31 March, 14th Field Troop had completed its mine-awareness training; only [[Lieutenant]] Stephen Alexander and five others remained at [[Oshakati]], the main SADF base in the north of the country. During the early hours of 1 April an SADF aircraft began dropping flares, and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds landed near the base. This signalled the start of an intense period of conflict, and Alexander's team was quickly withdrawn to Grootfontein. What had occurred was the infiltration of a large number of PLAN combatants (about 1,600), re-entering Namibia from Angola.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=89}}{{#tag:ref|The Associated Press reported that 1,900 SWAPO guerillas crossed the border.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989f}}|group=Note}} Accounts differed, but Hearn stated that all of those interviewed at the time made it clear that "they did not enter Namibia for war, but to seek out the UN".{{sfn|Hearn|1999|p=101}} Reuters reported that SWAPO demanded the right to establish bases in Namibia.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989e|p=}} The large size of the PLAN forces and the very small number of deployed UN forces (less than 1,000 at the time) meant that the UN had very little intelligence, and was unable to respond in force. Sitkowski wrote that the UN should have been informed about the high probability of SWAPO infiltration, but this did not occur.{{sfn|Getz|6 April 1989|p=10}}{{sfn|Sitkowski|2006|p=82}} The Australians were the first to know about the incursion, but they only found out informally via church sources at the Pastoral Centre (the accommodations for headquarters staff).{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=88}}

The UN had only two police observers in the north of the country at the time, and the South African government pressured the UN to allow its forces to leave their bases and respond. On 1 April the SRSG authorised the SADF to leave their bases, and they responded in force. By 5 April the UN reported that it only had 300 troops in the north of the country, including 97 Australians.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989b}}{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989c|p=9}} On 7 April Reuters reported that [[Louis Pienaar]] had assured safe passage out of the war-torn north of the country if fighting ceased, and had called on SWAPO to surrender to the police; he also warned that if they did not respond, "the police will have no other option than to pursue you with all means at their disposal".{{sfn|Steele|1989|p=}} Reuters reported that 73 SWAPO guerillas were killed on 8 April, 34 in a single action.{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989e|p=}} It was later estimated that over the three-week period following the incursion 251 PLAN combatants were killed, with the loss of 21 members of the SADF and other security forces.{{#tag:ref|The South Africans claimed that the Koevoet killed 294 insurgents and captured 14, while the SADF and SWATF killed another 18 and captured 26. The police lost 20 killed and the SADF five.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=91}}|group=Note}}

The SWAPO incursion became a complex political issue, and led to a week of tense negotiations. The UN considered emergency airlifts to bring more peacekeepers into the territory, and the United States offered aid.{{sfn|Steele|1989|p=}} On 9 April 1989 an agreement was reached at Mount Etjo{{#tag:ref|A game park outside [[Otjiwarongo]] in central-north Namibia.|group=Note}} (the Mount Etjo Declaration), calling for the rapid deployment of UNTAG forces and outlining a withdrawal procedure for PLAN soldiers (Operation Safe Passage) under which they would leave the country. Operation Piddock was the name for the Australian part of the operation. Horner wrote that if UNTAG were to play any role in ending the fighting, it was obvious that the Australians would be the key component. This was complex, and required authorisation from Gration and [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Defence Minister]] [[Kim Beazley]] for Australian troops to supervise the withdrawal of insurgent forces. It required the Australian Army engineers and British signallers to work as infantry, manning border and internal-assembly points. At the time, these were the only units which could be redeployed quickly to northern Namibia.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=91}}{{sfn|Getz|10 April 1989|p=1}}{{sfn|Getz|11 April 1989|p=9}}

The aim of the operation was to facilitate the withdrawal of PLAN combatants. South African Foreign Minister [[Pik Botha]] confined all South African troops to their base for 60 hours, allowing SWAPO guerillas to leave the country unhindered.{{sfn|Dowden|1989|p=}}{{#tag:ref|The Independent reported that [[Hidipo Hamutenya]], SWAPO's Head of Information in London stated that eighteen SWAPO guerillas had been "shot in the back as they tried to cross the border".{{sfn|Dowden|1989|p=}}|group=Note}} Nine assembly points were established by the UN, with up to twelve soldiers and five military observers at each. Six of the assembly points (APs) were led by Australians: Captain Richard Bradshaw (contingent signals officer) at AP Charlie ([[Ruacana]]), Sergeant Kerry Ponting (Squadron workshop) at AP Foxtrot ([[Oshikango]]), Captain Mark Hender (Squadron Operations Officer) at AP Juliet (Okankolo), Lieutenant Stephen Alexander (Field troop commander) at AP Delta (Beacon 7, west of Oshikango), Lieutenant Mark Broome (Plant Troop Officer) AP Bravo (Ruacana) and Lieutenant Pat Sowry (Liaison Officer) AP Kilo ([[Oshikuku]]).{{sfn|Horner|2011|pp=91–96}} Most of the assembly points had intense media scrutiny. The intention of the operation was for PLAN combatants to assemble at these points. They would then be escorted across the border north to the 16th parallel to their bases of confinement, but the operation was unsuccessful. Very few PLAN combatants passed through these points; for the most part, they withdrew across the border by walking independently. It was estimated that 200 to 400 PLAN members remained in Namibia, absorbed into the local community. Agreement was subsequently reached in late April that the SADF personnel be restricted to their bases from 26 April; in effect, hostilities ended after that date.{{sfn|Hearn|1999|pp=101–102}}{{sfn|Wren|1989|p=}}{{sfn|The Age|1989|p=}}

This was a stressful time for Australian soldiers deployed to these checkpoints.{{sfn|Getz|14 April 1989|p=8}} The South Africans were determined to intimidate the UN forces, and SWAPO casualties occurred in the immediate vicinity of several checkpoints. The South Africans set up in force immediately adjacent to many checkpoints, pointed machine guns at the Australians and demanded that they hand over SWAPO soldiers who had surrendered. The Australian and British soldiers were outnumbered and out-gunned.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=94}} Despite the fact that only nine SWAPO appeared at the points, the operation was a political success. Lieutenant Colonel Neil Donaldson, commander of the British contingent, said that "the world press showed Australian and British soldiers standing up to a bunch of South African bullies".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=96}} Crocker said that the fact that the Australian soldiers completed this operation without any casualties was a tribute to the "training standards of the Australian Army and perhaps, a bit of good luck".{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=6}} The conclusion of Operation Piddock meant that the Australians were able to begin their engineering tasks.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=99}}

===Return of refugees===
[[File:1989 Entrance to the Australian base at Ondangwa.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=Photograph of the front entrance to the Australian base at Ondangwa from inside the wire|Front entrance to the Australian base at Ondangwa occupied by 9th Construction Troop on 24 June 1989]]
The UN plan required that all exiled Namibians be given the opportunity to return to their country in time to participate in the electoral process. This was implemented by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), supported by a number of other UN agencies and programmes. In Namibia, the [[Council of Churches in Namibia]] (CCN) was UNHCR's implementing partner. Most returning Namibians returned from Angola; many came from Zambia, and a small number came from 46 other countries after the proclamation of a general amnesty. The logistics of managing the returnees was largely delegated to the Australian contingent.{{sfn|United Nations|2012|p=}}

Three air and three land entry points were established, as well as five reception centres. Four centres were designed by Namibia Consult Incorporated under the directorship of [[Klaus Dierks]], and constructed by the Australian contingent. The centres were located at Dobra, Mariabronn (near Grootfontein) and at [[Ongwediva]] and Engela in [[Ovamboland]]. They were administered under the auspices of the Repatriation, Resettlement and Reconstruction Committee of the CCN.{{sfn|Dierks|1989|p=}}

The 8th Construction Troop (under Lieutenant Geoff Burchell) constructed a camp and managed the reception centre at Engela, less than {{convert|5|km}} from the Angolan border; the 9th Construction Troop (under Lieutenant Andrew Stanner) constructed a similar camp and managed the reception centre at Ongwediva. The SADF continued attempts to intimidate the Australians and disrupt operations, but their actions had little effect. In late April an SADF aircraft dropped flares at night over the 9th Construction Troop base at Ongwediva, and explosions (possibly mortar rounds) were heard nearby.{{sfn|United Nations|2012|p=}}{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989}}

Security, services and logistics at the reception centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG, and a number of secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was kept under constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.{{sfn|United Nations|2012|p=}}

===Accommodation and other works===
[[File:1989 Opuwo airstrip.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=Photograph of the airstrip at Opuwo|Opuwo airstrip during upgrade by the [[17th Construction Squadron (Australia)|17th Construction Squadron]] during its deployment. This project was undertaken in support of the local community as a nation-building exercise.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}}]]
For the remainder of its deployment, the first contingent focused most of its efforts on providing accommodations for electoral centres and police stations. These were typically manned by only two or three police (or civilian) electoral staff and were almost always in small, remote villages. Buildings were leased, a large number of [[Travel trailer|caravans]] purchased and deployed and prefabricated buildings constructed in about 50 locations. Much of this was done by the Resources Troop (under Lieutenant Stuart Graham), centrally controlled by squadron construction officer Captain Shane Miller.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=107}}

The largest plant task undertaken during the deployment was the construction of an airstrip at [[Opuwo]]. The squadron commander, Major David Crago, described how the road network in Namibia was better than expected; in retrospect, the squadron brought too much heavy road-making equipment. The squadron deployed 20 members of the Plant Troop (under Captain Nigel Catchlove) to Opuwo. Over a period of four months, Sergeant Ken Roma constructed an all-weather airstrip in one of the most remote parts of Namibia.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=109}}

===Force rotation===
The first contingent returned to Australia in September and October 1989, Warren reporting that he was "amazed that none of his men was killed or seriously hurt during the tour of duty".{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989h|p=3}} Planning for the second contingent had begun as soon as the first contingent had deployed. Colonel John Crocker was appointed as the contingent commander, and was given the task of raising the force.{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=6}} Unlike the first contingent, which had been built around the 17th Construction Squadron and had maintained that unit's structure, the second contingent had to be built from scratch.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=120}} It deployed to Namibia between September and early October 1989.{{sfn|Hansard – T. Fischer|October 1989}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=119}}

===Election preparation and Operation Poll Gallop===
The security environment in Namibia changed in the lead-up to the election, including violence in Namibia and an increase in fighting between FAPLA and UNITA troops across the border in Angola. Horner wrote that the Australian contingent was not directly involved in "dealing with the violence", but the increased violence changed the nature of the mission.{{sfn|Horner|2011|pp=122–123}} It was initially envisioned that the military component of UNTAG would only provide communications and logistic support to the election. In September the role was broadened to include hundreds of electoral monitors, and in October (after detailed planning and reconnaissance of all polling stations) the Australian contingent deployed a ready-reaction force. At the same time the 15th Field Troop (under Lieutenant Brent Maddock) was deployed, making the first entry into a live minefield by Australian troops since the Vietnam War.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=123}}

Operation Poll Gallop was the name given to the largely logistic operation to support the Namibian elections. Activities began with 1ASC from May 1989 onward, but became the primary task for 2ASC:{{sfn|Forbes|1989|p=1}}{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=36}}
* '''Service support:''' Support was provided to approximately 500 electoral centres and police stations through the siting and erection of permanent (or portable) accommodations and the provision of essential services. UNTAG deployed over 350 polling stations; the Australian contingent constructed and provided support (including sanitary facilities) at 120 stations in the northern areas of [[Kaokoland]], [[Ovamboland]] and West [[Hereroland]].{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=124}}
* '''Construction engineering:''' This included the construction, modification or upgrade of UNTAG working and living accommodations, provision of essential services (power, water and air-traffic-control facilities) and the maintenance and upgrade of roads.
* '''Ready Reaction Force:''' The squadron formed a reinforced Field Troop (50 soldiers) in [[Buffel]] mine-proof vehicles as a ready-reaction force at Ondangwa, deploying to the 15 most-sensitive locations in Ovamboland and practising actions to stabilise a hostile (but not violent) situation in which Australians might be involved. On two occasions during the November 1989 election, the ASC Ready-Reaction Force was used to disperse rioters.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=125}}
* '''Australian military electoral monitors:''' The Australian contingent provided a team of thirty monitors headed by Lieutenant Colonel Peter Boyd, legal officer for the second contingent.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=125}}

Colonel John Crocker, commander of 2ASC, wrote: "For much of the mission, but particularly during the lead-up to the election, all members of the ASC worked, often well away from their bases, in a security environment which at best could be termed uneasy and on many occasions was definitely hazardous. The deeply divided political factions, which included thousands of de-mobilised soldiers from both sides, had easy access to weapons including machine guns and grenades. This situation resulted in a series of violent incidents including assassinations and reprisal killings which culminated in the deaths of 11 civilians and the wounding of 50 others in street battles in the northern town of Oshakati just before the election".{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=6}} Land mines and unexploded ammunition continued to cause injury and death; even during the week of the election, there were incidents.{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=322}}

===Post-election and return to Australia===
[[File:Australian Army land rover used in UNTAG.JPG|thumb|350px|alt=Photograph of a Land Rover used in Namibia on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra|Land Rover used in Namibia on display at the [[Australian War Memorial]], 2012]]
[[File:1990 03 02 CGS Commendation for UNTAG.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Copy of the Commendation from the Chief of the General Staff presented to the Australian contingent|Copy of the CGS Commendation presented to the Australian contingent to UNTAG]]
After the election, the contingent was able to focus almost exclusively on construction tasks. In addition to ongoing maintenance, these included taking over barracks and accommodations from the SADF and twelve non-UNTAG tasks in support of the local community as nation-building exercises.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}} These included:
*'''Opuwo airfield:''' The major task was the completion of the airfield upgrade at Opuwo begun by the first contingent. A detachment from Captain Kurt Heidecker's Plant Troop, supported by a section from 9th Construction Troop, worked over Christmas to complete these works (which included resurfacing and shaping the runway, drainage and installing culverts).{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}}
*'''Andara Catholic Mission hydroelectric plant:''' A team under Lieutenant Nick Rowntree upgraded a 900-metre supply channel for the [[Andara]] hydroelectric plant.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}}
*'''Classrooms in Tsumeb:''' [[Sapper]]s from the rear of the squadron constructed a number of classrooms for an Anglican school in a black neighbourhood in [[Tsumeb]] with funds provided by the Australian Liaison Office.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=133}}

Other tasks carried out by the squadron included Operation Make Safe, which took place in February and March 1990. The Field Troop conducted a reconnaissance of 10 known minefields, repaired perimeter fences and installed signs.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=134}}

The contingent began preparations for its return to Australia in December 1989. In January 1990 new works stopped,  manning of forward bases was reduced and stores and equipment were packed and prepared for sea. The Australian forces returned in four sorties on chartered commercial aircraft, the first departing Namibia on 6 February. The contingent's equipment loaded aboard the MV ''Kwang Tung'', which left Walvis Bay on 22 February.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=140}} The withdrawal included support from Australian logistics experts, a psychologist to conduct end-of-tour debriefings and a finance officer. The last demolition task was undertaken at Ondangwa on 25 March, and the last elements of the rear party left Namibia on 9 April 1990.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=141}} During the deployment there were no fatalities; although at least 10 soldiers were treated for malaria, there were few serious injuries.{{sfn|Sampson|1989|p=}}{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|The Canberra Times|1989g|p=}}

Despite being deployed to provide engineering support,
when the ceasefire broke down at the start of the mission, members of the squadron helped establish Assembly Points, which enabled the mission to continue. This activity was conducted in the face of hostility from elements of the former colonial power and personal danger arising from the breakdown of the cease fire. Later, 17 Construction Squadron became involved in the election process itself, providing security, transport and logistic support to election officials, monitors, other UN personnel, voters and polling stations. Members of 17 Construction Squadron ensured that, as much as possible, the election was able to proceed without interruption or interference and ensured that all parties were free from intimidation or duress. With the selfless support of individuals from other units of the Australian Defence Force, 17 Construction Squadron played a key role in the smooth and effective transition of Namibia from colonial rule to independence. The Squadron performed a role well beyond what was expected and brought great credit on itself, the Australian Army and Australia.

A number of governments linked the award of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] to UN Peacekeepers in 1988 to the UNTAG operation, but the award was shared by peacekeepers and peacekeeping operations worldwide. [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]] mentioned a number of UN peacekeeping operations (including Namibia) in his [[Nobel Prize#Nobel lecture|Nobel lecture]] in Oslo on 9 January 1989. Senator [[Graham Richardson]] also made similar comments in the [[Australian Senate]].{{sfn|Hansard – G. Richardson|1989}}{{sfn|Nobel Committee|1988|p=}}{{sfn|Pérez de Cuéllar|1989|p=}}{{sfn|House of Commons Debates|1989|p=397}}

The Australian UNTAG contingents were awarded a [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] Commendation. The award was presented to both contingents by Defence Minister Beazley at a 2 March 1990 parade in Holsworthy honouring those who had served in eleven UN (and other) peacekeeping operations.{{#tag:ref|The commendation was held in trust by 17th Construction Squadron but was destroyed in a fire, although copies had been made.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=142}}|group=Note}}

In April 2012, Army Chief [[David Morrison|Lieutenant General David Morrison, AO]] approved a recommendation for the award of the first Honour Distinction to the 17th Construction Squadron. This is awarded to units (or sub-units) in recognition of service under operational conditions in security-related, peacekeeping, [[peace enforcement]] and similar operations.{{sfn|Defence Instruction|2012|p=}} The award was presented to the unit by [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[Quentin Bryce]] on 11 May 2013.{{sfn|Morrison|2012a|p=}}{{sfn|Morrison|2012b}}

==Operational and other issues==

==={{anchor|Force or Chief Engineer}}Force Chief Engineer===
The appointment of Colonel Richard Warren as Chief Engineer was opposed by both [[Marrack Goulding]] (UN Undersecretary General for Special Political Affairs) and [[Cedric Thornberry]] (Director of the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General). The UN had planned on a civilian filling this role and working primarily with civilian contractors; in all subsequent UN missions, the senior engineer was a civilian. The UN resisted appointing Warren until the "last minute", with final approval only given on 1 March. Warren recalled that this gave him "an abnormal amount of authority and a remarkable degree of responsibility".{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=75}}

===Weapons and rules of engagement===
The contingents were faced with a number of issues concerning weapons and rules of engagement:
* '''Rules of Engagement:''' A major issue for the contingents concerned [[Rules of Engagement]] (ROE) and Orders for Opening Fire (OFOF). In 1989 the UN had no [[doctrine]] in this area, and was unable to develop any during the mission. The Australian contingent used standard ROE prepared before the deployment.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=94}}
*'''Machine guns:''' The UN required the Australians to deploy without the belt-fed [[M60 machine gun]], the standard section-level automatic weapon at the time. Instead, the contingent was required to deploy with World War II-vintage [[Bren light machine gun]]s, since these used only a 30-round magazine (the weapons had been rebuilt to accept 7.62mm ammunition).{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=100}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=94}}
*'''Deployment without weapons:''' On a number of occasions, soldiers were asked to deploy without weapons by UNTAG civilian officials. Early in the deployment Lieutenants Burchell and Stanner were asked by UNHCR to conduct an unarmed reconnaissance, but permission was refused. Near the election, Australian military electoral monitors were asked to deploy in civilian clothes without weapons.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=125}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=129}}

===Land mines and UXO===
[[File:1989 Field section on patrol in Casspir.jpg|thumb|350px|alt=Photograph of field engineers from 14th Field Troop on patrol in Owamboland in a Buffel mine-protected vehicle|Field engineers from the 14th Field Troop on patrol in [[Owamboland]] (near [[Ongwediva]]) in a [[Buffel]] mine-protected vehicle]]
[[Land mine]]s were used by the SADF and SWAPO and became a major feature of the war, triggering the development of mine-protected vehicles (MPV). The SADF typically laid marked, fenced, [[anti-personnel mine]]fields as perimeter protection for bases and vital assets. It laid a reported 45,000 mines during the conflict, of which 3,000 were unaccounted-for when UNTAG arrived.{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}} SWAPO used mines for ambushing or intimidation. Mines were laid individually or in clusters; [[anti-tank mine]]s were often stacked. The mines were obtained from South Africa, the USSR, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. After initial training by the SADF's 25th Field Squadron, an early task of the Field Troop was to conduct mine-awareness training for the other contingents. For the remainder of the deployment, much of the work of the 75 field engineers was clearing exposed mines, marking minefields and clearing routes.{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=86}} Crocker wrote, "for the first time since the Vietnam War, Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines. Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission. Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO) ranging from artillery shells, through RPG rockets to grenades. UXO, a legacy of the 20-year Bush War, posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area".{{sfn|Crocker|1991|p=6}}

To support the deployment, the UN leased a number of mine-protected vehicles from the SADF. Most were Buffels, but smaller numbers of [[Casspir]] and [[Wolf Armoured Vehicle|Wolf]] vehicles were also leased. These vehicles had excellent mobility, and were well-suited to operations in the harsh Namibian terrain.{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=32}}{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=118}}{{sfn|Thornberry|2004|p=151}} The contingent also trialled [[Thermal imaging camera|thermal-intensifier]] technologies, in what is thought to be the first operational use of this technology.{{sfn|Getz|5 August 1989|pp=49–52}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=106}}

===Radio communications===
One of the major difficulties early in the deployment to Namibia was poor [[radio communications]]. The Australian contingent was equipped with PRC-F1 [[High frequency|HF radios]] (manufactured by [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)|AWA)]], first issued to the Australian army in 1969. Output power was limited to one or ten watts [[Peak envelope power|PEP]]. HF radio communications were frequently impossible in the early month or two of the deployment. The primary factor was the [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm]], exacerbated by [[skip zone]], and [[ground plane]] effects resulting from the sandy environment and the high water table.  Detachments were often out of radio contact for extended periods, with no satisfactory alternate means of communication except couriers. Because the Australian force operated over large distances, with troop deployments often up to {{convert|700|km}} from squadron or force headquarters, courier communications often took days. Later in the deployment, the UN provided the contingent with higher-powered (100W) Motorola Micom X state-of-the-art HF equipment.{{sfn|Sowry|1992|pp=50–51}}

===Controversy and intimidation===
A number of observers noted that the UNTAG soldiers were not particularly popular with Namibia's 80,000 white residents. Shortly after the Australian advance party arrived in Namibia a pro-Pretoria newspaper accused Australian officers of breaching UN impartiality by attending a cocktail party at which leading members of SWAPO were present, and the incident was widely reported in the international press.{{sfn|Getz|3 April 1989}}{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=85}}{{sfn|Younghusband|1989|p=}} Soon afterwards, four Australian and four British soldiers were beaten by a large crowd in [[Tsumeb]], about {{convert|70|km}} from squadron headquarters in Grootfontein.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=87}} During the first few weeks of the deployment, on a number of occasions SADF soldiers discharged firearms in the direction of the Australian contingent or pointed firearms at Australians as a means of intimidation.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=112}} Corporal Paul Shepherd reported that during Operation Piddock, an SADF soldier threw a grenade (which did not explode) at his assembly point near Ruacana; during the night the South Africans fired in their direction, putting bullet holes in their Unimog truck.{{sfn|Horner|2011|p=93}}

===Other concerns===
Before the deployment there was controversy about the government's non-resolution of repatriation entitlements and peacekeeper coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, and it had not decided if the deployment would be considered operational service. The pay and allowance issues were resolved; many other conditions-of-service issues were identified, but not resolved.{{sfn|Hansard – T. Fisher|March 1989}}{{sfn|Fischer|9 April 1989}}{{sfn|Hansard – J. Newman|1989b}} During the deployment few issues were brought to Parliament's attention, although the issue of mail censorship was raised.{{sfn|Hansard – R. Tickner|1989}} During the second contingent's rotation, the soldiers' families had a full-time welfare officer tasked with supporting them.{{sfn|Sowry|1992|p=46}}

After the deployment, the issues of appropriate service conditions, awards and recognition took many years to resolve. After serving the required 90-day period, contingent members were entitled to the [[Australian Service Medal]] (ASM) for non-warlike service. About 12 years after their return to Australia, the government changed the status of the operation; contingent members were eligible for the [[Australian Active Service Medal#Returned from Active Service Badge|Returned from Active Service Badge]], and their ASMs were upgraded to the [[Australian Active Service Medal]] (AASM).{{sfn|Commonwealth Gazette|2001|p=}}{{sfn|Defence Honours|2012|p=}} After the 2002 decision Major Nigel Catchlove wrote to the ''[[Army (newspaper)|Army]]'' newspaper, calling it a "pointless upgrade" and saying it "detracts from the award of the AASM to those who truly deserve it". In his letter, Catchlove compared the UNTAG operation to two subsequent operations: the [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] deployment to Somalia during [[Operation Solace]] and the deployment of service personnel as part of the [[International Force for East Timor]]: "both of those operations involved robust rules of engagement appropriate to the intervention of forces in UN-sanctioned, US or Australian-led multi-national coalitions. UNTAG by way of contrast was a classic peacekeeping operation led by the UN in a relatively benign environment where rules of engagement were focused only on force protection". Catchlove questioned the "half-hearted approach to implementing this appalling decision" in which eligible people must apply for the upgrade, saying this "failed the test of commonsense".{{sfn|Catchlove|2002|p=}}

A '''Bachelor of Education''' (B.Ed.) is a [[bachelor's degree|graduate]] [[professional degree]] which prepares students for work as a teacher in schools, though in some countries additional work must be done in order for the student to be fully qualified to teach.

==USA and Canada==
In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], this degree is awarded for coursework completed within a program lasting one to five years, depending on the requirements established by the place where the province or state in which the university is located. In Canada, a B.Ed. degree is required for teaching certification.

A B.Ed. program may have direct entry from high school; as a combined degree with another bachelor's degree (e.g., B.A./B.Ed.); or as an after-degree program where the candidate has obtained a bachelor's degree, usually in the field in which the student wishes to teach. A good rapport or previous experience with young children or teens is also a desired characteristic of applicants.

There are several streams to a Bachelor of Education, each corresponding to the particular level of instruction. In the [[United States]], this includes [[elementary school]] education, [[middle school]] education, and [[high school]] education. Students in the elementary education stream generally study for a [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] degree. In the high school (secondary education) stream, the student specializes in one to two subject areas. Upon completion of the degree, they will prepare and eventually sit for the state's Board of Education certification examination.

A typical B.Ed. program may include coursework in [[pedagogy]], educational psychology, educational policy and leadership, assessment, curriculum development; and lesson planning, social justice, special education, and instructional technology.

==Australia==
In Australia, a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. In the majority of Australian universities, there is usually 2 distinct types of the Bachelor of Education: Primary and Secondary. The subjects and degree programs are quite different in both degrees e.g. for a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Primary) the focus of their degree would lie in behaviour, children, basic literacy, how children learn etc. For a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) they would therefore be teaching roughly 11- to 18-year-old adolescents and their programs would have less focus on those kinds of areas by the Primary degree. Instead, the degree is based around the student's intending teaching subjects; usually 1 or 2. In NSW, these teaching areas provide the major focus for their degrees in their final years. They consist of: English, Mathematics, Science (Biology, Physics &amp; Chemistry), Geography, History, Business Studies, Legal Studies, Economics, Society &amp; Culture and Languages.
The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Most Australian State Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or a bachelor's degree in one or two subject areas, with a Graduate Diploma in Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an 'End-On' course similar but slightly longer than a Graduate Diploma in Education.

Note: In Australia, the term Undergraduate Degree is used to describe all degrees undertaken by a first-time university student and usually no pre-requisite tertiary level studies are required, mostly just the completion of Secondary High School. Postgraduate degrees are used to describe the degrees completed with an Undergraduate degree as pre-requisite.

==Bangladesh==
In [[Bangladesh]], Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate professional degree for Hons. (4 years) and Diploma (1/2/3 years) in Education offered by the authorized Teachers Training Institutes or Colleges for those aimed their profession as a Teacher or as an Education and Curriculum Specialist or as an Educationalist in the government and non-governmental educational institutes or any educational organizations such as [[Save the Children]], [[UNICEF]], [[United Nations Development Programme]], BFES, SSUF, ASA etc. B.Ed. degree is mandatory for the teaching profession in both of primary and Secondary school level. Without teaching profession, if anyone wants to go other professions such as education &amp; curriculum specialist, researcher, administrator etc. in any educational or other sectors, he/she must have the minimum qualification of Hons. graduation degree in Education (B.Ed. hons. degree). Every year many talent Hons. graduate students from this subject get international scholarship from well known universities of other countries like [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[United States|USA]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] etc. The minimum qualification required for entry into '''B.Ed. Hons. (4 years)''' course is passed H.S.C or Equivalent and for entry into Diploma (1/2/3 years) course in education is [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc). The Hons. students of this subject have to read basic educational course contents as their major courses with some minor subject courses. In addition, usually for diploma (1/2/3 years) students from Arts faculty are trained to lecture subjects like history, civics, geography and languages and from Science faculty are trained to follow their lecture on mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology etc. whereas graduates from Commerce faculty trained up to lecture on accounting &amp; finance, economics, management &amp; marketing. After B.Ed. hons., one can continue for Master in Education (M.Ed.), M.Phil, PhD.D in Education in some universities of Bangladesh. National Council for Education and related Universities as well as their institutions is the constitutional authority to standardize courses for the educationalist and teachers in Bangladesh.

==Israel==
In Israel, Bachelor of Education(B.Ed.) is a course offered Suitable for those interested in developing the field. Developed unique training programs tailored contemporary trends in professional training for teaching. In addition, there are plans Sitting studies of academics and teachers complete undergraduate studies. In Israel there are a number of colleges and universities offering B.Ed. studies as [[:he:מכללת לוינסקי לחינוך|Levinsky College of Education]] and B.Sc.Ed. at The Technion - Israel Institute of Technology

==India==
In India, Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate course offered for those interested in pursuing a career in teaching. The B.Ed. degree is mandatory for teaching at the secondary (classes 6 to 10) and higher secondary (10+2 or classes 11 and 12). The minimum qualification required for entry into B.Ed. course is [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc.). While students from the Arts stream are trained to teach subjects like History, Civics, Geography, and languages, the students from the Science stream are trained to teach Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The duration of the course is two years from session 2015-16 as per NCTE Regulations, 2014. After B.Ed., students can pursue [[Master of Education]] (M.Ed.) in any Indian university or teacher-training institutes offering the course. The [[National Council for Teacher Education]] is the statutory body which regulating teacher training courses in the country of India.

The Right to Free and Compulsory Education for Children (RTE Act 2009) came into force from April 2010. The act emphasizes on quality education for every child. As such, with the view to bring about quality education in schools, it is required that the entry level percentage to B.Ed. be 50 for those candidates in the General Category and 45 for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The Bachelor of Elementary Education (B.El.Ed.) programme is a four-year integrated professional degree programme offered after the higher secondary stage of school. B.El.Ed. is designed to integrate the study of subject knowledge, human development, pedagogical knowledge, and communication skills. Both professional and academic options are available to students who graduate with a B.El.Ed. degree.

==Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. Modules in the [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language]]s are compulsory.

Students study a range of Education-related subjects, including Psychology, Sociology, History, Social Policy, Professional Practice. Students also study subjects from another field or discipline as qualification for an intended teaching area or method.

The degree is available in several specialisations, including Primary, Secondary, Human Movement/Health, Music, or Early Childhood education. The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or an Undergraduate/Bachelor's Degree in one or two subject areas, with a Diploma of Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an 'End-On' course similar but slightly longer than a Diploma of Education.

==New Zealand==
The 3-year Bachelor of Education prepares graduates to teach in early childhood centres, primary and intermediate schools. With the Bachelor of Education one can specialise in Primary, Early Childhood, Physical Education and Huarahi Māori. The qualification is designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to be effective teachers, and to gain provisional registration with the New Zealand Teachers Council. Teaching practicums allow students to gain invaluable experience in diverse education settings as they study. The Bachelor of Education can lead on to further postgraduate study.

== Nigeria ==
In [[Nigeria]], the Bachelor of Education degree is awarded at Universities and Colleges of Education across the nation as a first degree. There are a few specialised Universities of Education in the country that exist to train teachers professionally. Some of these specialised Universities include [[Tai Solarin University of Education]] and [[Ignatius Ajuru University of Education]]. The B.Ed can be done as combined honours with a B.A. or B.Sc. It can also be done as a single honours degree with specialisations in Nursery and Primary Education, Curriculum Development, Educational Administration and Policy Studies, among others. Students usually undergo intensive teaching practices at the 2nd and 3rd years of study. Upon graduation, they are registered by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) and can be employed as teachers afterwards. Postgraduate education usually take the form of an [[Master of Education|M.Ed]], PGDE, and GDE.

==Sri Lanka==
The Bachelor of Education degree was first introduced by the [[University of Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka) in 1963. Prof. J. E. Jayasuriya, then Professor of Education at University of Ceylon introduced the course to meet the growing demand for professional teacher qualifications. Then the practice was to join the teaching profession with a bachelor's degree either in Arts or Sciences and after four years of teaching in a Secondary school teachers get the One year Post-Graduate Diploma in Education.

The University of Ceylon used to take only 50 -60 Post Graduate Diploma candidates at a time in an annual program. The B.Ed. degree was introduced combining the bachelor's degree and the Post Graduate Diploma in Education. B.Ed. was introduced as a four-year special degree and in contrast with the 9 - 10 3hr papers at the final degree examination, a B.Ed. degree required a candidates to sit for 19 - 20 papers for the finals. This happened due to combining of the bachelor's degree and the Post-graduate Diploma in Education. Only the top performing students were admitted to B.Ed. degree at University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. The first batch graduated in 1967. Following this Australia introduced the B.Ed. degree. Upali M Sedere was the first First Class holder of the B.Ed. degree from University of Ceylon, Peradeniya in 1969. Subsequently, in 1973, the B.Ed. program at the University of Sri Lanka changed in its scope and character.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]], where both the [[university]] system and [[school]] system are very different, the degree is awarded after a three or four-year course (the course length depends on the university) which is specifically tailored to either [[primary education]] or for a limited range of [[secondary education]] subjects. It leads to [[Qualified Teacher Status]] (QTS) in England and Wales and is a [[teaching qualification]] in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

As a result of the [[Robbins Report|Robbins Report on higher education (1963)]], the teacher training colleges were reformed as [[College of education|Colleges of Education]]. Such colleges, as in the case of those in London, became 'constituent colleges' of the [[Institute of Education]], with their academic award being from the [[University of London]]. Students were offered an extra year of study, bringing the course up to four years in length and resulting in the award of the Bachelor of Education degree. The first Bachelors of Education graduated in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atm.org.uk/mt/archive/mt196files/ATM-MT196-03-07.pdf atm.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BEd became more widespread in the early 1980s, when a [[bachelor's degree]] became a requirement for new teachers in the whole of the United Kingdom, replacing the old [[Certificate in Education]] (Cert Ed).

The BEd is not the only way of gaining Qualified Teacher Status or gaining a teaching qualification. Other routes are as follows:

==Bachelor of Science Education (B.Sc.Ed.)==
A Bachelor of Science Education is a degree awarded to students who complete the four to five-year course of study in the field of science (major and minor in biology, chemistry, physics, and math) with major Educational courses. It is the combination of degrees in science and education course (sometimes referred to double degree programs B.Sc + B.Ed. = B.Sc.Ed.). Even though B.Sc and B.Ed. are notionally two degrees, they must be taken together. There are very few universities that offer this course because it requires collaboration between the Faculty/School of Science and that of Education, to ensure that the teacher not only can work in an education institution but also in an industrial area related to science.

In Malaysia, it is one of the most difficult admittance degrees for the students to get into. Students not only need a distinction result but also need to go through a psychology test, rigorous interviews and demos of teaching. Students who already get these courses will be given a full scholarship by the Minister of Education. Upon graduation, the students will get job offers from government and private institutions (mostly to teach for matriculation, foundation or high school students) due to deep understanding of specific science and professional teaching training. Graduates also can work in other science related industries. Bachelor of Science ''and'' Education is totally different from Bachelor of Science ''in'' Education.

In Singapore, the [[National Institute of Education]], an autonomous institute of Nanyang Technological University, offers a four-year undergraduate programme, offering B.Sc.(Ed.) or B.A.(Ed.) in its initial teacher training programmes. Students are taught pedagogical theories and principles, alongside their chosen subject majors (and minors).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6995">[[File:Beethoven pf son 32 title.jpg|thumb|Original title page for the Piano Sonata, Opus 111]]
The '''Catalogues of Beethoven compositions''' are all of the different ways in which the [[List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven|musical compositions]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] have been organized by researchers into his music.

==The problem==
When Beethoven died, he left (as many other composers) a great many compositions behind.  In Beethoven's case, a sizable majority of his works were published.  However, some works were not published, and some works were unfinished, either because he had laid them aside, or died before he could finish them.  The catalogues described here are attempts to organize and identify with precision all of these works in ways that are useful to musicologists, musicians, and the listening public.

Most of Beethoven's best known works were published in his lifetime, and bear opus numbers, with which they may be reliably identified.  The short piano piece "[[Für Elise]]" is a notable exception: it is usually designated [[WoO]] (Werke ohne Opuszahl – literally, "works without opus number") 59.

==Opus number==
[[File:Beethoven_bust_statue_by_Hagen.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A bust of Beethoven, based on his 1812 life mask]]

The traditional 19th-century method of identifying a composer's works was for publishers to assign some sort of consecutive [[Opus number]] to the works as they were published.  This method is not entirely satisfactory to anyone.  Musicians and the listening public have no reliable way to distinguish different works with similar characteristics.  Musicologists cannot reliably identify unpublished works, nor do they have a reliable indication from the opus number of the actual composition date(s).  For example, the [[Octet (Beethoven)|Octet]], written from 1792 to 1793 is Opus 103, while Opus 102 and Opus 104 were written in 1815 and 1817 respectively. Some opus numbers comprise multiple pieces; 172 works are divided among 138 opus numbers.

All of Beethoven's compositions up to and including Opus 135 were published in Beethoven's lifetime; later numbers were published posthumously, and are generally denoted by "Op. posth."

==Kinsky catalogue==
{{see also|WoO (Beethoven)|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven#List of works by number}}
In 1955, [[Georg Kinsky]] and [[Hans Halm]] published a catalogue of Beethoven's works, in which they assigned numbers to 205 "Werke ohne Opuszahl" (meaning "works without opus number" in German) to ''some'' of Beethoven's unpublished works.  These numbers given these works are generally preceded by "[[WoO]]".

The Kinsky–Halm catalogue also lists 18 works in an appendix as being either doubtfully attributed, or simply spurious. Some of those listed as doubtful have since been shown to be authored by Beethoven.{{Example needed}}  These numbers are generally preceded by "Anh.", short for German ''Anhang'', meaning ''appendix''.

==Hess catalogue==
The Swiss composer and musicologist [[Willy Hess (composer)|Willy Hess]] also researched and published a catalogue in the 1950s, in which he included pieces not included in the 19th century [[Beethoven Gesamtausgabe|complete edition]] published by [[Breitkopf and Härtel]]. Hess included many more fragmentary works than did Kinsky, and his catalog runs to 335 entries in the "Hauptkatalog" (main catalogue), and 66 "doubtful and falsely-attributed" works in an appendix. Many pieces have both WoO and H numbers.{{Example needed}}

==Biamonti catalogue==
Beethoven's compositions are also organized through the [[Biamonti Catalogue]], compiled by [[Giovanni Biamonti]] and published in 1968.  This work is an attempt to chronologically order all of Beethoven's creative output, in a manner similar to the catalogue of [[Franz Schubert]]'s works by [[Otto Erich Deutsch]].  It combines the pieces with opus numbers, all of the works from the Kinsky and Hess catalogues, and previously uncatalogued fragments, into a single list comprising 849 entries.

'''Chirality''' {{IPAc-en|k|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|l|ɪ|t|i}} is a geometric property of some molecules and ions.  A chiral molecule/ion is non-superposable on its [[mirror image]]. The presence of an [[asymmetric carbon|asymmetric carbon center]] is one of several structural features that induce [[chirality]] in organic and inorganic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (4th Edition) Paula Y. Bruice. Pearson Educational Books. {{ISBN|9780131407480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Organic Chemistry'' (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox, James K. Whitesell Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers (2004)

The mirror images of a chiral molecule or ion are called [[enantiomer]]s or '''optical [[isomer]]s'''. Individual enantiomers are often designated as either [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|right-handed or left-handed]]. Chirality is an essential consideration when discussing the [[stereochemistry]] in [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[inorganic chemistry]].  The concept is of great practical importance because most biomolecules and pharmaceuticals are chiral.

Chiral molecules and ions are described by various ways of designating their [[absolute configuration]], which codify either the entity's geometry or its [[polarimetry|ability to rotate plane-polarized light]], a common technique in studying chirality.

== Definition ==
Chirality is based on [[Molecular symmetry|molecular symmetry elements]]. Specifically, a chiral compound can contain no [[improper axis of rotation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), which includes planes of symmetry and inversion center. Chiral molecules are always dissymmetric (lacking S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) but not always asymmetric (lacking all symmetry elements except the trivial identity).  Asymmetric molecules are always chiral.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. A., "Chemical Applications of Group Theory," John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereogenic centers==
{{main article|Stereogenic center}}
In general, chiral molecules have '''point chirality''' at a single ''stereogenic'' atom, which has four different substituents. The two enantiomers of such compounds are said to have different '''absolute configurations''' at this center. This center is thus stereogenic (i.e., a grouping within a molecular entity that may be considered a focus of stereoisomerism). The stereogenic atom (also known as the ''stereocenter'') is usually carbon, as in many biological molecules.  However a stereocenter can coincide with any atom, including metals (as in many chiral [[coordination compound]]s), phosphorus, or sulfur. The low barrier of [[nitrogen inversion]] make most ''N''-chiral amines (NRR′R″) impossible to resolve, but [[P-Chiral phosphine|''P''-chiral phosphines]] (PRR′R″) as well as S-chiral sulfoxides (OSRR′) are optically stable.
[[File:R-BINOL-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|144px|right|[[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol]] is an example of a molecule lacking point chirality.]]
While the presence of a stereogenic atom describes the great majority of chiral molecules, many variations and exceptions exist. For instance it is not necessary for the chiral substance to have a stereogenic atom.  Examples include 1-bromo-3-chloro-5-fluoro[[adamantane]], methylethylphenyl[[tetrahedrane]], certain [[calixarenes]] and [[fullerenes]], which have [[inherent chirality]].  The [[C2-Symmetric ligands|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric species]] [[1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol|1,1′-bi-2-naphthol]] (BINOL), 1,3-dichloro[[Propadiene|allene]] have [[axial chirality]]. (''E'')-[[cyclooctene]] and many [[ferrocene]]s have [[planar chirality]].

When the optical [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotation]] for an enantiomer is too low for practical measurement, the species is said to exhibit [[cryptochirality]].

Even isotopic differences must be considered when examining chirality. Illustrative is the derivative of [[benzyl alcohol]] PhCHDOH, which is chiral. The ''S'' enantiomer has [''α'']&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = +0.715°.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Streitwieser}}{{cite journal |author1=Streitwieser, A., Jr. |author2=Wolfe, J. R., Jr. |author3=Schaeffer, W.

==In biochemistry==
Many biologically active molecules are chiral, including the naturally occurring [[amino acid]]s (the building blocks of [[protein]]s) and [[sugar]]s. In biological systems, most of these compounds are of the same chirality: most amino acids are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|L}}) and sugars are [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]] ({{smallcaps all|D}}). Typical naturally occurring proteins are made of {{smallcaps all|L}}-amino acids and are known as ''left-handed proteins''; the comparably rarer {{smallcaps all|D}}-amino acids produce ''right-handed proteins''.

The origin of this [[homochirality]] in [[biology]] is the subject of much debate.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08&gt;{{cite book | author= Meierhenrich, Uwe J.  | year= 2008 | title= Amino acids and the Asymmetry of Life | edition = | location = Berlin, GER | publisher = Springer | isbn= 3540768858 | chapter =  | pages = | url = | access-date = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientists believe that Earth life's "choice" of chirality was purely random, and that if carbon-based life forms exist elsewhere in the universe, their chemistry could theoretically have opposite chirality. However, there is some suggestion that early amino acids could have formed in comet dust. In this case, circularly polarised radiation (which makes up 17% of stellar radiation) could have caused the selective destruction of one chirality of amino acids, leading to a selection bias which ultimately resulted in all life on Earth being homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKee |first=Maggie |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7895-space-radiation-may-select-amino-acids-for-life.html |title=Space radiation may select amino acids for life |publisher=New Scientist |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meierhenrich Uwe J., Nahon Laurent, Alcaraz Christian, Hendrik Bredehöft Jan, Hoffmann Søren V., Barbier Bernard, Brack André | year = 2005 | title = Asymmetric Vacuum UV photolysis of the Amino Acid Leucine in the Solid State | url = | journal = Angew.

[[Enzyme]]s, which are chiral, often distinguish between the two enantiomers of a chiral substrate. One could imagine an enzyme as having a glove-like cavity that binds a substrate. If this glove is right-handed, then one enantiomer will fit inside and be bound, whereas the other enantiomer will have a poor fit and is unlikely to bind.

{{smallcaps all|L}}-forms of amino acids tend to be tasteless, whereas {{smallcaps all|D}}-forms tend to taste sweet.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich08/&gt; [[Spearmint]] leaves contain the {{smallcaps all|L}}-enantiomer of the chemical [[carvone]] or ''R''-(−)-carvone and [[caraway]] seeds contain the {{smallcaps all|D}}-enantiomer or ''S''-(+)-carvone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf60176a035 | title=Chemical and sensory data supporting the difference between the odors of the enantiomeric carvones |author1=Theodore J.

Chirality is important in context of ordered phases as well, for example the addition of a small amount of an optically active molecule to a nematic phase (a phase that has long range orientational order of molecules) transforms that phase to a chiral nematic phase (or cholesteric phase). Chirality in context of such phases in polymeric fluids has also been studied in this context.&lt;ref name=Srinivasarao&gt;{{cite journal | author= Srinivasarao, M. | year = 1999 | title= Chirality and Polymers | journal = Current Opinion in Colloid &amp; Interface Science | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 369–376 | doi = | url=  | quote =  }} {{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chirality is a symmetry property, not a characteristic of any part of the periodic table.  Thus many inorganic materials, molecules, and ions are chiral.  [[Quartz]] is an example from the mineral kingdom.  Such noncentric materials are of interest for applications in [[nonlinear optics]].

In the areas of [[coordination chemistry]] and [[organometallic chemistry]], chirality is pervasive and of practical importance.  A famous example is [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)]] complex in which the three bipyridine ligands adopt a chiral propeller-like arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;von Zelewsky, A. (1995). ''Stereochemistry of Coordination Compounds.'' Chichester: John Wiley.. {{ISBN|047195599X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two enantiomers of complexes such as [Ru(2,2′-bipyridine)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; may be designated as Λ (capital [[lambda]], the Greek version of "L") for a left-handed twist of the propeller described by the ligands, and Δ (capital [[delta (letter)|delta]], Greek "D") for a right-handed twist (pictured).

Chiral ligands confer chirality to a metal complex, as illustrated by metal-[[amino acid]] complexes.  If the metal exhibits catalytic properties, its combination with a chiral ligand is the basis of [[asymmetric catalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. {{ISBN|189138953X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and practices==

The term ''[[optical activity]]'' is derived from the interaction of chiral materials with polarized light. In a solution, the (−)-form, or [[levorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer [[Levorotation and dextrorotation|rotates]] the plane of a beam of [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized light]] [[counterclockwise]]. The (+)-form, or [[dextrorotatory]] form, of an optical isomer does the opposite. The rotation of light is measured using a [[polarimeter]] and is expressed as the optical rotation.

==Miscellaneous nomenclature==
* Any non-[[racemic]] chiral substance is called '''scalemic'''.  Scalemic materials can be enantiopure or enantioenriched.&lt;ref name=EllielChir97&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eliel, E.L. | year = 1997 | title = Infelicitous Stereochemical Nomenclatures | journal = Chirality | volume = 9 | pages = 428–430 | url =  https://www.uottawa.ca/publications/interscientia/inter.4/eliel/eliel.html | access-date = 5 February 2016 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-636x(1997)9:5/6&lt;428::aid-chir5&gt;3.3.co;2-e}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A chiral substance is '''enantiopure''' when only one of two possible enantiomers is present so that all molecules within a sample  have the same chirality sense. Use of '''homochiral''' as a synonym is strongly discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=asymmetric synthesis| file = E02072}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A chiral substance is '''enantioenriched''' or '''heterochiral''' when its enantiomeric ratio is greater than 50:50 but less than 100:0.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomerically enriched (enantioenriched)| file = E02071}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enantiomeric excess]] or '''e.e.''' is the difference between how much of one enantiomer is present compared to the other. For example, a sample with 40% e.e. of ''R'' contains 70% ''R'' and 30% ''S'' (70% − 30% = 40%).&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=enantiomer excess (enantiomeric excess)| file = E02070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The rotation of plane polarized light by chiral substances was first observed by [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1815,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Lakhtakia, A. (ed.) | title=Selected Papers on Natural Optical Activity (SPIE Milestone Volume 15) |publisher=SPIE | year=1990 }}{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained considerable importance in the sugar industry, analytical chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. [[Louis Pasteur]] deduced in 1848 that this phenomenon has a molecular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Pasteur, L. | title=Researches on the molecular asymmetry of natural organic products, English translation of French original, published by Alembic Club Reprints (Vol. 14, pp. 1–46) in 1905, facsimile reproduction by SPIE in a 1990 book | year=1848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Eliel, Ernest Ludwig; Wilen, Samuel H. &amp; Mander, Lewis N. | year = 1994 | title = Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds | edition = 1st | chapter = Chirality in Molecules Devoid of Chiral Centers (Chapter 14) | pages = | location = New York, NY, USA | publisher = Wiley &amp; Sons | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IyfwAAAAMAAJ | access-date = 2 February 2016 | isbn =  0471016705 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''chirality'' itself was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Bentley, Ronald | year = 1995 | title = From Optical Activity in Quartz to Chiral Drugs: Molecular Handedness in Biology and Medicine. | journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|Perspect.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3232">'''Coal slurry''' is a mixture of solids (mined [[coal]]) and liquids (usually water) produced by a [[coal preparation plant]].  As a [[slurry]], coal is separated from non-combustable components (ash) and can be fractionated by particle size as well.  Coal slurry can be transferred by pipeline&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redvalve.com/rv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=56 Red Valve Company: Coal Slurry Pipeline]&lt;/ref&gt; or with specialised pumps such as a [[progressive cavity pump]] to pump the highly abrasive, corrosive and viscous coal slurry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Reasons why you should choose the right pump for coal slurry. | url=http://www.globalpumps.com.au/case-studies/2012/transferring-coal-slurry-made-easy/ | date=2012-07-18 | accessdate=September 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale of water usage and hence potential costs and problems is large.  More than 7 billion tons of coal are mined per year (2010), using approximately 200 litres of water per ton.&lt;ref&gt;D.

Ideally, coal slurry consists only of crushed [[coal]] and water, which can be separated perfectly at low cost.  In practice, the separation is significantly costly(citation needed).  Furthermore, the slurry consists also of very fine coal dust that results in a waste called [[blackwater (coal)|blackwater]], which is stored in large impoundment ponds, often together with [[coal ash]].  Such ponds are susceptible to disastrous releases, such as the [[Buffalo Creek flood]] of 1972.   This impounded liquid waste can sometimes total billions of gallons in a single facility.  &lt;!-- coal ash is not coal slurryThe largest coal slurry impound in the United States, at [[Little Blue Run Lake]],  holds 20 billion gallons of coal ash and smokestack scrubber waste).&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopey|first=Don|date=3 April 2014|title=Little Blue Run coal ash site to close sooner; Plant owner must contain pollution |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2014/04/04/Coal-ash-site-to-close-sooner/stories/201404040080|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Principles==
This is done for two reasons:

===From a [[Light transport theory|physics of light transport]] point of view===
The energy reaching the pixel comes from the whole [[solid angle]] by which the eyes see the pixel in the scene, not from its central sample. This yields the key notion of '''pixel footprint''' on surfaces or in the [[texture space]], which is the back projection of the pixel on the scene.

The description above corresponds to the [[pinhole camera]] simplified optics classically used in [[computer graphics]]. Note that this approach can also represent a lens-based camera and thus [[depth of field]] effects, using a cone whose cross-section decreases from the lens size to zero at the [[focal plane]], and then increases.

Moreover, a real optical system does not focus on exact points because of [[Airy disc|diffraction]] and imperfections. This can be modeled as a [[point spread function]] (PSF) weighted within a solid angle larger than the pixel.

===From a signal processing point of view===
Ray-tracing images suffer strong [[aliasing]] because the "projected geometric signal" has very high frequencies exceeding the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|Nyquist-Shannon maximal frequency]] that can be represented using the pixel sampling rate, so that the input signal has to be low-pass filtered - i.e., integrated over a solid angle around the pixel center.

Note that contrary to intuition, the filter should not be the pixel footprint since a [[Rectangular function|box filter]] has poor spectral properties. Conversely, the ideal [[sinc function]] is not practical, having infinite support and possibly negative values. A [[Gaussian filter|Gaussian]] or a [[Lanczos resampling|Lanczos]] filter are considered good compromises.

==Computer graphics models==
Cone and Beam early papers rely on different simplifications: the first considers a circular section and treats the intersection with various possible shapes. The second treats an accurate pyramidal beam through the pixel and along a complex path, but it only works for [[polyedrical]] shapes.

Cone tracing solves certain problems related to [[Sample (signal)|sampling]] and aliasing, which can plague conventional ray tracing. However, cone tracing creates a host of problems of its own. For example, just intersecting a cone with scene geometry leads to an enormous variety of possible results. For this reason, cone tracing has remained mostly unpopular. In recent years, increases in computer speed have made [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] algorithms like [[distributed ray tracing]] - i.e. stochastic explicit integration of the pixel - much more used than cone tracing because the results are exact provided enough samples are used. But the convergence is so slow that even in the context of off-line rendering a huge amount of time is required to avoid [[Image noise|noise]]. Recent works focus on removing this noise with machine learning techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/3072959.3073601 |title=Interactive reconstruction of Monte Carlo image sequences using a recurrent denoising autoencoder |journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=1 |year=2017 |last1=Chaitanya |first1=Chakravarty R.

Differential cone-tracing, considering a differential angular neighborhood around a ray, avoids the complexity of exact geometry intersection but requires a LOD representation of the geometry and appearance of the objects. [[Mipmap|MIPmapping]] is an approximation of it limited to the integration of the surface texture within a cone footprint. Differential ray-tracing &lt;ref&gt;Homan Igehy. "Tracing Ray Differentials". http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/papers/trd/&lt;/ref&gt; extends it to textured surfaces viewed through complex paths of cones reflected or refracted by curved surfaces. The full differential cone-tracing - including geometry and appearance filtering - is mostly applicable as volumetric cone-tracing,&lt;ref&gt;Fabrice Neyret. "Modeling Animating and Rendering Complex Scenes using Volumetric Textures". http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00537523&lt;/ref&gt; relying on 3D MIPmapping.

"Interactive Indirect Illumination Using Voxel Cone Tracing". http://www.icare3d.org/research-cat/publications/interactive-indirect-illumination-using-voxel-cone-tracing.html&lt;/ref&gt; has generalized this approach to [[global illumination]] and adapted it to GPU, showing remarkable quality images at 25–70 frames per second.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAsg_xNzhcQ&lt;/ref&gt; The video game [[The Tomorrow Children]] uses a simplified and optimized form of this method to render its graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/286023/Graphics_Deep_Dive_Cascaded_voxel_cone_tracing_in_The_Tomorrow_Children.php|title=Graphics Deep Dive: Cascaded voxel cone tracing in The Tomorrow Children|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denoising Algorithm based on Relevance network Topology''' (DART) is an unsupervised algorithm that estimates an activity score for a pathway in a gene expression matrix, following a denoising step.&lt;ref name="dart" /&gt; In DART, a weighted average is used where the weights reflect the degree of the nodes in the pruned network.&lt;ref name="dart" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiao|first=yan|author2=Katherine Lawler |title=DART: Denoising Algorithm based on Relevance network Topology improves molecular pathway activity inference|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=19 October 2011|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-12-403|volume=12|page=403|pmid=22011170|pmc=3228554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The denoising step removes prior information that is inconsistent with a data set. This strategy substantially improves unsupervised predictions of pathway activity that are based on a prior model, which was learned from a different biological system or context.&lt;ref name="dart" /&gt;

Pre-existing methods such as gene set enrichment analysis method attempt to infer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Subramanian|first=Tamayo|author2=Mukherjee, Ebert BL |title=Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles|journal=PNAS|date=Sep 30, 2005|doi=10.1073/pnas.0506580102|pmid=16199517|pmc=1239896|volume=102|pages=15545–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not construct a structured list of genes. SPIA (Signaling Pathway Impact analysis)&lt;ref name=naps&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tarca AL|first=Draghici|author2=Khatri P |author3=Hassan SS |title=A novel signaling pathway impact analysis|journal=Bioinformatics |year=2009 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btn577 |volume=25 |pages=75–82|pmc=2732297}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method that uses the phenotype information to evaluate the pathway activity between two phenotypes. However, it does not identify the pathway gene subset that could be used to differentiate individual samples.&lt;ref name= naps /&gt;
[[CORG]] is used to identify a relevant gene subset. It is a supervised method, which does not perform as well as DART in analyzing independent data set&lt;ref name="dart" /&gt;

Understanding molecular pathway activity is crucial for risk assessment, clinical diagnosis and treatment. [[Meta-analysis]] of complex genomic data is often associated with difficulties such as extracting useful information from big data, eliminating confounding factors and providing more sensible interpretation. 
Different approaches have been taken to highlight the identification of relevant pathway in order to provide better [[gene expression]] prediction.

#Evaluate the consistency of the prior regulatory information 
#Remove inconsistent prior information-the denoising step
#Estimate pathway activity

Pearson correlations were first computed between regulatory genes at the level of transcription and a gene expression data set. The correlation coefficient then underwent a [[Fisher's transform]]: 
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_{ij}=\frac{1}{2} \log{\frac{1+c_{ij}}{1-c_{ij}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where c&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the correlation coefficient between gene i and j, and where γ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the variable that under the null hypothesis, its mean is zero and standard deviation 1/{{radic|n_s-3}}, where ns is the number of tumor samples. The threshold of p-value was set at 0.0001. Gene pairs with significant correlation will be considered relevant in the network. 
To predict the activity score in which genes that are nearby are also taken into consideration:

&lt;math&gt;
\vec S_{W\;AV}=\frac 1\sqrt{\sum_{i\in N}k_i^2}\sum_{i\in N}\sigma_ik_i\vec Z_i
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Where ki is the number of neighbors of gene i, zi is the normalized z-score and σi is a binary variable ( i.e 1 means upregulated upon activation and -1 means downregulated). This step is to estimate the activation level, in which sw AV is the activity score. A linear regression model was then applied to estimate the pathway activation levels. Thus, tij and pij denote the t-statistics and p-value associated with, whereas p&lt;0.05 indicates a significance.
To assess the consistency in a validation data set D, the performance measure Vij is denoted:

&lt;math&gt;
V_{ij}=\sum_{d\in D}\sigma_{ij}^{(d)}\left|t_{ij}^{(d)}\right|S\left(p_{ij}^{d}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
 
Where S is defined by

&lt;math&gt;
S(p_{ij})=
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; p_{ij}\le 0.05 \\
0 &amp; p_{ij}&gt;0.05
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
S is the threshold function of a given pair of pathways.
And where

&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_{ij}^{(d)}=
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \mathrm{sign}\left(t_{ij}^{(train)}\right)=\mathrm{sign}\left(t_{ij}^{(d)}\right),\;d\in D \\
-1 &amp; \mathrm{sign}\left(t_{ij}^{(train)}\right)=-\mathrm{sign}\left(t_{ij}^{(d)}\right),\;d\in D
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

σ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; is the score that tells the directionality of a correlation, in which an opposite prediction will be panelized by given a value of -1. t&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;  is the t-statistics of interpathway correlation. 
The performance measure Vij accounts for the significance of correlation between pathways, the direction of correlation, and the weights in the magnitude of the correlation. 
A two-tailed paired Wilcoxon test is performed to compare the distribution under hypothesis. 
Advantages and limitation:
DART gives an improved performance and higher accuracy in inferring pathway activity from prior information of pathway databases. 
Pre-existed information and large database are needed in order for DART to run.In other words, DART requires well-established prior gene expression data to start with, and then it can proceed evaluation of consistency and denoise any irrelevant information.

== Application ==

DART is an algorithm that is applicable and used successfully in Cancer Genomics. The DART [[algorithm]] has been shown to be a strong method for estimating the pathway activity and perturbation signature activity in breast and lung cancer gene expression data sets.&lt;ref name="dart" /&gt;
Imaging traits such as [[mammography]] (Mammography is the process of using low-energy X-rays to examine the human breast tissue) plays an important role in cancer tumor diagnosis. Studies have shown that women with increased mammographic density have a higher risk of developing Breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li J|first=Eriksson L|author2=Humphreys K |author3=Czene K |title=Genetic variation in the estrogen metabolic pathway and mammographic density as an intermediate phenotype of breast cancer|journal=Breast Cancer Res|date=2010|doi=10.1186/bcr2488|volume=12|pages=R19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estrogen receptor alpha gene 1 encodes Estrogen Receptor-alpha, which is activated by estrogen. Polymorphisms in [[ESR1]] are associated with breast cancer risk through differences in different level of breast density. DART successfully predicted an inverse correlation between ESR1 signaling and MMD.
It can be used in simulated and real multidimensional cancer genomic data. It gives more reliable prediction about pathway activation, which would be helpful in association studies.

'''Equilibrium Thermodynamics''' is the systematic study of transformations of matter and energy in systems in terms of a concept called [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].  The word equilibrium implies a state of balance.  Equilibrium thermodynamics, in origins, derives from analysis of the [[Carnot cycle]].  Here, typically a system, as cylinder of gas, initially in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is set ''out of balance'' via heat input from a [[combustion|combustion reaction]].  Then, through a series of steps, as the system settles into its final equilibrium state, work is extracted.    

In an equilibrium state the [[thermodynamic potential|potentials]], or driving forces, within the system, are in exact balance. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial [[state (thermodynamic)|state]] of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], subject to accurately specified constraints, to calculate, when the constraints are changed by an [[Thermodynamic operation|externally imposed intervention]], what the state of the system will be once it has reached a new equilibrium.  An equilibrium state is mathematically ascertained by seeking the extrema of a thermodynamic potential function, whose nature depends on the constraints imposed on the system. For example, a chemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure will reach equilibrium at a minimum of its components' [[Gibbs free energy]] and a maximum of their [[entropy]].

Equilibrium thermodynamics differs from [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]], in that, with the latter, the state of the system under investigation will typically not be uniform but will vary locally in those as energy, entropy, and temperature distributions as gradients are imposed by dissipative thermodynamic fluxes.  In equilibrium thermodynamics, by contrast, the state of the system will be considered uniform throughout, defined macroscopically by such quantities as temperature, pressure, or volume.  Systems are studied in terms of change from one equilibrium state to another; such a change is called a [[thermodynamic process]].

[[Ruppeiner geometry]] is a type of information geometry used to study thermodynamics. It claims that thermodynamic systems can be represented by [[Riemannian geometry]], and that statistical properties can be derived from the model. This geometrical model is based on the idea that there exist equilibrium states which can be represented by points on two-dimensional surface and the distance between these equilibrium states is related to the fluctuation between them.

[[File: Woman-power emblem.svg|thumb|upright|A generic symbol for feminism]]
'''Feminist political theory''' is a diverse subfield of [[feminist theory]] working towards three main goals:
# To understand and critique the role of gender in how [[political theory]] is conventionally construed.
# To re-frame and re-articulate conventional [[political theory]] in light of feminist issues (especially gender equality).
# To support [[political science]] presuming and pursuing gender equality.
Feminist political theory encompasses a broad scope of approaches. It overlaps with related areas including feminist jurisprudence/[[feminist legal theory]]; feminist political philosophy; female-centered empirical research in political science; and feminist research methods ([[feminist method]]) for use in political science the social sciences. Indeed, one scholar notes that, insofar as almost all versions of feminism involve "demonstrating the ways in which politics, understood as power relations, is present in our everyday lives," one could reasonably "describe feminist theory as a whole as a kind of political philosophy."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Feminist Political Theory|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee757/abstract|publisher = Blackwell Publishing Ltd|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9781444367072|doi = 10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee757/full|first = Lori|last = Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt; What frequently distinguishes feminist political theory from feminism broadly is the specific examination of the state and its role in the reproduction or redressing of gender inequality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to being broad and multidisciplinary, the field is relatively new, inherently innovative, and still expanding; the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' explains that "feminist political philosophy serves as a field for developing new ideals, practices, and justifications for how political institutions and practices should be organized and reconstructed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = Summer 2014|title = Feminist Political Philosophy|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2014/entries/feminism-political/|date = 2014-01-01|first = Noëlle|last = McAfee|editor-first = Edward N.|editor-last = Zalta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
For summary of feminist history more broadly, see [[feminism]]. Feminist political theory as a term only consolidated in the West during Women's Liberation movements of the 1960s and 70s. Previously, very few works of political theory explicitly considered women's political situation. John Stuart Mill’s 1861 call for women's suffrage in ''The Subjection of Women'' is a notable exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = John Stuart Mill: The Subjection of Women|url = http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm|website = www.constitution.org|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th Century, Simone de Beauvoir’s 1949 work ''The Second Sex'' exposed the power dynamics surrounding womanhood and laid the foundation for subsequent feminist theories exposing women's social subjugation. In the 1980s and 1990s, feminist theory expanded into the legal realm led by Catharine MacKinnon’s and Andrea Dworkin’s campaigns against pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = philosophical feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophical-feminism|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several distinct stages are sketched out below.

=== Liberal feminism ===
[[Liberal feminism]] marks an important approach to feminist politics which was especially pervasive during the first half of the twentieth century. Some of the most well known examples of liberal feminist writing were published far earlier,  including [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869). A common theme of liberal feminism is an emphasis on equal opportunity via fair opportunity and equal political rights. In addition, according to ''The International Encyclopedia of Ethics,'' "[L]iberal feminisms of both the past and the present retain some commitment to the distinction between the public and private realms – a distinction [which is the] focus of much critique within feminist political theory."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Marxist, socialist and radical feminism ===
Marxist feminism and socialist feminism considered classism as the primary source of women's oppression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union|last=Hartmann|first=Heidi|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-415-93152-5|location=Feminist Theory Reader (Eds: McCann &amp; Kim)|pages=206-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pandora's Box: Subjectivity, class, and sexuality in socialist feminist criticism|last=Kaplan|first=Cora|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=1985|isbn=0-8135-2388-5|location=Feminisms (1997) (Eds: Warhol &amp; Herndl)|pages=956-975}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "... Marxist theory does not allow women any more than other classes of oppressed people to constitute themselves as historical subjects, because Marxism does not take into account the fact that a class also consists of individuals one by one. Class consciousness is not enough. We must try to understand philosophically (politically) these concepts of 'subject' and 'class consciousness' and how they work in relation to our history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One is Not Born a Woman|last=Wittig|first=Monique|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0-415-93152-5|location=Feminist Theory Reader, Eds: McCann &amp; Kim)|pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Early radical feminism was grounded in the rejection of the nuclear family and femininity as constructed within heterosexuality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967-1975|last=Echols|first=Alice|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0816617876|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. and Radical feminism abdicated any previous forms of political theory to develop entirely new theories rooted primarily on the direct experiences of women. Radical Feminism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Political Theory|last=Bryson|first=Valerie|publisher=Palgrave|year=2016|isbn=9781137439048|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;has experienced many transitions over time, including facing an anti feminist backlash&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-case-against-contemporary-feminism|title=The Case Against Contemporary Feminism|last=Tolentino|first=Jia|date=2/8/2017|website=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-case-against-contemporary-feminism|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7/11/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;(humanism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism as Radical Humanism|last=Johnson|first=Pauline|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=9780429969065|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism and Humanism|last=Johnson|first=Pauline|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=9781118793305|location=In The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Humanism (Eds: Copson &amp; Grayling|pages=Chapter 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but the theoretical history and survival&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Mairead|date=Spring–Summer 2016|title=Kill Daddy: Reproduction, Futurity, and the Survival of the Radical Feminist|url=|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=44|pages=268-282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;remains important to understand&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dow &amp; Wood|first=|date=|title=Repeating History and Learning From It: What Can SlutWalks Teach Us About Feminism?|url=|journal=Women's Studies in Communication|volume=37|pages=22-43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Topics of inquiry ==
=== Feminist epistemology ===
A key aspect of feminist political theory/philosophy is feminist epistemology. Feminist epistemologists question the objectivity of social and philosophical sciences by contending that standards of authority and credibility are socially constructed and thus reflect and re-entrench the sociopolitical status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = philosophical feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophical-feminism|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one common feminist methodological solution is to include many diverse voices reflecting all parts of society in the process of knowledge-making.

=== Gendered political institutions ===
Political theory on the gendering of institutions explores questions such what does it mean for an institution to be “gendered," how can one evaluate whether an institution is gendered, and what are the consequences of gendered institutions for the people who work within them (of all genders). An example of such related scholarship is Eileen McDonagh's book ''The Motherless State'' which explores how socially feminized "motherly" attributes have been stripped from modern governance models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Motherless State|last = McDonagh|first = Eileen|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Chicago|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Group identity/identity politics ===
Theorist studying this aspect of feminist political theory question the construction of women as an identity group. On a basic level, they consider whether it is even possible to come to some sort of conclusion about a "women" group’s relation to politics. One facet of the debate involves [[intersectionality]] and whether women from different racial and cultural backgrounds have enough in common to form a political group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Should Blacks Represent Blacks and Women Represent Women? A Contingent Yes|last = Mansbridge|first = Jane|date = 1999|journal = Journal of Politics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another facet questions whether transgender women should be included in the group "women" insofar as they lack many of the experiences of girlhood and womanhood which bind "women" together as a distinct group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Dispute Between Radical Feminism and Transgenderism|url = http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2|website = The New Yorker|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another approach to this topic includes redefining "groupness;" for example, Iris Marion Young has suggested women are more of a "seriality" rather than a group insofar as they undergo similar experiences but in isolation of each other, lacking a sense of group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender as Seriality: Thinking About Women as a Social Collective|last = Young|first = Iris Marion|date = 1994|journal = Signs|doi =10.1086/494918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political leadership and gender ===
This field address how women lead differently than their male counterparts as legislators, executives, and judges. Some scholars in this field study how political leadership is itself masculinized to exclude the kinds of political leadership women most frequently provide, often outside of formal offices. For example, Hardy-Fanta looks at grassroots political work in Latino communities in the U.S. to identify feminized political leadership roles, ultimately concluding that Latina women provide the most critical leadership and work in those communities—despite the fact that most studies overlook their leadership because it does  not occur within formal officeholding roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Latina Women and Political Leadership|last = Hardy-Fanta|first = Carol|date = 1995|journal = New England Journal of Public Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tujunga Wash.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tujunga Wash]] is an example of a concrete flood control channel.]]
'''Flood control channels''' are large and empty basins which let water flow in and out (except during [[flood]]ing) or dry channels that run below the street levels of some larger [[cities]], so that if and when a flood occurs, the water will run into these channels, and eventually drain into a [[river]] or other body of [[water]]. Flood channels are sometimes built on the former courses of waterways as a way to reduce flooding.

Flood control channels are not to be confused with watercourses which are simply confined between [[levee]]s. These structures may be made entirely of [[concrete]], with concrete sides and an exposed bottom, with [[riprap]] sides and an exposed bottom, or completely unlined. They often contain grade control sills or [[weir]]s to prevent [[erosion]] and maintain a level streambed.

By definition, flood control channels range from the size of a [[street gutter]] to a few hundred or even a few thousand feet wide in some rare cases. Flood control channels are found in most heavily developed areas in the world. One city with many of these channels is [[Los Angeles]], as they became mandatory with the passage of the [[Flood Control Act of 1941]] passed in the wake of the [[Los Angeles Flood of 1938]].

[[File:John-Garton-reduced 2.jpg|thumb|right|John Garton]]

'''Dr John Garton''', of the firm of Garton Brothers of [[Newton-le-Willows]] in the [[United Kingdom]] was the  Originator of Scientific Farm Plant Breeding. He is credited as the first scientist to show that the common grain crops and many other plants are self-fertilizing. He also invented the process of multiple cross-fertilization of crop plants.

In 1898 the business became known as '''Gartons Limited''' and, under the inspired commercial leadership of '''George Peddie Miln''', was to become the British Empire's largest [[plant breeding]] and [[seed company]]. 

A public company from the start, its shares were traded on the [[London Stock Exchange]] from 1947.

==History of the business==

John Garton and his two brothers, Robert and Thomas, were in business with their father, Peter, in Golborne and Newton-le-Willows in [[Lancashire]], [[England]], as corn and agricultural merchants.

As a young man, John Garton (1863–1922),&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Warrington Examiner, 27 May 1922&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to understand that whilst some agricultural plants were self-pollinating, others were cross-pollinating. He began experimenting with the artificial cross pollination firstly of cereal plants, then herbage species and root crops. 

He attracted the friendship and encouragement of a young Scottish seedsman, George Peddie Miln (1861–1928)&lt;ref&gt;The Nurseryman and Seedsman, 4 January 1919&lt;/ref&gt; who had trained in [[Dundee]] and was seed manager of Dicksons Limited of [[Chester]].

Knowing he had developed a far reaching new technique in plant breeding John Garton began to carry out many thousands of controlled crosses on fields at the family farm in Newton-le-Willows. He and his colleagues tried in 1889 to interest the UK Government’s new Board of Agriculture in the invention they called '''Scientific Farm Plant Breeding'''.  But this was to no avail.

===Commercial start===

Robert&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt; and John Garton made a commercial start as R. &amp; J. Garton.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt; They launched their first variety, 'Abundance' oat, in 1892.

Generous publicity followed in the press, together with the publication of articles by botanists in the Journal of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England]], and in the Transactions of the [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]] in 1894 and 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhass.org.uk Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829144444/http://www.rhass.org.uk/ |date=29 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Robert Wallace (1853–1939) of the [[University of Edinburgh]] said 'Under the system originated by Mr John Garton an infinite number of new and distinct breeds of oats, barleys, wheats, clovers and grasses have been produced'.&lt;ref&gt;Page 22, 1900 Seed Catalogue, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 a public company was launched, Gartons Limited. It was based in [[Warrington]]. Many of the 600 or so subscribers for £50,000 cumulative preference shares of 6% rising to 10% were farmers. 

George Peddie Miln joined the company as Managing Director, together with Robert Garton, Thomas R. Garton, Thomas Baxter and Arthur Smith as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian front page, 6 August 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Robert and John Garton agreed to continue to work for the Company for five years for £500 and to receive the entire ordinary share capital of the new company of £50,000.{{clarification needed|perhaps this makes sense to business people, but it sounds as if they absconded with the capital|date=October 2013}}

It rapidly became the United Kingdom's best known plant breeding and seed company, and also exported seeds widely.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Examiner, 26 June 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Garton Lectureship at Edinburgh University===

In 1900 an endowment was made to found the Garton Lectureship in Indian and Colonial Agriculture at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19390118&amp;id=uTU1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=L6YLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3643,2419176|journal=The Glasgow Herald|title=Obituary: Emeritus Professor Robert Wallace, An authority on agricultural matters — 37 years in Edinburgh chair|date=18 January 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Garton Lectureship still exists as a biennial award to promising young lecturers in the School of Agriculture but is without [[emolument]]s and is no longer tied to colonial agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Britain's First Chair of Agriculture, Fleming &amp; Robertson, {{ISBN|0-902164-33-3}} pages 47 and 48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publicity in USA===

Noel Kingsbury writes:&lt;ref&gt;page 140 Kingsbury, Noel. Hybrid : the history and science of plant breeding. University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0-226-43704-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;From the late nineteenth century on, seed companies began to play an increasingly important, if not dominant, role in breeding non-cereal crops and a major role in producing varieties for market gardening and for private growers. The production of new cereals was a somewhat different matter - the fact that they were so vitally important for national food supplies and involved large-scale and long-term work made it more likely that they would be the concern of government. 

There were exceptions though, one being the family firm of Gartons of Warrington, Lancashire, in the north of England. Their production of cereals - oats in particular - was appreciated as internationally important during the latter quarter of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth; (The American wheat breeder) [[Mark A. Carleton|Mark Carleton]] visited them in 1898 and was reportedly astonished at their work, Garton varieties were widely exported throughout the British Empire (then by far and away the world's largest political unit) and the United States.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

"That private companies could be so effective in breeding cereal grains indicated that there was no link of necessity between their improvement and the publicly funded research that was to so dominate this sector over so much of the next century." 

In 1903 Professor [[Willet M. Hays]] (1859–1927) of the Agricultural Experiment Station in [[Minnesota]], USA said 'No one has done more brilliant work in Agricultural Plant Breeding than Messrs. Garton, and this is from now on to be recognised.'&lt;ref&gt;Page 5, 1902 Catalogue, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted intellectual property donation===

The introduction to their 1899 Spring Catalogue&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Gartons Limited's Spring 1899 Seed Catalogue&lt;/ref&gt; reads: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Our original idea for the dissemination of the seed of these new breeds as the stocks became sufficiently large for the purpose, was through some public body as in the form of an annual free seed distribution upon similar lines to the free seed distributions carried out by the Governments of the United States, Canada, and several of the British Colonies. 

''On three successive occasions we approached Her Majesty's Government with this object in view, the first occasion being on the formation of the Board of Agriculture, in 1889, when we offered to hand over the whole of the valuable results, providing that body would undertake their dissemination and the continuance of the work, either in the form of an annual free seed distribution or at current market price.''

''Upon the last occasion our offer was accompanied by letters and reports from all the leading Agricultural Professors, Botanists, and Scientists in the Kingdom, setting forth the national benefit which would accrue from the dissemination of the results in the form we had suggested. The final reply of Her Majesty's Government, however, was that whilst fully recognising the value of the work, owing to there being no precedent upon which to act in such a matter, they were unable to avail themselves of the offer. This was much to be regretted for had our ideas been carried into effect the British farmer would have been placed in immediate possession of important results, which in the hands of a Public Company would not reach him for many years.''

''Our efforts in this direction not having been successful, and as we were not in a position to undertake the work of distribution ourselves, we have placed it in the lands{{verify source|reason=should that be "hands"?|date=October 2013}} of a Public Company, and we trust that the continued efforts made by us on behalf of the British farmer will be fully appreciated by him, through his support of the Company responsible for the distribution of the seed of our new breeds of agricultural plants''

''R. &amp; J. Garton''''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Crop innovations===

The firm's first historic introduction was 'Abundance' [[oat]], the world's first agricultural plant variety bred from a ''controlled'' cross, introduced to commerce in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Spring Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the other 170 crop varieties&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/barnabymiln/Site/Gartons.html Gartons]&lt;/ref&gt; that Gartons bred and introduced to commerce were:

* 'Standwell' [[barley]], introduced in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;Seed  Catalogue 1898, Gartons&lt;/ref&gt; the first barley bred from a controlled cross. 
* 'White Monarch' [[wheat]], introduced in 1899,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt; the first wheat bred from a controlled cross. 
* 'Invincible' barley, introduced in 1899,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1899, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt; the first crop plant control crossed for disease resistance.
* Perennialized [[Trifolium pratense|red clover]], introduced in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1898, Gartons&lt;/ref&gt; the first controlled cross clover.
* Perennialized [[Lolium multiflorum|Italian ryegrass]], introduced in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;Seed Catalogue 1907, Gartons Limited&lt;/ref&gt; the first controlled cross pasture grass.

===John Garton's honorary doctorate===

On 23 March 1922 the Senatus Academicus of the [[University of Edinburgh]] offered to confer the honorary doctorate of LL.D on John Garton shortly before his death, which he duly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;University of Edinburgh Senatus Academicus Printed Minutes Volume III Oct. 1920-July 1924 p.295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian 26 August 1922&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal 29 July 1922 page 191&lt;/ref&gt; At its meeting on 6 July 1922 the Senatus Academicus learned that John Garton had died.&lt;ref&gt;University of Edinburgh Senatus Academicus Printed Minutes Volume III Oct. 1920-July 1924 p.332&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme and report of the Graduation Ceremony held on 21 July 1922 reads &lt;blockquote&gt; The Senatus Academicus recently conferred the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws upon the late John Garton, who duly accepted it. The Degree would have been formally conferred on the present occasion but for his lamented death. Mr Garton invented the process of multiple cross fertilisation of crop plants and has been the means in a great measure of revolutionising field culture by producing hundreds of new and improved varieties which have greatly increased the yields of all the common crops of the farm. The achievement proved to be of immense national importance during the War.

Mr Garton first showed that the common grain crops and many other crop plants are self-fertilising. Up till that time they were generally believed to be fertilised by wind or insects.
Mr Garton’s results got in crossing different species of grasses helped to develop the modern conception of species.

Twenty-two tears ago Mr Garton provided the means to establish the Garton Lectures on Colonial and Indian Agriculture, and subsequently he permanently endowed them as an integral part of the work of the Chair of Agriculture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Plant breeding grounds===

The plant breeding grounds were initially at Newton-le-Willows but moved to Acton Grange, two and a half miles south west of Warrington before settling in about 1930 at Little Leigh near [[Northwich]] in [[Cheshire]]. A seed development farm was located in [[Essex]], and root crop trials were located on farms in the north of England and in [[Scotland]]. Traditionally groups of farmers were invited in mid-summer to inspect the plant breeding grounds and be entertained by the Company.

[[File:LittleLeighTrials.jpg|thumb|right]]

Initially the Seed Warehouse for cleaning and distributing seed was in [[Newton-le-Willows]] but moved to Friars Green in Warrington in 1899 by which time the offices were at Thynne Street, Warrington.&lt;ref&gt;Gartons Limited Seed Catalogue 1901&lt;/ref&gt; A purpose built seven story Seed Warehouse and separate Head Office were built at Arpley, Warrington in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Gartons Limited Seed Catalogue 1910&lt;/ref&gt; There was an L. M. S.  railway siding into the Seed Warehouse. On 25 April 1912 the Seed Warehouse burned down&lt;ref&gt;Photograph in T.E.Miln's Newspaper Cutting Book, Miln Family Cartulary&lt;/ref&gt; but quickly rebuilt largely by the same builders. Seed cleaning machinery, some unique to the Company, ensured the purity of the product. As time went by fewer seeds were ‘picked’ or cleaned by hand by upwards of one hundred staff as machinery became more sophisticated. Across the top of roof of the warehouse was the company’s name which had to be disguised during wartime.

[[File:Gartons-Warehouse.tiff|thumb|right]]

From the beginning Gartons Limited tested its seeds for purity and germination at its own seed testing laboratories in Warrington. The [[1920 Seeds Act]], for the first time, made testing and declaring for purity and germination a legal requirement for all seed companies. The [[Official Seed Testing Station]] was created in 1917, firstly in Victoria Street in [[Westminster]], [[London]] and then in 1921 within the newly formed [[National Institute of Agricultural Botany]] in [[Cambridge]]. Larger seed companies including Gartons Limited were licensed to carry out their own purity and germination testing. 

[[File:Gartons World Records.jpg|thumb|right]]

===Commercial success and competition===

Gartons Limited was the United Kingdom’s only major agricultural plant breeding company.  But this caused them difficulties as early as in their Spring 1900 seed catalogue where a paragraph of the introduction reads: &lt;blockquote&gt; It has come to our knowledge that nearly all the New Breeds introduced by us up to the present time have been renamed by various dealers and are being offered by them under different names. Although the honesty of this conduct is more than questionable, we are resigned for the present to regard it as a novel form of flattery, but we strongly recommend all those who wish to secure our Seeds to order them direct from us, as they cannot be procured from any other genuine source. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the Great War (1914–1918) the United Kingdom government funded cereal breeding at the Plant Breeding Institute at Cambridge which had been founded in 1912,  and funded the setting up of plant breeding stations in Edinburgh (1921), Aberystwyth (1919) and in Glasnevin, Northern Ireland in competition with Gartons Limited.

The 1960 Report of the Committee on Transactions in Seeds set up by Parliament entitled Plant Breeders' Rights &lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Stationery Office Report, July 1960&lt;/ref&gt; stated that whilst two thirds of breeding work was by then carried out by government organisations, one third was in the hands of private breeders. And yet the only non-government funded agricultural crop plant breeding, research and testing establishment visited by the Committee was to Gartons Limited.&lt;ref&gt;Her Majesty's Stationery Office Report, July 1960, page 104&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom's Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964 allowed plant breeders  to fully protect and be rewarded for their introductions. The last variety bred by Gartons, 'Apex' wheat, was the first British bred wheat to be awarded plant breeders rights in 1967 under this legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Photographs of the Gartons Warrington Warehouse and Office built in 1910, The Warrington Examiner 4 April 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gartons Headquarters Plant Breeding Grounds in Cheshire, from The Warrington Examiner 4 April 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chairmen and directors===

The eldest of the three Garton brothers, Robert Garton, was the first chairman of Gartons Limited. He died in February 1950, aged 91,&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Examiner, 11 February 1950&lt;/ref&gt; a widower with no children. He was succeeded by the youngest brother, Thomas R. Garton, who died in May 1956. His son, John, was chairman from August 1963 until September 1965. Dr John Garton, the middle of the three brothers, was never, a director.

Nine members of the Miln family were involved with the business over a period of seventy five years.

[[File:Three-Miln-Generations.jpg|thumb|left]]

:[[File:George-Peddie-Miln.jpg|thumb|right|George Peddie Miln]]

Born at Linlathen, [[Broughty Ferry]] in 1861,  George Peddie Miln trained in a Dundee seed warehouse, the traditional Scottish training for a young man with ambition in the seed trade. He moved to [[Chester]] and ran one of its old established seed merchants before joining Gartons Limited as its first Managing Director in 1898. He was a member of Her Majesty's Board of Agriculture Seeds Advisory Council during the first World War. Both the Seeds Act 1920 and the formation of the [[National Institute of Agricultural Botany]] came about with his considerable encouragement during his three-year presidency of the Seed Trade Association of the United Kingdom. Of his eleven children, five trained in the seed trade. He was a Justice of the Peace in the City of [[Chester]], a Fellow of the Linnean Society and a member of the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. He died aged 68 following an unsuccessful operation.

When George P. Miln died in 1928 he was succeeded as managing director by his eldest son, Thomas Edward Miln (1890–1963)&lt;ref&gt;The Field, 25 November 1922&lt;/ref&gt; who for over twenty five years was chairman of the Retail Committee of the Seed Trade Association of the United Kingdom which proudly kept its independence from government control during World War II. A plant breeder as well as a businessman he is credited with the introduction of the sugar beet crop to UK agriculture. 

When Gartons Limited became a public quoted company on the London Stock Exchange in 1947 T. E. Miln entered into a further ten year employment contract as Managing Director, even though he was already 59, such was his reputation. Both his sons, Wallace and George, joined him in the business.

[[File:T E Miln.jpg|thumb|right|T.E. Miln]]

[[File:Wallace Miln.jpg|thumb|right|Wallace Miln]]
T. E. Miln was succeeded in 1961 by his elder son, Wallace Miln (1919–1994) also a skilled plant breeder and seed analyst.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian, 5 January 1962&lt;/ref&gt;  Wallace Miln was one of the three founders of the British Association of Plant Breeders at the time of the introduction of the United Kingdom's Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964. He was twice President of the Seed Trade Association of United Kingdom. He left Gartons Limited in 1973 to join his elder son, [[Barnaby Miln]], who had trained at Gartons and later with [[Northrup-King]]  in Minneapolis before setting up his own seed business at Bodenham in Herefordshire.

From 1947 Gartons Limited's shares were quoted on the London Stock Exchange.  The Company's profits for the previous seven years had averaged £48,940.&lt;ref&gt;London Corn Circular, 1 August 1947&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 the profit of £75,340  was the highest ever recorded &lt;ref&gt;Daily Telegraph, 20 September 1949&lt;/ref&gt; by the Company.

===Decline and closure===

In 1965 Peter Darlington&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 16 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt; became chairman of Gartons Limited. In a dramatic change of direction in 1967 Gartons Limited ceased retailing seeds directly to farmers. Instead  a new brand was created, Gartons GROplan, and marketing became wholesale through agricultural merchants throughout the United Kingdom. However Gartons GROplan was sold to Agricultural Holdings Company Limited in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;The Times newspaper, London, Friday 2 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt; but Gartons Limited continued as a plant breeding company.

Gartons plc, as it became known, ceased trading in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 19 August 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The seed warehouse at Bridge Foot, Warrington, which had dominated the town centre skyline since 1910, was demolished in October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Warrington Guardian, 15 October 1986&lt;/ref&gt; A hotel was built on the site.

==The Garton System of Plant Breeding==

These Explanatory Notes come from the Gartons Seed Catalogue for Spring 1900:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To those who are not acquainted with the botanical construction of plants it may be well to explain that plants possess generative organs, which correspond to those of the male and female in the animal kingdom. In the animal kingdom, progeny is derived from the mating of different animals of the same breed; in the vegetable kingdom the rule is that the seed is produced through the agency of the generative organs growing together on the same plant. Prior to the commencement of the work initiated by us and carried on during the past 20 years, which has led to the production of our New and Improved Breeds of agricultural plants, it was a recognised belief that many farm plants in the production of their seed were more or less cross-fertilised. The results of our experiments however have proved that such was not the case but that constant in-and-in breeding was the rule. 

Where such in-and-in breeding takes place the results are governed by the same natural laws as the in-and-in breeding of animals. In the production of New Breeds of animals the rule followed is to mate two animals of distinct breeds. The progeny, when fixity of type has been secured, constitutes a New Breed. 

Under our system of plant breeding we carry the mating of varieties or breeds far beyond what is practised in the animal kingdom. In the first instance we mate varieties and also what were formerly regarded as distinct species of the same genera, and after fixation, the progeny by these combinations are further mated together. 

A further extension of our system which is in itself unique and instructive, is the mating of uncultivated indigenous plants of the same Natural Order as the cultivated varieties. From such combinations most valuable results have been obtained. 

For example In Southern Asia there exists a species of wheat botanically known as Triticum spelta. In some districts it is looked upon as an indigenous weed infesting the cultivated crops of wheat. 

Under no climatic conditions does the grain of this species shed its seed when ripe, and even in threshing it is not possible to separate the grains, as the spikelets break off at the bases of the glumes, the grains remaining firmly enclosed between the chaff scales. 

By mating the varieties of this species with cultivated varieties, new breeds have been produced which will under no conditions shed their seed when ripe, but which thresh out a perfectly clean sample with a much heavier yield per acre than common wheat. 

In China there is an indigenous species of oat botanically known as Avena nuda or naked oat. The peculiar feature of this species is that the grains (which are very small) grow without any husk, being protected only by the chaff. The habit of the plant is likewise quite unique, four or five grains being suspended upon a thread-like filament about half an inch long. The mating of this species with cultivated varieties has produced new breeds giving yields 50 to 100 per cent. heavier than the original cultivated parents, with a corresponding decrease in the thickness of the skin. 

The wild or land oat, Avena fatua, of Great Britain has likewise been used with marked success in the production of new breeds in conjunction with the cultivated varieties. In the wild oat there is hardiness of constitution, vigour, strength of straw, and remarkable fertility. All these qualities have been retained in the new breeds produced. 

Another part of our system is the improvement of existing varieties of agricultural plants. The method is similar to that adopted by the breeder of stock for the improvement of his animals, when fresh blood of the same breed is introduced from some other herd. 

By crossing two distinct plants of the same variety the resulting progeny is more vigorous and robust in constitution, whilst the habit and individual character of the variety is maintained.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

'''A year later, these Explanatory Notes come from the Gartons Seed Catalogue for Spring 1901:'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;FOR over 20 years the work of cross-fertilising crop plants, with the object of producing New and Improved Breeds, has been carried on at Newton-le-Willows in Lancashire. It has there for the first time been demonstrated to Scientific Botanists as well as to Agriculturists that all the corn crops (cereals) and nearly all the other common crops of the farm are self fertilising. In other words, each individual plant provides the pollen which is required in the process of producing seed, to fertilise the female organs of its own flowers. This natural process results in a perfect system of in-breeding which has been going on for an indefinite period, making it possible to grow the different varieties of crops of the same kind in close proximity to each other, and even as mixed crops without any danger of crosses being produced. 

If crossing could have occurred in nature it would have been quite impossible to maintain the purity of any variety of crop plant for more than a year or two. As in the Animal Kingdom, the in-breeding of plants tends to the decrease of constitutional vigour, consequently when cross-fertilisation is practised the size and vigour of the selected progeny are increased in a remarkable degree.
 
Although the natural laws which govern the Animal and the Vegetable Kingdoms bear a very strong resemblance to each other, further points can be realised and greater progress can be made in a limited time with plants than with animals under a system of cross breeding. 

Not only have varieties of a given species, but what were formerly regarded as distinct species belonging to the same genus, been successfully mated. 
The tendency to sterility in their progeny is overcome by introducing pollen from one or other '01' the original plants, it being the male organs of reproduction that are liable to be absent or defective in the progeny of two extremely divergent parent plants. Many varieties as well as species can thus be blended in the formation of a new breed, but as it is necessary to secure fixity of type in every cross bred plant before it is again used for crossing, the labour and care involved are very considerable. 

Attempts at the production of first crosses are not new, as these have been practised for many years by experimenters in the same field, who however stopped short of the point at which the Garton System achieved its greatest results, viz.  by compound or multiple crossing. This further stage of the work of cross fertilisation leads to a thorough dislocation of the usual course of the law of inheritance by which "like produces like." In the wilderness of uncertainty and confusion which follows and in which the great majority of the progeny are found to be abortive or inferior, a few choice specimens appear which are grown for a number of years until fixity of type has been secured. These superior and selected specimens are adopted as suitable for cultivation, and a number of them are described in this Catalogue and offered to the public as much superior to the old varieties from which they were derived by the Garton System of Plant Breeding. In making the selections the large quantity and superior quality of the grain, together with great standing power in the straw have been the chief characteristics aimed at, and if these desiderata have been secured in a few of the new breeds to the detriment of the habit of "tillering," the difficulty is readily overcome by providing a liberal seeding.
 
Some of the most striking and valuable results have been achieved by introducing as progenitors, certain weeds belonging to the same natural order of plants as the cultivated parents. For example, an inferior variety of "spelt" wheat Triticum spelta from Southern Asia, has been employed with excellent results to introduce strength of gluten to the grain, and large yielding and standing power to the crop with immunity from shedding its seed during harvest.
 
A wild naked Oat, Avena nuda, indigenous to China has been used to produce new breeds which yield in some instances 100 per cent. more than their cultivated parents. Four or five grains are suspended in each spikelet by a thread like filament about half-an-inch long. This peculiar habit of the plant 'has been extended in the progeny and an' accompanying illustration shows a spikelet with no fewer than 14 grains in it.
 
The hardiness of constitution, standing power of straw, and remarkable fertility of the wild or land oat, Avena fatua, of Great Britain have been successfully introduced, but not without many difficulties, into some of the new breeds.
 
Some progress has also been made with the improvement of existing varieties of Agricultural plants by introducing pollen from plants of the same variety to increase the vigour of the plant without materially altering its general characteristics.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Great Australian Bight Marine Park.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Great Australian Bight]]

The '''Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System''' is a seasonal [[upwelling]] system in the eastern [[Great Australian Bight]], extending from [[Ceduna, South Australia]], to [[Portland, Victoria]], over a distance of about {{convert|800|km|mi}}. Upwelling events occur in the austral summer (from November to May) when seasonal winds blow from the southeast. These winds blow parallel to the shoreline at certain areas of the coast, which forces coastal waters offshore via [[Ekman transport]] and draws up cold, nutrient-rich waters from the ocean floor.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

Because the deep water carries abundant nutrients up from the [[ocean floor]], the upwelling area differs from the rest of the Great Australian Bight, especially the areas offshore of [[Western Australia]] and the [[Nullabor]] in [[South Australia]], which are generally nutrient-poor. Every summer, the upwelling sustains a bountiful ecosystem that attracts [[blue whale]]s and supports rich [[fishery|fisheries]].&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

The Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System (GSACUS) is [[Australia]]'s only deep-reaching coastal upwelling system, with nutrient-enriched water stemming from depths exceeding {{convert|300|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Preconditioning"&gt;Kämpf, J., 2010. On the preconditioning of coastal upwelling in the eastern Great Australian Bight. Journal of Geophysical Research – Oceans, VOL. 115, C12071, 11 pp., {{doi|10.1029/2010JC006294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, a new upwelling centre has been discovered on the western shelf of Tasmania.&lt;ref name="Tasmania"&gt;Kämpf, J., 2015. Phytoplankton blooms on the western shelf of Tasmania: evidence of a highly productive ecosystem, Ocean Sci., 11, 1-11. {{doi|10.5194/os-11-1-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this new upwelling centre is located outside South Australian waters, the entire upwelling system should be rather called the '''Great Southern Australian Coastal Upwelling System'''.

==Oceanographic processes==

During the austral summer, [[high-pressure system]]s over the Great Australian Bight cause southeasterly winds to blow over the coasts of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and South Australia. When winds blow parallel to the shoreline, [[Ekman transport]] pushes water to the left of the wind direction (in the southern hemisphere), which in this case is westward and offshore. To replace the water moving offshore, cold waters from the ocean floor rise to the surface.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|9–10}} During upwelling events, local sea surface temperature drops by  2-3 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

Key upwelling centres form in three different locations, described in the sub-sections below; the Kangaroo Island and Eyre Peninsula centres are linked by the same upwelling process.&lt;ref name="Conservation"&gt;Butler, A. J., F. Althaus, D. M. Furlani, and K. R. Ridgway.

Accessed 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2;10;25}}&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt; Upwelling events occur nearly simultaneously across the three separate centres, appearing within a few days of each other, despite spanning a distance of approximately {{convert|800|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|1–2}} While the Bonney Upwelling, where the strongest and most reliable upwelling events occur, was reported and explored over 30 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, R.K. 1981.

===Bonney Upwelling===

The Bonney Upwelling is the largest and most predictable upwelling in the GSACUS. It stretches from [[Portland, Victoria]] to [[Robe, South Australia]]. The [[continental shelf]] is narrow offshore of the "Bonney Coast" - only about {{convert|20|km|mi}} from the shore to the [[continental slope]] - and deep water is funneled to the surface through a series of [[submarine canyon]]s.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|4;24–26}}&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Kangaroo Island and Eyre Peninsula===

Upwelling at [[Kangaroo Island]] and the [[Eyre Peninsula]] is different than at the Bonney Upwelling. Here, the [[continental shelf]] is generally much wider than at the Bonney Coast - up to {{convert|100|km|mi}} wide off the Eyre Peninsula - and water is not drawn directly from the seafloor to the surface. Instead, field data and hydrodynamic modelling suggest that the upwelling follows from a chain of processes.&lt;ref name="Preconditioning"/&gt; This chain of processes starts in the deep submarine canyons of the Murray Canyon Group, located south of Kangaroo Island, where localized sub-surface upwelling brings a pool of cold water from the [[abyssal plains]] up to the continental shelf. This dense-water pool, named the ''Kangaroo Island Pool'', drifts along the shelf bottom just offshore of Kangaroo Island and the Eyre Peninsula. When a classical wind-driven upwelling event occurs, normally two to three times a summer, cold water is upwelled from the pool, not directly from the [[ocean floor]].&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|1–3}}&lt;ref name="Alongshore"&gt;McClatchie, S., J. F. Middleton, and T. M. Ward (2006), Water mass and alongshore variation in upwelling intensity in the eastern Great Australian Bight, J. Geophys. Res., 111, C08007, {{doi|10.1029/2004JC002699}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Der Borch, C.C., J.R. Conolly, R.S. Dietz, Sedimentation and structure of the continental margin in the vicinity of the Otway Basin, southern Australia, Marine Geology, Volume 8, Issue 1, January 1970, Pages 59-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:Nyctiphanes australis.jpg|thumb|alt=Australian Krill|Large swarms of [[krill]], ''[[Nyctiphanes australis]]'', form during upwelling events.]]
[[File:Blue Whale 001 body bw.jpg|thumb|alt=Blue Whale|An abundance of krill makes the Bonney Upwelling an important feeding site for the [[Blue Whale]] (''Balaenoptera musculus'')]]

Extensive upwelling of nutrient-rich water makes the GSACUS an important marine hot spot on Australia's southern shelves. During upwelling events, the abundance of the GSACUS ecosystem can approach that of some of the world’s most productive upwelling centers, such as those offshore of [[Humboldt Current|Peru]], [[California Current|California]], and [[Benguela Current#Upwelling and primary production|Namibia]].&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, T. M., McLeay, L. J., Dimmlich, W. F., Rogers, P. J., McClatchie, S., Matthews, R., Kämpf, J. and Van Ruth, P. D. (2006), Pelagic ecology of a northern boundary current system: effects of upwelling on the production and distribution of sardine (Sardinops sagax), anchovy (Engraulis australis) and southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) in the Great Australian Bight. Fisheries Oceanography, 15: 191–207. {{doi|10.1111/j.1365-2419.2006.00353.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During upwelling events, surface [[chlorophyll a]] concentrations, an indicator of phytoplankton abundance, increase tenfold.&lt;ref name="Kampf"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Phytoplankton blooms bring about swarms of [[krill]], which in turn attract [[blue whale]]s. Blue whales are found in various locations off the southeast coast of Australia, but most predominantly in the Bonney Upwelling region, which is one of 12 identified blue whale feeding sites worldwide. Marine biologist Peter Gill estimates that 100 blue whales visit the Bonney Upwelling area every year, ranging over {{convert|18,000|km2|sqmi}} of ocean from [[Robe, South Australia]] to [[Cape Otway]] in [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]]. The feeding grounds may extend further northwest, encompassing the rest of the GSACUS, but incomplete whale surveys are insufficient to establish their true range.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|2; 20–24}}&lt;ref name="Diary"&gt;Clevers, Jeni. [http://www.abc.net.au/nature/bigblue/diary.htm Producer's Diary]. ‘’The Big Blue’’. [[Australian Broadcasting Company]], 2007. Accessed 16 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other marine life that thrives in the upwelling includes filter feeders like [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, [[bryozoan]]s, and [[coral]]s. These animals feed predators such as seabirds, fishes, [[Australian fur seal]]s, and [[penguin]]s.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|ii}} The upwelling plays also an important role in the life cycle of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (''[[Thunnus maccoyii]]''), which accumulate in the eastern Great Australian Bight during the upwelling season and feed on sardines (''[[Sardinops sagax]]'') and anchovies (''[[Engraulis australis]]'').&lt;ref name="Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willis, J., and Hobday, A.

===Economic Importance===

The GSACUS supports a productive fishery, and local fishers recognize the bounty that the upwelling provides them.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|26}} Every November, [[Portland, Victoria]] hosts an [http://www.upwellingfestival.com.au Upwelling Festival] to celebrate the abundance of the Bonney Upwelling, and to begin the summer fishing season.&lt;ref name="Festival"/&gt;

Humans have exploited the GSACUS for thousands of years. Oral histories of local Aboriginal tribes indicate a close connection to the ocean, and said tribes may possibly have eaten [[beached whale]]s.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|36}} The [[Convincing Ground massacre]], which took place near [[Portland, Victoria]] in 1829, arose over a dispute between [[Whaling in Australia|European whalers]] and the [[Gunditjmara people]] over ownership of a beached whale.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Ian D. Clark, pp17-22, ''Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803-1859'', Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 {{ISBN|0-85575-281-5}} Excerpt also published on [http://museumvictoria.com.au/encounters/journeys/Robinson/convincing_ground.htm Museum Victoria website], accessed 26 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the mid-1840s, whaling and sealing were established as organized industries off the Bonney Coast.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|27}}

Today, [[southern rock lobster]] (referred to locally as crayfish) and [[trawling]] are the most important fishing industries in the Bonney Upwelling.&lt;ref name="Conservation"/&gt;{{rp|ii;28}} whereas the upwelling off the Eyre Peninsula supports a large sardine fishery, operating chiefly out of [[Port Lincoln, South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Alongshore"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sasardines.com.au/links-resources.html |title=South Australian Sardine Industry Inc |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

Next to the [[Great Barrier Reef]], the GSACUS and its ecosystem can be regarded as one of Australia's natural wonders. Due to its importance as a blue whale feeding and aggregation site, in 2002 the Bonney Upwelling was listed as critical habitat "requiring effective protection from user impacts"&lt;ref&gt;Australia.

'''Gregory M. Herek''', Ph.D. (born 1954 in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]) is a researcher, author, and professor of psychology at the [[University of California at Davis]] (UCD). He has conducted extensive research on prejudice against sexual minorities,&lt;ref name="goleman"&gt;{{citation |first=Daniel |last=Goleman |title=Homophobia: Scientists find clues to its roots |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 10, 1990 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DF113DF933A25754C0A966958260 |accessdate=2007-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coined the term ''[[sexual prejudice]]'' as a replacement for ''[[homophobia]]'' to describe this phenomenon. Herek argued that using the term homophobia incorrectly assumes that negative responses to lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are founded in pathological, irrational fear (a [[phobia]]), whereas psychological research indicates they are more accurately regarded as a form of [[prejudice]].&lt;ref name="herek2000"&gt;{{citation |first=Gregory M. |last=Herek |title=The psychology of sexual prejudice |periodical=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] |year=2000 |volume=9 |pages=19–22 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herek is an openly and prominent gay psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher John (February 6, 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yWMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22Gregory+Herek%22&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=INq7To2NLqSD4gSa-81I&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gregory%20Herek%22&amp;f=false "Gimme shelter"], ''The Advocate''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freiberg Peter (November 7, 1997), [http://www.glinn.com/news/11970198.htm "At least 20 Gay activists will participate in White House Conference on Hate Crimes"], ''Washington Blade''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bohan JS, Russell GM (1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rgv4Xdo9V-oC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22gay+psychologist%22+Gregory+Herek&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5SoA6fYODX&amp;sig=Ej4PiflBBxz0KQ7---WMHTAJgAs&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=F0C9TqacPIzR4QTZsOSTBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Gregory%20Herek%22&amp;f=false "Conversations about psychology and sexual orientation"], ''New York University Press''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Herek was born in 1954, the youngest of four children. He briefly attended the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]], but dropped out to devote himself to political activism.&lt;ref name="awards" /&gt; He later received his B.A. degree from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, and his M.A. and Ph.D. from the [[University of California, Davis]]. He completed a post-doctoral fellowship at [[Yale University]], followed by a year of teaching at Yale. He then joined the faculty at the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]]. In 1989, he returned to UC Davis, first as a research psychologist and then, since 1999, as a tenured professor.&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;{{citation  |title=Awards for Distinguished Contribution to Psychology in the Public Interest |periodical=American Psychologist |year=1997 |volume=52 |pages=345–348 |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=96503453 |issue=4 |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.52.4.345|last1=No Authorship Indicated }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Two principal foci of his original empirical research program are societal stigma based on sexual orientation and the social psychology of heterosexuals' attitudes towards lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals. He has published at least 108 papers and chapters in scholarly journals and books, most of them related to sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS, or attitudes and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=author%3AHerek+author%3AGM&amp;as_sdt=2000&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=1 |title=author:Herek author:GM - Google Scholar |publisher=Scholar.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has edited or coedited five books and two special issues of academic journals on these topics, and he has made more than 85 presentations at professional conferences and meetings. He has received numerous federal and state grants for his research with combined budgets totaling more than $5 million.

Over the 25 years, he has reviewed manuscripts on topics related to sexual orientation for a large number of scientific and professional journals spanning a variety of disciplines, including psychology, sociology, political science, sexuality studies, gender studies, and public health. He currently serves on the editorial boards of nine professional journals and he is frequently invited to serve as an ad hoc peer reviewer for others. He is also the Executive Editor Emeritus of Contemporary Perspectives on Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Psychology, a book series dedicated to scientific and professional works on sexual orientation and related topics, which is published by the American Psychological Association. He reviewed book proposals and edited manuscripts that addressed research on a variety of topics related to sexuality and sexual orientation.

As a member of a peer review panel for the National Institute of Mental Health from 1992 to 1995, and as an ad hoc reviewer for NIMH and the National Science Foundation on multiple occasions since then, he has reviewed proposals requesting federal funding for projects addressing an array of research questions related to sexuality. From 1995 to 2007, he served as chairperson of the Scientific Review Committee of the American Psychological Foundation's Wayne F. Placek Award competition, which funded empirical research in the behavioral and social sciences related to sexual minorities and sexual orientation.

He oversaw the review of more than 200 research proposals from a large number of academic disciplines.

Herek was an early advocate for scientific research on [[hate crimes]] based on sexual orientation, testifying in 1986 on behalf of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) for the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee's hearings on anti-gay violence.&lt;ref name="greerw"&gt;{{citation |first=William R. |last=Greer |title=Violence against homosexuals rising, groups seeking wider protection say |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9A0DE7D91638F930A15752C1A960948260 |date=November 23, 1986 |accessdate=2007-11-18}}. See also http://web1.msue.msu.edu/msue/imp/moddp/dp120303.html&lt;/ref&gt; He served as PhD advisor to graduate student [[Karen Franklin]] who also studied the psychology of [[violence]].

In 1993, he testified before the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] on behalf of the [[American Psychological Association]], [[American Psychiatric Association]], the [[National Association of Social Workers]], the [[American Counseling Association]], the [[American Nursing Association]], and the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]]. Herek summarized the results of an extensive review of the relevant published research from the social and behavioral sciences that the research data show that there is nothing about lesbians and gay men that makes them inherently unfit for military service, and there is nothing about heterosexuals that makes them inherently unable to work and live with gay people in close quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Herek: [http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/miltest2.html Oral Statement of Gregory M. Herek, Ph.D to the House Armed Services Committee - Made on behalf of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association, National Association of Social Workers, American Counseling Association, American Nursing Association, and the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927012407/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/miltest2.html |date=2016-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He concluded that heterosexual personnel can overcome their prejudices and adapt to living and working in close quarters with lesbians and gay men and that lesbians and gay men are not inherently less capable of military service than are heterosexual women and men. "The assumption that heterosexuals cannot overcome their prejudices toward gay people is a mistaken one," said Herek.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory M. Herek: [http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/miltest1.html Psychologist Testifies Against Military's Anti-Gay Ban - Researcher Cites Scientific Evidence That Nondiscriminatory Military Policy Can Be Implemented]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, he conducted the first federally funded scientific study to compare gay and lesbian hate crime victims with gay men and lesbians who were victimized in crimes of comparable severity that were not related to their sexual orientation. He found that hate crime survivors had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, compared to the other crime victims.&lt;ref name="herek1999"&gt;{{citation |first=Gregory M.

In recognition of this work, Herek was invited to participate in President Clinton's 1997 White House Conference on Hate Crimes, the only behavioral science researcher to be included among the invitees.&lt;ref name="ucdavisbio"&gt;{{citation |title=Gregory M.

The '''Hawai`i Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB)''' is  a marine biology laboratory located on the state-owned [[Coconut Island]] in [[Kāne'ohe Bay]].

==History==
The institute was established in 1912. It began as a wooden structure on the shores of [[Waikiki]] and originally functioned in conjunction with the [[Waikiki Aquarium]] until 1919 when both operations became part of the University of Hawai‘i. In 1947 a group of wealthy oil tycoons, including [[Edwin W. Pauley]], bought Coconut Island. Pauley donated a part of the island to the University for use as a marine laboratory for the study of the [[oceanography|marine sciences]].&lt;ref name=soest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UHMEnergy/Campus%20Energy%20Projects/Coconut%20Island.html|title=HIMB - A Brief History of Coconut Island|website=www.hawaii.edu|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1993, the Pauley family donated the remaining private part of Coconut Island for the construction of a world-class marine laboratory.&lt;ref name=soest/&gt;

In 2008, the institute was seeking 57 million dollars through state-issued bonds for the construction of a {{convert|24000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} marine research facility. The site is on the southeast side of the island. This is part of the master plan approved by the University of Hawaii's Board of Regents in 1998, which includes the addition of several research buildings, laboratories, and conference facilities. These will be funded on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2008/02/25/focus3.html?jst=pn_pn_lk|title=$57 million in bonds would fund Coconut Island facility|website=bizjournals.com|accessdate=May 22, 2018|author=Kalani, Nanea|date=February 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent is to turn Coconut Island into the world's premier [[coral reef]] research facility.&lt;ref name=honoluladvert&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Aug/01/ln/ln34a.html|title=Coconut Island impact study under way - The Honolulu Advertiser - Hawaii's Newspaper|work=[[The Honolulu Advertiser]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018|author=Aguiar, Eloise|date=August 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Coconut Island is approximately {{convert|29|acre|m2}}, including {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of enclosed lagoons used to keep organisms being studied in captivity. Surrounding it are {{convert|64|acre|m2}} of [[coral reef]], designated by the state of Hawai‘i as the Hawai‘i Marine Laboratory Refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dar/regulated-areas/coconut-island-hawaii-marine-laboratory-refuge/|title=Coconut Island – Hawai‘i Marine Laboratory Refuge|publisher=[[Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himb.hawaii.edu/|title=Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology|publisher=www.hawaii.edu|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only research facility in the world built on a coral reef.&lt;ref name=honoluladvert/&gt;

The boundaries of the Hawaii Marine Laboratory Refuge surrounding the island start at the high-water mark on the island and go to twenty-five feet beyond the outer edges of the reefs, including sand and seawall shoreline, where [[coral]] and [[calcium carbonate|sand calcium carbonate]] [[reef|reef flats]] are exposed at low tides. High coral and macro-algae flourish at shallow-depth zones while the deep habitats are characterized by [[sediment]] with low coral cover and colonized by [[Slump (geology)|slump]]ing from upper reef zones. Within Kaneohe Bay are sheltered areas. Man-made impacts in the area include [[dredging]], sewage release and freshwater flooding. The shores of the bay are characterized by coastal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.mpa.gov/exploreinv/SiteProfile4.aspx?SiteID=HI22|title=Site Profile - Moku-o-loe Island (Coconut Island)|publisher=www3.mpa.gov|accessdate=April 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220172810/http://www3.mpa.gov/exploreinv/SiteProfile4.aspx?SiteID=HI22|archivedate=December 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
The HIMB research facilities are used to explore deep-sea habitats where new species may be discovered and documented, as well as shallow reefs which are rich habitats likely to contain undiscovered species.&lt;ref name=nationalmarine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngsednet.org/workshop_details.cfm?w_id=27|title=National Marine Sanctuary Field Study|website=www.ngsednet.org|accessdate=April 6, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812215812/http://www.ngsednet.org/workshop_details.cfm?w_id=27|archivedate=August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Hawai‘i Coral Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program (CRAMP) is located at HIMB. It established a statewide network of more than 30   long-term coral reef monitoring sites with associated data collection systems. It went on to include rapid [[quantitative research]] and [[habitat]] mapping, which are tools new used to understand the ecology of the Hawaiian coral reefs in relation to surrounding geographic areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cramp.wcc.hawaii.edu/|title=Hawaii Coral Reef Assessment &amp; Monitoring Program (CRAMP) Home|publisher=cramp.wcc.hawaii.edu|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study of the HIMB research projects is on the effects of sound on [[dolphin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://starbulletin.com/2007/09/03/news/story04.html|title=UH tests sonar on sea mammals|date=September 3, 2007|work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]|accessdate=May 22, 2018|author=Kakesako, Gregg K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2004/jun04/noaa04-r155.html|title=NOAA Scientists Continue Nationwide Lecture Series on Human Noise Impact to Marine Mammals|website=www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov|date=June 4, 2004|accessdate=April 6, 2008|archivedate=September 17, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917164821/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2004/jun04/noaa04-r155.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another is the study of chemicals in [[Enchanted Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 2015, the institute was testing a new form of coral resistant to [[coral bleaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/05/scientists-attempt-to-breed-super-coral-to-save-threatened-reefs|title=Scientists attempt to breed 'super coral' to save threatened reefs|website=Theguardian.com|date=November 5, 2015|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute also spoke publicly to argue in favor of banning sunscreens with chemicals, as they majorly contribute to coral bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2018-05-04/hawaii-bans-sunscreens-with-chemicals-that-damage-coral-reefs-but-australia-reluctant-to-follow/1754154|title=Hawaii bans sunscreens with chemicals that damage coral reefs, but Australia reluctant to follow|website=Radioaustralia.net.au|date=May 4, 2018|author=Katherine Gregory|accessdate=May 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12132">A '''heteromer''' is something that consists of different parts. Examples are:

* [[Spinal neuron]]s that pass over to the opposite side of the spinal cord.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/heteromeric Medical dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Protein complex#Homomultimeric and heteromultimeric proteins|protein complex]] that contains two or more different polypeptides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/heteromeric Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
* [[Ligand-gated ion channel]]s such as the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]] and [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] are composed of five subunits arranged around a central pore that opens to allow ions to pass through. There are many different subunits available that can come together in a wide variety of combinations to form different subtypes of the ion channel.&lt;ref name="pmid17597586"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gotti C, Moretti M, Gaimarri A, Zanardi A, Clementi F, Zoli M | title = Heterogeneity and complexity of native brain nicotinic receptors | journal = [[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]] | volume = 74 | issue = 8 | pages = 1102–11 |date=October 2007 | pmid = 17597586 | doi = 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.05.023 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18723036"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Millar NS, Gotti C | title = Diversity of vertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 237–46 |date=January 2009 | pmid = 18723036 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2008.07.041 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19184647"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Collins AC, Salminen O, Marks MJ, Whiteaker P, Grady SR | title = The road to discovery of neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtypes | journal = Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology | volume = 192| issue = 192 | pages = 85–112 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19184647 | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-69248-5_4 | url =  | series = Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology | isbn = 978-3-540-69246-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the channel can be made from only one type of subunit, such as the [[Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor|α7 nicotinic receptor]], which is made up from five [[CHRNA7|α7]] subunits, and so is a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homomer homomer] rather than a heteromer, but more commonly several different types of subunit will come together to form a heteromeric complex (e.g., the [[Alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic receptor|α4β2 nicotinic receptor]], which is made up from two [[CHRNA4|α4]] subunits and three [[CHRNB2|β2]] subunits). Because the different ion channel subtypes are expressed to different extents in different tissues, this allows selective modulation of ion transport and means that a single [[neurotransmitter]] can produce varying effects depending on where in the body it is released.&lt;ref name="pmid12769611"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graham AJ, Martin-Ruiz CM, Teaktong T, Ray MA, Court JA | title = Human brain nicotinic receptors, their distribution and participation in neuropsychiatric disorders | journal = Current Drug Targets.

* [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s are composed of seven membrane-spanning alpha-helical segments that are usually linked together into a single folded chain to form the receptor complex. However, research has demonstrated that a number of GPCRs are also capable of forming heteromers from a combination of two or more individual GPCR subunits under some circumstances, especially where several different GPCRs are densely expressed in the same neuron. Such heteromers may be between receptors from the same family (e.g., adenosine [[Adenosine A1 receptor|A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[Adenosine A2A receptor|A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]] heteromers&lt;ref name="pmid16481441"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciruela F, Casadó V, Rodrigues RJ, Luján R, Burgueño J, Canals M, Borycz J, Rebola N, Goldberg SR, Mallol J, Cortés A, Canela EI, López-Giménez JF, Milligan G, Lluis C, Cunha RA, Ferré S, Franco R | title = Presynaptic control of striatal glutamatergic neurotransmission by adenosine A1-A2A receptor heteromers | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 2080–7 |date=February 2006 | pmid = 16481441 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3574-05.2006 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17981720"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ferre S, Ciruela F, Borycz J, Solinas M, Quarta D, Antoniou K, Quiroz C, Justinova Z, Lluis C, Franco R, Goldberg SR | title = Adenosine A1-A2A receptor heteromers: new targets for caffeine in the brain | journal = Frontiers in Bioscience | volume = 13 | issue = 13| pages = 2391–9 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17981720 | doi = 10.2741/2852| url = http://www.bioscience.org/2008/v13/af/2852/fulltext.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and dopamine [[D1-D2 Dopamine receptor heteromer|D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;ref name="pmid17194762"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rashid AJ, So CH, Kong MM, Furtak T, El-Ghundi M, Cheng R, O'Dowd BF, George SR | title = D1–D2 dopamine receptor heterooligomers with unique pharmacology are coupled to rapid activation of Gq/11 in the striatum | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 2 | pages = 654–9 |date=January 2007 | pmid = 17194762 | pmc = 1766439 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0604049104 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[dopamine receptor D1|D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[dopamine receptor D3|D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] heteromers&lt;ref name="pmid18644790"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marcellino D, Ferré S, Casadó V, Cortés A, Le Foll B, Mazzola C, Drago F, Saur O, Stark H, Soriano A, Barnes C, Goldberg SR, Lluis C, Fuxe K, Franco R | title = Identification of Dopamine D1–D3 Receptor Heteromers: INDICATIONS FOR A ROLE OF SYNERGISTIC D1–D3 RECEPTOR INTERACTIONS IN THE STRIATUM | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 38 | pages = 26016–25 |date=September 2008 | pmid = 18644790 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M710349200 | url = | pmc = 2533781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) or between entirely unrelated receptors such as CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name="pmid17356572"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carriba P, Ortiz O, Patkar K, Justinova Z, Stroik J, Themann A, Müller C, Woods AS, Hope BT, Ciruela F, Casadó V, Canela EI, Lluis C, Goldberg SR, Moratalla R, Franco R, Ferré S | title = Striatal adenosine A2A and cannabinoid CB1 receptors form functional heteromeric complexes that mediate the motor effects of cannabinoids| journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 32 | issue = 11 | pages = 2249–59 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17356572 | doi = 10.1038/sj.npp.1301375 | url = http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v32/n11/pdf/1301375a.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; glutamate [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5|mGluR&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] / adenosine A&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers,&lt;ref name="pmid18246094"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zezula J, Freissmuth M | title = The A2A-adenosine receptor: a GPCR with unique features? | journal = [[British Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume = 153 Suppl 1 | issue = S1| pages = S184–90 |date=March 2008 | pmid = 18246094 | pmc = 2268059 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707674 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; cannabinoid [[Cannabinoid receptor 1|CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] / dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heteromers,&lt;ref name="pmid18262573"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marcellino D, Carriba P, Filip M, Borgkvist A, Frankowska M, Bellido I, Tanganelli S, Müller CE, Fisone G, Lluis C, Agnati LF, Franco R, Fuxe K | title = Antagonistic cannabinoid CB1/dopamine D2 receptor interactions in striatal CB1/D2 heteromers.

The '''history of the polymerase chain reaction''' (PCR) has variously been described as a classic [[Eureka (word)|"Eureka!"]] moment,&lt;ref name=MullisLecture&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1993/mullis-lecture.html Kary Mullis' Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; or as an example of cooperative teamwork between disparate researchers.&lt;ref name=Rabinow&gt;Rabinow P "Making PCR: A Story of Biotechnology" University of Chicago Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-226-70147-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following is a list of events before, during, and after its development:

==Prelude==
* On '''April 25, 1953''' [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] published "a radically different structure" for [[DNA]],&lt;ref&gt;Watson JD, Crick FHC "A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid", Nature vol. 171, pp. 737–738 (1953).  [http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/coldspring/ideas/printit.html]&lt;/ref&gt; thereby founding the field of [[molecular genetics]].  Their [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|structural model]] featured two strands of [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[Base pair|base-paired]] DNA, running in opposite directions as a double helix.  They concluded their report saying that "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material".  For this insight they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in '''1962'''.
* Starting in the '''mid-1950s''', [[Arthur Kornberg]] began to study the mechanism of [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref&gt;(Arthur Kornberg's Discovery of DNA Polymerase I) J. Biol. Chem. vol. 280, p. 46. [http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/280/49/e46]&lt;/ref&gt;  By '''1957''' he has identified the first [[DNA polymerase]].&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, IR, Bessman MJ, Simms ES, Kornberg A "Enzymatic Synthesis of Deoxyribonucleic Acid. I. Preparation of Substrates and Partial Purification of an Enzyme from Escherichia coli" J. Biol. Chem. vol. 233(1) pp. 163–170 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  The enzyme was limited, creating DNA in just one direction and requiring an existing [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] to initiate copying of the template strand.  Overall, the DNA replication process is surprisingly complex, requiring separate proteins to [[DNA helicase|open]] the DNA helix, to [[Single-strand binding protein|keep]] it open, to create [[Primase|primers]], to [[DNA polymerase III holoenzyme|synthesize]] new DNA, to [[DNA polymerase I|remove]] the primers, and to [[DNA ligase|tie]] the pieces all together.  Kornberg was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in '''1959'''.
* In the '''early 1960s''' [[H. Gobind Khorana]] made significant advances in the elucidation of the [[genetic code]].  Afterwards, he initiated a large project to [[Gene synthesis|totally synthesize]] a functional human [[gene]].&lt;ref&gt;Khorana HG et al. "Total synthesis of the structural gene for the precursor of a tyrosine suppressor transfer RNA from Escherichia coli. 1. General introduction" J. Biol. Chem. vol. 251(3) pp. 565–70 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  To achieve this, Khorana pioneered many of the techniques needed to make and use [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthetic]] DNA [[oligonucleotide]]s.  Sequence-specific oligonucleotides were used both as building blocks for the gene, and as primers and templates for DNA polymerase.  In '''1968''' Khorana was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] for his work on the Genetic Code.
* In '''1969''' [[Thomas D. Brock]] reported the isolation of a new species of [[bacterium]] from a [[hot spring]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]].  ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]''&lt;ref&gt;Brock TD, Freeze H "Thermus aquaticus, a Nonsporulating Extreme Thermophile" J. Bacteriol. vol. 98(1) pp. 289–297 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; (Taq), became a standard source of enzymes able to withstand higher temperatures than those from ''[[Escherichia coli|E. Coli]]''.
* In '''1970''' Klenow reported a modified version of DNA Polymerase I from ''E. coli''.&lt;ref&gt;Klenow H and Henningsen I "Selective Elimination of the Exonuclease Activity of the Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase from Escherichia coli B by Limited Proteolysis" Proc Natl Acad Sci vol. 65 pp. 168–75 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  Treatment with a protease removed the 'forward' nuclease activity of this enzyme.  The overall activity of the resulting [[Klenow fragment]] is therefore biased towards the synthesis of DNA, rather than its degradation.
* By '''1971''' researchers in Khorana's project, concerned over their yields of DNA, began looking at "repair synthesis" – an artificial system of primers and templates that allows DNA polymerase to copy segments of the gene they are synthesizing.  Although similar to PCR in using repeated applications of DNA polymerase, the process they usually describe&lt;ref name=Khorana1&gt;Panet A, Khorana HG "Studies on Polynucleotides" J. Biol. Chem. vol. 249(16), pp. 5213–21 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; employs just a single primer-template complex, and therefore would not lead to the exponential amplification seen in PCR.
* Circa '''1971''' [[Kjell Kleppe]], a researcher in Khorana's lab, envisioned a process very similar to PCR.  At the end of a paper on the earlier technique,&lt;ref name=Kleppe&gt;Kleppe K, Ohtsuka E, Kleppe R, Molineux I, Khorana HG "Studies on polynucleotides. XCVI. Repair replications of short synthetic DNA's as catalyzed by DNA polymerases." J. Molec. Biol. vol. 56, pp. 341–61 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; he described how a two-primer system might lead to replication of a specific segment of DNA:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:::''"one would hope to obtain two structures, each containing the full length of the template strand appropriately complexed with the primer. DNA polymerase will be added to complete the process of repair replication. Two molecules of the original duplex should result. The whole cycle could be repeated, there being added every time a fresh dose of the enzyme."'' &lt;ref name=Kleppe/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:No results are shown there, and the mention of unpublished experiments in another paper&lt;ref name=Khorana1/&gt; may (or may not) refer to the two-primer replication system. (These early precursors to PCR were carefully scrutinized in a patent lawsuit, and are discussed in Mullis' chapters in ''The Polymerase Chain Reaction'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB, Ferré F, Gibbs RA "The Polymerase Chain Reaction" Birkhäuser Press (1994) {{ISBN|0-8176-3750-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

* Also in '''1971''', [[Cetus Corporation]] was founded in [[Berkeley, California]] by Ronald Cape, Peter Farley, and Donald Glaser.  Initially the company screened for microorganisms capable of producing components used in the manufacture of food, chemicals, vaccines, or pharmaceuticals. After moving to nearby [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], they began projects involving the new [[Genetic engineering|biotechnology]] industry, primarily the [[Recombinant DNA|cloning]] and [[Gene expression|expression]] of human genes, but also the development of diagnostic tests for genetic mutations.
* In '''1976''' a [[Taq polymerase|DNA polymerase]]&lt;ref name=Chien&gt;Chien A, Edgar DB, Trela JM "Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from the extreme thermophile Thermus aquaticus" J. Bacteriol. vol. 174 pp. 1550–1557 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; was isolated from [[Thermus aquaticus|''T. aquaticus'']]. It was found to retain its activity at temperatures above 75&amp;nbsp;°C.
* In '''1977''' [[Frederick Sanger]] reported a [[Chain termination method|method]] for determining the sequence of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR "DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors" Proc Natl Acad Sci vol. 74(12) pp. 5463–7 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique employed an oligonucleotide [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]], DNA polymerase, and modified [[Dideoxynucleotide|nucleotide precursors]] that block further extension of the primer in sequence-dependent manner.  For this innovation he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize]] in '''1980'''.

By '''1980''' all of the components needed to perform PCR amplification were known to the scientific community.  The use of DNA polymerase to extend oligonucleotide primers was a common procedure in DNA sequencing and the production of [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] for [[Recombinant DNA|cloning]] and [[Gene expression|expression]].  The use of DNA polymerase for [[nick translation]] was the most common method used to label [[Hybridization probe|DNA probes]] for [[Southern blot]]ting.

== Theme ==
* In '''1979''' [[Cetus Corporation]] hired [[Kary Mullis]] to synthesize oligonucleotides for various research and development projects throughout the company.&lt;ref name=Mullis-1&gt;Mullis KB "The Unusual Origins of the Polymerase Chain Reaction" Scientific American, vol. 262, pp. 56–65 (April 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; These oligos were used as probes for screening cloned genes, as primers for DNA sequencing and cDNA synthesis, and as building blocks for gene construction. Originally synthesizing these oligos by hand, Mullis later evaluated early prototypes for automated synthesizers.&lt;ref name=MullisLecture/&gt;
* By '''May 1983''' Mullis synthesized oligonucleotide probes for a project at Cetus to analyze a [[sickle cell anemia]] mutation. Hearing of problems with their work, Mullis proposed an alternative technique based on Sanger's [[Chain termination method|DNA sequencing]] method.&lt;ref name=Mullis-1/&gt; Realizing the difficulty in making the Sanger method specific to a single location in the genome, Mullis then modified the idea to add a second primer on the opposite strand. Repeated applications of polymerase could lead to a chain reaction of replication for a specific segment of the genome – PCR.
* Later in '''1983''' Mullis began to test his idea. His first experiment&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; did not involve thermal cycling – he hoped that the polymerase could perform continued replication on its own. Later experiments that year included repeated thermal cycling, and targeted small segments of a cloned gene. Mullis considered these experiments a success, but could not convince other researchers.
* In '''June 1984''' Cetus held its annual meeting in [[Monterey, California]]. Its scientists and consultants presented their results, and considered future projects. Mullis presented a poster on the production of oligonucleotides by his laboratory, and presented some of the results from his experiments with PCR.&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; Only [[Joshua Lederberg]], a Cetus consultant, showed any interest.&lt;ref name=Mullis-1/&gt; Later at the meeting, Mullis was involved in a physical altercation with another Cetus researcher over a dispute unrelated to PCR.&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; The other scientist left the company, and Mullis was removed as head of the oligo synthesis lab.

==Development==
* In '''September 1984''' Tom White, [[Vice president|VP]] of Research at Cetus (and a close friend), pressured Mullis to take his idea to the group developing the genetic mutation assay.  Together, they spent the following months designing experiments that could convincingly show that PCR is working on genomic DNA.  Unfortunately, the expected amplification product was not visible in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]],&lt;ref name=Scharf&gt;Scharf et al. "Direct Cloning and Sequence Analysis of Enzymatically Amplified Genomic Sequences" Science vol. 233, pp. 1076–78 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; leading to confusion as to whether the reaction had any specificity to the targeted region.
* In '''November 1984'''&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; the amplification products were analyzed by [[Southern blot]]ting, which clearly demonstrating increasing amount of the expected 110 [[base pair|bp]] DNA product.&lt;ref name=Saiki1&gt;Saiki RK et al. "Enzymatic Amplification of β-globin Genomic Sequences and Restriction Site Analysis for Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia" Science vol. 230 pp. 1350–54 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  Having the first visible signal, the researchers began optimizing the process.  Later, the amplified products were cloned and sequenced, showing that only a small fraction of the amplified DNA is the desired target, and that the [[Klenow fragment]] then being used only rarely incorporates incorrect nucleotides during replication.&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt;

==Exposition==
* As per normal industrial practice, the results were first used to apply for [[patent]]s.  Mullis applied &lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB "Process for amplifying nucleic acid sequences." U.S. Patent 4,683,202.&lt;/ref&gt; for a patent covering the basic idea of PCR and many potential applications, and was asked by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|PTO]] to include more results.  On '''March 28, 1985''' the entire development group (including Mullis) filed an application&lt;ref&gt;Mullis, KB et al. "Process for amplifying, detecting, and/or-cloning nucleic acid sequences." U.S. Patent 4,683,195.&lt;/ref&gt; that is more focused on the analysis of the Sickle Cell Anemia mutation via PCR and [[Oligomer restriction]].  After modification, both patents were approved on '''July 28, 1987'''.
* In the '''spring of 1985''' the development group began to apply the PCR technique to other targets.  Primers and probes were designed for a variable segment of the [[Human leukocyte antigen]] [[HLA-DQA1|DQα]] gene.  This reaction was much more specific than that for the β-hemoglobin target – the expected PCR product&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt; is directly visible on [[agarose gel electrophoresis]].  The amplification products from various sources were also cloned and sequenced, the first determination of new  alleles by PCR.&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt;  At this same time the original Oligomer Restriction assay technique was replaced with the more general [[Allele specific oligonucleotide]] method.&lt;ref name=Saiki2&gt;Saiki et al. "Analysis of enzymatically amplified β-globin and HLA DQα DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes." Nature vol. 324 (6093) pp. 163–6 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also '''early in 1985''', the group began using a thermostable DNA polymerase (the [[Klenow fragment|enzyme]] used in the original reaction is destroyed at each heating step).  At the time&lt;ref name=MullisLecture/&gt; only two had been described, from [[Thermus aquaticus|Taq]] and [[Bacillus stearothermophilus|Bst]].  The report on Taq polymerase&lt;ref name=Chien/&gt; was more detailed, so it was chosen for testing.  The Bst polymerase was later found to be unsuitable for PCR{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.  That summer Mullis attempted to isolate the enzyme, and a group outside of Cetus was contracted to make it, all without success.  In the '''Fall of 1985''' Susanne Stoffel and David Gelfand at Cetus succeed in making the polymerase, and it was immediately found by Randy Saiki to support the PCR process.
* With patents submitted, work proceeded to report PCR to the general scientific community.  An abstract for an [[American Society of Human Genetics]] meeting in [[Salt Lake City]] was submitted in '''April 1985''', and the first announcement of PCR was made there by Saiki in '''October'''.&lt;ref&gt;Saiki, R et al. "A Novel Method for the Prenatal Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia" Amer. Soc. Human Genetics, Oct. 9–13, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two publications were planned – an 'idea' paper from Mullis, and an 'application' paper from the entire development group.  Mullis submitted his manuscript to the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], which rejected it for not including results.  The other paper, mainly describing the [[Oligomer restriction|OR]] analysis assay, was submitted to [[Science (journal)|Science]] on '''September 20, 1985''' and was accepted in November.  After the rejection of Mullis' report in December, details on the PCR process were hastily added to the second paper, which appears on '''December 20, 1985'''.&lt;ref name=Saiki1/&gt;
* In '''May 1986''' Mullis presented PCR at the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium,&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB et al. "Specific enzymatic amplification of DNA in vitro: the polymerase chain reaction." Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. vol. 51 pp. 263–73 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; and published a modified version of his original 'idea' manuscript much later.&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB and Faloona FA "Specific Synthesis of DNA in vitro via a Polymerase-Catalyzed Chain Reaction." Methods in Enzymology vol. 155(F) pp. 335–50 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  The first non-Cetus report using PCR was submitted on '''September 5, 1986''',&lt;ref&gt;Verlaan-de Vries M et al. "A dot-blot screening procedure for mutated ras oncogenes using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides." Gene vol. 50(1–3) pp. 313–20 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; indicating how quickly other laboratories began implementing the technique.  The Cetus development group published their detailed sequence analysis of PCR products on '''September 8, 1986''',&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt; and their use of [[Allele specific oligonucleotide|ASO]] probes on '''November 13, 1986'''.&lt;ref name=Saiki2/&gt;
* The use of Taq polymerase in PCR was announced by Henry Erlich at a [[International Congress of Human Genetics|meeting]] in Berlin on '''September 20, 1986''', submitted for publication in '''October 1987''', and was published early the next year'.&lt;ref name=Saiki3&gt;Saiki et al. "Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase." Science vol. 239 pp. 487–91 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  The patent for PCR with Taq polymerase was filed on '''June 17, 1987''', and is issued on '''October 23, 1990'''.&lt;ref&gt;Mullis, KB et al. "Process for amplifying, detecting, and/or cloning nucleic acid sequences using a thermostable enzyme." U.S. Patent 4,965,188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variation==

* In '''December 1985''' a joint venture between Cetus and [[PerkinElmer|Perkin-Elmer]] was established to develop instruments and reagents for PCR.  Complex [[Thermal cycler|Thermal Cyclers]] were constructed to perform the Klenow-based amplifications, but never marketed.  Simpler machines for Taq-based PCR were developed, and on '''November 19, 1987''' a press release announces the commercial availability of the "PCR-1000 Thermal Cycler" and "AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase".
* In the '''Spring of 1985''' John Sninsky at Cetus began to use PCR for the difficult task of measuring the amount of HIV circulating in blood.  A viable test was announced on '''April 11, 1986''', and published in '''May 1987'''.&lt;ref&gt;Kwok S et al. "Identification of HIV sequences by using in vitro enzymatic amplification and oligomer cleavage detection." J. Virol. vol. 61(5) pp. 1690–4 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  Donated blood could then be screened for the virus, and the effect of antiviral drugs directly monitored.
* In '''1985''' Norm Arnheim, also a member of the development team, concluded his sabbatical at Cetus and assumed an academic position at [[University of Southern California|USC]].  He began to investigate the use of PCR to amplifiy samples containing just a single copy of the target sequence.  By '''1989''' his lab developed multiplex-PCR on single sperm to directly analyze the products of meiotic recombination.&lt;ref&gt;Boehnke M et al. "Fine-structure genetic mapping of human chromosomes using the polymerase chain reaction on single sperm." Am J Hum Genet vol. 45(1) pp. 21–32 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  These single-copy amplifications, which had first been run during the characterization of Taq polymerase,&lt;ref name=Saiki3/&gt; became vital to the study of [[ancient DNA]], as well as the genetic typing of preimplanted embryos.
* In '''1986''' Edward Blake, a forensics scientist working in the Cetus building, collaborated with Henry Erlich a researcher at Cetus, to apply PCR to the analysis of criminal evidence.  A panel of DNA samples from old cases was collected and coded, and was analyzed blind by Saiki using the HLA DQα assay.  When the code was broken, all of the evidence and perpetrators matched.  Blake and Erlich's group used the technique almost immediately in "Pennsylvania v. Pestinikas",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forensicdna.com/Timeline020702.pdf Forensic Science Timeline (PDF).]&lt;/ref&gt; the first use of PCR in a criminal case.  This DQα test is developed by Cetus as one of their "Ampli-Type" kits, and became part of early protocols for the testing of forensic evidence, such as in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]].
* By '''1989''' [[Alec Jeffreys]], who had earlier developed and applied the first [[DNA Fingerprinting]] tests, used PCR to increase their sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys A et al. "Amplification of human minisatellites." Nucleic Acids Research vol. 23 pp. 10953-71 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  With further modification, the amplification of highly polymorphic [[Variable number tandem repeat|VNTR]] loci became the standard protocol for [[National DNA Database]]s such as [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]].
* In '''1987''' Russ Higuchi succeeded in amplifying DNA from a human hair.&lt;ref&gt;Higuchi R et al. "DNA typing from single hairs." Nature vol. 332(6164) pp. 543–6 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  This work expanded to develop methods for the amplification of DNA from highly degraded samples, such as from [[Ancient DNA]] and in [[Forensics|forensic]] evidence.

==Coda==
* On '''December 22, 1989''' the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] awarded Taq Polymerase (and PCR) its first "Molecule of the Year".  The 'Taq PCR' paper&lt;ref name=Saiki3/&gt; became for several years the most [[Citation index|cited]] publication in biology.
* After the publication of the first PCR paper,&lt;ref name=Saiki1/&gt; the [[United States Government]] sent a stern letter to Randy Saiki, admonishing him for publishing a report on [[Nuclear chain reaction|"chain reactions"]] without the required prior review and approval by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].  Cetus responded, explaining the differences between PCR and the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* On '''July 23, 1991''' Cetus announced that its sale to the neighboring biotechnology company [[Chiron Corporation|Chiron]].  As part of the sale, rights to the PCR patents were sold for USD $300 million to [[Hoffman-La Roche]] (who in '''1989''' had bought limited rights to PCR).  Many of the Cetus PCR researchers moved to the Roche subsidiary, [[Roche Diagnostics|Roche Molecular Systems]].
* On '''October 13, 1993''' Kary Mullis, who had left Cetus in '''1986''', was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].  On the morning of his acceptance speech,&lt;ref name=MullisLecture/&gt; he was nearly arrested by Swedish authorities for the "inappropriate use of a laser pointer".&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB "Dancing Naked in the Mind Field" Pantheon Books (1998) {{ISBN|0-679-44255-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Honglujing Stele''' ({{zh|t=鴻臚井|s= 鸿胪井|p=Hónglújǐng}}) is a tablet 3 meters wide, 1.8 meters tall, &amp; 2 meters thick. It has 29 [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] characters written on it.

It is the only [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907) stele from [[Manchuria]]. It mentions the 1st king of the [[Balhae]] around 698 - 926 CE. The king listed on the tablet is [[Go of Balhae]].

This kingdom is considered [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n, or independent, depending on the nationality of the researcher. Russian and Japanese scholars classify it as an independent [[Mohe people|Mohe]] state.

It is currently located in the [[Japanese Imperial Palace]]. It was taken from [[Liaoning]] province, [[Lüshun]] city in about 1907 after the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Chinese researchers are now studying it for the first time.

'''Humanistic naturalism''' is the branch of [[philosophical naturalism]] wherein [[human beings]] are best able to control and understand the world through use of the [[scientific method]], combined with the social and ethical values of [[humanism]]. Concepts of spirituality, intuition, and [[metaphysics]] are considered [[subjectivity|subjectively]] valuable only, primarily because they are unfalsifiable, and therefore can never progress beyond the realm of personal opinion. A boundary is not drawn between [[nature]] and what lies "beyond" nature; everything is regarded as a result of explainable processes within nature, with nothing lying outside it.&lt;ref&gt;'' Living Issues in Philosophy'' (4th ed.; New York: American Book Co., 1963): 215-221.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The belief is that all living things are intricate extensions of nature, and therefore deserve some degree of mutual respect from human beings. Naturalists accept the need for adaptation to current change, however it may be, and also that life must feed upon life for survival. However, they also recognize the necessity for a fair exchange of resources between all species. Humanistic naturalists are generally concerned with the ethical aspects of "worldview naturalism."&lt;ref&gt;''What is Humanism'' (American Humanist Association)&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Industry and technology are sometimes regarded as enemies to naturalism, but this is not always the case. For those who do believe in such threats, the thought is that the majority of human history, societies were largely agricultural and [[hunter-gatherer]] and lived in relative harmony and balance with nature. With the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, some humanistic naturalists see this balance as being increasingly threatened. This view has some similarities with [[anarcho-primitivism]] and other anti-modernist perspectives.

In [[fluid mechanics]], a [[fluid]] is said to be in '''hydrostatic equilibrium''' or '''hydrostatic balance''' when it is at rest, or when the flow velocity at each point is constant over time. This occurs when external forces such as [[gravity]] are balanced by a [[pressure-gradient force]].&lt;ref&gt;White (2008). p 63, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] into a thin, dense shell, whereas gravity prevents the pressure gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into space.

Hydrostatic equilibrium is the current distinguishing criterion between [[dwarf planet]]s and [[Small Solar System body|small Solar System bodies]], and has other roles in [[astrophysics]] and [[planetary geology]]. This qualification typically means that the object is symmetrically rounded into a [[spheroid]] or [[ellipsoid]] shape, where any irregular surface features are due to a relatively thin solid [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. There are [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System|32 observationally confirmed&lt;!--of the DPs, only Ceres, Pluto, and Eris are obs. confirmed. the others rely on mathematical modeling.--&gt; such objects]] (apart from the Sun), sometimes called ''[[planemo]]s,''&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Stern]] considers these all to be "planets", but that conception was rejected by the [[International Astronomical Union]].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Solar System]], seven more&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html |title=Astronomer Mike Brown |publisher=Gps.caltech.edu |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2014-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018154917/http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html |archivedate=2011-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--3 accepted by the IAU, &amp; 4 more that "must" be according to Mike Brown--&gt; that are virtually certain, and [[List of possible dwarf planets|a hundred or so more]] that are likely.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

==Mathematical consideration==
[[File:Hydrostatic equilibrium.svg|thumb|right|If the highlighted volume of fluid is not accelerating, the forces on it upwards must equal the forces downwards.]]

===Derivation from force summation===
[[Newton's laws of motion]] state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it. This means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction. This force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibrium.

The fluid can be split into a large number of [[cuboid]] volume elements; by considering a single element, the action of the fluid can be derived.

There are 3 forces: the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure, P, of the fluid above it is, from the definition of [[pressure]],
:&lt;math&gt;F_{top} = - P_{top} \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards is
:&lt;math&gt;F_{bottom} = P_{bottom} \cdot A.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the [[weight]] of the volume element causes a force downwards.  If the [[density]] is ρ, the volume is V and g the [[standard gravity]], then:
:&lt;math&gt;F_{weight} = -\rho \cdot g \cdot V.&lt;/math&gt;
The volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom, times the height&amp;nbsp;— the formula for finding the volume of a cube.
:&lt;math&gt;F_{weight} = -\rho \cdot g \cdot A \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

By balancing these forces, the total force on the fluid is
:&lt;math&gt;\sum F = F_{bottom} + F_{top} + F_{weight} = P_{bottom} \cdot A - P_{top} \cdot A - \rho \cdot g \cdot A \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
This sum equals zero if the fluid's velocity is constant.  Dividing by A,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = P_{bottom} - P_{top} - \rho \cdot g \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
Or,
:&lt;math&gt;P_{top} - P_{bottom} = - \rho \cdot g \cdot h.&lt;/math&gt;
P&lt;sub&gt;top&lt;/sub&gt; − P&lt;sub&gt;bottom&lt;/sub&gt; is a change in pressure, and h is the height of the volume element—a change in the distance above the ground.  By saying these changes are [[infinitesimal]]ly small, the equation can be written in [[differential equation|differential]] form.
:&lt;math&gt;dP = - \rho \cdot g \cdot dh.&lt;/math&gt;
Density changes with pressure, and gravity changes with height, so the equation would be:
:&lt;math&gt;dP = - \rho(P) \cdot g(h) \cdot dh.&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation from Navier–Stokes equations===
Note finally that this last equation can be derived by solving the three-dimensional [[Navier–Stokes equations]] for the equilibrium situation where
:&lt;math&gt;u=v=\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the only non-trivial equation is the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-equation, which now reads
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}+\rho g=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, hydrostatic balance can be regarded as a particularly simple equilibrium solution of the Navier–Stokes equations.

===Derivation from general relativity===
By plugging the energy momentum tensor for a [[perfect fluid]]
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu}=(\rho c^{-2}+P)u^\mu u^\nu+Pg^{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
into the [[Einstein field equations]]
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^4}(T_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}T)&lt;/math&gt;
and using the conservation condition
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0&lt;/math&gt;
one can derive the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation]] for the structure of a static, spherically symmetric relativistic star in isotropic coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dr}=-\frac{G M(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}\left(1+\frac{P(r)}{\rho(r)c^2}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
In practice, ''Ρ'' and ''ρ'' are related by an equation of state of the form ''f''(''Ρ'',''ρ'')=0, with ''f'' specific to makeup of the star. ''M''(''r'') is a foliation of spheres weighted by the mass density ''ρ''(''r''), with the largest sphere having radius ''r'':
:&lt;math&gt;M(r)=4\pi\int_0^r dr' r'^2\rho(r').&lt;/math&gt;
Per standard procedure in taking the nonrelativistic limit, we let ''c''→∞, so that the factor
:&lt;math&gt;\left(1+\frac{P(r)}{\rho(r)c^2}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3P(r)}{M(r)c^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{2GM(r)}{r c^2}\right)^{-1}\rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, in the nonrelativistic limit the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equation reduces to Newton's hydrostatic equilibrium:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dr}=-\frac{GM(r)\rho(r)}{r^2}=-g(r)\,\rho(r)\longrightarrow dP = - \rho(h)\,g(h)\, dh&lt;/math&gt;
(we have made the trivial notation change ''h''=''r'' and have used ''f''(''Ρ'',''ρ'')=0 to express ''ρ'' in terms of ''P'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zee|first1=A.|title=Einstein gravity in a nutshell|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691145587|pages=451–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar equation can be computed for rotating, axially symmetric stars, which in its gauge independent form reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial_i P}{P+\rho} - \partial_i \ln u^t + u_t u^{\phi}\partial_i\frac{u_{\phi}}{u_t}=0&lt;/math&gt; 
Unlike the TOV equilibrium equation, these are two equations (for instance, if as usual when treating stars, one chooses spherical coordinates as basis coordinates &lt;math&gt;(t,r,\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, the index ''i'' runs for the coordinates ''r'' and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;).

==Applications==

===Fluids===
The hydrostatic equilibrium pertains to [[hydrostatics]] and the [[principles of equilibrium]] of [[fluid]]s.  A hydrostatic balance is a particular balance for weighing substances in water.  Hydrostatic balance allows the [[discovery (observation)|discovery]] of their [[specific gravity|specific gravities]].

===Astrophysics===
In any given layer of a [[star]], there is a hydrostatic equilibrium between the outward thermal pressure from below and the weight of the material above pressing inward.  The [[isotropic]] gravitational field compresses the star into the most compact shape possible. A rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium is an [[oblate spheroid]] up to a certain (critical) angular velocity. An extreme example of this phenomenon is the star [[Vega]], which has a rotation period of 12.5 hours. Consequently, Vega is about 20% larger at the equator than at the poles. A star with an angular velocity above the critical angular velocity becomes a [[Jacobi ellipsoid|Jacobi (scalene) ellipsoid]], and at still faster rotation it is no longer ellipsoidal but [[wikt:pyriform|piriform]] or [[oviform]], with yet other shapes beyond that, though shapes beyond scalene are not stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.josleys.com/show_gallery.php?galid=313 |title=Gallery : The shape of Planet Earth |publisher=Josleys.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the star has a massive nearby companion object then [[tidal force]]s come into play as well, distorting the star into a scalene shape when rotation alone would make it a spheroid.  An example of this is [[Beta Lyrae]].

Hydrostatic equilibrium is also important for the [[intracluster medium]], where it restricts the amount of fluid that can be present in the core of a [[cluster of galaxies]].

We can also use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium to estimate the [[velocity dispersion]] of [[dark matter]] in clusters of galaxies. Only [[baryon]]ic matter (or, rather, the collisions thereof) emits [[X-ray]] radiation. The absolute X-ray [[luminosity]] per unit volume takes the form &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X=\Lambda(T_B)\rho_B^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T_B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; are the temperature and density of the baryonic matter, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda(T)&lt;/math&gt; is some function of temperature and fundamental constants. The baryonic density satisfies the above equation &lt;math&gt;dP=-\rho gdr&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;p_B(r+dr)-p_B(r)=-dr\frac{\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\int_0^r 4\pi r^2\,\rho_M(r)\, dr.&lt;/math&gt;
The integral is a measure of the total mass of the cluster, with &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; being the proper distance to the center of the cluster. Using the [[ideal gas law]] &lt;math&gt;p_B=kT_B\rho_B/m_B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and &lt;math&gt;m_B&lt;/math&gt; is a characteristic mass of the baryonic gas particles) and rearranging, we arrive at
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_B(r)\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\right)=-\frac{\rho_B(r)G}{r^2}\int_0^r 4\pi r^2\,\rho_M(r)\, dr.&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;r^2/\rho_B(r)&lt;/math&gt; and differentiating with respect to &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left[\frac{r^2}{\rho_B(r)}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_B(r)\rho_B(r)}{m_B}\right)\right]=-4\pi Gr^2\rho_M(r).&lt;/math&gt;
If we make the assumption that cold dark matter particles have an isotropic velocity distribution, then the same derivation applies to these particles, and their density &lt;math&gt;\rho_D=\rho_M-\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the non-linear differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dr}\left[\frac{r^2}{\rho_D(r)}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{kT_D(r)\rho_D(r)}{m_D}\right)\right]=-4\pi Gr^2\rho_M(r).&lt;/math&gt;
With perfect X-ray and distance data, we could calculate the baryon density at each point in the cluster and thus the dark matter density. We could then calculate the velocity dispersion &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_D&lt;/math&gt; of the dark matter, which is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_D=\frac{kT_D}{m_D}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The central density ratio &lt;math&gt;\rho_B(0)/\rho_M(0)&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on the [[redshift]] &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; of the cluster and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_B(0)/\rho_M(0)\propto (1+z)^2\left(\frac{\theta}{s}\right)^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular width of the cluster and &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; the proper distance to the cluster. Values for the ratio range from .11 to .14 for various surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Cosmology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-852682-7|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary geology===
The concept of hydrostatic equilibrium has also become important in determining whether an astronomical object is a [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], or [[small Solar System body]]. According to the [[definition of planet]] adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 2006, one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium. Such a body will normally have the differentiated interior and geology of a world (a [[planemo]]), though near-hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet [[4 Vesta]] may also be differentiated. Sometimes the equilibrium shape is an [[oblate spheroid]], as is the case with Earth. However, in the cases of moons in synchronous orbit, nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a [[scalene ellipsoid]]. Also, the dwarf planet {{dp|Haumea}} is scalene due to its rapid rotation.

It had been thought that icy objects with a diameter larger than roughly 400&amp;nbsp;km are usually in hydrostatic equilibrium, whereas those smaller than that are not. Icy objects need less mass for hydrostatic equilibrium than rocky objects. The smallest object that is known to have an equilibrium shape is the icy moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] at 397&amp;nbsp;km, whereas the largest object known to have an obviously non-equilibrium shape is the rocky asteroid [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] at 532&amp;nbsp;km (582&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;556&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;500&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;km). However, Mimas is not actually in hydrostatic equilibrium for its current rotation. The smallest body confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], at 945 km, whereas the largest body known to not be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the icy moon [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], at 1,470&amp;nbsp;km.

Because the [[terrestrial planet]]s and dwarf planets (and likewise the larger [[natural satellite|satellites]], like the [[Moon]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]]) have irregular surfaces, this definition evidently has some flexibility, but a specific means of quantifying an object's shape by this standard has not yet been announced. Local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium. For example, the massive base of the tallest&lt;!--as opposed to highest--&gt; mountain on Earth, [[Mauna Kea]], has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust, so that the overall distribution of mass approaches equilibrium. The amount of leeway afforded the definition could affect the classification of the asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], which may have solidified while in hydrostatic equilibrium but was subsequently significantly deformed by large impacts (now 572.6&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;557.2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;446.4&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="Hubble"&gt;{{cite web

===Atmospherics===
In the atmosphere, the pressure of the air decreases with increasing altitude. This pressure difference causes an upward force called the [[pressure-gradient force]]. The force of gravity balances this out, keeping the atmosphere bound to Earth and maintaining pressure differences with altitude.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76239">{{short description|Response of fish to environmental hypoxia}}
Fish are exposed to large oxygen fluctuations in their aquatic environment since the inherent properties of water can result in marked spatial and temporal differences in the concentration of oxygen (see [[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]] and [[underwater]]). Fish respond to [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] with varied behavioral, physiological, and cellular responses in order to maintain [[homeostasis]] and organism function in an oxygen-depleted environment. The biggest challenge fish face when exposed to low oxygen conditions is maintaining metabolic energy balance, as 95% of the oxygen consumed by fish is used for [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] production through the [[electron transport chain]].&lt;ref name= "Richards"&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1016/S1546-5098(08)00010-1|chapter = Chapter 10 Metabolic and Molecular Responses of Fish to Hypoxia|title = Hypoxia| volume=27| pages=443–485|series = Fish Physiology|year = 2009|last1 = Richards|first1 = Jeffrey G.| isbn=9780123746320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, hypoxia survival requires a coordinated response to secure more oxygen from the depleted environment and counteract the metabolic consequences of decreased ATP production at the mitochondria. This article is a review of the effects of hypoxia on all aspects of fish, ranging from behavior down to genes.

==Hypoxia tolerance==
A fish’s hypoxia tolerance can be represented in different ways. A commonly used representation is the critical O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tension (P&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the lowest water O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tension (P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) at which a fish can maintain a stable O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption rate (M&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Claireaux|first1=G.|last2=Chabot|first2=D.|title=Responses by fishes to environmental hypoxia: integration through Fry's concept of aerobic metabolic scope|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=2016|volume=88|issue=1|pages=232–251|doi=10.1111/jfb.12833|pmid=26768976}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fish with a lower P&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore thought to be more hypoxia-tolerant than a fish with a higher P&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt;. But while P&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt; is often used to represent hypoxia tolerance, it more accurately represents the ability to take up environmental O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  at hypoxic P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;s and does not incorporate the significant contributions of [[anaerobic glycolysis]] and metabolic suppression to hypoxia tolerance (see below). P&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt; is nevertheless closely tied to a fish’s hypoxia tolerance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mandic|first1=M.|last2=Speers-Roesch|first2=B.|last3=Richards|first3=J.G.|title=Hypoxia tolerance in sculpins is associated with high anaerobic enzyme activity in brain but not in liver or muscle|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology|date=2012|volume=86|issue=1|pages=92–105|doi=10.1086/667938|pmid=23303324}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part because some fish prioritize their use of aerobic metabolism over anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Regan|first1=M.D.|last2=Gill|first2=I.S.|last3=Richards|first3=J.G.|title=Calorespirometry reveals that goldfish prioritize aerobic metabolism over metabolic rate depression in all but near-anoxic environments|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|date=2017|volume=220|issue=4|pages=564–572|doi=10.1242/jeb.145169|pmid=27913601|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/220/4/564.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore remains a widely used hypoxia tolerance metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=N.J.|last2=Urbina|first2=M.A.|last3=Reardon|first3=E.E.|last4=McKenzie|first4=D.J.|last5=Wilson|first5=R.J.|title=A new analysis of hypoxia tolerance in fishes using a database of critical oxygen level (P crit)|journal=Conservation Physiology|date=2016|volume=1|issue=4|doi=10.1093/conphys/cow012|pmid=27293760|pmc=4849809|url=https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/4/1/cow012/2951333/A-new-analysis-of-hypoxia-tolerance-in-fishes|page=cow012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fish’s hypoxia tolerance can also be represented as the amount of time it can spend at a particular hypoxic P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; before it loses dorsal-ventral equilibrium (called time-to-LOE), or the P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; at which it loses equilibrium when P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is decreased from normoxia to anoxia at some set rate (called P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;-of-LOE). A higher time-to-LOE value or a lower P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;-of-LOE value therefore imply enhanced hypoxia tolerances. In either case, LOE is a more holistic representation of overall hypoxia tolerance because it incorporates all contributors to hypoxia tolerance, including aerobic metabolism, anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression.
[[File:Pcrit.png|thumb|Oxygen consumption rate decreases with decreasing environmental oxygen tension (P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) when P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt; P&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt;. On the other hand, oxygen consumption rate is unaffected by the changes in oxygen tension when P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; P&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt;]]

==Oxygen sensing==

===Oxygen sensing structures===
In mammals there are several structures that have been implicated as oxygen sensing structures; however, all of these structures are situated to detect aortic or internal hypoxia since mammals rarely run into environmental hypoxia.  These structures include the type I cells of the [[carotid body]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gonzalez | first1=C | last2=Almaraz | first2=L | last3=Obeso | first3=A | last4=Rigual | first4=R | year=1994 | title=Carotid body chemoreceptors: from natural stimuli to sensory discharges | journal=Physiol Rev | volume=74 | pages=829–898 | pmid=7938227 | issue=4| doi=10.1152/physrev.1994.74.4.829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the neuroepithelial bodies of the lungs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fu | first1=XW | last2=Nurse | first2=CA | last3=Wong | first3=V | last4=Cutz | first4=E | year=2002 | title=Hypoxia-induced secretion of serotonin from intact pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies in neonatal rabbit | journal=J Physiol | volume=539 | pages=503–510 | pmid=11882682 | issue=Pt 2 | pmc=2290169 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2001.013071}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] [[neuron]]s and [[vascular smooth muscle]] cells.
In fish, the neuroepithelial cells (NEC) have been implicated as the major oxygen sensing cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jonz | first1=MG | last2=Fearon  | first2=IM | last3=Nurse | first3=CA | year=2004 | title=Neuroepithelial oxygen chemoreceptors of the zebrafish gill | journal=J Physiol | volume=560 | pages=737–752 | pmid=15331683 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2004.069294 | issue=Pt 3 | pmc=1665292}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NEC have been found in all teleost fish studied to date, and are likely a highly conserved structure within many [[Taxon|taxa]] of fish.  NEC are also found in all four gill arches within several different structures, such as along the filaments, at the ends of the [[Fish anatomy|gill rakers]] and throughout the lamellae.  Two separate neural pathways have been identified within the [[zebrafish]] gill arches both the [[Axon|motor and sensory nerve fibre]] pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jonz | first1=MG | last2=Nurse | first2=CA | year=2003 | title=Neuroepithelial cells and associated innervation of the zebrafish gill: A confocal immunofluorescence study | journal=J Comp Neurol | volume=461 | pages=1–17 | pmid=12722101 | doi=10.1002/cne.10680 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since neuroepithelial cells are distributed throughout the gills, they are often ideally situated to detect both [[Artery|arterial]] as well as environmental oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Coolidge | first1=EH | last2=Ciuhandu | first2=CC | last3=Milsom | first3=WK | year=2008 | title=A comparative analysis of putative oxygen sensing cells in the fish gill | journal=J Exp Biol | volume=211 | pages=1231–1242 | pmid=18375847 | doi=10.1242/jeb.015248 | issue=Pt 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanisms of neurotransmitter release in neuroepithelial cells===
Neuroepithelial cells (NEC) are thought to be [[neuron]]-like [[chemoreceptor]] cells because they rely on [[membrane potential]] changes for the release of [[neurotransmitters]] and signal transmission onto nearby cells.  Once NEC of the [[zebrafish]] [[gills]] come in contact with either environmental or [[aortic]] [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], an outward K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  "leak" channel is inhibited.  It remains unclear how these K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels are inhibited by a shortage of oxygen because there are yet to be any known direct binding sites for "a lack of oxygen", only whole cell and ion channel responses to hypoxia.  K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  "leak" channels are two-pore-domain [[ion channels]] that are open at the resting [[membrane potential]] of the cell and play a major role in setting the equilibrium resting membrane potential of the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lesage | first1=F | last2=Lazdunski | first2=M | year=2000 | title=Molecular and functional properties of two-pore-domain potassium channels | journal=Am J Physiol | volume=279 | pages=F793–F801 | pmid=11053038 | issue=5| doi=10.1152/ajprenal.2000.279.5.F793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once this "leak" channel is closed, the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is no longer able to freely flow out of the cell, and the membrane potential of the NEC increases; the cell becomes depolarized.  This [[depolarization]] causes voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels to open, and for [[extracellular]] Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to flow down its concentration gradient into the cell causing the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration to greatly increase.  Once the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is inside the cell, it binds to the [[Synaptic vesicle|vesicle]] release machinery and facilitates binding of the [[SNARE|t-snare]] complex on the vesicle to the [[SNARE|s-snare]] complex on the NEC cell membrane which initiates the release of [[neurotransmitters]] into the [[Chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]].

===Signal transduction up to higher brain centres===
If the post-synaptic cell is a sensory neuron, then an increased firing rate in that neuron will transmit the signal to the central nervous system for integration.  Whereas, if the post-synaptic cell is a connective pillar cell or a [[vascular smooth muscle]] cell, then the [[serotonin]] will cause [[vasoconstriction]] and previously unused lamellae will be recruited through recruitment of more [[capillary]] beds, and the total surface area for gas exchange per lamella will be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Farrell | first1=AP | last2=Daxboeck | first2=C | last3=Randall | first3=DJ | year=1979 | title=The effect of input pressure and flow on the pattern and resistance to flow in the isolated perfused gill of a teleost fish | journal=J Comp Physiol | volume=133 | pages=233–240 | doi=10.1007/BF00691471 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fish, the hypoxic signal is carried up to the brain for processing by the [[Glossopharyngeal nerve|glossopharyngeal]] (cranial nerve IX) and [[Vagus nerve|vagus]] (cranial nerve X) nerves. The first [[Pharyngeal arch|branchial arch]] is [[innervated]] by the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX); however all four arches are innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X).  Both the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves carry sensory nerve fibres into the brain and central nervous system.

===Locations of oxygen sensors===
Through studies using mammalian model organisms, there are two main [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] for the location of oxygen sensing in chemoreceptor cells: the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] hypothesis and the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] hypothesis.  The membrane hypothesis was proposed for the [[carotid body]] in mice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lopez-Barneo | first1=J | last2=Lopez-Lopez | first2=JR | last3=Urena | first3=J | last4=Gonzalez | first4=C | year=1988 | title=Chemotransduction in the carotid body: K+ current modulated by PO2 in type I chemoreceptor cells | journal=Science | volume=241 | pages=580–582 | pmid=2456613 | doi=10.1126/science.2456613 | issue=4865}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it predicts that oxygen sensing is an ion balance initiated process.  The mitochondrial hypothesis was also proposed for the carotid body of mice, but it relies on the levels of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] and/or [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) production as a cue for hypoxia.  Specifically, the oxygen sensitive K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  currents are inhibited by [[Hydrogen peroxide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[NADPH oxidase]] activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fu | first1=XW | last2=Wang | first2=D | last3=Nurse | first3=CA | last4=Dinauer | first4=MC | last5=Cutz | first5=E | year=2000 | title=NADPH oxidase is an O2 sensor in airway chemoreceptors: Evidence from K+ current modulation in wild-type and oxidase-deficient mice | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume=97 | pages=4374–4379 | pmid=10760304 | issue=8 | pmc=18249 | doi=10.1073/pnas.97.8.4374}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence for both of these hypotheses depending on the species used for the study.  For the neuroepithelial cells in the zebrafish gills, there is strong evidence supporting the "membrane hypothesis" due to their capacity to respond to hypoxia after removal of the contents of the cell.  However, there is no evidence against multiple sites for oxygen sensing in organisms.

==Acute responses to hypoxia==
Many hypoxic environments never reach the level of [[Anoxic waters|anoxia]] and most fish are able to cope with this stress using different [[Physiology|physiological]] and behavioural strategies.  Fish that use air breathing organs (ABO) tend to live in environments with highly variable oxygen content and rely on aerial respiration during times when there is not enough oxygen to support water-breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | pmid =21056112 | doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2010.10.029 | title=Hypoxia tolerance and partitioning of bimodal respiration in the striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) | journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | date=2011 | volume=158 | issue=2 | pages=207–214 | first=Sjannie | last=Lefevre}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though all [[teleosts]] have some form of [[swim bladder]], many of them are not capable of breathing air, and they rely on aquatic surface respiration as a supply of more oxygenated water at the surface of the water.  However, many species of teleost fish are obligate water breathers and do not display either of these surface respiratory behaviours.

Typically, acute hypoxia causes [[hyperventilation]], [[bradycardia]] and an elevation in gill [[vascular resistance]] in teleosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holeton | first1 = GF | last2 = Randall | first2 = DJ | year = 1967 | title = Changes in blood pressure in the rainbow trout during hypoxia | url = | journal = J Exp Biol | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 297–305 | pmid = 6033996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the benefit of these changes in [[blood pressure]] to oxygen uptake has not been supported in a recent study of the [[rainbow trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | pmid =16574450 | doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2006.02.026 | title=Does bradycardia or hypertension enhance gas transfer in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)? | journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | date=2006 | volume=144 | issue=2 | pages=163–172 | first=S.F. | last=Perry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that the [[Acute toxicity|acute]] hypoxia response is simply a stress response, and the advantages found in early studies may only result after [[acclimatization]] to the environment.

==Behavioral responses==
Hypoxia can modify normal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Reebs, S.G. (2009) [http://www.howfishbehave.ca/pdf/oxygen.pdf Oxygen and fish behaviour]&lt;/ref&gt; Parental behaviour meant to provide oxygen to the eggs is often affected by hypoxia. For example, fanning behavior (swimming on the spot near the eggs to create a flow of water over them, and thus a constant supply of oxygen) is often increased when oxygen is less available. This has been documented in sticklebacks,&lt;ref&gt;Iersel, J.J.A. van. 1953. An analysis of the parental behaviour of the male three-spine stickleback (''Gasterosteus aculeatus'' L.). Behaviour Supplement 3: 1-159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sevenster, P. 1961. A causal analysis of a displacement activity (fanning in ''Gasterosteus aculeatus'' L.). Behaviour Supplement 9: 1-170.&lt;/ref&gt; gobies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Torricelli | first1 = P. | last2 = Lugli | first2 = M. | last3 = Gandolfi | first3 = G. | year = 1985 | title = A quantitative analysis of the fanning activity in the male ''Padogobius martensi'' (Pisces: Gobiidae) | jstor = 4534416 | journal = Behaviour | volume = 92 | issue = 3/4| pages = 288–301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Takegaki | first1 = T. | last2 = Nakazono | first2 = A. | year = 1999 | title = Responses of the egg-tending gobiid fish ''Valenciennea longipinnis'' to the fluctuation of dissolved oxygen in the burrow | url = | journal = Bulletin of Marine Science | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 815–823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and clownfishes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Green | first1 = B.S. | last2 = McCormick | first2 = M.I. | year = 2005 | title = O2 replenishment to fish nests: males adjust brood care to ambient conditions and brood development | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 389–397 | doi=10.1093/beheco/ari007}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Behavioural adaptations meant to survive when oxygen is scarce include reduced activity levels, aquatic surface respiration, and air breathing.

===Reduced activity levels===

As oxygen levels decrease, fish may at first increase movements in an attempt to escape the hypoxic zone, but eventually they greatly reduce their activity levels, thus reducing their energetic (and therefore oxygen) demands. [[Atlantic herring]] show this exact pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Domenici | first1 = P. | last2 = Steffensen | first2 = J.F. | last3 = Batty | first3 = R.S. | year = 2000 | title = The effect of progressive hypoxia on swimming activity and schooling in Atlantic herring | url = | journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 57 | issue = 6| pages = 1526–1538 | doi=10.1006/jfbi.2000.1413| citeseerx = 10.1.1.1.2926 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of fishes that reduce their activity levels under hypoxia include the [[common sole]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dalla Via | first1 = D. | last2 = Van | last3 = den Thillart | first3 = G. | last4 = Cattani | first4 = O. | last5 = Cortesi | first5 = P. | year = 1998 | title = Behavioural responses and biochemical correlates in ''Solea solea'' to gradual hypoxic exposure | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 76 | issue = 11| pages = 2108–2113 | doi=10.1139/z98-141}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[guppy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kramer | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Mehegan | first2 = J.P. | year = 1981 | title = Aquatic surface respiration, an adaptive response to hypoxia in the guppy, ''Poecilia reticulata'' (Pisces, Poeciliidae) | url = | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 6 | issue = 3–4| pages = 299–313 | doi=10.1007/bf00005759}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[small-spotted catshark]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Metcalfe | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Butler | first2 = P.J. | year = 1984 | title = Changes in activity and ventilation in response to hypoxia in unrestrained, unoperated dogfish (''Scyliorhinus canicula'' L.) | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 180 | issue = | pages = 153–162 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[viviparous eelpout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = P. | last2 = Rademacher | first2 = K. | last3 = Kils | first3 = U. | year = 1992 | title = ''In situ'' investigations on the respiration and behaviour of the eelpout ''Zoarces viviparus'' under short-terms hypoxia | doi = 10.3354/meps088181 | journal = Marine Ecology Progress Series | volume = 88 | issue = | pages = 181–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sharks that ram-ventilate their gills may understandably increase their swimming speeds under hypoxia, to bring more water to the gills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carlson | first1 = J.K. | last2 = Parsons | first2 = G.R. | year = 2001 | title = The effects of hypoxia on three sympatric shark species: physiological and behavioral responses | doi = 10.1023/a:1011641302048 | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 427–433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquatic surface respiration===
In response to decreasing [[oxygenation (environmental)|dissolved oxygen]] level in the environment, fish swim up to the surface of the water column and ventilate at the top layer of the water where it contains relatively higher level of dissolved oxygen, a behavior called aquatic surface respiration (ASR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kramer | first1 = D.L. | year = 1987 | title = Dissolved oxygen and fish behavior | url = | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 81–92 | doi=10.1007/bf00002597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen diffuses into water from air and therefore the top layer of water in contact with air contains more oxygen. This is true only in stagnant water; in running water all layers are mixed together and oxygen levels are the same throughout the water column. One environment where ASR often takes place is tidepools, particularly at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Congleton | first1 = J.L. | year = 1980 | title = Observations of the responses of some southern California tidepool fishes to nocturnal hypoxic stress | url = | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | volume = 66 | issue = 4| pages = 719–722 | doi=10.1016/0300-9629(80)90026-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separation from the sea at low tide means that water is not renewed, fish crowding within the pool means that oxygen is quickly depleted, and absence of light at night means that there is no photosynthesis to replenish the oxygen. Examples of tidepool species that perform ASR include the tidepool [[sculpin]], ''Oligocottus maculosus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sloman | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Mandic | first2 = M.M. | last3 = Todgham | first3 = A.E. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = The response of the tidepool sculpin, ''Oligocottus maculosus'', to hypoxia in laboratory, mecocosm and field environments | url = | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | volume = 149 | issue = 3| pages = 284–292 | doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.01.004| pmid = 18276177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mandic | first1 = M | last2 = Sloman | first2 = KA Richards JG | year = 2009 | title = Escaping to the surface: a phylogenetically independent analysis of hypoxia-induced respiratory behaviors in sculpins | url = | journal = Physiol Biochem Zool | volume = 82 | issue = 6| pages = 703–738 | pmid = 19799503 | doi=10.1086/605932}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[three-spined stickleback]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reebs | first1 = S.G. | last2 = Whoriskey | first2 = F.G. | last3 = FitzGerald | first3 = G.J. | year = 1984 | title = Diel patterns of fanning activity, egg respiration, and the nocturnal behavior of male three spined sticklebacks, ''Gasterosteus aculeatus'' L.

But ASR is not limited to the intertidal environment. Most tropical and temperate fish species living in stagnant waters engage in ASR during hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |  doi= 10.1007/BF00011822 | title=Aquatic surface respiration, a widespread adaptation to hypoxia in tropical freshwater fishes | journal=Environmental Biology of Fishes | date=1982 | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=47–55 | first=Donald L. | last=Kramer}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study looked at 26 species representing eight families of non-air breathing fishes from the North American great plains, and found that all but four of them performed ASR during hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gee | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Tallman | first2 = R.F. | last3 = Smart | first3 = H.J. | year = 1978 | title = Reactions of some great plains fishes to progressive hypoxia | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume = 56 | issue = 9| pages = 1962–1966 | doi=10.1139/z78-263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looked at 24 species of tropical fish common to the pet trade, from tetras to barbs to cichlids, and found that all of them performed ASR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kramer | first1 = D.L. | last2 = McClure | first2 = M. | year = 1982 | title = Aquatic surface respiration, a widespread adaptation to hypoxia in tropical freshwater fishes | url = | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 47–55 | doi=10.1007/bf00011822}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual situation in which ASR is performed is during winter, in lakes covered by ice, at the interface between water and ice or near air bubbles trapped underneath the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klinger | first1 = S.A. | last2 = Magnuson | first2 = J.J. | last3 = Gallepp | first3 = G.W. | year = 1982 | title = Survival mechanisms of the central mudminnow (''Umbra limi''), fathead minnow (''Pimephales promelas'') and brook stickleback (''Culaea inconstans'') for low oxygen in winter | url = | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 113–120 | doi=10.1007/bf00001781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Magnuson | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Beckel | first2 = A.L. | last3 = Mills | first3 = K. | last4 = Brandt | first4 = S.B. | year = 1985 | title = Surviving winter hypoxia: behavioral adaptations of fishes in a northern Wisconsin winterkill lake | url = | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 241–250 | doi=10.1007/bf00002627}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrosky | first1 = B.R. | last2 = Magnuson | first2 = J.J. | year = 1973 | title = Behavioral responses of Northern pike, yellow perch and bluegill to oxygen concentrations under simulated winterkill conditions | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1973 | issue = 1| pages = 124–133 | doi=10.2307/1442367| jstor = 1442367 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species may show morphological adaptations, such as a flat head and an upturned mouth, that allow them to perform ASR without breaking the water surface (which would make them more visible to aerial predators).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = W.M. Jr | year = 1970 | title = Morphological adaptations of cyprinodontoids for inhabiting oxygen deficient waters | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1970 | issue = 2| pages = 319–326 | doi=10.2307/1441653| jstor = 1441653 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[mummichog]], whose upturned mouth suggests surface feeding, but whose feeding habits are not particularly restricted to the surface. In the [[tambaqui]], a South American species, exposure to hypoxia induces within hours the development of additional blood vessels inside the lower lip, enhancing its ability to take up oxygen during ASR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sundin | first1 = L. | last2 = Reid | first2 = S.G. | last3 = Rantin | first3 = F.T. | last4 = Milson | first4 = W.K. | year = 2000 | title = Branchial receptors and cardiorespiratory reflexes in a neotropical fish, the tambaqui (''Colossoma macropomum'') | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 203 | issue = | pages = 1225–1239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swimming upside down may also help fishes perform ASR, as in some [[upside-down catfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = L.J. | last2 = Kaufman | first2 = L. | last3 = Chapman | first3 = C.A. | year = 1994 | title = Why swim upside down? A comparative study of two mochokid catfishes | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1994 | issue = 1| pages = 130–135 | doi=10.2307/1446679| jstor = 1446679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species may hold an air bubble within the mouth during ASR. This may assist buoyancy as well as increase the oxygen content of the water passing over the bubble on its way to the gills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gee | first1 = J.H. | last2 = Gee | first2 = P.A. | year = 1991 | title = Reaction of gobioid fishes to hypoxia: buoyancy control and aquatic surface respiration | url = | journal = Copeia | volume = 1991 | issue = 1| pages = 17–28 | doi=10.2307/1446244| jstor = 1446244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way to reduce buoyancy costs is to perform ASR on rocks or plants that provide support near the water surface.

ASR significantly affects survival of fish during severe hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | pmid= 21316378 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.02.009 | title=Leap of faith: Voluntary emersion behaviour and physiological adaptations to aerial exposure in a non-aestivating freshwater fish in response to aquatic hypoxia | journal=Physiology | date=2011 | volume=103 | issue=2 | pages=240–247 | first=Mauricio A. | last=Urbina}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Poecilia|shortfin molly]] for example,  survival was approximately four times higher in individuals able to perform ASR as compared to fish not allowed to perform ASR during their exposure to extreme hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;Plath M, Tobler M, Riesch R, García de León FJ, Giere O, Schlupp I. 2007. Survival in an extreme habitat: the roles of behaviour and energy limitation. ''Die Naturwissenschaften'' 94: 991-6. PMID&lt;/ref&gt;

ASR may be performed more often when the need for oxygen is higher. In the [[sailfin molly]], gestating females (this species is a livebearer) spend about 50% of their time in ASR as compared to only 15% in non-gestating females under the same low levels of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Timmerman | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Chapman | first2 = L.J. | year = 2003 | title = The effect of gestational state on oxygen consumption and response to hypoxia in the sailfin molly, ''Poecilia latipinna'' | doi =10.1023/a:1027300701599 | journal = Environmental Biology of Fishes | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 293–299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerial respiration (air breathing)===
Aerial respiration is the ‘gulping’ of air at the surface of water to directly extract oxygen from the atmosphere. Aerial respiration evolved in fish that were exposed to more frequent hypoxia; also, species that engage in aerial respiration tend to be more hypoxia tolerant than those which do not air-breath during the hypoxia.&lt;ref name = "Richards 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Richards | first=JG | year=2011 | title=Physiological, behavioral and biochemical adaptations of intertidal fishes to hypoxia | journal=J Exp Biol | volume=214 | pages=191–199 | pmid=21177940 | doi=10.1242/jeb.047951 | issue=Pt 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of air breathing fish—facultative and non-facultative. Under normoxic conditions facultative fish can survive without having to breathe air from the surface of the water. However, non-facultative fish must respire at the surface even in normal dissolved oxygen levels because their [[gill]]s cannot extract enough oxygen from the water.

Many air breathing freshwater teleosts use ABOs to effectively extract oxygen from air while maintaining functions of the gills. ABOs are modified [[gastrointestinal tracts]], [[gas bladder]]s, and [[labyrinth organ]]s;&lt;ref name ="Sloman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sloman | first1 = KA | last2 = Sloman | first2 = RD | last3 = De Boeck | first3 = G | last4 = Scott | first4 = GR | last5 = Iftikar | first5 = FI | last6 = Wood | first6 = CM | last7 = Almeida-Val | first7 = VMF | year = 2009 | title = The role of size in synchronous air breathing of Hoplosternum littorale | url = | journal = Physiol Biochem Zool | volume = 82 | issue = 6| pages = 625–34 | doi = 10.1086/605936 | pmid = 19799504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are highly vascularized and provide additional method of extracting oxygen from the air.&lt;ref name="Richards2"&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1016/S1546-5098(08)00002-2|chapter = Chapter 2 Behavioral Responses and Ecological Consequences|title = Hypoxia| volume=27| pages=25–77|series = Fish Physiology|year = 2009|last1 = Chapman|first1 = Lauren J.| last2=McKenzie| first2=David J.| isbn=9780123746320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish also use ABO for storing the retained oxygen.

====Predation risk associated with ASR and aerial respiration====
Both ASR and aerial respiration require fish to travel to the top of water column and this behaviour increases the predation risks by aerial predators or other [[piscivores]] inhabiting near the surface of the water.&lt;ref name ="Richards2"/&gt; In order to cope with the increased predation risk upon surfacing, some fish perform ASR or aerial respiration in schools&lt;ref name ="Sloman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Domenici | first1 = P | last2 = Lefrançois | first2 = C | last3 = Shingles | first3 = A | year = 2007 | title = Hypoxia and the antipredator behaviours of fishes | url = | journal = Philos Trans R Soc Lond B | volume = 362 | issue = 1487| pages = 2105–2121 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2007.2103 | pmid = 17472921 | pmc=2442856}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to ‘dilute’ the predation risk. When fish can visually detect the presence of their aerial predators, they simply refrain from surfacing, or prefer to surface in areas where they can be detected less easily (i.e. turbid, shaded areas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shingles | first1 = A. | last2 = McKenzie | first2 = D.J. | last3 = Claireaux | first3 = G. | last4 = Domenici | first4 = P. | year = 2005 | title = Reflex cardioventilatory responses to hypoxia in the flathead grey mulet (''Mugil cephalus'') and their behavioural modulation by perceived threat of predation and water turbidity | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/reflex-cardioventilatory-responses-to-hypoxia-in-the-flathead-grey-mullet--mugil-cephalus--and-their-behavioural-modulation-by-perceived-threat-of-predation-and-water-turbidity(84d79d52-42af-45f7-bff7-360e5b460626).html| journal = Physiological and Biochemical Zoology | volume = 78 | issue = 5| pages = 744–755 | doi=10.1086/432143| pmid = 16052452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gill remodelling in hypoxia==
Gill remodelling happens in only a few species of fish, and it involves the buildup or removal of an inter-lamellar cell mass (ILCM).  As a response to hypoxia, some fish are able to remodel their gills to increase [[Respiratory system|respiratory]] surface area, with some species such as goldfish doubling their lamellar surface areas in as little as 8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Regan|first1=M.D.|last2=Richards|first2=J.G.|title=Rates of hypoxia induction alter mechanisms of O2 uptake and the critical O2 tension of goldfish|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|date=2017|volume=220|issue=14|doi=10.1242/jeb.154948|pmid=28476894|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/220/14/2536|pages=2536–2544}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased respiratory surface area comes as a trade-off with increased metabolic costs because the [[gills]] are a very important site for many important processes including respiratory [[gas exchange]], [[Acid base homeostasis|acid-base regulation]], [[Excretion|nitrogen excretion]], [[osmoregulation]], [[hormone|hormone regulation]], [[metabolism]], and environmental sensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15618479 | doi=10.1152/physrev.00050.2003 | volume=85 | issue=1 | title=The multifunctional fish gill: dominant site of gas exchange, osmoregulation, acid-base regulation, and excretion of nitrogenous waste | date=January 2005 | pages=97–177 | journal=Physiological Reviews | last1 = Evans | first1 = DH | last2 = Piermarini | first2 = PM | last3 = Choe | first3 = KP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[crucian carp]] is one species able to remodel its gill filaments in response to hypoxia. Their inter-lamellar cells have high rates of [[Mitosis|mitotic]] activity which are influenced by both hypoxia and temperature.&lt;ref name ="Sollid"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12966058 | volume=206 | issue=Pt 20 | title=Hypoxia induces adaptive and reversible gross morphological changes in crucian carp gills | date=October 2003 | pages=3667–73 | journal=J Exp Biol | doi=10.1242/jeb.00594 | last1 = Sollid | first1 = J | last2 = De Angelis | first2 = P | last3 = Gundersen | first3 = K | last4 = Nilsson | first4 = GE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In cold (15&amp;nbsp;°C) water the crucian carp has more ILCM, but when the temperature is increased to 25&amp;nbsp;°C the ILCM is removed, just as it would be in hypoxic conditions.  This same transition in [[gill]] [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] occurs in the [[goldfish]] when the temperature was raised from 7.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 15&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15767311 | doi=10.1242/jeb.01505 | volume=208 | issue=Pt 6 | title=Temperature alters the respiratory surface area of crucian carp Carassius carassius and goldfish Carassius auratus | date=March 2005 | pages=1109–16 | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | last1 = Sollid | first1 = J | last2 = Weber | first2 = RE | last3 = Nilsson | first3 = GE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This difference may be due to the temperature regimes that these fish are typically found in, or there could be an underlying protective mechanism to prevent a loss of ion balance in stressful temperatures.  Temperature also affects the speed at which the gills can be remodelled: for example, at 20&amp;nbsp;°C in hypoxia, the crucian carp can completely remove its ILCM in 6 hours, whereas at 8&amp;nbsp;°C, the same process takes 3–7 days.&lt;ref name ="Sollid"/&gt;  The ILCM is likely removed by [[apoptosis]], but it is possible that when the fish is faced with the double stress of hypoxia at high temperature, the lamellae may be lost by physical degradation. Covering the gill lamellae may protect species like the crucian carp from [[Parasitism|parasites]] and environmental toxins during normoxia by limiting their surface area for inward [[diffusion]] while still maintaining oxygen transport due to an extremely high [[hemoglobin]] oxygen binding [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]].&lt;ref name ="Sollid" /&gt;

The [[naked carp]], a closely related species native to the high-altitude [[Lake Qinghai]], is also able to remodel their gills in response to hypoxic conditions. In response to oxygen levels 95% lower than normoxic conditions, apoptosis of ILCM increases lamellar surface area by up to 60% after just 24 hours.&lt;ref name="matey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matey|first=V.|author2=Richards, J.

==Oxygen uptake==
Fish exhibit a wide range of tactics to counteract aquatic hypoxia, but when escape from the hypoxic stress is not possible, maintaining oxygen extraction and delivery becomes an essential component to survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | pmid =12161331 | doi=10.1016/S1569-9048(02)00113-1 | title=Physiological responses to prolonged aquatic hypoxia in the Queensland lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri | journal=Respiratory Physiology | date=2002 | volume=132 | issue=2 | pages=179–190 | first=Peter K | last=Kind}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the [[Notothenioidei|Antarctic ice fish]] that does not, most fish use [[hemoglobin]] (Hb) within their red blood cells to bind chemically and deliver 95% of the oxygen extracted from the environment to the working tissues. Maintaining oxygen extraction and delivery to the tissues allows continued activity under hypoxic stress and is in part determined by modifications in two different blood parameters: [[hematocrit]] and the binding properties of hemoglobin.

===Hematocrit===

In general, hematocrit is the number of red blood cells (RBC) in circulation and is highly variable among fish species.

While increasing hematocrit means that the blood can carry a larger total amount of oxygen, a possible advantage during hypoxia, increasing the number of RBCs in the blood can also lead to certain disadvantages. First, A higher hematocrit results in more [[viscosity|viscous]] blood (especially in cold water) increasing the amount of energy the cardiac system requires to pump the blood through the system and secondly depending on the transit time of the blood across the [[branchial arch]] and the diffusion rate of oxygen, an increased hematocrit may result in less efficient transfer of oxygen from the environment to the blood.&lt;ref name ="Perry"/&gt;

===Changing the binding affinity of hemoglobin===

An alternative mechanism to preserve O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivery in the face of low ambient oxygen is to increase the affinity of the blood. The oxygen content of the blood is related to [[Blood gas tension|PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and is illustrated using an oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC). Fish hemoglobins, with the exception of the [[agnatha]]ns, are tetramers that exhibit [[cooperativity]] of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding and have sigmoidal OECs.

[[File:Oxygen Equilibrium Curve.jpg|thumb|Oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC) demonstrating the PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; required for half of the hemoglobin oxygen binding sites to be saturated with oxygen (P50)]]

The binding affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen is estimated using a measurement called P50 (the partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% bound with oxygen) and can be extremely variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1093/icb/20.1.139 | title=Molecular Ecology of Teleost Fish Hemoglobins Strategies for Adapting to Changing Environments | journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology | date=1980 | volume=20 | issue=1 | pages=139–162 | first=Dennis A | last=Powers}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the hemoglobin has a weak affinity for oxygen, it is said to have a high P50 and therefore constrains the environment in which a fish can inhabit to those with relatively high environmental PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, fish hemoglobins with a low P50 bind strongly to oxygen and are then of obvious advantage when attempting to extract oxygen from hypoxic or variable PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; environments. The use of high affinity (low P50) hemoglobins results in reduced ventillatory and therefore energetic requirements when facing hypoxic insult.&lt;ref name = "Perry"/&gt; The oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin (Hb-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is regulated through a suite of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric modulators]]; the principal modulators used for controlling Hb-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity under hypoxic insult are:
#Increasing RBC pH
#Reducing inorganic phosphate interactions

====pH and inorganic phosphates (Pi)====

In [[rainbow trout]] as well as a variety of other teleosts, increased RBC pH stems from the activation of B-andrenergic [[Na+/H+ exchanger|{{chem|Na|+|/H|+}} exchange protein]] (BNHE) on the RBC membrane via circulating catelcholamines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3040965 | volume=382 | title=Control of cell volume and ion transport by beta-adrenergic catecholamines in erythrocytes of rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri | pmc=1183016 | date=January 1987 | pages=123–44 | journal=J Physiol | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1987.sp016359 | last1 = Borgese | first1 = F | last2 = Garcia-Romeu | first2 = F | last3 = Motais | first3 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process causes the internal pH of the RBC to increase through the outwards movement of {{chem|H|+}} and inwards movement of {{chem|Na|+}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | doi =10.1007/BF00689729 | title=Adrenergic regulation of haemoglobin oxygen affinity in rainbow trout red cells | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B | date=1983 | volume=152 | issue=1 | pages=67–72 | first=Mikko | last=Nikinmaa}}&lt;/ref&gt; The net consequence of [[alkalinity|alkalizing]] the RBC is an increase in Hb-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity via the [[Bohr effect]]. The net influx of {{chem|Na|+}} ions and the compensatory activation of [[Na+/K+-ATPase|{{chem|Na|+|/K|+}}-ATPase]] to maintain ionic equilibrium within the RBC results in a steady decline in cellular ATP, also serving to increase Hb-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nikinmaa, M|author2=Boutilier, RG|year=1995|contribution=Adrenergic control of red cell pH, organic phosphate concentrations and haemoglobin function in teleost fish|title=Advances in Comparative and Environmental Physiology|volume=21|editor=Heisler, N|pages=107–133|location=Berlin|publisher= Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a further result of inward {{chem|Na|+}} movement, the [[osmolarity]] of the RBC increases causing [[osmotic]] influx of water and cell swelling. The dilution of the cell contents causes further spatial separation of hemoglobin from the inorganic phosphates and again serves to increase Hb-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affinity.&lt;ref name ="Perry"/&gt;

====Changing Hb- isoforms====
Nearly all animals have more than one kind of Hb present in the RBC. Multiple Hb isoforms (see [[isoforms]]) are particularly common in [[ectotherm]]s, but especially in fish that are required to cope with both fluctutating temperature and oxygen availability. Hbs isolated from the [[European eel]] can be separated into [[anodic]] and [[cathodic]] isoforms. The anodic isoforms have low oxygen affinities (high P50) and marked Bohr effects, while the cathodic lack significant pH effects and are therefore thought to confer hypoxia tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tamburrini | first1 = M | last2 = Verde | first2 = C | last3 = Olianas | first3 = A | last4 = Giardina | first4 = B | last5 = Corda | first5 = M | last6 = Sanna | first6 = MT | last7 = Fais | first7 = A | last8 = Deiana | first8 = AM | last9 = Prisco | first9 = G | last10 = Pellegrini | first10 = M | year = 2001 | title = The hemoglobin system of the brown moray Gymnothorax unicolor: Structure/function relationships | url = | journal = Eur J Biochem | volume = 268 | issue = 14| pages = 4104–4111 | pmid = 11454005 | doi=10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02333.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several species of African cichlids raised from early stage development under either hypoxic or normoxic conditions were contrasted in an attempt to compare Hb isoforms. They demonstrated there were Hb isoforms specific to the hypoxia-raised individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17626121 | doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00536.2006 | volume=293 | issue=3 | title=Multiple strategies of Lake Victoria cichlids to cope with lifelong hypoxia include hemoglobin switching | date=September 2007 | pages=R1376–83 | journal=American Journal of Physiology.

==Metabolic challenge==
To deal with decreased ATP production through the electron transport chain, fish must activate anaerobic means of energy production (see [[anaerobic metabolism]]) while suppressing metabolic demands. The ability to decrease energy demand by metabolic suppression is essential to ensure hypoxic survival due to the limited efficiency of anaerobic ATP production.

===Switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism===
Aerobic respiration, in which oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor, is crucial to all water-breathing fish.  When fish are deprived of oxygen, they require other ways to produce ATP.  Thus, a switch from aerobic metabolism to anaerobic metabolism occurs at the onset of hypoxia.  [[Glycolysis]] and [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] are used as alternative pathways for ATP production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21818543 | doi=10.1007/s10695-011-9542-8 | volume=38 | issue=3 | title=Effects of dissolved oxygen on glycolytic enzyme specific activities in liver and skeletal muscle of Fundulus heteroclitus | date=June 2012 | pages=615–24 | journal=Fish Physiology and Biochemistry | last1 = Abbaraju | first1 = NV | last2 = Rees | first2 = BB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these pathways are much less efficient than aerobic metabolism.  For example, when using the same substrate, the total yield of ATP in anaerobic metabolism is 15 times lower than in aerobic metabolism.  This level of ATP production is not sufficient to maintain a high metabolic rate, therefore, the only survival strategy for fish is to alter their metabolic demands.

===Metabolic suppression===
Metabolic suppression is the regulated and reversible reduction of metabolic rate below [[basal metabolic rate]] (called standard metabolic rate in ectothermic animals).&lt;ref name="Richards" /&gt; This reduces the fish’s rate of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] use, which prolongs its survival time at severely hypoxic sub-P&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt; P&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;s by reducing the rate at which the fish’s finite anaerobic fuel stores ([[glycogen]]) are used. Metabolic suppression also reduces the accumulation rate of deleterious anaerobic end-products ([[lactic acid|lactate]] and protons), which delays their negative impact on the fish.

The mechanisms that fish use to suppress metabolic rate occur at behavioral, physiological and biochemical levels. Behaviorally, metabolic rate can be lowered through reduced locomotion, feeding, courtship, and mating.&lt;ref name="Nilsson et al.

The prevalence of metabolic suppression use among fish species has not been thoroughly explored. This is partly because the metabolic rates of hypoxia-exposed fish, including suppressed metabolic rates, can only be accurately measured using direct [[calorimetry]], and this technique is seldom used for fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Regan|first1=MD|last2=Gosline|first2=JM|last3=Richards|first3=JG|title=A simple and affordable calorespirometer for assessing the metabolic rates of fishes|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|date=2013|volume=216|issue=Pt 24|pages=4507–13|doi=10.1242/jeb.093500|pmid=24072793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=JA|title=Oxygen consumption rate v. rate of energy utilization of fishes: a comparison and brief history of the two measurements|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|date=2016|volume=88|issue=1|pages=10–25|doi=10.1111/jfb.12824|pmid=26768970}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few studies that have used calorimetry reveal that some fish species employ metabolic suppression in hypoxia/anoxia (e.g., goldfish, tilapia, European eel) while others do not (e.g. rainbow trout, zebrafish).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Ginneken|first1=V|last2=Addink|first2=A|last3=van den Thillart|first3=GE|title=Metabolic rate and level of activity determined in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus Peters) by direct and indirect calorimetry and videomonitoring|journal=Themochimica Acta|date=1997|volume=291|pages=1–13|doi=10.1016/S0040-6031(96)03106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Ginneken|first1=VJ|last2=Onderwater|first2=M|last3=Olivar|first3=OL|last4=van den Thillart|first4=GE|title=Metabolic depression and investigation of glucose/ethanol conversion in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla Linnaeus 1758) during anaerobiosis|journal=Thermochimica Acta|date=2001|volume=373|pages=23–30|doi=10.1016/S0040-6031(01)00463-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Regan|first1=MD|last2=Gill|first2=IS|last3=Richards|first3=JG|title=Calorespirometry reveals that goldfish prioritize aerobic metabolism over metabolic rate depression in all but near-anoxic environments|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|date=2017|volume=220|issue=4|pages=564–572|doi=10.1242/jeb.145169|pmid=27913601}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stangl|first1=P|last2=Wegener|first2=G|title=Calorimetric and biochemical studies on the effects of environmental hypoxia and chemicals on freshwater fish|journal=Themochimica Acta|date=1996|volume=271|pages=101–113|doi=10.1016/0040-6031(95)02586-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards" /&gt; The species that employ metabolic suppression are more hypoxia-tolerant than the species that do not, which suggests that metabolic suppression enhances hypoxia tolerance.

If the hypoxic exposure lasts sufficiently long, the fish will succumb to a depletion of its glycogen stores and/or the over-accumulation of deleterious anaerobic end-products. Furthermore, the severely limited energetic scope that comes with a metabolically suppressed state means that the fish is unable to complete critical tasks such a predator avoidance and reproduction. Perhaps for these reasons, goldfish prioritize their use of aerobic metabolism in most hypoxic environments, reserving metabolic suppression for the extreme case of anoxia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Energy conservation===
In addition to a reduction in the rate of protein synthesis, it appears that some species of hypoxia-tolerant fish conserve energy by employing Hochachka’s ion channel arrest hypothesis.  This hypothesis makes two predictions:
# Hypoxia-tolerant animals naturally have low membrane permeabilities
# Membrane permeability decreases even more during hypoxic conditions (ion channel arrest)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | pmid= 2417316 | doi=10.1126/science.2417316 | title=Defense strategies against hypoxia and hypothermia | journal=Science | date=1986 | volume=231 | issue=4735 | pages=234–241 | first=P. | last=Hochachka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buck | first1 = L.

The first prediction holds true.  When membrane permeability to Na+ and K+ ions was compared between reptiles and mammals, reptile membranes were discovered to be five times less leaky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3605374 | volume=253 | issue=1 Pt 2 | title=Evolution of mammalian endothermic metabolism: &amp;quot;leaky&amp;quot; membranes as a source of heat | date=July 1987 | pages=R1–7 | journal=Am J Physiol | last1 = Else | first1 = PL | last2 = Hulbert | first2 = AJ| doi=10.1152/ajpregu.1987.253.1.R1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second prediction has been more difficult to prove experimentally, however, indirect measures have showed a decrease in Na+/K+-ATPase activity in eel and trout [[hepatocytes]] during hypoxic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16228932 | doi=10.1086/432857 | volume=78 | issue=6 | title=Metabolic arrest and its regulation in anoxic eel hepatocytes | year=2005 | pages=926–36 | journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology | last1 = Busk | first1 = M | last2 = Boutilier | first2 = RG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bogdanova | first1 = A. | last2 = Grenacher | first2 = B. | last3 = Nikinmaa | first3 = M. | last4 = Gassmann | first4 = M. | year = 2005 | title = Hypoxic responses of Na +/K+ ATPase in trout hepatocytes | url = | journal = J.

===Enhanced glycogen stores===
The limiting factor for fish undergoing hypoxia is the availability of fermentable substrate for anaerobic metabolism; once substrate runs out, ATP production ceases.  Endogenous [[glycogen]] is present in tissue as a long term energy storage molecule.  It can be converted into glucose and subsequently used as the starting material in glycolysis.
A key adaptation to long-term survival during hypoxia is the ability of an organism to store large amounts of glycogen.  Many hypoxia-tolerant species, such as carp, goldfish, [[killifish]], and [[oscar (fish)|oscar]] contain the largest glycogen content (300-2000 µmol glocosyl units/g) in their tissue compared to hypoxia-sensitive fish, such as rainbow trout, which contain only 100 µmol glocosyl units/g.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1016/S1546-5098(08)00009-5|chapter = Chapter 9 the Anoxia-Tolerant Crucian Carp (Carassius Carassius L.)|title = Hypoxia| volume=27| pages=397–441|series = Fish Physiology|year = 2009|last1 = Vornanen|first1 = Matti| last2=Stecyk| first2=Jonathan A.W.| last3=Nilsson| first3=Göran E.| isbn=9780123746320}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The more glycogen stored in a tissue indicates the capacity for that tissue to undergo glycolysis and produce ATP.

===Tolerance of waste products===
When anaerobic pathways are turned on, glycogen stores are depleted and accumulation of acidic waste products occurs.  This is known as a [[Pasteur effect]].  A challenge hypoxia-tolerant fish face is how to produce ATP anaerobically without creating a significant Pasteur effect.  Along with a reduction in metabolism, some fish have adapted traits to avoid accumulation of [[lactic acid|lactate]].  For example, the crucian carp, a highly hypoxia-tolerant fish,  has evolved to survive months of anoxic waters.  A key adaptation is the ability to convert lactate to ethanol in the muscle and excrete it out of their gills.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | pmid= 7384807 | doi=10.1126/science.7384807 | title=Ethanol: novel end product of vertebrate anaerobic metabolism | journal=Science | date=1980 | volume=209 | issue=4453 | pages=308–309 | first=E. | last=Shoubridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although this process is energetically costly is it crucial to their survival in hypoxic waters.

==Gene expression changes==
[[DNA microarray]] studies done on different fish species exposed to low-oxygen conditions have shown that at the genetic level fish respond to hypoxia by changing the expression of genes involved in oxygen transport, ATP production, and [[protein synthesis]]. In the liver of [[mudsucker]]s exposed to hypoxia there were changes in the expression of genes involved in [[heme]] metabolism such as [[hemopexin]], [[heme oxygenase 1]], and [[ferritin]].&lt;ref name= "Gracey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gracey | first1 = AY | last2 = Troll | first2 = JV | last3 = Somero | first3 = GN | year = 2001 | title = Hypoxia-induced gene expression profiling in the euryoxic fish Gillichthys mirabilis | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 98 | issue = 4| pages = 1993–1998 | pmid = 11172064 | doi=10.1073/pnas.98.4.1993 | pmc=29370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the sequestration and metabolism of iron may suggest hypoxia induced [[erythropoiesis]] and increased demand for hemoglobin synthesis, leading to increased oxygen uptake and transport. Increased expression of [[myoglobin]], which is normally only found in muscle tissue, has also been observed after hypoxia exposure in the gills of zebrafish&lt;ref name= "van der meer"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15994372 | doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00089.2005 | volume=289 | issue=5 | title=Gene expression profiling of the long-term adaptive response to hypoxia in the gills of adult zebrafish | date=November 2005 | pages=R1512–9 | journal=American Journal of Physiology.

Microarray studies done on fish species exposed to hypoxia typically show a metabolic switch, that is, a decrease in the expression of genes involved in aerobic metabolism and an increase in expression of genes involved in anaerobic metabolism. Zebrafish embryos exposed to hypoxia decreased expression of genes involved in the [[citric acid cycle]] including, [[succinate dehydrogenase]], [[malate dehydrogenase]], and [[citrate synthase]], and increased expression of genes involved in glycolysis such as [[phosphoglycerate mutase]], [[enolase]], [[aldolase]], and [[lactate dehydrogenase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12700360 | doi=10.1152/physiolgenomics.00128.2002 | volume=13 | issue=2 | title=Gene expression profile of zebrafish exposed to hypoxia during development | date=April 2003 | pages=97–106 | journal=Physiological Genomics | last1 = Ton | first1 = C | last2 = Stamatiou | first2 = D | last3 = Liew | first3 = CC}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in protein synthesis is an important response to hypoxia in order to decrease ATP demand for whole organism metabolic suppression. Decreases in the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis, such as [[elongation factor-2]] and several [[ribosomal proteins]], have been shown in the muscle of the mudsucker&lt;ref name= "Gracey"/&gt; and gills of adult zebrafish&lt;ref name= "van der meer"/&gt; after hypoxia exposure .

Research in mammals has implicated [[hypoxia-inducible factors|hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)]] as a key regulator of gene expression changes in response to hypoxia&lt;ref name= "Nikinmaa"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15821280 | doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00626.2004 | volume=288 | issue=5 | title=Oxygen-dependent gene expression in fishes | date=May 2005 | pages=R1079–90 | journal=American Journal of Physiology. Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology | last1 = Nikinmaa | first1 = M | last2 = Rees | first2 = BB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a direct link between fish HIFs and gene expression changes in response to hypoxia has yet to be found. [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic analysis]] of available fish, [[tetrapod]], and [[bird]] HIF-α and -β sequences shows that the isoforms of both subunits present in mammals are also represented in fish Within fish, HIF sequences group close together and are distinct from tetrapod and bird sequences.&lt;ref name ="Richards"/&gt; As well, amino acid analysis of available fish HIF-α and -β sequences reveals that they contain all functional domains shown to be important for mammalian HIF function,&lt;ref name ="Richards"/&gt; including the [[Basic-helix-loop-helix|basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)]] domain, [[PAS domain|Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS)]] domain, and the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD), which render the HIF-α subunit sensitive to oxygen levels.&lt;ref name= "Nikinmaa"/&gt; The evolutionary similarity between HIF sequences in fish, tetrapods and birds, as well as the conservation of important functional domains suggests that HIF function and regulation is similar between fish and mammalian species. There is also evidence of novel HIF mechanisms present in fish not found in mammals. In mammals, HIF-α protein is continuously synthesized and regulated [[posttranslational modification|post-translationally]] by changing oxygen conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenneth | first1 = NS | last2 = Rocha | first2 = S | year = 2008 | title = Regulation of gene expression by hypoxia | url = | journal = Biochem J | volume = 414 | issue = 1| pages = 19–29 | pmid = 18651837 | doi=10.1042/BJ20081055}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been shown in different fish species that HIF-α [[mRNA]] levels are also responsive to hypoxia. In the hypoxia tolerant [[grass carp]], substantial increases in HIF-1α and HIF-3α mRNA were observed in all tissues after hypoxia exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16623959 | doi=10.1186/1471-2199-7-15 | volume=7 | title=Cloning and expression analysis of two distinct HIF-alpha isoforms--gcHIF-1alpha and gcHIF-4alpha--from the hypoxia-tolerant grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idellus | pmc=1473195 | year=2006 | pages=15 | issue=1 | journal=BMC Molecular Biology | last1 = Law | first1 = SH | last2 = Wu | first2 = RS | last3 = Ng | first3 = PK | last4 = Yu | first4 = RM | last5 = Kong | first5 = RY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, mRNA levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α were hypoxia-responsive in the ovaries of the [[Atlantic croaker]] during both short and long term hypoxia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | pmid =17467194 | doi=10.1016/j.gene.2007.03.009 | title=Molecular cloning, characterization and expression of two hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, in a hypoxia-tolerant marine teleost, Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) | journal=Gene | date=2007 | volume=396 | issue=2 | pages=273–282 | first=Md.

The project is directed by Dr. [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/george-nicholas George P. Nicholas] ([[Simon Fraser University]]), co-developed with [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/julie-hollowell Julie Hollowell] ([[Indiana University]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/kelly-bannister Kelly Bannister] ([[University of Victoria]]) and is funded by the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]]'s (SSHRC) major collaborative research initiatives (MCRI) program.

IPinCH is a collaboration of scholars, students, heritage professionals, community members, policy makers, and Indigenous organizations across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people|title = People &amp; Partners|website = Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Our Research Team&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team|title = Research Team {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes over fifty leading scholars and professionals, nearly one hundred Associates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates|title = Associates {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; sixteen Fellows,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/fellows|title = Fellows {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over thirty partnering organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/partners|title = Partnering Organisations {{!}} Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|website = www.sfu.ca|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing Canada, Australia, United States, New Zealand, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Germany, and Switzerland. Our organizational partners range from the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), to [[Parks Canada]], to Indigenous groups including the [[Penobscot Nation of Maine]] and the [[Moriori]] of [[Rekohu]] (Chatham Islands, New Zealand)

The project serves as both a practical resource and a network of support for communities and researchers engaged in cultural heritage work. Topics of research include the theoretical, ethical, and practical implications of commodification, appropriation, and other flows of knowledge about the past, and how these may affect communities, researchers, and other stakeholders.

==Purpose==

===Objectives===
* To document the diversity of principles, interpretations, and actions arising in response to [[intellectual property]] issues in [[cultural heritage]] worldwide;
* To generate more robust theoretical understandings as well as norms of good practice in heritage work; and
* To make findings available to stakeholders, from Aboriginal communities to professional organizations to government agencies, allowing them to develop and refine their own theories, principles, policies and practices.

===Mission===
IPinCH is an international collaboration of [[archaeologists]], [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous organizations]], [[lawyers]], [[anthropologists]], [[ethicists]], museum specialists, policy makers, and others, working to facilitate fair and equitable exchanges of knowledge relating to heritage. The IPinCH Project is concerned with the theoretical, ethical, and practical implications of [[commodification]], [[appropriation (sociology)|appropriation]], and other flows of knowledge about the past, and how these may affect communities, researchers, and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]].

===Vision===
IPinCH provides a foundation of research, knowledge and resources to assist archaeologists, academic institutions, descendant communities, scholars, policy makers, and other stakeholders in negotiating more equitable and successful terms of research and policies through an agenda of community-based research and topical exploration of intellectual property (IP) issues. IPinCH focuses on archaeology as a primary component of cultural heritage; however, this project is ultimately concerned with larger issues of the nature of knowledge and rights based on culture—how these are defined and used, who has control and access, and especially how fair and appropriate use and access can be achieved to the benefit of all stakeholders in the past.

==Project Description==
The 7-year project began in 2008 with a $2.5 million grant from the Major Collaborative Research Initiatives program of Canada’s Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sshrc.ca/ Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council&lt;/ref&gt;  About one-fourth of the project budget is reserved for student fellowships&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/opportunities/Students student fellowships&lt;/ref&gt; and research support, and one-fourth for community-based heritage research for case studies&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project_components case studies&lt;/ref&gt; related to the project themes.

The IPinCH Project is led by Dr. Nicholas and guided by a steering committee of six team members representing five universities ([https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/catherine-bell Catherine Bell] [University of Alberta], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/joe-watkins Joe Watkins] [University of Oklahoma], and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/steering-committee/john-r-welch John Welch] [Simon Fraser University], plus Hollowell and Bannister). Team members represent nine Canadian and nineteen international universities, and eleven Canadian and international organizations.  A project advisory board will review project activities in addition to advising on strategies for linking with stakeholders and dissemination of results ([https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/michael-brown Michael Brown] [Williams College], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/larry-chartrand Larry Chartrand] [Métis; University of Winnipeg], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/robert-layton Robert Layton] [University of Durham, UK], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/peter-levesque Peter Levesque] [Principal Director, KMbW - Knowledge Mobilization Works], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/robert-paterson Robert K. Paterson] [UBC, Faculty of Law], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/dame-marilyn-strathern Dame Marilyn Strathern] [University of Cambridge, UK], [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/advisor/david-j-stephenson-jr David Stephenson] [Rocky Mountain Thunder Law Firm, Boulder, CO]).

The IPinCH project initially had three components:
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives Community Initiatives]
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/working-groups Working Groups]
* [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/knowledge-base Knowledge Base]
As of March 2016, eight of the twelve community initiatives have been completed and the final reports are available on the IPinCH website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives|title=IPinCH Community Initiatives|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for details on IPinCH’s Community Initiatives, please see below). To accommodate broadening research interests and developments, IPinCH Working Groups have been reconceptualized as Research Themes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/working-groups|title=Working Groups|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see section below on Research Themes). The knowledge base (KB),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/knowledge-base|title=The IPinCH Knowledge Base|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; an online searchable database and archive containing scholarly and popular articles, documents and tools created by communities, global case studies, research protocols and legislation, and resources created by the IPinCH project, has been retired from the IPinCH website. A selection of KB material is available within Simon Fraser University’s Institutional Repository Summit.

==Community-based Initiatives / Special Initiatives ==
[[File:IPinCH Community-Based Initiatives.png|thumb|''IPinCH-supported Community-Based Initiatives are located all over the globe. IPinCH funds seventeen initiatives, based in Australia, Canada, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand, and the United States, working with groups such as the Inuvialuit, the Penobscot Nation, the Ainu, the Hopi Tribe, and the Moriori.'']]
In IPinCH’s [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/project-components/community-based-initiatives Community-Based Initiatives] (CBIs), team members work closely with communities to investigate and address pressing cultural heritage challenges in specific contexts. IPinCH-supported Community-Based Initiatives are located all over the globe. We fund seventeen initiatives, based in Australia, Canada, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, New Zealand, and the United States, working with groups such as the Inuvialuit, the Penobscot Nation, the Ainu, the Hopi Tribe, and the Moriori.

IPinCH values a collaborative approach and employs Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR)&lt;ref&gt;Minkler, M., and N. Wallerstein (editors) 2003 Community-Based Participatory Research for Health. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Springett, J. 2003 Issues in Participatory Evaluation.

Native Studies Review 8 (2): pp. 51–74&lt;/ref&gt; methods that engage the community in all aspects of the research process. In the CBIs, communities determine the research goals, which form for the foundation for the initiative, including the practical and theoretical outputs. After community review, the results of these initiatives will be made available to partner organizations and stakeholders, in order to assist them in refining their own policies and approaches.

Key features of a CBPR methodology include: 
*A collaborative approach that engages the community or organization in all aspects of the research process—from development of research questions and research design to conducting the research, designing outputs, and disseminating results;
*Research goals that prioritize community needs and result in direct community benefits;
*Projects that contribute to community capacity building and to sustainable and more equitable relations between the community and outside researchers, promote respect for local values, and address mistrust, inequity, and similar issues in conventional research.

Twelve community initiatives received funding from IPinCH and a further five Special Initiatives have also been approved. The community initiatives address a broad range of pressing cultural heritage topics: 
*'''A Case of Access: Inuvialuit Engagement with the Smithsonian’s MacFarlane Collection'''

The MacFarlane Collection is a collection of 550 [[Inuvialuit]] items bought by [[Hudson’s Bay Company]] trader Roderick MacFarlane in the mid-1800s for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, David. Painted Wooden Plaques from the MacFarlane Collection: The Earliest Inuvialuit Graphic Art. ARCTIC VOL. 59, NO. 4 (DECEMBER 2006) P. 351– 360&lt;/ref&gt; Inuvialuit elders, youth, cultural experts, anthropologists and museum curators shared with one another their respective knowledge about the museum collection and documented the process. The project has encouraged interaction and engagement by the Inuvialuit with the objects in the MacFarlane Collection, supported by the creation of a [http://www.inuvialuitlivinghistory.ca/ virtual exhibit] and searchable archive of the collection. Additional details about the "A Case of Access" Community Initiative are available in the [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/project_components/community-based_initiatives/acaseofaccess_finalreport_2014.pdf full report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/project_components/community-based_initiatives/inuvialuit_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary], available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Cultural Tourism in Nunavik'''

In the early 1990s, the first few attempts at [[cultural tourism]] in [[Nunavik]] saw little success, but there is now support from businesses to include tourism as a facet of economic development. The [http://www.avataq.qc.ca/en/Home Avataq Cultural Institute], an IPinCH partner organization, has advocated the development of cultural tourism for some time, but Avataq sees a world’s difference between what it envisions as responsible development and certain economic interests’ vision for cultural tourism. This case study works with local communities to answer several key questions: What part do the Nunavimmiut really play in this development? Are they silent participants or, on the contrary, the driving force behind this development? One of the aims of the research is to re-centre the meaning of cultural tourism as a means of protecting [[Inuit culture]], possibly in tension with the Quebec government’s “[[Plan Nord]]” for Northern economic and tourism development.

*'''Developing Policies and Protocols for the Culturally Sensitive Intellectual Properties of the Penobscot Nation of Maine'''

Indigenous communities face legal, social, cultural, and economic challenges when attempting to protect or manage their intellectual property (IP), and often there is a lack of community infrastructure to formalize processes for confronting IP issues. To mitigate this challenge, the [[Penobscot|Penobscot Nation]] in Maine established an IP Working Group that developed tribal protocols, tools, and an internal infrastructure to address IP issues particularly related to archaeology and heritage-based places. This involved discussions around what constitutes Penobscot Nation intellectual property, what characterizes intellectual property violations (and how to deal with them), and identifying the community’s intellectual property priorities. The [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/penobscot_final_report_2014.pdf full project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/penobscot_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.
*'''Education, Protection and Management of ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' (Sanilac Petroglyph Site)'''

For the [[Saginaw Chippewa Tribal Nation]] of Michigan, ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' is a sacred place where teachings from their Anishinabe ancestors are embedded in the rock as [[petroglyph]]s. Amidst concerns over the inappropriate use of the teachings, this case study explores issues around cultural commodification with the goal of working with the Saginaw Chippewa's Ziibiwing Cultural Society to create a plan to protect and control the use of the ''ezhibiigaadek asin'' site. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/ezhibiigaadek_asin_finalreport_2016.pdf project report] is available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Grassroots Resource Preservation and Management in Kyrgyzstan: Ethnicity, Nationalism and Heritage on a Human Scale'''

This case study began a public conversation among both urban and rural people about intellectual property and cultural heritage in [[Kyrgyzstan]], a post-Soviet nation where ties to the past have been attenuated and even severed. In Kyrgyzstan, local communities have little or no awareness of the heritage resources in their midst, and damage to sites is common. This case study had three components all with the shared goal of encouraging a national dialogue on cultural heritage and intellectual property. The first project involved developing a new foundation for an endangered archaeological structure. The second project focused on preserving oral traditions for younger generations of Kyrgyz, while the third initiative was centered on creating a photographic record of local archaeological sites.
*'''Moriori Cultural Database'''

Located on Rēkohu ([[Chatham Islands]], New Zealand), this project involved research and community-building related to [[Moriori people|Moriori]] identity, indigenous cultural heritage and resource management and protection. A key component of this study was the development of a multi-layer database to integrate research on Moriori identity, cultural heritage protection, land use, and resource management in culturally sensitive ways. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/moriori_final_report_2014.pdf project report] and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/moriori_project_summary_2014.pdf project summary] are available on the IPinCH website.

*'''Secwepemc Territorial Authority – Honoring Ownership of Tangible / Intangible Culture'''

This initiative brought together [[Secwepemc]] community leaders and knowledge holders from Neskonlith, Adams Lake, and Splats’in Bands of interior [[British Columbia]] with a group of social, legal, and political scholars. This community initiative will outline approaches to cultural heritage encounters within Secwepemc territory, examining what it would look like were we to fully accept and act upon the premise that Secwepemc Peoples’ have economic, political, and legal authority within their territory. At the heart of this project is a desire to develop fruitful scholarly and economic collaborations, while fully honouring Secwepemc peoples’ assertions of territorial authority.
* '''The History and Contemporary Practices of the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office'''
What are the differences between [[Hopi]] notions of ''navoti'' (“[[traditional knowledge]]”) and Euro-American understandings of intellectual property? What are the implications of this in terms of managing cultural knowledge resources? This case study is working towards developing an official cultural heritage management guide for the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office and the Hopi Tribe.

*'''The Journey Home - Guiding Intangible Knowledge Production in the Analysis of Ancestral Remains'''

In the Journey Home project, the question was not whether ancestral remains should be repatriated from the [[University of British Columbia]] Lab of Archaeology to the [[Sto:lo|Stó:lō Nation]], but rather how to do things right, regardless of timeframe. This study developed mutually acceptable guidelines for [[repatriation]], addressing complex questions related to the production of knowledge, authority, control, and ongoing relationships with ancestors. The full [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/sites/default/files/resources/reports/thejourneyhome_finalreport_2016.pdf project report] is available on the IPinCH website.
*'''The Ngaut Ngaut Interpretive Project: Providing Culturally Sustainable Online Interpretive Content to the Public'''

Indigenous groups around the world are struggling to come to terms with the issues that an online environment poses to the presentation of the Indigenous past and present. In this initiative, the Mannum Aboriginal Community Association Inc. countered offensive and incorrect online information about the Ngaut Ngaut heritage complex in [[South Australia]] by creating their own interpretive content in which they shared community perceptions and values about this significant cultural landscape. The [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3YUNheVwtsFcVRWQXNDbG5MNkE/view?pli=1 full project report] and an [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3YUNheVwtsFYm4wWndadjFRTTQ/view?pli=1 interpretive guide] for the Ngaut Ngaut site are available on the IPinCH website. 
*'''Treaty Relations as a Method of Resolving IP Issues'''

This case study examined the political relationship established between [[First Nations]] and Canada through historical [[Treaty|treaties]]. Did the treaty relationship include, either directly or indirectly, a shared understanding of how the cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples would be treated by Settlers and by the governments they established? How might this historical relationship serve Settler-First Nations relations today? Based on a careful examination of published primary and secondary materials related to treaty negotiations in central Ontario and the Northwest Territories, the study applies historical, oral-historical, and anthropological methods and attempts to identify aspects of these historic treaties which have resonance for current IP debates around topics such as property, ownership, and jurisdiction.

*'''Yukon First Nations Heritage Values and Heritage Resource Management'''

This community initiative seeks understandings of heritage values from three participating [[Yukon]] First Nations: the [[Champagne and Aishihik First Nations|Champagne &amp; Aishihik First Nations]], the [[Carcross/Tagish First Nation|Carcross-Tagish First Nation,]] and the [[Ta'an Kwach'an Council|Ta'an Kwach'än Council.]] This project will explore how the values of Yukon First Nations towards heritage resources differ from Western understandings, and will articulate and document what Indigenous heritage management practices look like on a practical level.

==Research Themes==
Integrating research findings and knowledge from our Community-Based Initiatives and other sources, the IPinCH Research Themes explore unique questions relating to intellectual property and heritage.  Each group is led by at least two team members, as Research Theme Co-Chairs. Membership in these groups is open to all associated students, partnering organization representatives, co-investigators, associates, collaborators, research assistants, steering committee members, and community representatives.
* '''Bioarchaeology, DNA, and Indigeneity'''
How is [[Genetics|genetic]] information being used to define—or redefine—identity, [[Ancestor|ancestry]], and diversity? What are the ensuing social, ethical, and practical implications of [[DNA]] research for descendent communities, First Nations peoples, and other stakeholders? What are the intersections of genetic and cultural identities? What can research examples such as that of [[Kwäday Dän Ts'ìnchi]] (Long Ago Person Found) or the [[Anzick-1|Clovis period child]] from the Anzick site teach us about moving forward with genetic studies through collaborative research? As archaeologists and anthropologists increasingly turn to genetic information to provide insights into the past, there are important implications for Indigenous peoples today. From genetic ancestry tests that purport to identify “Native American ancestry,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science|last=TallBear|first=Kim|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Minnesota|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the potential application of [[ancient DNA analysis]] to assist with the [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|repatriation]] of human remains, DNA is changing the way in which identity is constructed—both for ancient and present-day peoples. Research theme chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/daryl-pullman Daryl Pullman] (Memorial University), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/alan-h-goodman Alan Goodman] (Hampshire College), and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/dorothy-lippert Dorothy Lippert] (Smithsonian Institution).
*'''Commodifications of Cultural Heritage'''
How can processes of commodification be both harmful and beneficial? What tools and strategies can Indigenous communities and scholars use to deal with commodification concerns and opportunities? This theme covers complex topics such as the role of government and legislation in regulating cultural commodification, whether commodification can benefit disempowered communities, and the impact of treating human remains as commodities, whether in medical science or museums. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/sven-ouzman Sven Ouzman] ([[University of Pretoria]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates/solen-roth Solen Roth] (University of British Columbia). 
*'''Community-Based Cultural Heritage Research (CBCHR)'''
[[Community-Based Participatory Research]] (CBPR) methods engage communities in all aspects of the research process. In IPinCH’s Community Initiatives, the communities determine the research goals, which form for the foundation for the initiative, including the practical and theoretical outputs. These IPinCH-supported initiatives may serve as positive examples of CBPR methods being put to use to investigate and address pressing cultural heritage needs. There is an ongoing need for background information and case studies to help students and scholars think through the implications of community-based work. This theme also amalgamates resources to help foster balanced and mutually beneficial relationships between academic and community researchers and promote fair and culturally-appropriate uses of intellectual property. Research theme chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/kelly-bannister Kelly Bannister] (University of Victoria), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/julie-hollowell Julie Hollowell] (Indiana University), [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/ian-lilley Ian Lilley] (University of Queensland), and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/john-r-welch John R. Welch] (Simon Fraser University). 
*'''Cultural Tourism'''
The diversity of the world’s cultures, both past and present, is one of the key attractions of travel. Governments, the tourism industry, and communities work hard to create unforgettable cultural products and experiences. But are the economic benefits of these experiences shared equally with communities? Are they sustainable environmentally, are they culturally appropriate experiences to share, and do communities have control over how their culture is represented? These questions are at the heart of the ''Cultural Tourism'' research theme. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/lena-mortensen Lena Mortensen] (University of Toronto - Scarborough) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/david-schaepe David Schaepe] (Sto:lo Nation)
*'''Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Heritage, and the Law'''
The ''Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Heritage, and the Law'' Research Theme investigates the application of [[intellectual property law]] to the realm of cultural heritage, as well as alternative models to protect, promote, and maintain cultural and heritage goods. A number of legal systems coexist and often intersect with conventional intellectual property protections, including customary law, international law, informal or “vernacular” intellectual property, and moral economies. Many stakeholders thus face an inter-jurisdictional geography of cultural rights, consisting of [[indigenist]] social movements, NGOs, development agencies and institutions, multilateral institutions, and the [[Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples]]. This theme addresses these complex legal and political landscapes. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/rosemary-j-coombe Rosemary Coombe] ([[York University]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/associates/patricia-goff Patricia Goff] ([[Wilfrid Laurier University]], Ontario).
*'''Indigenous Research Ethics'''
The ''Indigenous Research Ethics'' theme explores the dynamic intersection of policies, procedures, practices, and philosophies of contemporary Indigenous research ethics. The research contained within this theme represents a useful resource for practitioners who grapple with intellectual property ethics and issues. Emphasis is placed upon the special demands and rewards of collaborative research practice. Research theme co-chairs: [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/alison-wylie Alison Wylie] ([[University of Washington]]) and [https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/about/ipinch-people/research-team/sonya-atalay Sonya Atalay] ([[Indiana University]]).
* '''Safeguarding Indigenous Heritage'''
In 2014, the long-standing conflict over Grace Islet, off [[Salt Spring Island]], B.C., a well-documented [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] burial islet, reached a boiling point as construction began on a private residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/resources/declarations/open-letter-grace-islet|title=An Open Letter on Grace Islet|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grace-islet-home-on-sacred-aboriginal-cemetery-to-be-demolished-1.3186534|title=Home on sacred B.C. aboriginal cemetery to be demolished|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following protests by First Nations, scholars, and members of the public, construction was halted and the province of British Columbia eventually purchased Grace Islet from the private landowner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/grace-islet-controversy-ends-as-b-c-steps-in-to-buy-land-1.2906882|title=Grace Islet burial site saved as province steps in|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IPinCH believes that the critical issue in the Grace Islet case is the absence of respect for First Nations laws, values, and practices relating to burial sites and ancestral remains, and the need for descendant communities to have a say in how their ancestral sites are managed and protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/ipinch/resources/declarations/ancestral-burial-grounds|title=Declaration on the Safeguarding of Indigenous Ancestral Burial Grounds as Sacred Sites and Cultural Landscapes|website=Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Islet is one of many such cases in British Columbia and, indeed, around the world, that demonstrate the limited legal protections available to protect Indigenous burial grounds''.'' This research theme seeks to examine current challenges in protecting Indigenous ancestral burial sites within the province and to propose a new approach that meets the needs of all parties.

The '''Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary''' refers to a [[biblical commentary]] entitled a ''Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible'', prepared by Robert Jamieson, [[Andrew Robert Fausset]] and [[David Brown (Free Church of Scotland)|David Brown]] and published in 1871; and derived works from this initial publication, in differing numbers of volumes and abridgements. The commentary uses the [[King James Version of the Bible]] as its text.

==Background==
Robert Jamieson D.D. (1802–1880) was a minister at St. Paul’s Church, [[Provanmill]] in [[Glasgow]]. Andrew Fausset, A.M. (1821–1910) was rector of [[St Cuthbert's Church, York|St. Cuthbert’s Church]] in [[York (England)|York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/fausset_ar|title=A. R. Fausset - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|work=[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]]|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Brown (1803–1897) was a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] minister at St. James, Glasgow, and professor of [[theology]] at [[Christ's College, Aberdeen|Free Church College]] of the [[University of Aberdeen]].

The writers described their work as:

:[a] humble effort to make Scripture expound itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/jamieson-fausset-brown/revelation/revelation-22.html|title=Revelation 22 Commentary - Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible|website=Bible Study Tools|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and prayed:

:May the Blessed Lord who has caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning, bless this ... effort ... and make it an instrument towards the conversion of sinners and the edification of saints, to the glory of His great name and the hastening of His kingdom! Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/jamieson-fausset-brown/revelation/revelation-22.html|title=Revelation 22 Commentary - Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible|website=Bible Study Tools|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example text==
On [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1 -

1. In the beginning — a period of remote and unknown antiquity, hid in the depths of eternal ages; and so the phrase is used in {{bibleverse||Proverbs|8:22-23|KJV}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;God — the name of the Supreme Being, signifying in Hebrew, "Strong," "Mighty." It is expressive of omnipotent power; and by its use here in the plural form, is obscurely taught at the opening of the Bible, a doctrine clearly revealed in other parts of it, namely, that though God is one, there is a plurality of persons in the Godhead — Father, Son, and Spirit, who were engaged in the creative work ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 8:27; [[Gospel of John|John]] 1:3, 10; [[Letter to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 3:9; [[Letter To the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 1:2; [[Book of Job|Job]] 26:13).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''John Tasioulas''' (born 18 December 1964) is a Greek-Australian moral and legal philosopher. He is the inaugural Yeoh Professor of Politics, Philosophy and Law at [[The Dickson Poon School of Law]], [[King's College London]] and Director of the [[Yeoh Tiong Lay]] Centre for Politics, Philosophy, and Law.{{r|joins}} He holds dual Australian and British citizenship.

==Biography==
John Tasioulas was born in Wollongong, New South Wales, in 1964.{{r|cv}} His parents migrated to Australia from [[Dasyllio]] in the [[Grevena]] region of Greece. He was a student at [[Northcote High School]] and [[Melbourne High School (Victoria)|Melbourne High School]]. He completed undergraduate degrees in Philosophy and Law at the [[University Of Melbourne|University of Melbourne]] and was the 1989 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] for Victoria.{{r|psonis}} Studying at [[Balliol College]], he received a doctorate (D.Phil in Philosophy) from [[Oxford university|Oxford University]] for a thesis on moral relativism which was supervised by [[Joseph Raz]]. Tasioulas was a Lecturer in Jurisprudence at the [[Glasgow university|University of Glasgow]] (1992–1998), Reader in Moral and Legal Philosophy at the University of Oxford where he was a Tutorial Fellow in Philosophy at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] (1998–2010), and [[Quain Professor|Quain Professor of Jurisprudence]] in the [[UCL Faculty of Laws|Faculty of Laws]], [[University College London]] (2011–2014). He is an Honorary Professorial Fellow at Melbourne Law School, an Emeritus Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, a Distinguished Research Fellow of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, and a member of the [[Academia Europaea]].{{r|ae|ccae}} He has been a Fellow at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]] at [[Harvard University]] and a Visiting Professor of Law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]]. He delivered the 'Or 'Emet Lecture at [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] (2011), the Natural Law Lecture at Notre Dame Law School (2012), and the Van Hasselt Lecture at Delft University of Technology (2016). 

==Academic expertise==

Tasioulas works in moral, legal and political philosophy. He has advanced a version of the communicative theory of punishment, according to which the overarching point of punishment is the communication of censure to wrong-doers. His version of the theory is distinctive in making room for the value of mercy alongside that of retributive justice. 

In the philosophy of human rights, Tasioulas has argued for an orthodox understanding of such rights, according to which they are moral rights possessed by all human beings simply in virtue of their humanity. This contrasts with a more recent view that characterizes human rights in terms of some political role(s), such as being triggers for international intervention or benchmarks of internal legitimacy. According to Tasioulas, human rights have a foundation both in a plurality of human interests and in equal human dignity. 

He has written on a range of other topics including moral relativism, the ethics of biomedicine, and the philosophy of international law. His co-edited volume, ''The Philosophy of International Law'' (OUP, 2010), is a central text in the field.

In popular culture, the term is sometimes used to mean any attempt to understand a secretive organization or process, such as plans for upcoming products or events, by interpreting indirect clues.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The term is named after the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], the seat of today's Russian and then-Soviet government. Kremlinologist refers to academic, media, and commentary experts who specialize in the study of Kremlinology. The term is sometimes sweepingly used to describe Western scholars who researched issues of, or specialized in, Russian/Soviet law, although the correct term is simply [[List of Russian legal historians|''Russian law'' scholar]]. Sovietologists or Kremlinologists should also be distinguished from [[Transitology|transitologists]], scholars who study legal, economic and social transitions from [[communism]] to [[capitalism]].

==Techniques==
During the [[Cold War]], lack of reliable information about the country forced Western analysts to "read between the lines" and to use the tiniest tidbits, such as the removal of portraits, the rearranging of chairs, positions at the reviewing stand for parades in [[Red Square]], the choice of capital or small initial letters in phrases such as "First Secretary", the arrangement of articles on the pages of the party newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' and other indirect signs to try to understand what was happening in internal Soviet politics.

To study the relations between Communist fraternal states, Kremlinologists compare the statements issued by the respective national [[Communist Party|Communist parties]], looking for omissions and discrepancies in the ordering of objectives. The description of state visits in the Communist press are also scrutinized, as well as the degree of [[hospitality]] lent to dignitaries. Kremlinology also emphasizes [[ritual]], in that it notices and ascribes meaning to the unusual absence of a policy statement on a certain anniversary or holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sino-Vietnamese Conflict|first=Eugene K.|last=Lawson|publisher=Praeger|year=1984|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the German language, such attempts acquired the somewhat derisive name "Kreml-Astrologie" (Kremlin Astrology), hinting at the fact that its results were often vague and inconclusive, if not outright wrong.

==After the Cold War==
The term "Kremlinology" is still in use in application to the study of decision-making processes in the [[Politics of Russia|politics of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipec-eu.ru/programmnyie-materialyi Poland is in the Eurasian Union: the mythology of Russian-Polish relations. Eurasian Club East - West, October 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207030814/http://ipec-eu.ru/programmnyie-materialyi |date=2012-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, the term is sometimes used to mean any attempt to understand a secretive organization or process, such as plans for upcoming products or events, by interpreting indirect clues.

While the Soviet Union no longer exists, other secretive states still do, such as [[North Korea]], for which Kremlinology-like approaches are still used by the Western media.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The '''MPT8080 "Microtutor"''' is a [[microprocessor]] trainer based on the [[Intel 8080]] processor, developed by Limrose Electronics. It was designed in the mid-1970s to assist in the understanding of the then-new microprocessors.

Users of the MPT8080 enter [[assembly language]] programs via binary switches or a [[hexadecimal]] keypad. While the code executes, the user can observe what is happening on the address, data, and control signals of the microprocessor. The MPT8080 acts like a [[Computer architecture simulator|simulator]], in that code can be stepped through one [[Instruction set|instruction]]—or each cycle of each individual instruction—at a time to observe what is happening.

The MPT8080 has simple input and output, consisting of eight [[LED]]s and eight switches. The input port allows code to sense the state of external switches, whilst the output port can display information on one of its eight LEDs. The input and outputs port also have connectors, allowing them to be connected to external signals through accessory patch kits, allowing the MPT8080 to control and monitor other circuitry.

==History==
Initially, a [[Motorola 6800]]-based trainer was developed alongside the Intel 8080–based model, but due to technical and operational issues the 6800 trainer was abandoned.

As recently as 2012, the MPT8080 remained in academic use at [[King's College London]], as part of a course in practical physics.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011}}, the MPT8080 was still available for sale.

=== MPT8080 Version 1 ===
The initial version of the MPT8080 was designed by Dr. Ravi Raizada, the chief executive officer of Limrose Electronics.  It was first marketed in 1977.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Details of version 1 of the microtutor are included in the book : Small Systems Computer Sourcebook, author: J C Boonham&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version used eight binary switches and a load button for program entry.

=== MPT8080 Version 2 ===
The second version of the MPT8080, introduced around 1980,{{When|date=March 2011}} replaced the binary switch input with a 16-key hexadecimal keypad.  Although more than half of the trainer's circuitry was redesigned for this version, it remained compatible with the first version. A trace mode was added to allow single-cycle execution as well as machine cycles; this allowed the user to quickly step through code until reaching the portion of the program in which the user was interested. Latest UK price £495+vat (source: Limrose U.K.Price List 1st Sept 2010).

== Operating the MPT8080 ==
Programs are entered in the MPT8080 in data entry mode ("MMLE").  Each byte of the program is entered, either by toggling the binary switches and pressing the load button, or by entering the byte on the hexadecimal keypad.  The program can then be executed.

The program can control the eight output port lines, turning the associated LEDs on or off.

By selecting single-step and single-cycle mode and stepping through a program with the step button, the user can see exactly what happens during every [[instruction cycle]], observing the program counter, data bus and control signals on their corresponding LEDs.

By selecting single-instruction mode, rather than single-cycle mode, each press of the step button will execute a complete instruction, rather than a single cycle.  This is useful for quickly advancing to a specific address.

The input/output ports can be used to read external signals and drive [[output device]]s like motors and buzzers with little or no additional hardware.

The system is programmed directly in 8080 [[machine code]]:
&lt;pre&gt;
Address       Code           Instruction                     Comments
0000          DB 00          IN  0                           Read from switches
0002          D3 00          OUT 0                           write to LEDs
0004          C3 00 00       JMP 0                           return to start of code
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Wiki-mam-intcs.png|thumb|right|An illustration of mammary intercourse]]
&lt;!-- If you don't like the above image - create a suitable replacement. --&gt;
'''Mammary intercourse''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sex act]], performed as either [[foreplay]] or as [[non-penetrative sex]], that involves the stimulation of the male [[Human penis|penis]] by the female [[breast]]s and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Alex Comfort 1972 p. 67-9"&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1972) p. 67-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Mammary intercourse involves the male placing his [[Erection|erect]] penis in the female's [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]], then starting to rub or [[pelvic thrust|thrust]] between her breasts, while the breasts are squeezed around the penile shaft, creating a tight area for stimulation.&lt;ref name="Alex Comfort 1972 p. 67-9"/&gt; In addition, the woman may move her breasts up and down against the penis for an additional stimulation. The act may be carried out face to face, or head to tail, with the woman recommended to be on top if she has smaller breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1972) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; When performed as a non-penetrative sex act, the act is continued until the point of [[ejaculation]] for the man.

Mammary intercourse is said by [[Alex Comfort]] to produce mutual orgasm in women with sensitive breasts (what [[Margot Anand]] terms ''local orgasms of the breast''),&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1972) p. 69 and p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margo Ananad, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and it was one of the nine substitute exercises for [[Sexual penetration|penetrative]] sexual activities, as detailed in the ''Paradis Charnels'' of 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1972) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; This act can be combined with [[fellatio]].

Since mammary intercourse is a non-penetrative sex act, the risk of passing a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) that requires direct contact between the [[mucous membranes]] and [[pre-ejaculate]] or [[semen]] is greatly reduced. [[HIV]] is among the infections that require such direct contact and is therefore very unlikely to be transmitted via mammary intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Jeffrey A.|title = Advances in HIV/AIDS education and prevention|journal=Family Relations|volume=44|issue=4|pages=345–352|date=October 1995|issn=0197-6664|jstor=584989|doi=10.2307/584989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the [[condom]] usage habits of New Zealand's [[sex worker]]s said that they offered various [[safe sex]] alternatives to [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]] to clients who refused to wear a condom. One sex worker said that mammary intercourse was one alternative used; mammary intercourse performed by a woman with large breasts felt to the client like penetrative vaginal sex.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Woods, 1996, in  Davis, pages 125-127&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammary intercourse has sometimes been considered a [[perversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Allen, ''A Textbook of Psychosexual Disorders'' (1969) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], however, considered such extensions of sexual interest to fall within the range of the normal, unless marked out by exclusivity (i.e. the repudiation of all other forms of sexual contact).&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 65 and p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slang terms==
Mammary intercourse is known as ''titty-fucking'', ''titfuck'', ''titjob'' or ''boob job'' in the United States, as well as ''tit wank'' or ''French fuck'' in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name=french&gt;Godson, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; - the latter term dating back to the 1930s; while a more jocular equivalent is ''a trip down mammary lane''.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Morton, ''The Lover's Tongue'' (2003) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese [[sex industry]] uses the term ''paizuri''. ''Paizuri'' in the [[Japanese writing system]] is パイズリ with the first part パイ being from the word おっぱい (pronounced as ''oppai'') which is a slang word for breast, and the second part ズリ being from the word 擦り (pronounced as ''zuri'') which means "rub".&lt;ref&gt;Bacarr, 2004, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, 1992, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mircea Eliade''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈmirt͡ʃe̯a eliˈade|lang}}; {{OldStyleDate|March 9|1907|February 24}} – April 22, 1986) was a [[Romania]]n historian of religion, fiction writer, philosopher, and professor at the [[University of Chicago]]. He was a leading interpreter of religious experience, who established [[paradigm]]s in religious studies that persist to this day. His theory that ''[[Hierophany|hierophanies]]'' form the basis of religion, splitting the human experience of reality into [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and profane]] space and time, has proved influential.&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most influential contributions to religious studies was his theory of [[Eternal Return (Eliade)|''Eternal Return'']], which holds that myths and rituals do not simply commemorate hierophanies, but, at least to the minds of the religious, actually participate in them.&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"/&gt;

His literary works belong to the [[fantastic]] and [[Autobiographical novel|autobiographical]] genres. The best known are the novels ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]'' ("La Nuit [[Bengal]]i" or "Bengal Nights"), ''[[Noaptea de Sânziene]]'' ("The Forbidden Forest"), ''Isabel și apele diavolului'' ("Isabel and the Devil's Waters") and ''[[Romanul Adolescentului Miop]]'' ("Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent"), the [[novella]]s ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'' ("Miss Christina") and ''[[Youth Without Youth (novella)|Tinerețe fără tinerețe]]'' ("Youth Without Youth"), and the short stories ''[[Secretul doctorului Honigberger]]'' ("The Secret of Dr. Honigberger") and ''[[La Țigănci]]'' ("With the Gypsy Girls").

Early in his life, Eliade was a journalist and essayist, a disciple of Romanian [[far-right]] philosopher and journalist [[Nae Ionescu]], and a member of the literary society ''Criterion''. In the 1940s, he served as cultural attaché to the United Kingdom and Portugal. Several times during the late 1930s, Eliade publicly expressed his support for the [[Iron Guard]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] political organization. His political involvement at the time, as well as his other [[Far-right politics|far right]] connections, were frequently criticised after [[World War II]].

Noted for his vast erudition, Eliade had fluent command of five languages ([[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[English language|English]]) and a reading knowledge of three others ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Sanskrit]]). He was elected a posthumous member of the [[Romanian Academy]].

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Born in [[Bucharest]], he was the son of [[Romanian Land Forces]] officer Gheorghe Eliade (whose original surname was Ieremia)&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="smihai"&gt;Silviu Mihai, [http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=3920&amp;art=8997&amp;diraut=123&amp;cHash=ae6af0be58 "A doua viaţă a lui Mircea Eliade" ("Mircea Eliade's Second Life")], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', February 6, 2006; retrieved July 31, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeana ''née'' Vasilescu.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"&gt;Călinescu, p.956&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] believer, Gheorghe Eliade registered his son's birth four days before the actual date, to coincide with the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]] feast of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]].&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; Mircea Eliade had a sister, Corina, the mother of [[Semiotics|semiologist]] [[Sorin Alexandrescu]].&lt;ref name="scnostal"&gt;Simona Chiţan, "Nostalgia după România" ("Nostalgia for Romania"), interview with Sorin Alexandrescu, in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', June 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; His family moved between [[Tecuci]] and Bucharest, ultimately settling in the capital in 1914,&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; and purchasing a house on Melodiei Street, near [[Piața Rosetti]], where Mircea Eliade resided until late in his teens.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"&gt;Sergio Vila-Sanjuán, [http://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20070530/51355796343/paseo-por-el-bucarest-de-mircea-eliade.html "Paseo por el Bucarest de Mircea Eliade" ("Passing through Mircea Eliade's Bucharest")], in ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', May 30, 2007 {{es icon}}; retrieved January 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade kept a particularly fond memory of his childhood and, later in life, wrote about the impact various unusual episodes and encounters had on his mind. In one instance during the [[World War I]] [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Romanian Campaign]], when Eliade was about ten years of age, he witnessed the bombing of Bucharest by [[German Empire|German]] [[zeppelin]]s and the [[Patriotism|patriotic]] fervor in the occupied capital at news that Romania was able to stop the [[Central Powers]]' advance into [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"&gt;[[Ion Hadârcă]], [http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20070428/article_3/ "Mircea Eliade la începuturi" ("Mircea Eliade at His Beginnings")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108070458/http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20070428/article_3/ |date=2007-11-08 }}, in ''Revista Sud-Est'', 1/2007; retrieved January 21, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He described this stage in his life as marked by an unrepeatable [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]].&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"&gt;[[Ioan P. Culianu]], "Mahaparanirvana", in [http://www.elhilodeariadna.org/index.asp ''El Hilo de Ariadna''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230010917/http://www.elhilodeariadna.org/index.asp |date=2007-12-30 }}, Vol. II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Ellwood98-99&gt;Ellwood, p.98–99&lt;/ref&gt; Recalling his entrance into a drawing room that an "eerie iridescent light" had turned into "a fairy-tale palace", he wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I practiced for many years [the] exercise of recapturing that epiphanic moment, and I would always find again the same plenitude. I would slip into it as into a fragment of time devoid of duration—without beginning, middle, or end. During my last years of lycée, when I struggled with profound attacks of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], I still succeeded at times in returning to the golden green light of that afternoon. [...] But even though the beatitude was the same, it was now impossible to bear because it aggravated my sadness too much. By this time I knew the world to which the drawing room belonged [...] was a world forever lost.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Autobiography'', in Ellwood, p.98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Robert Ellwood, a professor of religion who did his graduate studies under Mircea Eliade,&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; saw this type of [[nostalgia]] as one of the most characteristic themes in Eliade's life and academic writings.&lt;ref name = Ellwood98-99&gt;Ellwood, p.98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence and literary debut===
After completing his primary education at the school on Mântuleasa Street,&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; Eliade attended the [[Spiru Haret National College]] in the same class as [[Arșavir Acterian]], [[Haig Acterian]], and [[Petre Viforeanu]] (and several years the senior of [[Nicolae Steinhardt]], who eventually became a close friend of Eliade's).&lt;ref name="Steinhardt, in Handoca"&gt;Steinhardt, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; Among his other colleagues was future philosopher [[Constantin Noica]]&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; and Noica's friend, future art historian [[Barbu Brezianu]].&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Marinescu, [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2004-03-13/%E2%80%9CAm+luat+din+intamplarile+vietii+tot+ce+este+mai+frumos%E2%80%9D,+spune+cercetatorul+operei+brancusiene " 'Am luat din întâmplarile vieţii tot ce este mai frumos', spune cercetatorul operei brâncuşiene" (" 'I Took the Best Out of Life's Occurrences', Says Researcher of Brancusi's Work")], interview with [[Barbu Brezianu]], in ''[[Curierul Naţional]]'', March 13, 2004; retrieved February 22, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Eliade was fascinated with the natural world, which formed the setting of his very first literary attempts,&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; as well as with [[Romanian folklore]] and the [[Christianity|Christian]] faith as expressed by peasants.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Growing up, he aimed to find and record what he believed was the common source of all religious traditions.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; The young Eliade's interest in physical exercise and adventure led him to pursue [[mountaineering]] and [[sailing]],&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; and he also joined the [[Cercetaşii României|Romanian Boy Scouts]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Vlădescu, "100 de ani de cercetaşi" ("100 Years of Scouting"), in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', August 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

With a group of friends, he designed and sailed a boat on the [[Danube]], from [[Tulcea]] to the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Roman, ''Continental Drift: Colliding Continents, Converging Cultures'', [[CRC Press]], [[Institute of Physics Publishing]], Bristol and Philadelphia, 2000, p.60 {{ISBN|0-7503-0686-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Eliade grew estranged from the educational environment, becoming disenchanted with the discipline required and obsessed with the idea that he was uglier and less virile than his colleagues.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; In order to cultivate his willpower, he would force himself to swallow insects&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; and only slept four to five hours a night.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; At one point, Eliade was failing four subjects, among which was the study of the [[Romanian language]].&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;

Instead, he became interested in [[natural science]] and [[chemistry]], as well as the [[occult]],&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; and wrote short pieces on [[Entomology|entomological]] subjects.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Despite his father's concern that he was in danger of losing his already weak eyesight, Eliade read passionately.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; One of his favorite authors was [[Honoré de Balzac]], whose work he studied carefully.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Eliade also became acquainted with the [[Modernism|modernist]] short stories of [[Giovanni Papini]] and [[social anthropology]] studies by [[James George Frazer]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

His interest in the two writers led him to learn [[Italian language|Italian]] and English in private, and he also began studying [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; At the time, Eliade became acquainted with [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]]'s poems and the ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; He was also interested in philosophy—studying, among others, [[Socrates]], [[Vasile Conta]], and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Epictetus]], and read works of history—the two Romanian historians who influenced him from early on were [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] and [[Nicolae Iorga]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; His first published work was the 1921 ''Inamicul viermelui de mătase'' ("The Silkworm's Enemy"),&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; followed by ''Cum am găsit piatra filosofală'' ("How I Found the [[Philosopher's stone|Philosophers' Stone]]").&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Four years later, Eliade completed work on his debut volume, the autobiographical ''[[Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent]]''.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

===University studies and Indian sojourn===

[[File:Mircea Eliade young.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Eliade in 1933]]
Between 1925 and 1928, he attended the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Philosophy and Letters in 1928, earning his diploma with a study on Early Modern [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher [[Tommaso Campanella]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; In 1927, Eliade traveled to Italy, where he met Papini&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; and collaborated with the scholar [[Giuseppe Tucci]].

It was during his student years that Eliade met [[Nae Ionescu]], who lectured in [[Logic]], becoming one of his disciples and friends.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.954, 955; Nastasă, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; He was especially attracted to Ionescu's radical ideas and his interest in religion, which signified a break with the [[Rationalism|rationalist]] tradition represented by senior academics such as [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], [[Dimitrie Gusti]], and [[Tudor Vianu]] (all of whom owed inspiration to the defunct literary society ''[[Junimea]]'', albeit in varying degrees).&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;

Eliade's scholarly works began after a long period of study in [[British India]], at the [[University of Calcutta]]. Finding that the [[Maharaja]] of [[Kassimbazar]] sponsored [[Europe]]an scholars to study in India, Eliade applied and was granted an allowance for four years, which was later doubled by a Romanian [[scholarship]].&lt;ref name="Nastasă, p.237"&gt;Nastasă, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn 1928, he sailed for [[Calcutta]] to study [[Sanskrit]] and philosophy under [[Surendranath Dasgupta]], a [[Bengal]]i [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge alumnus]] and professor at Calcutta University, the author of a five volume ''History of Indian Philosophy''. Before reaching the [[Indian subcontinent]], Eliade also made a brief visit to [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; Once there, he visited large areas of the region, and spent a short period at a [[Himalaya]]n ''[[ashram]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, p.150; Nastasă, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied the basics of [[Indian philosophy]], and, in parallel, learned Sanskrit, [[Pali]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] under Dasgupta's direction.&lt;ref name="Nastasă, p.237"/&gt; At the time, he also became interested in the actions of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], whom he met personally,&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"&gt;Kelley L. Ross, [http://www.friesian.com/eliade.htm ''Mircea Eliade''], on [http://www.friesian.com/ friesian.com]; retrieved July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Satyagraha]]'' as a phenomenon; later, Eliade adapted Gandhian ideas in his discourse on spirituality and Romania.&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"/&gt;

In 1930, while living with Dasgupta, Eliade fell in love with his host's daughter, [[Maitreyi Devi]], later writing a barely disguised autobiographical novel ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]'' (also known as "La Nuit Bengali" or "Bengal Nights"), in which he claimed that he carried on a physical relationship with her.&lt;ref name="kamani"&gt;Ginu Kamani, [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/143651.html "A Terrible Hurt: The Untold Story behind the Publishing of Maitreyi Devi"], at the University of Chicago Press website; retrieved July 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade received his [[PhD]] in 1933, with a thesis on [[Yoga]] practices.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca; Nastasă, p.237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ribas"&gt;Albert Ribas, "Mircea Eliade, historiador de las religiones" ("Mircea Eliade, Historian of Religions"), in ''El Ciervo. Revista de pensamiento y cultura'', Año 49, Núm. 588 (Marzo 2000), p.35–38&lt;/ref&gt; The book, which was translated into [[French language|French]] three years later,&lt;ref name="Nastasă, p.237"/&gt; had significant impact in academia, both in Romania and abroad.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

He later recalled that the book was an early step for understanding not just Indian religious practices, but also Romanian spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Nastasă, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, Eliade began a correspondence with the [[Sri Lanka|Ceylonese]]-born philosopher [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"&gt;McGuire, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936–1937, he functioned as honorary assistant for Ionescu's course, lecturing in [[Metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.442; Ornea, p.452&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Mircea Eliade had a physical relationship with the actress Sorana Țopa, while falling in love with Nina Mareș, whom he ultimately married.&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"&gt;[[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=16282&amp;print=true "Jurnalul unui om mare" ("The Diary of A Big Man")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 338, September 2006; retrieved January 23, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, introduced to him by his new friend [[Mihail Sebastian]], already had a daughter, Giza, from a man who had divorced her.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Eliade subsequently adopted Giza,&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"&gt;Şora, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; and the three of them moved to an apartment at 141 [[Dacia Boulevard]].&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; He left his residence in 1936, during a trip he made to the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]], when he first visited [[London]], [[Oxford]] and [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;

===''Criterion'' and ''Cuvântul''===
[[File:Casa lui Eliade.jpg|thumb|250px|Eliade's home in [[Bucharest]] (1934–1940)]]
After contributing various and generally polemical pieces in university magazines, Eliade came to the attention of journalist [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], who invited him to collaborate on the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] paper ''[[Cuvântul]]'', which was noted for its harsh tones.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; By then, ''Cuvântul'' was also hosting articles by Ionescu.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;

As one of the figures in the ''[[Criterion (literary society)|Criterion]]'' [[literary society]] (1933–1934), Eliade's initial encounter with the traditional [[far right]] was polemical: the group's conferences were stormed by members of [[A. C. Cuza]]'s [[National-Christian Defense League]], who objected to what they viewed as [[pacifism]] and addressed [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] insults to several speakers, including Sebastian;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.150–151, 153&lt;/ref&gt; in 1933, he was among the signers of a manifesto opposing [[Nazi Germany]]'s state-enforced [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.174–175&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, at a time when Sebastian was publicly insulted by Nae Ionescu, who prefaced his book (''De două mii de ani...'') with thoughts on the "eternal damnation" of Jews, Mircea Eliade spoke out against this perspective, and commented that Ionescu's references to the verdict "[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|Outside the Church there is no salvation]]" contradicted the notion of God's [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1934, in Ornea, p.408; see also Ellwood, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; However, he contended that Ionescu's text was not evidence of antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1934, in Ornea, p.408–409&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, reflecting on the early history of the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]] and its [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish community]], he deplored the expulsion of Jewish savants from Romanian soil, making specific references to [[Moses Gaster]], [[Heimann Hariton Tiktin]] and [[Lazăr Șăineanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1936, in Ornea, p.410&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade's views at the time focused on innovation—in the summer of 1933, he replied to an anti-[[Modernism|modernist]] critique written by [[George Călinescu]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;All I wish for is a deep change, a complete transformation. But, for God's sake, in any direction other than [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1933, in Ornea, p.167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He and friends [[Emil Cioran]] and [[Constantin Noica]] were by then under the influence of [[Trăirism]], a school of thought that was formed around the ideals expressed by Ionescu.

Like Mihail Sebastian, who was himself becoming influenced by Ionescu, he maintained contacts with intellectuals from all sides of the political spectrum: their entourage included the right-wing [[Dan Botta]] and [[Mircea Vulcănescu]], the non-political Petrescu and [[Ionel Jianu]], and [[Belu Zilber]], who was a member of the illegal [[Romanian Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="tanasezilber2"&gt;[[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=569&amp;nr=2003-08-18 "Belu Zilber", Part II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010402/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2003-08-18&amp;art=569 |date=2007-09-27 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 701, August 2003; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the intellectuals who attended his lectures were [[Mihai Şora]] (whom he deemed his favorite student), [[Eugen Schileru]] and [[Miron Constantinescu]]—known later as, respectively, a philosopher, an art critic, and a sociologist and political figure of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; [[Mariana Şora|Mariana Klein]], who became Șora's wife, was one of Eliade's female students, and later authored works on his scholarship.&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt;

Eliade later recounted that he had himself enlisted Zilber as a ''Cuvântul'' contributor, in order for him to provide a [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspective on the issues discussed by the journal.&lt;ref name="tanasezilber2"/&gt; Their relation soured in 1935, when the latter publicly accused Eliade of serving as an agent for the secret police, ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' (Sebastian answered to the statement by alleging that Zilber was himself a secret agent, and the latter eventually retracted his claim).&lt;ref name="tanasezilber2"/&gt;

===1930s political transition===
Eliade's articles before and after his adherence to the principles of the [[Iron Guard]] (or, as it was usually known at the time, the ''Legionary Movement''), beginning with his ''Itinerar spiritual'' ("Spiritual Itinerary", serialized in ''Cuvântul'' in 1927), center on several political ideals advocated by the far right.

They displayed his rejection of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberalism]] and the [[Modernization|modernizing]] goals of the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]] (perceived as "an abstract apology of Mankind"&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1933, in Ornea, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and "ape-like imitation of [Western] Europe"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1936, in Ornea, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for [[democracy]] itself (accusing it of "managing to crush all attempts at national renaissance",&lt;ref name = "Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.53"&gt;Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and later praising [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] on the grounds that, according to Eliade, "[in Italy,] he who thinks for himself is promoted to the highest office in the shortest of times").&lt;ref name="Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.53"/&gt; He approved of an [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] state centered on the Orthodox Church (in 1927, despite his still-vivid interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], he recommended young [[intellectual]]s "the return to the Church"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1927, in Ornea, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; which he opposed to, among others, the [[Secularism|secular]] nationalism of [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]];&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1935, in Ornea, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; referring to this particular ideal as "Romanianism", Eliade was, in 1934, still viewing it as "neither fascism, nor [[chauvinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1934, in Ornea, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade was especially dissatisfied with the incidence of unemployment among intellectuals, whose careers in state-financed institutions had been rendered uncertain by the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1933, in Ornea, pp. 178, 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Eliade was the focus of a campaign in the far right press, being targeted for having authored "[[pornography]]" in his ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'' and ''Isabel și apele diavolului''; similar accusations were aimed at other cultural figures, including [[Tudor Arghezi]] and [[Geo Bogza]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 445–55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Assessments of Eliade's work were in sharp contrast to one another: also in 1936, Eliade accepted an award from the [[Romanian Writers' Society]], of which he had been a member since 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, pp. 525–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  In summer 1937, through an official decision which came as a result of the accusations, and despite student protests, he was stripped of his position at the University.&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p. 86; Ornea, pp. 452–53; Şora, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade decided to sue the [[Minister of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Ministry of Education]], asking for a symbolic compensation of 1 [[Romanian leu|leu]].&lt;ref name= "Ornea, p.453"&gt;Ornea, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; He won the trial, and regained his position as Nae Ionescu's assistant.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.453" /&gt;

Nevertheless, by 1937, he gave his intellectual support to the Iron Guard, in which he saw "a [[Christianity|Christian]] revolution aimed at creating a new Romania",&lt;ref name="Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.203"&gt;Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; and a group able "to reconcile Romania with God".&lt;ref name = "Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.203" /&gt; His articles of the time, published in Iron Guard papers such as ''Sfarmă Piatră'' and ''[[Buna Vestire]]'', contain ample praises of the movement's leaders ([[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], [[Ion Moţa]], [[Vasile Marin]], and [[Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.202–206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oscaderea"&gt;[[Ovidiu Şimonca]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=14834 "Mircea Eliade şi 'căderea în lume'" ("Mircea Eliade and 'the Descent into the World'")] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121222064543/http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=14834 |date=2012-12-22 }}, review of Florin Ţurcanu, ''Mircea Eliade.

He eventually enrolled in the ''Totul pentru Țară'' ("Everything for the Fatherland" Party), the political expression of the Iron Guard,&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.207"&gt;Ornea, p.207&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to its [[Romanian general election, 1937|1937 electoral campaign]] in [[Prahova County]]—as indicated by his inclusion on a list of party members with [[Counties of Romania|county]]-level responsibilities (published in ''Buna Vestire'').&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.207"/&gt;

===Internment and diplomatic service===
The stance taken by Eliade resulted in his arrest on July 14, 1938 after a crackdown on the Iron Guard authorized by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]. At the time of his arrest, he had just interrupted a column on ''Provincia și legionarismul'' ("The Province and Legionary Ideology") in ''[[Vremea]]'', having been singled out by [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Armand Călinescu]] as an author of Iron Guard [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.208–209&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade was kept for three weeks in a cell at the ''[[Siguranţa Statului]]'' Headquarters, in an attempt to have him sign a "declaration of dissociation" with the Iron Guard, but he refused to do so.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.209"&gt;Ornea, p.209&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of August he was transferred to a makeshift camp at [[Miercurea-Ciuc]]. When Eliade began coughing blood in October 1938, he was taken to a clinic in [[Moroeni]].&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.209"/&gt; Eliade was simply released on November 12, and subsequently spent his time writing his play ''Iphigenia'' (also known as ''Ifigenia'').&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; In April 1940, with the help of [[Alexandru Rosetti]], became the Cultural Attaché to the [[United Kingdom]], a posting cut short when Romanian-British foreign relations were broken.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.209"/&gt;

After leaving London he was assigned the office of Counsel and [[Press secretary|Press Officer]] (later Cultural Attaché) to the Romanian Embassy in [[Portugal]],&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca; Nastasă, p.442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"&gt;[[Cătălin Avramescu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=135&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=3508 "Citim una, înţelegem alta" ("We Read One Thing and Understand Another")], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. III, August 2006; retrieved January 28, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mlimpost"&gt;[[Michael Löwy]], [http://assr.revues.org/document3128.html Review of Daniel Dubuisson, ''Impostures et pseudo-science.

In 1942, Eliade authored a volume in praise of the ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'', established in Portugal by [[António de Oliveira Salazar]],&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mesalaz"&gt;Eliade, ''Salazar'', in "Eliade despre Salazar" ("Eliade on Salazar"), ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', October 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.90&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "The Salazarian state, a Christian and [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] one, is first and foremost based on love".&lt;ref name="mesalaz"/&gt; On July 7 of the same year, he was received by Salazar himself, who assigned Eliade the task of warning Antonescu to withdraw the [[Romanian Army]] from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] ("[In his place], I would not be grinding it in [[Russia]]").&lt;ref name="in Handoca"&gt;Eliade, in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade also claimed that such contacts with the leader of a neutral country had made him the target for [[Gestapo]] surveillance, but that he had managed to communicate Salazar's advice to [[Mihai Antonescu]], Romania's [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister]].&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in Handoca"/&gt;

In autumn 1943, he traveled to [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupied France]], where he rejoined [[Emil Cioran]], also meeting with scholar [[Georges Dumézil]] and the [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] writer [[Paul Morand]].&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; At the same time, he applied for a position of lecturer at the [[University of Bucharest]], but withdrew from the race, leaving [[Constantin Noica]] and [[Ion Zamfirescu]] to dispute the position, in front of a panel of academics comprising [[Lucian Blaga]] and [[Dimitrie Gusti]] (Zamfirescu's eventual selection, going against Blaga's recommendation, was to be the topic of a controversy).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă, p.442–443&lt;/ref&gt; In his private notes, Eliade wrote that he took no further interest in the office, because his visits abroad had convinced him that he had "something great to say", and that he could not function within the confines of "a minor culture".&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Also during the war, Eliade traveled to [[Berlin]], where he met and conversed with controversial political theorist [[Carl Schmitt]],&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; and frequently visited [[Spain under Franco|Francoist Spain]], where he notably attended the 1944 Lusitano-Spanish scientific congress in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jgspania"&gt;Joaquín Garrigós, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/index.php?nr=191&amp;cmd=articol&amp;id=6740 "Pasiunea lui Mircea Eliade pentru Spania" ("Mircea Eliade's Passion for Spain")], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Vol. IV, October 2007; retrieved January 21, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aoopium"&gt;[[Andrei Oişteanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2007-05-11&amp;art=3719 "Mircea Eliade, de la opium la amfetamine" ("Mircea Eliade, from Opium to Amphetamines")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516220935/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=3719&amp;nr=2007-05-11 |date=2007-05-16 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 896, May 2007; retrieved January 17, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his trips to Spain that Eliade met philosophers [[José Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Eugeni d'Ors]].

Nina Eliade fell ill with [[uterine cancer]] and died during their stay in [[Lisbon]], in late 1944. As the widower later wrote, the disease was probably caused by an [[abortion]] procedure she had undergone at an early stage of their relationship.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; He came to suffer from [[clinical depression]], which increased as Romania and her [[Axis Powers|Axis]] allies suffered major defeats on the Eastern Front.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; Contemplating a return to Romania as a soldier or a [[monk]],&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; he was on a continuous search for effective [[antidepressant]]s, medicating himself with [[passion flower]] extract, and, eventually, with [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; This was probably not his first experience with drugs: vague mentions in his notebooks have been read as indication that Mircea Eliade was taking [[opium]] during his travels to [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; Later, discussing the works of [[Aldous Huxley]], Eliade wrote that the British author's use of [[mescaline]] as a source of inspiration had something in common with his own experience, indicating 1945 as a date of reference and adding that it was "needless to explain why that is".&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt;

===Early exile===
At signs that the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]] was about to take hold, Eliade opted not to return to the country. On September 16, 1945, he moved to [[France]] with his adopted daughter Giza.&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Once there, he resumed contacts with Dumézil, who helped him recover his position in academia.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; On Dumézil's recommendation, he taught at the ''[[École Pratique des Hautes Études]]'' in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; It was estimated that, at the time, it was not uncommon for him to work 15 hours a day.&lt;ref name="ribas"/&gt; Eliade married a second time, to the Romanian exile Christinel Cotescu.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msrsotia"&gt;Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.zf.ro/articol_87328/cottestii__familia_sotiei_lui_mircea_eliade.html "Cotteştii: familia soţiei lui Mircea Eliade" ("The Cottescus: the Family of Mircea Eliade's Wife")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803223957/http://www.zf.ro/articol_87328/cottestii__familia_sotiei_lui_mircea_eliade.html |date=2008-08-03 }}, in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', June 30, 2006; retrieved January 22, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second wife, the descendant of [[boyar]]s, was the sister-in-law of the conductor [[Ionel Perlea]].&lt;ref name="msrsotia"/&gt;

Together with [[Emil Cioran]] and other Romanian expatriates, Eliade rallied with the former diplomat [[Alexandru Busuioceanu]], helping him publicize [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] opinion to the [[Western Europe]]an public.&lt;ref name="guleaobsc"&gt;Dan Gulea, [https://archive.is/20130113115235/http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=12070 "O perspectivă sintetică" ("A Syncretic Perspective")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 242, October 2004; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also briefly involved in publishing a Romanian-language magazine, titled ''Luceafărul'' ("The Morning Star"),&lt;ref name="guleaobsc"/&gt; and was again in contact with [[Mihail Șora]], who had been granted a [[scholarship]] to study in France, and with Șora's wife [[Mariana Şora|Mariana]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; In 1947, he was facing material constraints, and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] found him a job as a [[French language|French-language]] teacher in the [[United States]], at a school in [[Arizona]]; the arrangement ended upon Coomaraswamy's death in September.&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"/&gt;

Beginning in 1948, he wrote for the journal ''Critique'', edited by French philosopher  [[Georges Bataille]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; The following year, he went on a visit to Italy, where he wrote the first 300 pages of his novel ''[[Noaptea de Sânziene]]'' (he visited the country a third time in 1952).&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; He collaborated with [[Carl Jung]] and the ''[[Eranos]]'' circle after [[Henry Corbin]] recommended him in 1949,&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"/&gt; and wrote for the ''Antaios'' magazine (edited by [[Ernst Jünger]]).&lt;ref name="ribas"/&gt; In 1950, Eliade began attending ''Eranos'' conferences, meeting Jung, [[Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn]], [[Gershom Scholem]] and [[Paul Radin]].&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, p.150–151&lt;/ref&gt; He described ''Eranos'' as "one of the most creative cultural experiences of the modern Western world."&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.151"&gt;McGuire, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1956, he moved to the United States, settling in [[Chicago]] the following year.&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; He had been invited by [[Joachim Wach]] to give a series of lectures at Wach's home institution, the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.151"/&gt; Eliade and Wach are generally admitted to be the founders of the "Chicago school" that basically defined the study of religions for the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics in History"&gt;[http://marty-center.uchicago.edu/conferences/wach_eliade/about.shtml Conference on ''Hermeneutics in History: Mircea Eliade, Joachim Wach, and the Science of Religions''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211130723/http://marty-center.uchicago.edu/conferences/wach_eliade/about.shtml |date=2006-12-11 }}, at the [http://marty-center.uchicago.edu/ University of Chicago Martin Marty Center.

In 1966, Mircea Eliade became a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; He also worked as editor-in-chief of [[Macmillan Publishers]]' ''Encyclopedia of Religion'', and, in 1968, lectured in religious history at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Oişteanu, "Mircea Eliade şi mişcarea hippie"&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during that period that Mircea Eliade completed his voluminous and influential ''History of Religious Ideas'', which grouped together the overviews of his main original interpretations of religious history.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; He occasionally traveled out of the United States, such as attending the Congress for the History of Religions in [[Marburg]] (1960) and visits to [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] in 1970.&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;

===Final years and death===
Initially, Eliade was attacked with virulence by the [[Romanian Communist Party]] press, chiefly by ''[[România Liberă]]''—which described him as "the Iron Guard's ideologue, [[Enemy of the people|enemy of the working class]], apologist of Salazar's dictatorship".&lt;ref&gt;''România Liberă'', ''passim'' September–October 1944, in Frunză, p.251&lt;/ref&gt; However, the regime also made secretive attempts to enlist his and Cioran's support: [[Haig Acterian]]'s widow, theater director [[Marietta Sadova]], was sent to Paris in order to re-establish contacts with the two.&lt;ref name="tismetern"&gt;[[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], ''Stalinism pentru eternitate'' (Romanian translation of ''Stalinism for All Seasons''), [[Polirom]], Iaşi, 2005, p.187, 337. {{ISBN|973-681-899-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the move was planned by Romanian officials, her encounters were to be used as evidence incriminating her at a February 1960 trial for treason (where [[Constantin Noica]] and [[Dinu Pillat]] were the main defendants).&lt;ref name="tismetern"/&gt; Romania's secret police, the [[Securitate]], also portrayed Eliade as a spy for the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and a former agent of the Gestapo.&lt;ref name="zfscriit"&gt;Alexandru Popescu, [http://www.zf.ro/articol_109162/alexandru_popescu__ix___scriitorii_si_spionajul.html "Scriitorii şi spionajul" ("Writers and Spying")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185224/http://www.zf.ro/articol_109162/alexandru_popescu__ix___scriitorii_si_spionajul.html |date=2008-02-15 }}, in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', January 26, 2007; retrieved November 8, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unprecedented event occurred with the interview that was granted by Mircea Eliade to poet [[Adrian Păunescu]], during the latter's 1970 visit to Chicago; Eliade complimented both Păunescu's activism and his support for official tenets, expressing a belief that
&lt;blockquote&gt;the youth of Eastern Europe is clearly superior to that of Western Europe. [...] I am convinced that, within ten years, the young revolutionary generation shan't be behaving as does today the noisy minority of [[New Left|Western contesters]]. [...] Eastern youth have seen the abolition of traditional institutions, have accepted it [...] and are not yet content with the structures enforced, but rather seek to improve them.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1970, in [[Paul Cernat]], "Îmblânzitorul României Socialiste.

Păunescu's visit to Chicago was followed by those of the nationalist official writer [[Eugen Barbu]] and by Eliade's friend Constantin Noica (who had since been released from jail).&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; At the time, Eliade contemplated returning to Romania, but was eventually persuaded by fellow Romanian intellectuals in exile (including [[Radio Free Europe]]'s [[Virgil Ierunca]] and [[Monica Lovinescu]]) to reject Communist proposals.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; In 1977, he joined other exiled Romanian intellectuals in signing a telegram protesting the repressive measures newly enforced by the Ceauşescu regime.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; Writing in 2007, Romanian anthropologist [[Andrei Oișteanu]] recounted how, around 1984, the Securitate unsuccessfully pressured to become an [[agent of influence]] in Eliade's Chicago circle.&lt;ref name="teodoist"&gt;Cristian Teodorescu, [http://cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=11526&amp;art=30480&amp;cHash=19a3e7c987 "Eliade şi Culianu prin ocheanul lui Oişteanu" ("Eliade and Culianu through Oişteanu's Lens")], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', June 14, 2007; retrieved November 7, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his later years, Eliade's fascist past was progressively exposed publicly, the stress of which probably contributed to the decline of his health.&lt;ref name="smihai"/&gt; By then, his writing career was hampered by severe [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; The last academic honors bestowed upon him were the [[Académie française|French Academy]]'s [[Bordin Prize]] (1977) and the title of ''[[Honorary degree|Doctor Honoris Causa]]'', granted by the [[University of Washington]] (1985).&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt;

Mircea Eliade died at the [[Bernard Mitchell Hospital]] in April 1986.

==Work==

===The general nature of religion===
In his work on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly regarded for his writings on [[Alchemy]],&lt;ref&gt;'Eliade offers a theoretical background for understanding alchemy from the perspective of  the history of  religion. Alchemy is a spiritual technique and can be understood not as an important moment in the history of  science but rather as a kind of  religious phenomenon with its own particular rules.' {{Cite book|last = Calian |first = George Florin |title = Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa. Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy | url=https://archive.org/stream/AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnThe/FlorinGeorgeCalian-AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnTheHistoriographyOfAlchemy#page/n0/mode/2up | publisher = Annual of Medieval Studies at CEU |location = Budapest|year = 2010 |page = 169}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shamanism]], [[Yoga]] and what he called the [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]]—the implicit belief, supposedly present in religious thought in general, that [[Religious behaviour|religious behavior]] is not only an imitation of, but also a participation in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins. Eliade's thinking was in part influenced by [[Rudolf Otto]], [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]], [[Nae Ionescu]] and the writings of the [[Traditionalist School]] ([[René Guénon]] and [[Julius Evola]]).&lt;ref name="pccheie"/&gt; For instance, Eliade's ''The Sacred and the Profane'' partially builds on Otto's ''[[Numinous|The Idea of the Holy]]'' to show how religion emerges from the experience of the sacred, and myths of time and nature.

Eliade is known for his attempt to find broad, cross-cultural parallels and unities in religion, particularly in myths. [[Wendy Doniger]], Eliade's colleague from 1978 until his death, has observed that "Eliade argued boldly for universals where he might more safely have argued for widely prevalent patterns".&lt;ref&gt;Doniger's foreword to Eliade's ''Shamanism'' (Princeton University Press edition, 1972, p.xii)&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Treatise on the History of Religions'' was praised by French philologist [[Georges Dumézil]] for its coherence and ability to synthesize diverse and distinct mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Dumézil, "Introducere", in Eliade, ''Tratat de istorie a religiilor: Introducere'' ("Religious History Treatise" – ''Patterns in Comparative Religion''), [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Ellwood describes Eliade's approach to religion as follows. Eliade approaches religion by imagining an ideally "religious" person, whom he calls ''homo religiosus'' in his writings. Eliade's theories basically describe how this ''homo religiosus'' would view the world.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.99"&gt;Ellwood, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that all religious practitioners actually think and act like ''homo religiosus''. Instead, it means that religious behavior "says through its own language" that the world is as ''homo religiosus'' would see it, whether or not the real-life participants in religious behavior are aware of it.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.104"&gt;Ellwood, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ellwood writes that Eliade "tends to slide over that last qualification", implying that traditional societies actually thought like ''homo religiosus''.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.104"/&gt;

====Sacred and profane====
[[File:Mosesshoesspeculum.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Moses]] taking off his shoes in front of the [[burning bush]] (illustration from a 16th-century edition of the ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'').]]
Eliade argues that "Yahweh is both kind and wrathful; the God of the Christian mystics and theologians is terrible and gentle at once".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that the Indian and [[China|Chinese]] mystic tried to attain "a state of perfect indifference and neutrality" that resulted in a coincidence of opposites in which "pleasure and pain, desire and repulsion, cold and heat [...] are expunged from his awareness".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"/&gt;

Eliade's understanding of religion centers on his concept of [[hierophany]] (manifestation of the Sacred)—a concept that includes, but is not limited to, the older and more restrictive concept of [[theophany]] (manifestation of a god).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.20–22; ''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of religious thought, Eliade argues, hierophanies give structure and orientation to the world, establishing a sacred order. The "profane" space of nonreligious experience can only be divided up geometrically: it has no "qualitative differentiation and, hence, no orientation [is] given by virtue of its inherent structure".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.22"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, profane space gives man no pattern for his behavior. In contrast to profane space, the site of a hierophany has a sacred structure to which religious man conforms himself. A hierophany amounts to a "revelation of an absolute reality, opposed to the non-reality of the vast surrounding expanse".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.21"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.21&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of "[[hierotopy|sacred space]]" demanding a certain response from man, Eliade gives the story of [[Moses]] halting before [[Yahweh]]'s manifestation as a [[burning bush]] (''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'' 3:5) and taking off his shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

====Origin myths and sacred time====
Eliade notes that, in traditional societies, myth represents the absolute truth about primordial time.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.23"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.23&lt;/ref&gt; According to the myths, this was the time when the Sacred first appeared, establishing the world's structure—myths claim to describe the primordial events that made society and the natural world be that which they are. Eliade argues that all myths are, in that sense, origin myths: "myth, then, is always an account of a ''creation''".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional societies believe that the power of a thing lies in its origin.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt; If origin is equivalent to power, then "it is the first manifestation of a thing that is significant and valid"&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt; (a thing's reality and value therefore lies only in its first appearance).

According to Eliade's theory, only the Sacred has value, only a thing's first appearance has value and, therefore, only the Sacred's first appearance has value. Myth describes the Sacred's first appearance; therefore, the mythical age is sacred time,&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.23"/&gt; the only time of value: "primitive man was interested only in the ''beginnings'' [...] to him it mattered little what had happened to himself, or to others like him, in more or less distant times".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.44"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade postulated this as the reason for the "[[nostalgia]] for origins" that appears in many religions, the desire to return to a primordial [[Paradise]].&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.44"/&gt;

====Eternal return and "Terror of history"====
{{Main|Eternal return (Eliade)}}
Eliade argues that traditional man attributes no value to the linear march of historical events: only the events of the mythical age have value. To give his own life value, traditional man performs myths and rituals. Because the Sacred's essence lies only in the mythical age, only in the Sacred's first appearance, any later appearance is actually the first appearance; by recounting or re-enacting mythical events, myths and rituals "re-actualize" those events.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade often uses the term "[[archetype]]s" to refer to the mythical models established by the Sacred, although Eliade's use of the term should be distinguished from the use of the term in [[Jungian psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Leeming, "Archetypes"&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, argues Eliade, religious behavior does not only commemorate, but also participates in, sacred events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ''imitating'' the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythical hero, or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.23"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliade called this concept the "[[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]]" (distinguished from the [[Eternal return|philosophical concept of "eternal return"]]). Wendy Doniger noted that Eliade's theory of the eternal return "has become a truism in the study of religions".&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"/&gt;

Eliade attributes the well-known "cyclic" vision of time in ancient thought to belief in the eternal return. For instance, the [[New Year]] ceremonies among the [[Mesopotamia]]ns, the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], and other [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]] peoples re-enacted their [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic]] myths. Therefore, by the logic of the eternal return, each New Year ceremony ''was'' the beginning of the world for these peoples. According to Eliade, these peoples felt a need to return to the Beginning at regular intervals, turning time into a circle.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality, p.47–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that yearning to remain in the mythical age causes a "terror of history": traditional man desires to escape the linear succession of events (which, Eliade indicated, he viewed as empty of any inherent value or sacrality). Eliade suggests that the abandonment of mythical thought and the full acceptance of linear, historical time, with its "terror", is one of the reasons for modern man's anxieties.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', Chapter 4; ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.231–245&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional societies escape this anxiety to an extent, as they refuse to completely acknowledge historical time.

====''Coincidentia oppositorum''====
Eliade claims that many myths, rituals, and mystical experiences involve a "coincidence of opposites", or ''[[coincidentia oppositorum]]''. In fact, he calls the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' "the mythical pattern".&lt;ref&gt;In ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'' (p.419), Eliade gives a section about the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' the title "Coincidentia Oppositorum—THE MYTHICAL PATTERN". Beane and Doty chose to retain this title when excerpting this section in ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'' (p. 449).&lt;/ref&gt; Many myths, Eliade notes, "present us with a twofold revelation":
&lt;blockquote&gt;they express on the one hand the diametrical opposition of two divine figures sprung from one and the same principle and destined, in many versions, to be reconciled at some ''illud tempus'' of eschatology, and on the other, the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' in the very nature of the divinity, which shows itself, by turns or even simultaneously, benevolent and terrible, creative and destructive, solar and serpentine, and so on (in other words, actual and potential).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 449&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eliade argues that "Yahweh is both kind and wrathful; the God of the Christian mystics and theologians is terrible and gentle at once".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"/&gt; He also thought that the Indian and Chinese mystic tried to attain "a state of perfect indifference and neutrality" that resulted in a coincidence of opposites in which "pleasure and pain, desire and repulsion, cold and heat [...] are expunged from his awareness".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.450"/&gt;

According to Eliade, the ''coincidentia oppositorum''’s appeal lies in "man's deep dissatisfaction with his actual situation, with what is called the human condition".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.439"/&gt; In many mythologies, the end of the mythical age involves a "fall", a fundamental "[[Ontology|ontological]] change in the structure of the World".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.440"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; Because the ''coincidentia oppositorum'' is a contradiction, it represents a denial of the world's current logical structure, a reversal of the "fall".

Also, traditional man's dissatisfaction with the post-mythical age expresses itself as a feeling of being "torn and separate".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.439"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', p. 439&lt;/ref&gt; In many mythologies, the lost mythical age was a Paradise, "a paradoxical state in which the contraries exist side by side without conflict, and the multiplications form aspects of a mysterious Unity".&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.440"/&gt; The ''coincidentia oppositorum'' expresses a wish to recover the lost unity of the mythical Paradise, for it presents a reconciliation of opposites and the unification of diversity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the level of pre-systematic thought, the mystery of totality embodies man's endeavor to reach a perspective in which the contraries are abolished, the Spirit of Evil reveals itself as a stimulant of Good, and Demons appear as the night aspect of the Gods.&lt;ref name="Eliade Myths p.440"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Exceptions to the general nature===
[[File:Meister von Torcello 001.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[Last Judgment]] (detail) in the 12th century [[Byzantine art|Byzantine mosaic]] at [[Torcello]].]]
Eliade acknowledges that not all religious behavior has all the attributes described in his theory of sacred time and the eternal return. The [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Islam|Muslim]] traditions embrace linear, historical time as sacred or capable of sanctification, while some [[Eastern religions|Eastern traditions]] largely reject the notion of sacred time, seeking escape from the [[wheel of time|cycles of time]].

Because they contain rituals, Judaism and Christianity necessarily—Eliade argues—retain a sense of cyclic time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''by the very fact that it is a religion'', Christianity had to keep at least one mythical aspect—[[Liturgy|liturgical]] Time, that is, the periodic rediscovery of the ''illud tempus'' of the beginnings [and] an ''imitation'' of the [[Christ]] as ''exemplary pattern''.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Judaism and Christianity do not see time as a circle endlessly turning on itself; nor do they see such a cycle as desirable, as a way to participate in the Sacred. Instead, these religions embrace the concept of linear history progressing toward the [[Messianic Age]] or the [[Last Judgment]], thus initiating the idea of "progress" (humans are to work for a Paradise in the future).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 64–65, 169&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eliade's understanding of Judaeo-Christian [[eschatology]] can also be understood as cyclical in that the "end of time" is a return to God: "The final catastrophe will put an end to history, hence will restore man to eternity and beatitude".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-[[Islam]]ic [[Persian Empire|Persian]] religion of Zoroastrianism, which made a notable "contribution to the religious formation of the West",&lt;ref name="Eliade v.1 p.302"&gt;Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; also has a linear sense of time. According to Eliade, the Hebrews had a linear sense of time before being influenced by Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref name="Eliade v.1 p.302"/&gt; In fact, Eliade identifies the Hebrews, not the Zoroastrians, as the first culture to truly "valorize" historical time, the first to see all major historical events as episodes in a continuous divine revelation.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''A History of Religious Ideas'', vol. 1, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eliade argues, Judaism elaborated its mythology of linear time by adding elements borrowed from Zoroastrianism—including [[Dualistic cosmology#Moral dualism|ethical dualism]], a savior figure, the future resurrection of the body, and the idea of cosmic progress toward "the final triumph of Good".&lt;ref name="Eliade v.1 p.302"/&gt;

The [[Indian religions]] of the East generally retain a cyclic view of time—for instance, the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] doctrine of ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpas]]''. According to Eliade, most religions that accept the cyclic view of time also embrace it: they see it as a way to return to the sacred time. However, in [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and some forms of Hinduism, the Sacred lies outside the flux of the material world (called ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]'', or "illusion"), and one can only reach it by escaping from the cycles of time.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Sacred lies outside cyclic time, which conditions humans, people can only reach the Sacred by escaping the [[human condition]]. According to Eliade, [[Yoga]] techniques aim at escaping the limitations of the body, allowing the soul (''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') to rise above ''maya'' and reach the Sacred (''[[nirvana]]'', ''[[moksha]]''). Imagery of "freedom", and of death to one's old body and rebirth with a new body, occur frequently in Yogic texts, representing escape from the bondage of the temporal human condition.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols'', Volume 2, p.312–14&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade discusses these themes in detail in ''Yoga: Immortality and Freedom''.

===Symbolism of the Center===
{{Main|Axis mundi}}
[[File:AM 738 4to Yggdrasill.png|thumb|150px|The [[World Tree|Cosmic Tree]] ''[[Yggdrasill]]'', as depicted in a 17th-century [[Iceland]]ic miniature.]]
A recurrent theme in Eliade's myth analysis is the ''[[axis mundi]]'', the Center of the World. According to Eliade, the Cosmic Center is a necessary corollary to the division of reality into the Sacred and the profane. The Sacred contains all value, and the world gains purpose and meaning only through hierophanies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the homogeneous and infinite expanse, in which no point of reference is possible and hence no orientation is established, the [[hierophany]] reveals an absolute fixed point, a center.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.21"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because profane space gives man no orientation for his life, the Sacred must manifest itself in a hierophany, thereby establishing a sacred site around which man can orient himself. The site of a hierophany establishes a "fixed point, a center".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; This Center abolishes the "homogeneity and relativity of profane space",&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.22"/&gt; for it becomes "the central axis for all future orientation".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.21"/&gt;

A manifestation of the Sacred in profane space is, by definition, an example of something breaking through from one plane of existence to another. Therefore, the initial hierophany that establishes the Center must be a point at which there is contact between different planes—this, Eliade argues, explains the frequent mythical imagery of a [[World Tree|Cosmic Tree]] or Pillar joining Heaven, Earth, and the [[underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.259–260&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade noted that, when traditional societies found a new territory, they often perform consecrating rituals that reenact the hierophany that established the Center and founded the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.32–36&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the designs of traditional buildings, especially temples, usually imitate the mythical image of the ''axis mundi'' joining the different cosmic levels. For instance, the [[Babylon]]ian [[ziggurat]]s were built to resemble cosmic mountains passing through the heavenly spheres, and the rock of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] was supposed to reach deep into the ''[[tehom]]'', or primordial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.40, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the logic of the [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]], the site of each such symbolic Center will actually be the Center of the World:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be said, in general, that the majority of the sacred and ritual trees that we meet with in the history of religions are only replicas, imperfect copies of this exemplary archetype, the Cosmic Tree. Thus, all these sacred trees are thought of as situated at the Centre of the World, and all the ritual trees or posts [...] are, as it were, magically projected into the Centre of the World.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Eliade's interpretation, religious man apparently feels the need to live not only near, but ''at'', the mythical Center as much as possible, given that the Center is the point of communication with the Sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Eliade argues, many traditional societies share common outlines in their mythical [[geography|geographies]]. In the middle of the known world is the sacred Center, "a place that is sacred above all";&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.39&lt;/ref&gt; this Center anchors the established order.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.22"/&gt; Around the sacred Center lies the known world, the realm of established order; and beyond the known world is a chaotic and dangerous realm, "peopled by ghosts, demons, [and] 'foreigners' (who are [identified with] demons and the souls of the dead)".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.29&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, traditional societies place their known world at the Center because (from their perspective) their known world is the realm that obeys a recognizable order, and it therefore must be the realm in which the Sacred manifests itself; the regions beyond the known world, which seem strange and foreign, must lie far from the Center, outside the order established by the Sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', pp. 39–40; Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

===The High God===
{{See also|Sky father|Deus otiosus}}
According to some "evolutionistic" theories of religion, especially that of [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], cultures naturally progress from [[animism]] and [[polytheism]] to [[monotheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p.157, 161&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, more advanced cultures should be more monotheistic, and more primitive cultures should be more polytheistic. However, many of the most "primitive", pre-agricultural societies believe in a supreme [[Sky father|sky-god]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.93; ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.38–40, 54–58&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to Eliade, post-19th-century scholars have rejected Tylor's theory of evolution from [[animism]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p.161&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the discovery of supreme sky-gods among "primitives", Eliade suspects that the earliest humans worshiped a heavenly Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.38, 54; ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.176&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', he writes, "The most popular prayer in the world is addressed to 'Our Father who art in heaven.' It is possible that man's earliest prayers were addressed to the same heavenly father."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Eliade disagrees with [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]], who thought the earliest form of religion was a strict monotheism. Eliade dismisses this theory of "primordial monotheism" (''Urmonotheismus'') as "rigid" and unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p.162; see also Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.54–58&lt;/ref&gt; "At most," he writes, "this schema [Schmidt's theory] renders an account of human [religious] evolution since the [[Paleolithic]] era".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; If an ''Urmonotheismus'' did exist, Eliade adds, it probably differed in many ways from the conceptions of God in many modern monotheistic faiths: for instance, the primordial High God could manifest himself as an animal without losing his status as a celestial Supreme Being.&lt;ref&gt;''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p. 176–77&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, heavenly Supreme Beings are actually less common in more advanced cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.54–55&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade speculates that the discovery of agriculture brought a host of [[Fertility god|fertility gods and goddesses]] into the forefront, causing the celestial Supreme Being to fade away and eventually vanish from many ancient religions.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.138&lt;/ref&gt; Even in primitive hunter-gatherer societies, the High God is a vague, distant figure, dwelling high above the world.&lt;ref&gt;See Eliade, ''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.54–56&lt;/ref&gt; Often he has no [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] and receives [[prayer]] only as a last resort, when all else has failed.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.134–36; ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.97&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade calls the distant High God a ''[[deus otiosus]]'' ("idle god").&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

In belief systems that involve a ''deus otiosus'', the distant High God is believed to have been closer to humans during the mythical age. After finishing his works of creation, the High God "forsook the earth and withdrew into the highest heaven".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.134&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the Sacred's distance from "profane" life, life lived after the mythical age: by escaping from the profane condition through religious behavior, figures such as the [[shaman]] return to the conditions of the mythical age, which include nearness to the High God ("by his ''flight'' or ascension, the shaman [...] meets the God of Heaven face to face and speaks directly to him, as man sometimes did ''in illo tempore''").&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.66"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.66&lt;/ref&gt; The shamanistic behaviors surrounding the High God are a particularly clear example of the eternal return.

===Shamanism===

====Overview====
[[File:Schamanin während einer Kamlanie-Zeremonie am Feuer in Kysyl.jpg|thumb|260px|A [[shaman]] performing a ceremonial in [[Tuva]].]]
Eliade's scholarly work includes a study of shamanism, ''[[Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy]]'', a survey of shamanistic practices in different areas. His ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'' also addresses shamanism in some detail.

In ''Shamanism'', Eliade argues for a restrictive use of the word ''shaman'': it should not apply to just any [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]] or [[medicine man]], as that would make the term redundant; at the same time, he argues against restricting the term to the practitioners of the sacred of [[Siberia]] and [[Central Asia]] (it is from one of the titles for this function, namely, ''šamán'', considered by Eliade to be of [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] origin, that the term itself was introduced into Western languages).&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism'', p. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade defines a shaman as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;he is believed to cure, like all doctors, and to perform miracles of the [[fakir]] type, like all magicians [...] But beyond this, he is a [[psychopomp]], and he may also be a priest, [[Mysticism|mystic]], and poet.&lt;ref name="Eliade, Shamanism, p.4"&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If we define shamanism this way, Eliade claims, we find that the term covers a collection of phenomena that share a common and unique "structure" and "history".&lt;ref name="Eliade, Shamanism, p.4"/&gt; (When thus defined, shamanism tends to occur in its purest forms in [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting]] and [[Herding|pastoral]] societies like those of Siberia and Central Asia, which revere a celestial High God "on the way to becoming a ''deus otiosus''".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.6, 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade takes the shamanism of those regions as his most representative example.)

In his examinations of shamanism, Eliade emphasizes the shaman's attribute of regaining man's condition before the "Fall" out of sacred time: "The most representative mystical experience of the archaic societies, that of shamanism, betrays the ''Nostalgia for Paradise'', the desire to recover the state of freedom and beatitude before 'the Fall'."&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.66"/&gt; This concern—which, by itself, is the concern of almost all religious behavior, according to Eliade—manifests itself in specific ways in shamanism.

====Death, resurrection and secondary functions====
According to Eliade, one of the most common shamanistic themes is the shaman's supposed death and [[resurrection]]. This occurs in particular during his [[initiation]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', pp.82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the procedure is supposed to be performed by spirits who dismember the shaman and strip the flesh from his bones, then put him back together and revive him. In more than one way, this death and resurrection represents the shaman's elevation above human nature.

First, the shaman dies so that he can rise above human nature on a quite literal level. After he has been dismembered by the initiatory spirits, they often replace his old organs with new, magical ones (the shaman dies to his profane self so that he can rise again as a new, sanctified, being).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt; Second, by being reduced to his bones, the shaman experiences rebirth on a more symbolic level: in many hunting and herding societies, the bone represents the source of life, so reduction to a skeleton "is equivalent to re-entering the womb of this primordial life, that is, to a complete renewal, a mystical rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade considers this return to the source of life essentially equivalent to the eternal return.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, the shamanistic phenomenon of repeated death and resurrection also represents a transfiguration in other ways. The shaman dies not once but many times: having died during initiation and risen again with new powers, the shaman can send his spirit out of his body on errands; thus, his whole career consists of repeated deaths and resurrections. The shaman's new ability to die and return to life shows that he is no longer bound by the laws of profane time, particularly the law of death: "the ability to 'die' and come to life again [...] denotes that [the shaman] has surpassed the human condition".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Having risen above the human condition, the shaman is not bound by the flow of history. Therefore, he enjoys the conditions of the mythical age. In many myths, humans can speak with animals; and, after their initiations, many shamans claim to be able to communicate with animals. According to Eliade, this is one manifestation of the shaman's return to "the ''illud tempus'' described to us by the paradisiac myths".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.63&lt;/ref&gt;

The shaman can descend to the underworld or ascend to heaven, often by climbing the [[World Tree]], the cosmic pillar, the sacred ladder, or some other form of the ''[[axis mundi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.64&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the shaman will ascend to heaven to speak with the High God. Because the gods (particularly the High God, according to Eliade's ''deus otiosus'' concept) were closer to humans during the mythical age, the shaman's easy communication with the High God represents an abolition of history and a return to the mythical age.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.66"/&gt;

Because of his ability to communicate with the gods and descend to the land of the dead, the shaman frequently functions as a [[psychopomp]] and a [[medicine man]].&lt;ref name="Eliade, Shamanism, p.4"/&gt;

==Eliade's philosophy==

===Early contributions===
In addition to his political essays, the young Mircea Eliade authored others, philosophical in content. Connected with the ideology of [[Trăirism]], they were often prophetic in tone, and saw Eliade being hailed as a herald by various representatives of his generation.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; When Eliade was 21 years old and publishing his ''Itinerar spiritual'', literary critic [[Şerban Cioculescu]] described him as "the column leader of the spiritually mystical and [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] youth."&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Cioculescu discussed his "impressive erudition", but argued that it was "occasionally plethoric, poetically inebriating itself through abuse".&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Cioculescu's colleague [[Perpessicius]] saw the young author and his generation as marked by "the specter of war", a notion he connected to various essays of the 1920s and 30s in which Eliade threatened the world with the verdict that a new conflict was looming (while asking that young people be allowed to manifest their will and fully experience freedom before perishing).&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

One of Eliade's noted contributions in this respect was the 1932 ''Soliloquii'' ("Soliloquies"), which explored [[Existentialism|existential philosophy]]. [[George Călinescu]] who saw in it "an echo of [[Nae Ionescu]]'s lectures",&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"&gt;Călinescu, p.954&lt;/ref&gt; traced a parallel with the essays of another of Ionescu's disciples, [[Emil Cioran]], while noting that Cioran's were "of a more exulted tone and written in the [[Aphorism|aphoristic]] form of [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.955&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu recorded Eliade's rejection of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], citing the author's stated indifference towards any "naïveté" or "contradictions" that the reader could possibly reproach him, as well as his dismissive thoughts of "theoretical data" and mainstream philosophy in general (Eliade saw the latter as "inert, infertile and pathogenic").&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt; Eliade thus argued, "a sincere brain is unassailable, for it denies itself to any relationship with outside truths."&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"&gt;Eliade, in Călinescu, p.954&lt;/ref&gt;

The young writer was however careful to clarify that the existence he took into consideration was not the life of "instincts and personal [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncrasies]]", which he believed determined the lives of many humans, but that of a distinct set comprising "personalities".&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"/&gt; He described "personalities" as characterized by both "purpose" and "a much more complicated and dangerous alchemy".&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"/&gt; This differentiation, George Călinescu believed, echoed Ionescu's metaphor of man, seen as "the only animal who can fail at living", and the duck, who "shall remain a duck no matter what it does".&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, in Călinescu, p.953, 954&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, the purpose of personalities is infinity: "consciously and gloriously bringing [existence] to waste, into as many skies as possible, continuously fulfilling and polishing oneself, seeking ascent and not circumference."&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.954"/&gt;

In Eliade's view, two roads await man in this process. One is glory, determined by either work or procreation, and the other the [[asceticism]] of religion or magic—both, Călinescu believed, where aimed at reaching the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], even in those cases where Eliade described the latter as an "abyssal experience" into which man may take the plunge.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt; The critic pointed out that the addition of "a magical solution" to the options taken into consideration seemed to be Eliade's own original contributions to his mentor's philosophy, and proposed that it may have owed inspiration to [[Julius Evola]] and his disciples.&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt; He also recorded that Eliade applied this concept to human creation, and specifically to artistic creation, citing him describing the latter as "a magical joy, the victorious break of the iron circle" (a reflection of ''[[imitatio dei]]'', having salvation for its ultimate goal).&lt;ref name="Călinescu, p.954"/&gt;

===Philosopher of religion===

====Anti-reductionism and the "transconscious"====
By profession, Eliade was a historian of religion. However, his scholarly works draw heavily on philosophical and psychological terminology. In addition, they contain a number of philosophical arguments about religion. In particular, Eliade often implies the existence of a universal psychological or spiritual "essence" behind all religious phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.110–11&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these arguments, some have accused Eliade of over-generalization and "[[essentialism]]", or even of promoting a theological agenda under the guise of historical scholarship. However, others argue that Eliade is better understood as a scholar who is willing to openly discuss sacred experience and its consequences.&lt;ref&gt;For example, according to Wendy Doniger (Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.xv), Eliade has been accused "of being a crypto-theologian"; however, Doniger argues that Eliade is better characterized as "an open hierogian". Likewise, Robert Ellwood (Ellwood, p.111) denies that Eliade practiced "covert theology".&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying religion, Eliade rejects certain "[[Reductionism|reductionist]]" approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allen, ''Myth and Religion in Mircea Eliade'', [[Routledge]], London, 2002, p.45–46; [[Adrian Marino]], ''L'Herméneutique de Mircea Eliade'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], Paris, 1981, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade thinks a religious phenomenon cannot be reduced to a product of culture and history. He insists that, although religion involves "the social man, the economic man, and so forth", nonetheless "all these conditioning factors together do not, of themselves, add up to the life of the spirit".&lt;ref name="Eliade p.32"&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this anti-reductionist position, Eliade argues against those who accuse him of overgeneralizing, of looking for [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] at the expense of [[particular]]s. Eliade admits that every religious phenomenon is shaped by the particular culture and history that produced it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the Son of God incarnated and became the Christ, he had to speak [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]; he could only conduct himself as a Hebrew of his times [...] His religious message, however universal it might be, was conditioned by the past and present history of the Hebrew people. If the Son of God had been born in India, his spoken language would have had to conform itself to the structure of the [[Languages of India|Indian languages]].&lt;ref name="Eliade p.32"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Eliade argues against those he calls "[[Historicism|historicist]] or [[Existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers" who do not recognize "man in general" behind particular men produced by particular situations&lt;ref name="Eliade p.32"/&gt; (Eliade cites [[Immanuel Kant]] as the likely forerunner of this kind of "historicism").&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that human consciousness transcends (is not reducible to) its historical and cultural conditioning,&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.33&lt;/ref&gt; and even suggests the possibility of a "transconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.17&lt;/ref&gt; By this, Eliade does not necessarily mean anything supernatural or mystical: within the "transconscious", he places religious motifs, symbols, images, and nostalgias that are supposedly universal and whose causes therefore cannot be reduced to historical and cultural conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

====Platonism and "primitive ontology"====
According to Eliade, traditional man feels that things "acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.5"&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; To traditional man, the profane world is "meaningless", and a thing rises out of the profane world only by conforming to an ideal, mythical model.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.34"&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade describes this view of reality as a fundamental part of "primitive [[ontology]]" (the study of "existence" or "reality").&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.34"/&gt; Here he sees a similarity with the philosophy of [[Plato]], who believed that physical phenomena are pale and transient imitations of eternal models or "Forms" (''see [[Theory of forms]]''). He argued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Plato could be regarded as the outstanding philosopher of 'primitive mentality,' that is, as the thinker who succeeded in giving philosophic currency and validity to the modes of life and behavior of archaic humanity.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.34"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliade thinks the [[Platonic realism|Platonic]] ''Theory of forms'' is "primitive ontology" persisting in [[Greek philosophy]]. He claims that Platonism is the "most fully elaborated" version of this primitive ontology.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Dadosky, p.105&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Structure of Religious Knowing: Encountering the Sacred in Eliade and Lonergan'', [[John Daniel Dadosky]] argues that, by making this statement, Eliade was acknowledging "indebtedness to Greek philosophy in general, and to Plato's theory of forms specifically, for his own theory of archetypes and repetition".&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dadosky also states that "one should be cautious when trying to assess Eliade's indebtedness to Plato".&lt;ref&gt;Dadosky, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; Dadosky quotes [[Robert Segal]], a professor of religion, who draws a distinction between Platonism and Eliade's "primitive ontology": for Eliade, the ideal models are patterns that a person or object may or may not imitate; for Plato, there is a Form for everything, and everything imitates a Form by the very fact that it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, in Dadosky, p.105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existentialism and secularism====
Behind the diverse cultural forms of different religions, Eliade proposes a universal: traditional man, he claims, "always believes that there is an absolute reality, ''the sacred'', which transcends this world but manifests itself in this world, thereby sanctifying it and making it real".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.202"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.202&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, traditional man's behavior gains purpose and meaning through the Sacred: "By imitating divine behavior, man puts and keeps himself close to the gods—that is, in the real and the significant."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, "modern nonreligious man assumes a new existential situation".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.202"/&gt; For traditional man, historical events gain significance by imitating sacred, transcendent events. In contrast, nonreligious man lacks sacred models for how history or human behavior should be, so he must decide on his own how history should proceed—he "regards himself solely as the subject and agent of history, and refuses all appeal to transcendence".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.203"&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.203&lt;/ref&gt; From the standpoint of religious thought, the world has an objective purpose established by mythical events, to which man should conform himself: "Myth teaches [religious man] the primordial 'stories' that have constituted him existentially."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.12; see also Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.20, 145.&lt;/ref&gt; From the standpoint of [[Secularism|secular]] thought, any purpose must be invented and imposed on the world by man. Because of this new "existential situation", Eliade argues, the Sacred becomes the primary obstacle to nonreligious man's "freedom". In viewing himself as the proper maker of history, nonreligious man resists all notions of an externally (for instance, divinely) imposed order or model he must obey: modern man "''makes himself'', and he only makes himself completely in proportion as he desacralizes himself and the world. [...] He will not truly be free until he has killed the last god".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.203"/&gt;

====Religious survivals in the secular world====
Eliade says that secular man cannot escape his bondage to religious thought. By its very nature, secularism depends on religion for its sense of identity: by resisting sacred models, by insisting that man make history on his own, secular man identifies himself only through opposition to religious thought: "He [secular man] recognizes himself in proportion as he 'frees' and 'purifies' himself from the '[[superstition]]s' of his ancestors."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, modern man "still retains a large stock of camouflaged myths and degenerated rituals".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.205&lt;/ref&gt; For example, modern social events still have similarities to traditional initiation rituals, and modern novels feature mythical motifs and themes.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 205; ''Myth and Reality'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, secular man still participates in something like the eternal return: by reading modern literature, "modern man succeeds in obtaining an 'escape from time' comparable to the 'emergence from time' effected by myths".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 205; see also Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade sees traces of religious thought even in secular academia. He thinks modern scientists are motivated by the religious desire to return to the sacred time of origins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One could say that the anxious search for the origins of Life and Mind; the fascination in the 'mysteries of Nature'; the urge to penetrate and decipher the inner structure of Matter—all these longings and drives denote a sort of nostalgia for the primordial, for the original universal ''matrix''. Matter, Substance, represents the ''absolute origin'', the beginning of all things.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Eliade believes the rise of materialism in the 19th century forced the religious nostalgia for "origins" to express itself in science. He mentions his own field of History of Religions as one of the fields that was obsessed with origins during the 19th century:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The new discipline of History of Religions developed rapidly in this cultural context. And, of course, it followed a like pattern: the [[Positivism|positivistic]] approach to the facts and the search for origins, for the very beginning of religion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;All Western historiography was during that time obsessed with the quest of ''origins''. [...] This search for the origins of human institutions and cultural creations prolongs and completes the naturalist's quest for the origin of species, the biologist's dream of grasping the origin of life, the geologist's and the astronomer's endeavor to understand the origin of the Earth and the Universe. From a psychological point of view, one can decipher here the same nostalgia for the 'primordial' and the 'original'.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "The Quest for the 'Origins' of Religion", p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some of his writings, Eliade describes modern political ideologies as secularized mythology. According to Eliade, [[Marxism]] "takes up and carries on one of the great [[eschatological]] myths of the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean world, namely: the redemptive part to be played by the Just (the 'elect', the 'anointed', the 'innocent', the 'missioners', in our own days the [[proletariat]]), whose sufferings are invoked to change the ontological status of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'' 1960, pp. 25–26, in Ellwood, pp. 91–92&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade sees the widespread myth of the [[Golden Age]], "which, according to a number of traditions, lies at the beginning and the end of History", as the "precedent" for [[Karl Marx]]'s vision of a [[classless society]].&lt;ref name="Myths2526, Ell92"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'' 1960, pp. 25–26, in Ellwood, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, he sees Marx's belief in the final triumph of the good (the proletariat) over the evil (the [[bourgeoisie]]) as "a truly messianic Judaeo-Christian ideology".&lt;ref name="Myths2526, Ell92"/&gt; Despite Marx's hostility toward religion, Eliade implies, his ideology works within a conceptual framework inherited from religious mythology.

Likewise, Eliade notes that Nazism involved a [[Nazi occultism|pseudo-pagan mysticism]] based on [[Germanic paganism|ancient Germanic religion]]. He suggests that the differences between the Nazis' pseudo-Germanic mythology and Marx's pseudo-Judaeo-Christian mythology explain their differing success:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In comparison with the vigorous optimism of the communist myth, the mythology propagated by the national socialists seems particularly inept; and this is not only because of the limitations of the racial myth (how could one imagine that the rest of Europe would voluntarily accept submission to the master-race?), but above all because of the fundamental pessimism of the Germanic mythology. [...] For the eschaton prophesied and expected by the ancient Germans was the [[ragnarok]]—that is, a catastrophic end of the world.&lt;ref name="Myths2526, Ell92"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Modern man and the "terror of history"====
According to Eliade, modern man displays "traces" of "mythological behavior" because he intensely needs sacred time and the eternal return.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Despite modern man's claims to be nonreligious, he ultimately cannot find value in the linear progression of historical events; even modern man feels the "terror of history": "Here too [...] there is always the struggle against Time, the hope to be freed from the weight of 'dead Time,' of the Time that crushes and kills."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, this "terror of history" becomes especially acute when violent and threatening historical events confront modern man—the mere fact that a terrible event has happened, that it is part of history, is of little comfort to those who suffer from it. Eliade asks rhetorically how modern man can "tolerate the catastrophes and horrors of history—from collective deportations and massacres to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]]—if beyond them he can glimpse no sign, no transhistorical meaning".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade indicates that, if repetitions of mythical events provided sacred value and meaning for history in the eyes of ancient man, modern man has denied the Sacred and must therefore invent value and purpose on his own. Without the Sacred to confer an absolute, objective value upon historical events, modern man is left with "a [[Relativism|relativistic]] or [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] view of history" and a resulting "spiritual aridity".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.152&lt;/ref&gt; In chapter 4 ("The Terror of History") of ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'' and chapter 9 ("Religious Symbolism and the Modern Man's Anxiety") of ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', Eliade argues at length that the rejection of religious thought is a primary cause of modern man's anxieties.

====Inter-cultural dialogue and a "new humanism"====
Eliade argues that modern man may escape the "Terror of history" by learning from traditional cultures. For example, Eliade thinks [[Hinduism]] has advice for modern Westerners. According to many branches of Hinduism, the world of historical time is illusory, and the only absolute reality is the immortal soul or ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' within man. According to Eliade, Hindus thus escape the terror of history by refusing to see historical time as the true reality.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.240–241&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade notes that a [[Western philosophy|Western]] or [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] philosopher might feel suspicious toward this Hindu view of history:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One can easily guess what a European historical and [[Existentialism|existentialist]] philosopher might reply [...] You ask me, he would say, to 'die to History'; but man is not, and he ''cannot be'' anything else but History, for his very essence is temporality. You are asking me, then, to give up my authentic existence and to take refuge in an abstraction, in pure Being, in the ''atman'': I am to sacrifice my dignity as a creator of History in order to live an a-historic, inauthentic existence, empty of all human content. Well, I prefer to put up with my anxiety: at least, it cannot deprive me of a certain heroic grandeur, that of becoming conscious of, and accepting, the human condition.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 241"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Eliade argues that the Hindu approach to history does not necessarily lead to a rejection of history. On the contrary, in Hinduism historical human existence is not the "absurdity" that many Continental philosophers see it as.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p. 241"/&gt; According to Hinduism, history is a divine creation, and one may live contentedly within it as long as one maintains a certain degree of detachment from it: "One is devoured by Time, by History, not because one lives in them, but because one thinks them ''real'' and, in consequence, one forgets or undervalues eternity."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Eliade argues that Westerners can learn from non-Western cultures to see something besides absurdity in suffering and death. Traditional cultures see suffering and death as a [[rite of passage]]. In fact, their [[initiation]] rituals often involve a symbolic death and resurrection, or symbolic ordeals followed by relief. Thus, Eliade argues, modern man can learn to see his historical ordeals, even death, as necessary initiations into the next stage of one's existence.&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.243"&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.243&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade even suggests that traditional thought offers relief from the vague [[anxiety]] caused by "our obscure presentiment of the end of the world, or more exactly of the end of ''our'' world, our ''own'' civilization".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.243"/&gt; Many traditional cultures have myths about the end of their world or civilization; however, these myths do not succeed "in paralysing either Life or Culture".&lt;ref name="Eliade, p.243"/&gt; These traditional cultures emphasize cyclic time and, therefore, the inevitable rise of a new world or civilization on the ruins of the old. Thus, they feel comforted even in contemplating the end times.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.243–244&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade argues that a Western spiritual rebirth can happen within the framework of Western spiritual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.244&lt;/ref&gt; However, he says, to start this rebirth, Westerners may need to be stimulated by ideas from non-Western cultures. In his ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', Eliade claims that a "genuine encounter" between cultures "might well constitute the point of departure for a new [[humanism]], upon a world scale".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.245&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity and the "salvation" of History====
Mircea Eliade sees the [[Abrahamic religion]]s as a turning point between the ancient, cyclic view of time and the modern, linear view of time, noting that, in their case, sacred events are not limited to a far-off primordial age, but continue throughout history: "time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the [[Eternal Return (Eliade)|Eternal Return]]; it has become linear and irreversible Time".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; He thus sees in Christianity the ultimate example of a religion embracing linear, historical time. When God is born as a man, into the stream of history, "all history becomes a [[theophany]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries'', p.153&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, "Christianity strives to ''save'' history".&lt;ref name="Eliade p.170"&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In Christianity, the Sacred enters a human being (Christ) to save humans, but it also enters history to "save" history and turn otherwise ordinary, historical events into something "capable of transmitting a trans-historical message".&lt;ref name="Eliade p.170"/&gt;

From Eliade's perspective, Christianity's "trans-historical message" may be the most important help that modern man could have in confronting the terror of history. In his book ''Mito'' ("Myth"), [[Italy|Italian]] researcher [[Furio Jesi]] argues that Eliade denies man the position of a true protagonist in history: for Eliade, true human experience lies not in intellectually "making history", but in man's experiences of joy and grief. Thus, from Eliade's perspective, the Christ story becomes the perfect myth for modern man.&lt;ref name="Jesi, p.66-67"&gt;Jesi, p.66–67&lt;/ref&gt; In Christianity, God willingly entered historical time by being born as Christ, and accepted the suffering that followed. By identifying with Christ, modern man can learn to confront painful historical events.&lt;ref name="Jesi, p.66-67"/&gt; Ultimately, according to Jesi, Eliade sees Christianity as the only religion that can save man from the "Terror of history".&lt;ref&gt;Jesi, p.66–70&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eliade's view, traditional man sees time as an endless repetition of mythical archetypes. In contrast, modern man has abandoned mythical archetypes and entered linear, historical time—in this context, unlike many other religions, Christianity attributes value to historical time. Thus, Eliade concludes, "Christianity incontestably proves to be the religion of 'fallen man'", of modern man who has lost "the paradise of archetypes and repetition".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Modern gnosticism", Romanticism and Eliade's nostalgia====
In analyzing the similarities between the "mythologists" Eliade, [[Joseph Campbell]] and Carl Jung, Robert Ellwood concluded that the three modern mythologists, all of whom believed that myths reveal "timeless truth",&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilled the role "[[Gnosticism|gnostics]]" had in [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. The diverse religious movements covered by the term "gnosticism" share the basic doctrines that the surrounding world is fundamentally evil or inhospitable, that we are trapped in the world through no fault of our own, and that we can be saved from the world only through secret knowledge (''[[gnosis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Ellwood claimed that the three mythologists were "modern gnostics through and through",&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; remarking,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Whether in [[Augustus|Augustan Rome]] or modern Europe, democracy all too easily gave way to [[totalitarianism]], technology was as readily used for battle as for comfort, and immense wealth lay alongside abysmal poverty. [...] Gnostics past and present sought answers not in the course of outward human events, but in knowledge of the world's beginning, of what lies above and beyond the world, and of the secret places of the human soul. To all this the mythologists spoke, and they acquired large and loyal followings.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Ellwood, the mythologists believed in gnosticism's basic doctrines (even if in a secularized form). Ellwood also believes that [[Romanticism]], which stimulated the modern study of mythology,&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.19"&gt;Ellwood, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; strongly influenced the mythologists. Because Romantics stress that emotion and imagination have the same dignity as reason, Ellwood argues, they tend to think political truth "is known less by rational considerations than by its capacity to fire the passions" and, therefore, that political truth is "very apt to be found [...] in the distant past".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.19"/&gt;

As modern gnostics, Ellwood argues, the three mythologists felt alienated from the surrounding modern world. As scholars, they knew of primordial societies that had operated differently from modern ones. And as people influenced by Romanticism, they saw myths as a saving ''gnosis'' that offered "avenues of eternal return to simpler primordial ages when the values that rule the world were forged".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Ellwood identifies Eliade's personal sense of nostalgia as a source for his interest in, or even his theories about, traditional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.99, 117&lt;/ref&gt; He cites Eliade himself claiming to desire an "eternal return" like that by which traditional man returns to the mythical paradise: "My essential preoccupation is precisely the means of escaping History, of saving myself through symbol, myth, rite, archetypes".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, quoted by [[Virgil Ierunca]], ''The Literary Work of Mircea Eliade'', in Ellwood, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ellwood's view, Eliade's nostalgia was only enhanced by his exile from Romania: "In later years Eliade felt about his own Romanian past as did primal folk about mythic time. He was drawn back to it, yet he knew he could not live there, and that all was not well with it."&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.101"&gt;Ellwood, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that this nostalgia, along with Eliade's sense that "exile is among the profoundest metaphors for all human life",&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.97&lt;/ref&gt; influenced Eliade's theories. Ellwood sees evidence of this in Eliade's concept of the "Terror of history" from which modern man is no longer shielded.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.102&lt;/ref&gt; In this concept, Ellwood sees an "element of nostalgia" for earlier times "when the sacred was strong and the terror of history had barely raised its head".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Eliade's scholarship==

===Overgeneralization===
Eliade cites a wide variety of myths and rituals to support his theories. However, he has been accused of making over-generalizations: many scholars think he lacks sufficient evidence to put forth his ideas as universal, or even general, principles of religious thought. According to one scholar, "Eliade may have been the most popular and influential contemporary historian of religion", but "many, if not most, specialists in anthropology, sociology, and even history of religions have either ignored or quickly dismissed" Eliade's works.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Allen, "Eliade and History", in ''Journal of Religion'', 52:2 (1988), p.545&lt;/ref&gt;

The classicist [[Geoffrey Kirk|G. S. Kirk]] criticizes Eliade's insistence that [[Australian Aborigines]] and ancient [[Mesopotamia]]ns had concepts of "being", "non-being", "real", and "becoming", although they lacked words for them. Kirk also believes that Eliade overextends his theories: for example, Eliade claims that the modern myth of the "[[noble savage]]" results from the religious tendency to idealize the primordial, mythical age.&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth..., footnote, p.255"&gt;Kirk, ''Myth...'', footnote, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kirk, "such extravagances, together with a marked repetitiousness, have made Eliade unpopular with many anthropologists and sociologists".&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth..., footnote, p.255"/&gt; In Kirk's view, Eliade derived his theory of [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]] from the functions of [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]] and then proceeded to apply the theory to other mythologies to which it did not apply. For example, Kirk argues that the eternal return does not accurately describe the functions of [[Native American mythology|Native American]] or [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.64–66&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk concludes, "Eliade's idea is a valuable perception about certain myths, not a guide to the proper understanding of all of them".&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

Even [[Wendy Doniger]], Eliade's successor at the University of Chicago, claims (in an introduction to Eliade's own ''Shamanism'') that the eternal return does not apply to all myths and rituals, although it may apply to many of them.&lt;ref name="Doniger Forward p.xiii"/&gt; However, although Doniger agrees that Eliade made over-generalizations, she notes that his willingness to "argue boldly for universals" allowed him to see patterns "that spanned the entire globe and the whole of human history".&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; Whether they were true or not, she argues, Eliade's theories are still useful "as starting points for the comparative study of religion". She also argues that Eliade's theories have been able to accommodate "new data to which Eliade did not have access".&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of empirical support===
Several researchers have criticized Eliade's work as having no [[Empirical method|empirical]] support. Thus, he is said to have "failed to provide an adequate methodology for the history of religions and to establish this discipline as an empirical science",&lt;ref name="ricketts"&gt;Mac Linscott Ricketts, "Review of ''Religion on Trial: Mircea Eliade and His Critics'' by Guilford Dudley III", in ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 46, No. 3 (September 1978), p.400–402&lt;/ref&gt; though the same critics admit that "the history of religions should not aim at being an empirical science anyway".&lt;ref name="ricketts"/&gt; Specifically, his claim that the sacred is a structure of human consciousness is distrusted as not being empirically provable: "no one has yet turned up the basic category ''sacred''".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory D. Alles, "Review of ''Changing Religious Worlds: The Meaning and End of Mircea Eliade'' by Brian Rennie", in ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', Vol. 71, p.466–469 (Alles' italics)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there has been mention of his tendency to ignore the social aspects of religion.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; Anthropologist Alice Kehoe is highly critical of Eliade's work on Shamanism, namely because he was not an anthropologist but a historian. She contends that Eliade never did any field work or contacted any indigenous groups that practiced Shamanism, and that his work was synthesized from various sources without being supported by direct field research.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Kehoe, ''Shamans and Religion: An Anthropological Exploration in Critical Thinking'', Waveland Press, London, 2000, ''passim''. {{ISBN|1-57766-162-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Professor Kees W. Bolle of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] argues that "Professor Eliade's approach, in all his works, is empirical":&lt;ref name="bolle"&gt;Kees W. Bolle, ''The Freedom of Man in Myth'', [[Vanderbilt University Press]], Nashville, 1968, p.14. {{ISBN|0-8265-1248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolle sets Eliade apart for what he sees as Eliade's particularly close "attention to the various particular motifs" of different myths.&lt;ref name="bolle"/&gt; French researcher Daniel Dubuisson places doubt on Eliade's scholarship and its scientific character, citing the Romanian academic's alleged refusal to accept the treatment of religions in their historical and cultural context, and proposing that Eliade's notion of ''[[hierophany]]'' refers to the actual existence of a supernatural level.&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;

[[Ronald Inden]], a historian of [[India]] and University of Chicago professor, criticized Mircea Eliade, alongside other intellectual figures ([[Carl Jung]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] among them), for encouraging a "romantic view" of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="indenmorny"&gt;Inden, in Morny Joy, "Irigaray's Eastern Expedition", Chapter 4 of Morny Joy, [[Kathleen O'Grady]], Judith L. Poxon, ''Religion in French Feminist Thought: Critical Perspectives'', [[Routledge]], London, 2003, p.63. {{ISBN|0-415-21536-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that their approach to the subject relied mainly on an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] approach, and made Hinduism seem like "a private realm of the imagination and the religious which modern, Western man lacks but needs."&lt;ref name="indenmorny"/&gt;

===Far right and nationalist influences===
Although his scholarly work was never subordinated to his early political beliefs, the school of thought he was associated with in [[interwar]] Romania, namely [[Trăirism]], as well as the works of [[Julius Evola]] he continued to draw inspiration from, have thematic links to fascism.&lt;ref name="pccheie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and academic Marcel Tolcea has argued that, through Evola's particular interpretation of Guénon's works, Eliade kept a traceable connection with [[far right]] ideologies in his academic contributions.&lt;ref name="pccheie"/&gt; Daniel Dubuisson singled out Eliade's concept of ''homo religiosus'' as a reflection of fascist [[elitism]], and argued that the Romanian scholar's views of [[Judaism]] and the [[Old Testament]], which depicted Hebrews as the enemies of an ancient cosmic religion, were ultimately the preservation of an [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] discourse.&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt;

A piece authored in 1930 saw Eliade defining Julius Evola as a great thinker and offering praise to the controversial intellectuals [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="mlimpost"/&gt; Evola, who continued to defend the core principles of mystical fascism, once protested to Eliade about the latter's failure to cite him and Guénon. Eliade replied that his works were written for a contemporary public, and not to initiates of esoteric circles.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Fragments d'un Journal 11, 1970–1978'', [[Éditions Gallimard]], Paris, 1981, p.194&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1960s, he, together with Evola, [[Louis Rougier]], and other intellectuals, offered support to [[Alain de Benoist]]'s controversial ''[[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne]]'', part of the ''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'' intellectual trend.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p.173; Douglas R. Holmes, ''Integral Europe: Fast-Capitalism, Multiculturalism, Neofascism'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, 2000, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, Eliade was also preoccupied with the cult of [[Zalmoxis]] and its supposed [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="boia"&gt;[[Lucian Boia]], ''Istorie şi mit în conştiinţa românească'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 1997 (tr. ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2001), p.152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, "Zalmoxis, The Vanishing God", in ''[[Slavic Review]]'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (December 1974), p.807–809&lt;/ref&gt; This, like his conclusion that [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] had been superficial inside [[Roman Dacia]], was a view celebrated by contemporary partisans of [[Protochronism|Protochronist]] nationalism.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boia"/&gt; According to historian [[Sorin Antohi]], Eliade may have actually encouraged Protochronists such as [[Edgar Papu]] to carry out research which resulted in the claim that medieval Romanians had anticipated the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Antohi, preface to Liiceanu, p.xx&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of Eliade, Jung, and Campbell, Ellwood also discusses the connection between academic theories and controversial political involvements, noting that all three mythologists have been accused of [[reactionary]] political positions. Ellwood notes the obvious parallel between the [[conservatism]] of myth, which speaks of a primordial golden age, and the conservatism of far right politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.xiii–xiv&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ellwood argues that the explanation is more complex than that. Wherever their political sympathies may have sometimes been, he claims, the three mythologists were often "apolitical if not antipolitical, scorning any this-worldly salvation".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the connection between mythology and politics differs for each of the mythologists in question: in Eliade's case, Ellwood believes, a strong sense of nostalgia ("for childhood, for historical times past, for cosmic religion, for paradise"),&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.99"/&gt; influenced not only the scholar's academic interests, but also his political views.

Because Eliade stayed out of politics during his later life, Ellwood tries to extract an implicit political philosophy from Eliade's scholarly works. Ellwood argues that the later Eliade's nostalgia for ancient traditions did not make him a political reactionary, even a quiet one. He concludes that the later Eliade was, in fact, a "radical [[Modernism|modernist]]".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.119"&gt;Ellwood, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellwood,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who see Eliade's fascination with the primordial as merely reactionary in the ordinary political or religious sense of the word do not understand the mature Eliade in a sufficiently radical way. [...] Tradition was not for him exactly [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] 'prescription' or sacred trust to be kept alive generation after generation, for Eliade was fully aware that tradition, like men and nations, lives only by changing and even occultation. The tack is not to try fruitlessly to keep it unchanging, but to discover where it is hiding.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.119"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Eliade, religious elements survive in secular culture, but in new, "camouflaged" forms.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.118&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Ellwood believes that the later Eliade probably thought modern man should preserve elements of the past, but should not try to restore their original form through reactionary politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.119–20&lt;/ref&gt; He suspects that Eliade would have favored "a minimal rather than a maximalist state" that would allow personal spiritual transformation without enforcing it.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.120"&gt;Ellwood, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars have accused Eliade of "[[essentialism]]", a type of over-generalization in which one incorrectly attributes a common "essence" to a whole group—in this case, all "religious" or "traditional" societies. Furthermore, some see a connection between Eliade's essentialism with regard to religion and fascist essentialism with regard to races and nations.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.111"&gt;Ellwood, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; To Ellwood, this connection "seems rather tortured, in the end amounting to little more than an ''ad hominem'' argument which attempts to tar Eliade's entire [scholarly] work with the ill-repute all decent people feel for [[Sturmabteilung|storm troopers]] and the Iron Guard".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.111"/&gt; However, Ellwood admits that common tendencies in "mythological thinking" may have caused Eliade, as well as Jung and Campbell, to view certain groups in an "essentialist" way, and that this may explain their purported antisemitism: "A tendency to think in generic terms of peoples, races, religions, or parties, which as we shall see is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking, including that of such modern mythologists as our three, can connect with nascent anti-Semitism, or the connection can be the other way."&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary works==

===Generic traits===
Many of Mircea Eliade's literary works, in particular his earliest ones, are noted for their [[eroticism]] and their focus on subjective experience. Modernist in style, they have drawn comparisons to the contemporary writings of [[Mihail Sebastian]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.963&lt;/ref&gt; [[I. Valerian]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.843&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ion Biberi]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.967&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Giovanni Papini]], his literary passions included [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Miguel de Unamuno]],&lt;ref name="Şora, Handoca"/&gt; as well as [[André Gide]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Eliade also read with interest the prose of [[Romain Rolland]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers [[Voltaire]] and [[Denis Diderot]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; As a youth, he read the works of Romanian authors such as [[Liviu Rebreanu]] and [[Panait Istrati]]; initially, he was also interested in [[Ionel Teodoreanu]]'s prose works, but later rejected them and criticized their author.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

Investigating the works' main characteristics, [[George Călinescu]] stressed that Eliade owed much of his style to the direct influence of French author André Gide, concluding that, alongside [[Camil Petrescu]] and a few others, Eliade was among Gide's leading disciples in [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]].&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; He commented that, like Gide, Eliade believed that the artist "does not take a stand, but experiences good and evil while setting himself free from both, maintaining an intact curiosity."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; A specific aspect of this focus on experience is sexual experimentation—Călinescu notes that Eliade's fiction works tend to depict a male figure "possessing all practicable women in [a given] family".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"&gt;Călinescu, p.959&lt;/ref&gt; He also considered that, as a rule, Eliade depicts woman as "a basic means for a sexual experience and repudiated with harsh [[egotism]]."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt;

For Călinescu, such a perspective on life culminated in "banality", leaving authors gripped by the "cult of the self" and "a contempt for literature".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; Polemically, Călinescu proposed that Mircea Eliade's supposed focus on "aggressive youth" served to instill his [[Interwar period|interwar]] Romanian writers with the idea that they had a common destiny as a generation apart.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.956"/&gt; He also commented that, when set in Romania, Mircea Eliade's stories lacked the "perception of immediate reality", and, analyzing the non-traditional names the writer tended to ascribe to his Romanian characters, that they did not depict "specificity".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"&gt;Călinescu, p.958&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in Călinescu's view, Eliade's stories were often "[[Sensationalism|sensationalist]] compositions of the illustrated magazine kind."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.960"&gt;Călinescu, p.960&lt;/ref&gt; Mircea Eliade's assessment of his own pre-1940 literary contributions oscillated between expressions of pride&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; and the bitter verdict that they were written for "an audience of little ladies and high school students".&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"/&gt;

A secondary but unifying feature present in most of Eliade's stories is their setting, a magical and part-fictional [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; In part, they also serve to illustrate or allude to Eliade's own research in the field of religion, as well as to the concepts he introduced.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Thus, commentators such as [[Matei Călinescu]] and [[Carmen Mușat]] have also argued that a main characteristic of Eliade's [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] prose is a substitution between the [[supernatural]] and the mundane: in this interpretation, Eliade turns the daily world into an incomprehensible place, while the intrusive supernatural aspect promises to offer the sense of life.&lt;ref name="musatalcatuire"&gt;[[Carmen Muşat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=4693&amp;print=true "Despre fantastica alcătuire a realului" ("On the Fantastic Shape of Reality")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 131, August–September 2002; retrieved January 17, 2008{{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion was in turn linked to Eliade's own thoughts on [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], and in particular his idea that, once "camouflaged" in life or history, [[miracle]]s become "unrecognizable".&lt;ref name="musatalcatuire"/&gt;

===Oriental themed novels===
One of Eliade's earliest fiction writings, the controversial [[first-person narrative]] ''Isabel şi apele diavolului'', focused on the figure of a young and brilliant academic, whose self-declared fear is that of "being common".&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.956"&gt;Eliade, in Călinescu, p.956&lt;/ref&gt; The hero's experience is recorded in "notebooks", which are compiled to form the actual narrative, and which serve to record his unusual, mostly sexual, experiences in [[British India]]—the narrator describes himself as dominated by "a devilish indifference" towards "all things having to do with art or [[metaphysics]]", focusing instead on eroticism.&lt;ref name="Eliade Căl. p.956"/&gt; The guest of a [[pastor]], the scholar ponders sexual adventures with his host's wife, servant girl, and finally with his daughter Isabel. Persuading the pastor's adolescent son to run away from home, becoming the sexual initiator of a twelve-year-old girl and the lover of a much older woman, the character also attempts to seduce Isabel. Although she falls in love, the young woman does not give in to his pressures, but eventually allows herself to be abused and impregnated by another character, letting the object of her affection know that she had thought of him all along.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"&gt;Călinescu, p.957&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Eliade's best-known works, the novel ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]'', dwells on Eliade's own experience, comprising camouflaged details of his relationships with [[Surendranath Dasgupta]] and Dasgupta's daughter [[Maitreyi Devi]]. The main character, Allan, is an [[England|Englishman]] who visits the Indian engineer Narendra Sen and courts his daughter, herself known as Maitreyi. The narrative is again built on "notebooks" to which Allan adds his comments. This technique Călinescu describes as "boring", and its result "cynical".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"/&gt;

Allan himself stands alongside Eliade's male characters, whose focus is on action, sensation and experience—his chaste contacts with Maitreyi are encouraged by Sen, who hopes for a marriage which is nonetheless abhorred by his would-be European son-in-law.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"/&gt; Instead, Allan is fascinated to discover Maitreyi's Oriental version of [[Platonic love]], marked by spiritual attachment more than by physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.957–958&lt;/ref&gt; However, their affair soon after turns physical, and she decides to attach herself to Allan as one would to a husband, in what is an informal and intimate wedding ceremony (which sees her vowing her love and invoking an [[Chthonic|earth goddess]] as the seal of union).&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Upon discovering this, Narendra Sen becomes enraged, rejecting their guest and keeping Maitreyi in confinement. As a result, his daughter decides to have intercourse with a lowly stranger, becoming pregnant in the hope that her parents would consequently allow her to marry her lover. However, the story also casts doubt on her earlier actions, reflecting rumors that Maitreyi was not a virgin at the time she and Allan first met, which also seems to expose her father as a hypocrite.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

George Călinescu objected to the narrative, arguing that both the physical affair and the father's rage seemed artificial, while commenting that Eliade placing doubt on his Indian characters' honesty had turned the plot into a piece of "[[Ethnology|ethnological]] humor".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Noting that the work developed on a classical theme of [[miscegenation]], which recalled the prose of [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] and [[Pierre Loti]],&lt;ref name="Căl. p.957"/&gt; the critic proposed that its main merit was in introducing the [[Exoticism|exotic novel]] to local literature.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

Mircea Eliade's other early works include ''Șantier'' ("Building Site"), a part-novel, part-diary account of his Indian sojourn. George Călinescu objected to its "monotony", and, noting that it featured a set of "intelligent observations", criticized the "banality of its ideological conversations."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; ''Șantier'' was also noted for its portrayal of [[drug addiction]] and intoxication with [[opium]], both of which could have referred to Eliade's actual travel experience.&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt;

In his earliest novel, titled ''[[Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent]]'' and written in the first person, Eliade depicts his experience through high school.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; It is proof of the influence exercised on him by the literature of [[Giovanni Papini]], and in particular by Papini's story ''[[Un uomo finito]]''.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Each of its chapters reads like an independent [[novella]], and, in all, the work experiments with the limits traced between novel and diary.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Literary critic [[Eugen Simion]] called it "the most valuable" among Eliade's earliest literary attempts, but noted that, being "ambitious", the book had failed to achieve "an aesthetically satisfactory format".&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; According to Simion, the innovative intent of the ''Novel...'' was provided by its technique, by its goal of providing authenticity in depicting experiences, and by its insight into [[adolescent psychology]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; The novel notably shows its narrator practicing self-[[flagellation]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

Eliade's 1934 novel ''Întoarcerea din rai'' ("Return from Paradise") centers on Pavel Anicet, a young man who seeks knowledge through what Călinescu defined as "sexual excess".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; His search leaves him with a reduced sensitivity: right after being confronted with his father's death, Anicet breaks out in tears only after sitting through an entire dinner.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; The other characters, standing for Eliade's generation, all seek knowledge through violence or retreat from the world—nonetheless, unlike Anicet, they ultimately fail at imposing rigors upon themselves.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Pavel himself eventually abandons his belief in sex as a means for enlightenment, and commits suicide in hopes of reaching the level of primordial unity. The solution, George Călinescu noted, mirrored the strange murder in Gide's ''[[Lafcadio's Adventures]]''.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt; Eliade himself indicated that the book dealt with the "loss of the beatitude, illusions, and optimism that had dominated the first twenty years of '[[Greater Romania]]'."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Ellwood, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ellwood connected the work to Eliade's recurring sense of loss in respect to the "atmosphere of euphoria and faith" of his adolescence.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.101"/&gt; Călinescu criticizes ''Întoarcerea din rai'', describing its dialog sequences as "awkward", its narrative as "void", and its artistic interest as "non-existent", proposing that the reader could however find it relevant as the "document of a mentality".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

The lengthy novel ''Huliganii'' ("The Hooligans") is intended as the fresco of a family, and, through it, that of an entire generation. The book's main protagonist, Petru Anicet, is a composer who places value in experiments; other characters include Dragu, who considers "a hooligan's experience" as "the only fertile debut into life", and the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] Alexandru Pleşa, who is on the search for "the heroic life" by enlisting youth in "perfect regiments, equally intoxicated by a collective myth."&lt;ref name="admestmeanea"&gt;[[Gabriela Adameşteanu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Cum-suporta-individul-socurile-Istoriei.-Dialog-cu-Norman-MANEA*articleID_14662-articles_details.html "Cum suportă individul şocurile Istoriei. Dialog cu Norman Manea" ("How the Individual Bears the Shocks of History. A Dialog with Norman Manea")], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 304, January 2006; retrieved January 16, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Călinescu, p.958–959&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu thought that the young male characters all owed inspiration to [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s [[Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov]] (''see [[Crime and Punishment]]'').&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Anicet, who partly shares Pleșa's vision for a collective experiment, is also prone to sexual adventures, and seduces the women of the Lecca family (who have hired him as a piano teacher).&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Romanian-born novelist [[Norman Manea]] called Anicet's experiment: "the paraded defiance of [[bourgeois]] conventions, in which venereal disease and lubricity dwell together."&lt;ref name="admestmeanea"/&gt; In one episode of the book, Anicet convinces Anișoara Lecca to gratuitously steal from her parents—an outrage which leads her mother to moral decay and, eventually, to suicide.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; George Călinescu criticized the book for inconsistencies and "excesses in Dostoyevskianism", but noted that the Lecca family portrayal was "suggestive", and that the dramatic scenes were written with "a remarkable poetic calm."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt;

The novel ''[[Marriage in Heaven]]'' depicts the correspondence between two male friends, an artist and a common man, who complain to each other about their failures in love: the former complains about a lover who wanted his children when he did not, while the other recalls being abandoned by a woman who, despite his intentions, did not want to become pregnant by him. Eliade lets the reader understand that they are in fact talking about the same woman.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.960"/&gt;

===Fantastic and fantasy literature===
Mircea Eliade's earliest works, most of which were published at later stages, belong to the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre. One of the first such literary exercises to be printed, the 1921 ''Cum am găsit piatra filosofală'', showed its adolescent author's interest in themes that he was to explore throughout his career, in particular [[esotericism]] and [[alchemy]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Written in the first person, it depicts an experiment which, for a moment, seems to be the discovery of the [[philosophers' stone]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; These early writings also include two sketches for novels: ''Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii'' ("The Wonderful Journey of the Five Beetles into the Land of the Red Ants") and ''Memoriile unui soldat de plumb'' ("The Memoirs of a Lead Soldier").&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; In the former, a company of beetle spies is sent among the red ants—their travel offers a setting for [[Satire|satirical]] commentary.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Eliade himself explained that ''Memoriile unui soldat de plumb'' was an ambitious project, designed as a fresco to include the birth of the Universe, [[abiogenesis]], [[human evolution]], and the entire world history.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

Eliade's fantasy novel ''[[Domnișoara Christina]]'', was, on its own, the topic of a scandal.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; The novel deals with the fate of an eccentric family, the Moscus, who are haunted by the ghost of a murdered young woman, known as Christina. The apparition shares characteristics with [[vampire]]s and with ''[[strigoi]]'': she is believed to be drinking the blood of cattle and that of a young family member.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; The young man Egor becomes the object of Christina's desire, and is shown to have intercourse with her.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Noting that the plot and setting reminded one of [[horror fiction]] works by the German author [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]], and defending ''Domnişoara Christina'' in front of harsher criticism, Călinescu nonetheless argued that the "international environment" in which it took place was "upsetting".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; He also depicted the plot as focused on "major impurity", summarizing the story's references to [[necrophilia]], [[menstruation|menstrual]] [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] and [[ephebophilia]].&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt;

Eliade's short story ''Șarpele'' ("The Snake") was described by George Călinescu as "[[Hermeticism|hermetic]]".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; While on a trip to the forest, several persons witness a feat of magic performed by the male character Andronic, who summons a snake from the bottom of a river and places it on an island. At the end of the story, Andronic and the female character Dorina are found on the island, naked and locked in a sensual embrace.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; Călinescu saw the piece as an allusion to [[Gnosticism]], to the [[Kabbalah]], and to [[Babylonian mythology]], while linking the snake to the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure and major [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent symbol]] [[Ophion]].&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; He was however dissatisfied with this introduction of iconic images, describing it as "languishing".&lt;ref name="Căl. p.960"/&gt;

The short story ''Un om mare'' ("A Big Man"), which Eliade authored during his stay in Portugal, shows a common person, the engineer Cucoanes, who grows steadily and uncontrollably, reaching immense proportions and ultimately disappearing into the wilderness of the [[Bucegi Mountains]].&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"&gt;[[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=99&amp;nr=2002-05-20 "''L'Affaire'', după Matei" (''L'Affaire'', according to Matei"), Part II] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010509/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=99&amp;nr=2002-05-20 |date=2007-09-27 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr. 636, May 2002; retrieved January 17, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade himself referenced the story and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s experiments in the same section of his private notes, a matter which allowed [[Matei Călinescu]] to propose that ''Un om mare'' was a direct product of its author's experience with drugs.&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; The same commentator, who deemed ''Un om mare'' "perhaps Eliade's most memorable short story", connected it with the ''[[uriaș]]i'' characters present in [[Romanian folklore]].&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt;

===Other writings===
Eliade reinterpreted the Greek mythological figure [[Iphigeneia]] in his eponymous 1941 play. Here, the maiden falls in love with [[Achilles]], and accepts to be sacrificed on the [[pyre]] as a means to ensure both her lover's happiness (as predicted by an [[oracle]]) and her father [[Agamemnon]]'s victory in the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name="raifigenia"&gt;[[Radu Albala]], "Teatrul Naţional din Bucureşti.

In addition to his fiction, the exiled Eliade authored several volumes of memoirs and diaries and travel writings. They were published sporadically, and covered various stages of his life. One of the earliest such pieces was ''India'', grouping accounts of the travels he made through the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="jgspania"/&gt; Writing for the [[Spain|Spanish]] journal ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', commentator [[Sergio Vila-Sanjuán]] described the first volume of Eliade's ''Autobiography'' (covering the years 1907 to 1937) as "a great book", while noting that the other main volume was "more conventional and insincere."&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; In Vila-Sanjuán's view, the texts reveal Mircea Eliade himself as "a Dostoyevskyian character", as well as "an accomplished person, a [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethian]] figure".&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

A work that drew particular interest was his ''Jurnal portughez'' ("Portuguese Diary"), completed during his stay in [[Lisbon]] and published only after its author's death. A portion of it dealing with his stay in Romania is believed to have been lost.&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt; The travels to Spain, partly recorded in ''Jurnal portughez'', also led to a separate volume, ''Jurnal cordobez'' ("Cordoban Diary"), which Eliade compiled from various independent notebooks.&lt;ref name="jgspania"/&gt;  ''Jurnal portughez'' shows Eliade coping with [[clinical depression]] and political crisis, and has been described by [[Andrei Oișteanu]] as "an overwhelming [read], through the immense suffering it exhales."&lt;ref name="aoopium"/&gt; Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] argued that part of the volume is "a masterpiece of its time", while concluding that some 700 pages were passable for the "among others" section of [[Bibliography of Mircea Eliade|Eliade's bibliography]].&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Noting that the book featured parts where Eliade spoke of himself in eulogistic terms, notably comparing himself favorably to Goethe and Romania's national poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], Cernat accused the writer of "egolatry", and deduced that Eliade was "ready to step over dead bodies for the sake of his spiritual 'mission' ".&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; The same passages led philosopher and journalist [[Cătălin Avramescu]] to argue that Eliade's behavior was evidence of "[[megalomania]]".&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"/&gt;

Eliade also wrote various essays of literary criticism. In his youth, alongside his study on [[Julius Evola]], he published essays which introduced the Romanian public to representatives of modern [[Spanish literature]] and philosophy, among them [[Adolfo Bonilla San Martín]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] and [[Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo]].&lt;ref name="jgspania"/&gt; He also wrote an essay on the works of [[James Joyce]], connecting it with his own theories on the [[Eternal return (Eliade)|eternal return]] ("[Joyce's literature is] saturated with nostalgia for the myth of the eternal repetition"), and deeming Joyce himself an anti-[[Historicism|historicist]] "archaic" figure among the modernists.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Robert Spoo, ''James Joyce and the Language of History: Dedalus's Nightmare'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York, Oxford, 1994, p.158. {{ISBN|0-19-508749-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, Eliade edited the collected works of Romanian historian [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]].&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

M. L. Ricketts discovered and translated into English a previously unpublished play written by Mircea Eliade in Paris 1946 ''Aventura Spirituală'' (''A Spiritual Adventure''). It was published by for the first time in ''[[Theory in Action]]'' -the journal of the [[Transformative Studies Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformativestudies.org/publications/theory-in-action-the-journal-of-tsi/past-issues/volume-5-number-1-january-2012/ Transformative Studies Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; vol. 5 (2012): 2–58.

==Controversy: antisemitism and links with the Iron Guard==

===Early statements===
The early years in Eliade's public career show him to have been highly tolerant of [[Jew]]s in general, and of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish minority in Romania]] in particular. His early condemnation of [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies was accompanied by his caution and moderation in regard to [[Nae Ionescu]]'s various anti-Jewish attacks.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.408–409, 412&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 1930s, Mihail Sebastian was marginalized by Romania's antisemitic policies, and came to reflect on his Romanian friend's association with the far right. The subsequent ideological break between him and Eliade has been compared by writer [[Gabriela Adameşteanu]] with that between [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]].&lt;ref name="admestmeanea"/&gt; In his ''Journal'', published long after his 1945 death, Sebastian claimed that Eliade's actions during the 1930s show him to be an antisemite. According to Sebastian, Eliade had been friendly to him until the start of his political commitments, after which he severed all ties.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Before their friendship came apart, however, Sebastian claimed that he took notes on their conversations (which he later published) during which Eliade was supposed to have expressed antisemitic views. According to Sebastian, Eliade said in 1939:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Poles' resistance]] in [[Warsaw]] is a Jewish resistance. Only yids are capable of the blackmail of putting women and children in the front line, to take advantage of the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]' sense of scruple. The Germans have no interest in the destruction of Romania. Only a pro-German government can save us... What is [[Bukovina#Preceding events and Second World War|happening on the frontier with Bukovina]] is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country. Rather than a Romania again invaded by kikes, it would be better to have a German protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The friendship between Eliade and Sebastian drastically declined during the war: the latter writer, fearing for his security during the pro-Nazi [[Ion Antonescu]] regime (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''), hoped that Eliade, by then a diplomat, could intervene in his favor; however, upon his brief return to Romania, Eliade did not see or approach Sebastian.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

Later, Mircea Eliade expressed his regret at not having had the chance to redeem his friendship with Sebastian before the latter was killed in a car accident.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in Handoca"/&gt; [[Paul Cernat]] notes that Eliade's statement includes an admission that he "counted on [Sebastian's] support, in order to get back into Romanian life and culture", and proposes that Eliade may have expected his friend to vouch for him in front of hostile authorities.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; Some of Sebastian's late recordings in his diary show that their author was reflecting with nostalgia on his relationship with Eliade, and that he deplored the outcome.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

Eliade provided two distinct explanations for not having met with Sebastian: one was related to his claim of being followed around by the [[Gestapo]], and the other, expressed in his diaries, was that the shame of representing a regime that humiliated Jews had made him avoid facing his former friend.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; Another take on the matter was advanced in 1972 by the [[Israel]]i magazine ''Toladot'', who claimed that, as an official representative, Eliade was aware of Antonescu's agreement to implement the [[Final Solution]] in Romania and of how this could affect Sebastian (''see [[Holocaust in Romania]]'').&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; In addition, rumors were sparked that Sebastian and Nina Mareş had a physical relationship, one which could have contributed to the clash between the two literary figures.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Beyond his involvement with a movement known for its antisemitism, Eliade did not usually comment on Jewish issues. However, an article titled ''Piloţii orbi'' ("The Blind Pilots"), contributed to the journal ''Vremea'' in 1936, showed that he supported at least some Iron Guard accusations against the Jewish community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the war [that is, [[World War I]]], Jews have occupied the villages of [[Maramureş historical region|Maramureş]] and [[Bukovina]], and gained the absolute majority in the towns and cities in [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;It was popular prejudice in the late 1930s to claim that [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Ukrainian Jews]] in the [[Soviet Union]] had obtained Romanian citizenship illegally after crossing the border into [[Maramureş historical region|Maramureş]] and Bukovina. In 1938, this accusation served as an excuse for the [[Octavian Goga]]-[[A. C. Cuza]] government to suspend and review all Jewish citizenship guaranteed after 1923, rendering it very difficult to regain (Ornea, p.391). Eliade's mention of Bessarabia probably refers to an earlier period, being his interpretation of a pre-[[Greater Romania]] process.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] It would be absurd to expect Jews to resign themselves in order to become a minority with certain rights and very many duties—after they have tasted the honey of power and conquered as many command positions as they have. Jews are currently fighting with all forces to maintain their positions, expecting a future offensive—and, as far as I am concerned, I understand their fight and admire their vitality, tenacity, genius.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1936, in Ornea, p.412–413; partially in the ''Final Report'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One year later, a text, accompanied by his picture, was featured as answer to an inquiry by the Iron Guard's ''[[Buna Vestire]]'' about the reasons he had for supporting the movement. A short section of it summarizes an anti-Jewish attitude:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Can the Romanian nation end its life in the saddest decay witnessed by history, undermined by misery and [[syphilis]], conquered by Jews and torn to pieces by foreigners, demoralized, betrayed, sold for a few million [[Romanian leu|lei]]?&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, 1937, in Ornea, p.413; in the ''Final Report'', p.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the literary critic [[Z. Ornea]], in the 1980s Eliade denied authorship of the text. He explained the use of his signature, his picture, and the picture's caption, as having been applied by the magazine's editor, [[Mihail Polihroniade]], to a piece the latter had written after having failed to obtain Eliade's contribution; he also claimed that, given his respect for Polihroniade, he had not wished to publicize this matter previously.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.206; Ornea is skeptical of these explanations, given the long period of time spent before Eliade gave them, and especially the fact that the article itself, despite the haste in which it must have been written, has remarkably detailed references to many articles written by Eliade in various papers over a period of time.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polemics and exile===
Dumitru G. Danielopol, a fellow diplomat present in [[London]] during Eliade's stay in the city, later stated that the latter had identified himself as "a guiding light of [the Iron Guard] movement" and victim of [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]'s repression.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; In October 1940, as the [[National Legionary State]] came into existence, the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] [[blacklist]]ed Mircea Eliade, alongside five other  Romanians, due to his Iron Guard connections and suspicions that he was prepared to spy in favor of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="zfscriit"/&gt; According to various sources, while in [[Portugal]], the diplomat was also preparing to disseminate [[propaganda]] in favor of the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; In ''Jurnal portughez'', Eliade defines himself as "a Legionary",&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt; and speaks of his own "Legionary climax" as a stage he had gone through during the early 1940s.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

The depolitisation of Eliade after the start of his diplomatic career was also mistrusted by his former close friend [[Eugène Ionesco]], who indicated that, upon the close of [[World War II]], Eliade's personal beliefs as communicated to his friends amounted to "all is over now that Communism has won".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco, 1945, in Ornea, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; This forms part of Ionesco's severe and succinct review of the careers of Legionary-inspired intellectuals, many of them his friends and former friends, in a letter he sent to [[Tudor Vianu]].&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.184–185&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, Ionesco indicated to [[Petru Comarnescu]] that he did not want to see either Eliade or Cioran, and that he considered the two of them "Legionaries for ever"—adding "we are [[hyena]]s to one another".&lt;ref&gt;Ionesco, 1946, in Ornea, p.211&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliade's former friend, the communist [[Belu Zilber]], who was attending the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Conference]] in 1946, refused to see Eliade, arguing that, as an Iron Guard affiliate, the latter had "denounced left-wingers", and contrasting him with Cioran ("They are both Legionaries, but [Cioran] is honest").&lt;ref&gt;[[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=575&amp;nr=2003-08-25 "Belu Zilber" (III)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011339/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2003-08-25&amp;art=575 |date=2007-09-27 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr.702, August 2003; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Eliade's political activities were brought into discussion as he was getting ready to publish a translation of his ''Techniques du Yoga'' with the left-leaning [[Italy|Italian]] company ''[[Giulio Einaudi Editore]]''—the denunciation was probably orchestrated by Romanian officials.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.210"&gt;Ornea, p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1954, when [[Horia Sima]], who led the Iron Guard during its exile, was rejected by a faction inside the movement, Mircea Eliade's name was included on a list of persons who supported the latter—although this may have happened without his consent.&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.210"/&gt; According to exiled [[dissident]] and novelist [[Dumitru Ţepeneag]], around that date, Eliade expressed his sympathy for Iron Guard members in general, whom he viewed as "courageous".&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Coroiu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090115020500/http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/un-roman-la-paris-0.html "Un român la Paris"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', August 31, 2006; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Robert Ellwood, the Eliade he met in the 1960s was entirely apolitical, remained aloof from "the passionate politics of that era in the United States", and "[r]eportedly [...] never read newspapers"&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.83"&gt;Ellwood, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; (an assessment shared by [[Sorin Alexandrescu]]).&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt; Eliade's student [[Ioan Petru Culianu]] noted that journalists had come to refer to the Romanian scholar as "the great recluse".&lt;ref name="ipcmahapar"/&gt; Despite Eliade's withdrawal from radical politics, Ellwood indicates, he still remained concerned with Romania's welfare. He saw himself and other exiled Romanian intellectuals as members of a circle who worked to "maintain the culture of a free Romania and, above all, to publish texts that had become unpublishable in Romania itself".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Ordeal by Labyrinth'', in Ellwood, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1969, Eliade's past became the subject of public debate in [[Israel]]. At the time, historian [[Gershom Scholem]] asked Eliade to explain his attitudes, which the latter did using vague terms.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oişteanu, Angajamentul..."&gt;Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this exchange, Scholem declared his dissatisfaction, and argued that Israel could not extend a welcome to the Romanian academic.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; During the final years of Eliade's life, his disciple Culianu exposed and publicly criticized his 1930s pro-Iron Guard activities; relations between the two soured as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sorin Antohi]], [http://www.iwm.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=306&amp;Itemid=478 "Exploring the Legacy of Ioan Petru Culianu"], in the [http://www.iwm.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=109&amp;Itemid=231 ''Institut für die Wissenschaften vom Menschen Post''], Newsletter 72, Spring 2001; retrieved July 16, 2007; Ted Anton, [http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9209/culianu.html "The Killing of Professor Culianu"], in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', Volume 2, No. 6, September/October 1992; retrieved July 29, 2007; Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade's other Romanian disciple, [[Andrei Oişteanu]], noted that, in the years following Eliade's death, conversations with various people who had known the scholar had made Culianu less certain of his earlier stances, and had led him to declare: "Mr. Eliade was never antisemitic, a member of the Iron Guard, or pro-Nazi. But, in any case, I am led to believe that he was closer to the Iron Guard than I would have liked to believe."&lt;ref&gt;Culianu, in Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early stage of his polemic with Culianu, Eliade complained in writing that "it is not possible to write an objective history" of the Iron Guard and its leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]].&lt;ref name="Eliade, in Ellwood, p.91"/&gt; Arguing that people "would only accept apologetics [...] or executions", he contended: "After [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], even honest people cannot afford being objective".&lt;ref name="Eliade, in Ellwood, p.91"&gt;Eliade, in Ellwood, p.91; in Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Posterity===
Alongside the arguments introduced by Daniel Dubuisson, criticism of Mircea Eliade's political involvement with antisemitism and fascism came from Adriana Berger, [[Leon Volovici]], Alexandra Lagniel-Lavastine, Florin Țurcanu and others, who have attempted to trace Eliade's antisemitism throughout his work and through his associations with contemporary antisemites, such as the Italian fascist [[occultist]] [[Julius Evola]]. Volovici, for example, is critical of Eliade not only because of his support for the Iron Guard, but also for spreading antisemitism and [[anti-Masonry]] in 1930s Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Volovici, ''Nationalist Ideology and Antisemitism: The Case of Romanian Intellectuals in the 1930s'', [[Pergamon Press]], Oxford, 1991, p.104–105, 110–111, 120–126, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, exiled novelist [[Norman Manea]] published an essay firmly condemning Eliade's attachment to the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Other scholars, like [[Bryan S. Rennie]], have claimed that there is, to date, no evidence of Eliade's membership, active services rendered, or of any real involvement with any fascist or totalitarian movements or membership organizations, nor that there is any evidence of his continued support for nationalist ideals after their inherently violent nature was revealed. They further assert that there is no imprint of overt political beliefs in Eliade's scholarship, and also claim that Eliade's critics are following political agendas.&lt;ref name="rossfriesian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan S. Rennie]], ''Reconstructing Eliade: Making Sense of Religion'', [[State University of New York Press]], Albany, 1996, p.149–177. {{ISBN|0-7914-2763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanian scholar Mircea Handoca, editor of Eliade's writings, argues that the controversy surrounding Eliade was encouraged by a group of exiled writers, of whom Manea was a main representative, and believes that Eliade's association with the Guard was a conjectural one, determined by the young author's Christian values and [[Conservatism|conservative]] stance, as well as by his belief that a Legionary Romania could mirror Portugal's ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]''.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Handoca opined that Eliade changed his stance after discovering that the Legionaries had turned violent, and argued that there was no evidence of Eliade's actual affiliation with the Iron Guard as a political movement.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Additionally, Joaquín Garrigós, who translated Eliade's works into [[Spanish language|Spanish]], claimed that none of Eliade's texts he ever encountered show him to be an antisemite.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Mircea Eliade's nephew and commentator [[Sorin Alexandrescu]] himself proposed that Eliade's politics were essentially conservative and [[Patriotism|patriotic]], in part motivated by a fear of the [[Soviet Union]] which he shared with many other young intellectuals.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; Based on Mircea Eliade's admiration for [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]], various other authors assess that Eliade remained committed to [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Robert Ellwood also places Eliade's involvement with the Iron Guard in relation to scholar's conservatism, and connects this aspect of Eliade's life with both his nostalgia and his study of primal societies. According to Ellwood, the part of Eliade that felt attracted to the "freedom of new beginnings suggested by primal myths" is the same part that felt attracted to the Guard, with its almost mythological notion of a new beginning through a "national resurrection".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.100–101&lt;/ref&gt; On a more basic level, Ellwood describes Eliade as an "instinctively spiritual" person who saw the Iron Guard as a spiritual movement.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; In Ellwood's view, Eliade was aware that the "[[golden age]]" of antiquity was no longer accessible to secular man, that it could be recalled but not re-established. Thus, a "more accessible" object for nostalgia was a "secondary silver age within the last few hundred years"—the [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s 19th century cultural renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.xiv&lt;/ref&gt; To the young Eliade, the Iron Guard seemed like a path for returning to the silver age of Romania's glory, being a movement "dedicated to the cultural and national renewal of the Romanian people by appeal to their spiritual roots".&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.83"/&gt; Ellwood describes the young Eliade as someone "capable of being fired up by mythological archetypes and with no awareness of the evil that was to be unleashed".&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Eliade's withdrawal from politics, and also because the later Eliade's religiosity was very personal and idiosyncratic,&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.120"/&gt; Ellwood believes the later Eliade probably would have rejected the "corporate sacred" of the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.120"/&gt; According to Ellwood, the later Eliade had the same desire for a Romanian "resurrection" that had motivated the early Eliade to support the Iron Guard, but he now channeled it apolitically through his efforts to "maintain the culture of a free Romania" abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, p.115&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his writings, Eliade says, "Against the terror of History there are only two possibilities of defense: action or contemplation."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''The Forbidden Forest'', in Ellwood, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ellwood, the young Eliade took the former option, trying to reform the world through action, whereas the older Eliade tried to resist the terror of history intellectually.&lt;ref name="Ellwood, p.101"/&gt;

Eliade's own version of events, presenting his involvement in far right politics as marginal, was judged to contain several inaccuracies and unverifiable claims.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.202, 208–211, 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Eliade depicted his arrest as having been solely caused by his friendship with [[Nae Ionescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.202, 209&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, answering Gershom Scholem's query, he is known to have explicitly denied ever having contributed to ''[[Buna Vestire]]''.&lt;ref name="oscaderea"/&gt; According to [[Sorin Antohi]], "Eliade died without ever clearly expressing regret for his Iron Guard sympathies".&lt;ref name="Antohi p.xxiii"&gt;Antohi, preface to Liiceanu, p.xxiii&lt;/ref&gt; [[Z. Ornea]] noted that, in a short section of his ''Autobiography'' where he discusses the ''Einaudi'' incident, Eliade speaks of "my imprudent acts and errors committed in youth", as "a series of malentendus that would follow me all my life."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Ornea, p.210&lt;/ref&gt; Ornea commented that this was the only instance where the Romanian academic spoke of his political involvement with a dose of self-criticism, and contrasted the statement with Eliade's usual refusal to discuss his stances "pertinently".&lt;ref name="Ornea, p.210"/&gt; Reviewing the arguments brought in support of Eliade, Sergio Vila-Sanjuán concluded: "Nevertheless, Eliade's pro-Legionary columns endure in the newspaper libraries, he never showed his regret for this connection [with the Iron Guard] and always, right up to his final writings, he invoked the figure of his teacher Nae Ionescu."&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

In his ''Felix Culpa'', Manea directly accused Eliade of having embellished his memoirs in order to minimize an embarrassing past.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt; A secondary debate surrounding Eliade's alleged unwillingness to dissociate with the Guard took place after ''Jurnalul portughez'' saw print. Sorin Alexandrescu expressed a belief that notes in the diary show Eliade's "break with his far right past".&lt;ref name="scnostal"/&gt; [[Cătălin Avramescu]] defined this conclusion as "whitewashing", and, answering to Alexandrescu's claim that his uncle's support for the Guard was always superficial, argued that ''Jurnal portughez'' and other writings of the time showed Eliade's disenchantment with the Legionaries' Christian stance in tandem with his growing sympathy for [[Nazism]] and its [[Nazi occultism|pagan messages]].&lt;ref name="cavrcitim"/&gt; Paul Cernat, who stressed that it was the only one of Eliade's autobiographical works not to have been reworked by its author, concluded that the book documented Eliade's own efforts to "camouflage" his political sympathies without rejecting them altogether.&lt;ref name="pcommare"/&gt;

Oișteanu argued that, in old age, Eliade moved away from his earlier stances and even came to sympathize with the non-[[Marxism|Marxist]] Left and the [[hippie]] [[youth movement]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teodoist"/&gt; He noted that Eliade initially felt apprehensive about the consequences of hippie activism, but that the interests they shared, as well as their advocacy of [[communalism]] and [[free love]] had made him argue that hippies were "a quasi-religious movement" that was "rediscovering the sacrality of Life".&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, in Oişteanu, "Mircea Eliade şi mişcarea hippie"&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei Oișteanu, who proposed that Eliade's critics were divided into a "maximalist" and a "minimalist" camp (trying to, respectively, enhance or shadow the impact Legionary ideas had on Eliade), argued in favor of moderation, and indicated that Eliade's fascism needed to be correlated to the political choices of his generation.&lt;ref name="Oişteanu, Angajamentul..."/&gt;

===Political symbolism in Eliade's fiction===
Various critics have traced links between Eliade's fiction works and his political views, or Romanian politics in general. Early on, [[George Călinescu]] argued that the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] model outlined in ''Huliganii'' was: "An allusion to certain bygone political movements [...], sublimated in the ever so abstruse philosophy of death as a path to knowledge."&lt;ref name="Căl. p.959"/&gt; By contrast, ''Întoarcerea din rai'' partly focuses on a failed [[Communism|communist]] rebellion, which enlists the participation of its main characters.&lt;ref name="Căl. p.958"/&gt;

''Iphigenia''‍'s story of self-sacrifice, turned voluntary in Eliade's version, was taken by various commentators, beginning with [[Mihail Sebastian]], as a favorable allusion to the Iron Guard's beliefs on commitment and death, as well as to the bloody outcome of the 1941 [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; Ten years after its premiere, the play was reprinted by Legionary refugees in Argentina: on the occasion, the text was reviewed for publishing by Eliade himself.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt; Reading ''Iphigenia'' was what partly sparked Culianu's investigation of his mentor's early political affiliations.&lt;ref name="aoamniotica"/&gt;

A special debate was sparked by ''Un om mare''. Culianu viewed it as a direct reference to [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] and his rise in popularity, an interpretation partly based on the similarity between, on one hand, two monikers ascribed to the Legionary leader (by, respectively, his adversaries and his followers), and, on the other, the main character's name (''Cucoanes'').&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt; [[Matei Călinescu]] did not reject Culianu's version, but argued that, on its own, the piece was beyond political interpretations.&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt; Commenting on this dialog, literary historian and essayist [[Mircea Iorgulescu]] objected to the original verdict, indicating his belief that there was no historical evidence to substantiate Culianu's point of view.&lt;ref name="milaffaireii"/&gt;

Alongside Eliade's main works, his attempted novel of youth, ''Minunata călătorie a celor cinci cărăbuși in țara furnicilor roșii'', which depicts a population of red ants living in a totalitarian society and forming bands to harass the beetles, was seen as a potential allusion to the [[Soviet Union]] and to communism.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt; Despite Eliade's ultimate reception in [[Communist Romania]], this writing could not be published during the period, after [[Censorship|censors]] singled out fragments which they saw as especially problematic.&lt;ref name="ihincep"/&gt;

An endowed chair in the History of Religions at the [[University of Chicago]] Divinity School was named after Eliade in recognition of his wide contribution to the research on this subject; the current (and first incumbent) holder of this chair is [[Wendy Doniger]].

To evaluate the legacy of Eliade and [[Joachim Wach]] within the discipline of the history of religions, the University of Chicago chose 2006 (the intermediate year between the 50th anniversary of Wach's death and the 100th anniversary of Eliade's birth), to hold a two-day conference in order to reflect upon their academic contributions and their political lives in their social and historical contexts, as well as the relationship between their works and their lives.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics in History"/&gt;

In 1990, after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], Eliade was elected posthumously to the [[Romanian Academy]]. In Romania, Mircea Eliade's legacy in the field of the history of religions is mirrored by the journal ''Archaeus'' (founded 1997, and affiliated with the [[University of Bucharest]] Faculty of History). The 6th European Association for the Study of Religion and International Association for the History of Religions Special Conference on ''Religious History of Europe and Asia'' took place from September 20 to September 23, 2006, in [[Bucharest]]. An important section of the Congress was dedicated to the memory of Mircea Eliade, whose legacy in the field of history of religions was scrutinized by various scholars, some of whom were his direct students at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rahr.ro/RAHR/Conference2006/index.htm |title=''The Sixth EASR and IAHR Special Conference'' |accessdate=2009-07-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011070115/http://www.rahr.ro/RAHR/Conference2006/index.htm |archivedate=October 11, 2006 |df= }}; retrieved July 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As Antohi noted, Eliade, [[Emil Cioran]] and [[Constantin Noica]] "represent in [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]] ultimate expressions of excellence, [Eliade and Cioran] being regarded as proof that Romania's [[Interwar period|interwar]] culture (and, by extension, Romanian culture as a whole) was able to reach the ultimate levels of depth, sophistication and creativity."&lt;ref name="Antohi p.xxiii"/&gt; A [[TVR 1|Romanian Television 1]] poll carried out in 2006 nominated Mircea Eliade as the 7th Greatest Romanian in history; his case was argued by the journalist [[Dragoş Bucurenci]] (''see [[100 greatest Romanians]]''). His name was given to a boulevard in the northern Bucharest area of [[Primăverii]], to a street in [[Cluj-Napoca]], and to high schools in Bucharest, [[Sighişoara]], and [[Reşiţa]]. The Eliades' house on Melodiei Street was torn down during the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], and an apartment block was raised in its place; his second residence, on [[Dacia Boulevard]], features a memorial plaque in his honor.&lt;ref name="vilasanjpaseo"/&gt;

Eliade's image in contemporary culture also has political implications. Historian [[Irina Livezeanu]] proposed that the respect he enjoys in Romania is matched by that of other "nationalist thinkers and politicians" who "have reentered the contemporary scene largely as heroes of a pre- and anticommunist past", including Nae Ionescu and Cioran, but also [[Ion Antonescu]] and [[Nichifor Crainic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Irina Livezeanu]], ''Cultural Politics in Greater Romania: Regionalism, Nation Building and Ethnic Struggle, 1918–1930'', [[Cornell University Press]], [[New York City]], 1995, p.x. {{ISBN|0-8014-8688-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, according to Oişteanu (who relied his assessment on Eliade's own personal notes), Eliade's interest in the American hippie community was reciprocated by members of the latter, some of whom reportedly viewed Eliade as "a [[guru]]".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Eliade has also been hailed as an inspiration by [[Germany|German]] representatives of the ''[[Neue Rechte]]'', claiming legacy from the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] (among them is the controversial magazine ''[[Junge Freiheit]]'' and the essayist [[Karlheinz Weißmann]]).&lt;ref name="altitudini"&gt;[http://www.altitudini.ro/articles.php?ai=1399 "Biografia lui Mircea Eliade la o editură germană radicală de dreapta" ("Mircea Eliade's Biography at a Right-Wing Radical German Publishing House")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903051830/http://www.altitudini.ro/articles.php?ai=1399 |date=2007-09-03 }}, in [http://www.altitudini.ro/ ''Altitudini''], Nr. 17, July 2007; retrieved November 8, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Florin Ţurcanu's biographical volume on Eliade was issued in a German translation by the Antaios publishing house, which is mouthpiece for the ''Neue Rechte''.&lt;ref name="altitudini"/&gt; The edition was not reviewed by the mainstream German press.&lt;ref name="altitudini"/&gt; Other sections of the European [[far right]] also claim Eliade as an inspiration, and consider his contacts with the Iron Guard to be a merit—among their representatives are the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Neo-fascism|neofascist]] [[Claudio Mutti]] and Romanian groups who trace their origin to the Legionary Movement.&lt;ref name="Oişteanu, Angajamentul..."/&gt;

===Portrayals, filmography and dramatizations===
Early on, Mircea Eliade's novels were the subject of [[satire]]: before the two of them became friends, [[Nicolae Steinhardt]], using the pen name ''Antisthius'', authored and published [[Parody|parodies]] of them.&lt;ref name="Steinhardt, in Handoca"/&gt; [[Maitreyi Devi]], who strongly objected to Eliade's account of their encounter and relationship, wrote her own novel as a reply to his ''[[Bengal Nights (novel)|Maitreyi]]''; written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], it was titled ''[[Na Hanyate]]'' (translated into English as "It Does Not Die").&lt;ref name="kamani"/&gt; Several authors, including [[Ioan Petru Culianu]], have drawn a parallel between [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s [[Theatre of the Absurd|Absurdist]] play of 1959, ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'', which depicts the population of a small town falling victim to a mass metamorphosis, and the impact fascism had on Ionesco's closest friends (Eliade included).&lt;ref&gt;Oişteanu, "Angajamentul..."; Ornea, p.19, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Saul Bellow]] published his controversial ''[[Ravelstein]]'' novel. Having for its setting the [[University of Chicago]], it had among its characters Radu Grielescu, who was identified by several critics as Eliade. The latter's portrayal, accomplished through statements made by the eponymous character, is polemical: Grielescu, who is identified as a disciple of [[Nae Ionescu]], took part in the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Bucharest Pogrom]], and is in Chicago as a refugee scholar, searching for the friendship of a Jewish colleague as a means to rehabilitate himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2002-05-27&amp;art=103 "Portretul artistului ca delincvent politic" ("The Portrait of the Artist as a Political Offender"), Part I] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008065648/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?nr=2002-05-27&amp;art=103 |date=2007-10-08 }}, in ''[[22 (magazine)|22]]'', Nr.637, May 2002; retrieved July 16, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Romanian literary critic and translator Antoaneta Ralian, who was an acquaintance of Bellow's, argued that much of the negative portrayal was owed to a personal choice Bellow made (after having divorced from Alexandra Bagdasar, his Romanian wife and Eliade disciple).&lt;ref name="ralian"&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_19388-A-incetat-din-viata-laureatul-Premiului-Nobel-Saul-Bellow.htm Antoaneta Ralian, interviewed on the occasion of Saul Bellow's death] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110532/http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_19388-A-incetat-din-viata-laureatul-Premiului-Nobel-Saul-Bellow.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}, [[BBC|BBC Romania]], April 7, 2005 (hosted by hotnews.ro); retrieved July 16, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also mentioned that, during a 1979 interview, Bellow had expressed admiration for Eliade.&lt;ref name="ralian"/&gt;

The 1988 film ''[[The Bengali Night]]'', directed by Nicolas Klotz and based upon the French translation of ''Maitreyi'', stars [[United Kingdom|British]] actor [[Hugh Grant]] as Allan, the European character based on Eliade, while [[Supriya Pathak]] is Gayatri, a character based on Maitreyi Devi (who had refused to be mentioned by name).&lt;ref name="kamani"/&gt; The film, considered "[[Pornography|pornographic]]" by [[Hinduism|Hindu]] activists, was only shown once in [[India]].&lt;ref name="kamani"/&gt; In addition to ''The Bengali Night'', films based on, or referring to, his works, include: ''Mircea Eliade et la redécouverte du Sacré'' (1987), part of the television series ''Architecture et Géographie sacrées'', by [[Paul Barbă Neagră]]; ''[[Miss Christina (1992 film)|Domnişoara Christina]]'' (1992), by Viorel Sergovici; ''[[Eu Adam]]'' (1996), by [[Dan Pița]]; ''[[Youth Without Youth (film)|Youth Without Youth]]'' (2007), by [[Francis Ford Coppola]].

Eliade's ''Iphigenia'' was again included in theater programs during the late years of the [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] regime: in January 1982, a new version, directed by [[Ion Cojar]], premiered at the [[National Theater Bucharest]], starring [[Mircea Albulescu]], [[Tania Filip]] and [[Adrian Pintea]] in some of the main roles.&lt;ref name="raifigenia"/&gt; Dramatizations based on his work include ''[[La Țigănci]]'', which has been the basis for two theater adaptations: ''Cazul Gavrilescu'' ("The Gavrilescu Case"), directed by [[Gelu Colceag]] and hosted by the [[Nottara Theater]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Irina Margareta Nistor]], [http://agenda.liternet.ro/articol/5148/Irina-Margareta-Nistor/Un-cuplu-creator-de-teatru---Gelu-si-Roxana-Colceag.html "Un cuplu creator de teatru – Gelu şi Roxana Colceag" ("A Theater Producing Couple – Gelu and Roxana Colceag")], September 2001, at the [http://agenda.liternet.ro/ LiterNet publishing house]; retrieved January 18, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an eponymous play by director Alexandru Hausvater, first staged by the [[Odeon Theatre (Bucharest)|Odeon Theater]] in 2003 (starring, among others, [[Adriana Trandafir]], [[Florin Zamfirescu]], and [[Carmen Tănase]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adevarul.ro/index.php?section=articole&amp;screen=index&amp;id=39710&amp;duminica=1 "''La ţigănci''...&amp;nbsp;cu Popescu" (''To the Gypsy Girls''...&amp;nbsp;with Popescu")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327210015/http://www.adevarul.ro/index.php?section=articole&amp;screen=index&amp;id=39710&amp;duminica=1 |date=2008-03-27 }}, in ''[[Adevărul]]'', May 31, 2003; retrieved December 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, on Eliade's 100th birthday, the [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]] hosted the ''Mircea Eliade Week'', during which [[radio drama]] adaptations of several works were broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agenda.liternet.ro/articol/3964/Comunicat-de-presa/Saptamana-Mircea-Eliade-la-Radio-Romania.html "Săptămâna ''Mircea Eliade'' la Radio România" ("The ''Mircea Eliade'' Week on Radio Romania")] (2007 press communique) {{ro icon}}, at the [http://agenda.liternet.ro/ LiterNet publishing house]; retrieved December 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In September of that year, director and dramatist Cezarina Udrescu staged a [[multimedia]] performance based on a number of works Mircea Eliade wrote during his stay in [[Portugal]]; titled ''Apocalipsa după Mircea Eliade'' ("The Apocalypse According to Mircea Eliade"), and shown as part of a Romanian Radio cultural campaign, it starred [[Ion Caramitru]], [[Oana Pellea]] and [[Răzvan Vasilescu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandul.info/arte/scrieri-eliade-visniec-cadrul-festivalului-enescu.html?3940;909322 "Scrieri de Eliade şi Vişniec, în cadrul festivalului Enescu" ("Texts by Eliade and Vişniec, as Part of the Enescu Festival")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922041749/http://www.gandul.info/arte/scrieri-eliade-visniec-cadrul-festivalului-enescu.html?3940;909322 |date=2007-09-22 }}, in ''[[Gândul]]'', September 12, 2007; retrieved December 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Domnișoara Christina'' has been the subject of two [[opera]]s: the first, carrying the same Romanian title, was authored by Romanian composer [[Șerban Nichifor]] and premiered in 1981 at the Romanian Radio;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cimec.ro/Muzica/evenimadd/simn2004/ZiuaIV.htm ''Săptămâna Internaţională a Muzicii Noi.

'''Needs analysis''' is the formal process that sits alongside [[Requirements analysis]] and focuses on the human elements of the requirements.

==Introduction==

[[User-centered design]], according to Katz-Haas, is really about defining who the users are, defining their tasks and goals, their experience levels, what functions they want and need from a system, what information they want and need and understanding how the users think the system should work. [[User-centered design]] has also been linked to the identification of required job performance skills, the assessment of prospective trainees’ skills and the development of objectives.

The first step in any user centered design process is to understand the user’s needs.

Put simply, whereas [[requirements analysis]] focuses on the elements needed to be represented in the system, needs analysis focuses on the requirements related to the goals, aspirations and needs of the users and/or the user community and feeds them into the system requirement analysis process. The main purpose of needs analysis is the user’s satisfaction.

As it focuses on the needs of the human, needs analysis is not limited to addressing the requirements of just software, but can be applied to any domain, such as automotive, consumer product or services such as banking. Although it is not a business development tool, it can be used to help in the development of a business case.

We can identify the customers needs by three ways:
# Client request,
# Modification of an existing design,
# Generation of new product.

==Underlying principles of needs analysis==
The following list gives the principles of needs analysis as originally defined.
*	User’s need-based requirements are complex and can conflict
*	User’s need-based requirements build a bridge from the business case to the design
*	User’s need-based requirements help to identify trade-offs that need to happen in the design process (i.e., where a design cannot resolve the user’s need-based requirement conflicts)
*	User’s need-based requirements are there to unify the multi-disciplinary design team; enabling them to meet their business case.
*	Formulate and ask questions to do with the business plan that provide an indication of the human aspects of the system, including the relative merit of functionality.
*	Always express these findings from the user’s perspective.
*	Cross-relate these requirements to each other and to the impactors on the activity.
*	Allocate sufficient time during the development process to check and validate your user’s need-based requirements.
*	Ensure that all user’s need based requirements are derived as low level user requirements before being transposed into system requirements.
*	Word your requirements precisely and ensure that you cover all categories of human-related requirements.
*	Create test statements to validate the user’s need-based requirements, the concept and the implementation.
*	Prior to freezing your design, validate your user’s need-based requirements with users.
*	Accept that there still may be contradictory requirements.
*	Understand the nuances of the requirements and ensure that these are reflected in the precise wording of the requirements.
*	Keep asking your users until you have a true understanding of their requirements.
*	Elegant design can only be created from understanding the nuances of the requirements sharing ideas and fact toward feasibility of work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12869">The '''Organizational-Activational Hypothesis''' states that [[steroid hormones]] permanently organize the nervous system during early development, which is reflected in adult male or female typical behaviors.&lt;ref&gt; Phoenix CH, Goy RW, Gerall AA, Young WC. Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig. Endocrinology. 1959;65:369–382. &lt;/ref&gt; In adulthood, the same steroid hormones activate, modulate, and inhibit these behaviors. &lt;ref&gt; Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was revolutionary when first published in 1959 because no other previous experiment had demonstrated that adult behaviors could be determined hormonally during early development. &lt;ref&gt; Wallen, Kim. “The Organizational Hypothesis: Reflections on the 50th anniversary of the publication of Phoenix, Goy, Geral, and Young (1959).” Hormones and Behavior. 561. Web. 24 Mar. 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

The Phoenix et al. study sought to discover whether [[gonadal hormones]] given during the prenatal period had organizing effects on guinea pigs’ reproductive behavior&lt;ref&gt; Phoenix CH, Goy RW, Gerall AA, Young WC. Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig. Endocrinology. 1959;65:369–382.  &lt;/ref&gt; It was found that when female controls, gonadectomized (removal of gonads) females, hermaphrodites, and [[castrated]] males were injected prenatally with [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] proprionate, the mean number of mounts increased. This increase in male-typical reproductive behavior shows that prenatal androgens have a masculinizing effect. Moreover, the organizing effects of hormones can have permanent effects. Phoenix et al. found that females injected with testosterone propionate while pregnant, instead of neonatally, did not have any effect on [[lordosis]]. This demonstrates that when testosterone is given postnatally in females, there may not be lasting effects as compared to prenatally administered testosterone. The data from this study supports the organizational hypothesis that states when [[androgens]] are given prenatally there is an organizing effect on sexual behavior, permanently altering normal female mating behavior as adults. &lt;ref&gt; Phoenix CH, Goy RW, Gerall AA, Young WC. Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig. Endocrinology. 1959;65:369–382.  &lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms in sexual differentiation ==
Sexual behavior in rats is organized prenatally and activated with steroids hormones in adulthood.  &lt;ref&gt; Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In males high levels of testosterone produced by testes and travel to the brain. Here, testosterone is aromatized to an estradiol and masculinizes and defeminizes the brain. Thus, [[estradiol]] is responsible for many male-typical behavior. In females, the ovaries produce large amounts of [[estrogen]] during gestation. Rats have alpha-fetoprotein that binds to the estrogen before it can reach the brain. The estrogen is eventually metabolized in the liver. This protein has a low affinity for androgens. Therefore, testosterone can reach the brain without being taken up by alpha-fetoprotein. Due to fact that males have different levels of androgens in the brain, this can lead to organizing effects from androgen exposure with the expression of masculine behaviour.

== Main points of organizational-activational theory ==
The organizational-activational theory has three main components.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

#Organizational effects are permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Gomes et al. showed that organizational effects can last a lifetime. Newborn female mice were exposed to either endured one minute of the neonatal handling stress procedure for the first ten days postpartum or were not handled at all. As adults, sexual receptiveness was recorded and handled female mice showed less [[lordosis]] than non-handled female mice and had less serum progesterone. &lt;ref&gt; Gomes C. (2012). “Neonatal handling induces alteration in progesterone secretion after sexual behavior but not in angiotensin II receptor density in the medial amygdala: implications for reproductive success.” Life Sciences. 2867-2871. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Neonatal handling not only affected reproductive behavior, but also affected sympathetic nerve activity and glucocorticoid levels into adulthood, indicating that emotional stress during developmentally sensitive periods can permanently change behavior. &lt;ref&gt; Nugent BM. (2012). “Hormonal Programming Across the Lifespan.” Hormone and Metabolic Research. 577–586. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Organizational effects occur just prior to or after birth, but before neural tissues have matured.&lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Gorski et al. demonstrated the importance of the timing of hormonal influence in a study involving rats and the size of their [[medial preoptic nucleus]] (MPON). MPON size is a [[sexually dimorphic]] trait in that the MPON of male rats is larger than the MPON of female rats. But when male rats were castrated neonatally, their MPON was significantly smaller than male rats that were castrated after their brains were sexually differentiated. Despite both groups of males being castrated, the timing of the castration affected MPON size, indicating that organizational effects occur prior to maturation of neural tissues.&lt;ref&gt; Gorski R. (1978). “Evidence for a morphological sex difference within the medial preoptic area of the rat brain.” Brain Research. 333–346. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Organizational effects take place during a [[critical period]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Results from studies indicate that organizational effects are maximized during sensitive periods of brain development. One critical period is weeks 8-24 of gestation. Another sensitive period shortly after birth may exist with a peak in testosterone in male infants during postnatal months 1-5. &lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Auyeung et al. tested for an association between fetal and postnatal testosterone and autism in children. The results supported the idea that there is a critical period during which organizational effects occur. Fetal testosterone levels (taken from amniotic fluid during second trimester amniocentesis) and postnatal testosterone levels (from 18- to 24-month-olds' saliva) were compared with the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT), a measure of autistic traits in children. The authors found that only fetal testosterone was positively associated with Q-CHAT scores, signifying that fetal testosterone exposure during the critical period for sexual differentiation of the brain is associated with the development of autistic traits whereas postnatal androgens are not.&lt;ref&gt; Auyeung B. (2012). “Prenatal versus postnatal sex steroid hormone effects on autistic traits in children at 18 to 24 months of age.” Molecular Autism.17. Web. 25 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
There is evidence that organizational effects are not always permanent. In canaries, only the males produce song. Brain regions associated with bird song, including the hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudale (HVc) and nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA), are larger in male canaries. However, the HVc and RA grow significantly larger in gonadectomized female canaries if given testosterone at 11 months of age and these females even begin to sing. These two brain regions change morphologically due to testosterone, indicating that neural tissue can be changed due to steroid hormones despite being organized to react to sex hormones in a female- or male-specific way.&lt;ref&gt; Nottebohm F. (1980). “Testosterone triggers growth of brain vocal control nuclei in adult female canaries.” Brain Res.429-436. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence ==
=== Facts of [[Digit ratio|2D:4D]] ratio ===
Finger ratio has been examined in relation to a number of physical traits that show sex differences and evidence suggests it is influenced by the prenatal environment, although there is no direct evidence for the latter.&lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in men have been motivated by two conflicting hypotheses. On the one hand, homosexual men were hypothesized to be exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero, which would be associated with a lower 2D:4D ratio than that found in heterosexual men. On the other hand, homosexual men have been hypothesized to have low prenatal testosterone exposure, and data from two studies are consistent with that hypothesis, showing homosexual men to have a higher finger ratio (on both hands) than heterosexual men. &lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
   
=== Ovulation and gonadal secretion ===
The hormonal control of ovulation is also related to the organizational/activational hypothesis.  &lt;ref&gt; Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Both males and females rats exhibit luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses in which LH is released from the anterior pituitary due to the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Females, however, show an increase in LH pulse frequency around ovulation due to the positive feedback mechanism. When estrogen is increased in the blood, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the hypothalamus causes the release of GnRH. The GnRH surge brings about a surge in LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Since females have a cyclic gonadal function, there may be a sexual dimorphism in the gonadal secretion. When female rats are injected with testosterone there is no positive feedback occurring and no LH surge. Moreover, castrated males will exhibit LH surges, similar to female cyclic gonadal behavior.

'''''Passion: An Essay on Personality''''' is a philosophical inquiry into [[human nature]] by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. The book explores the individual and his relation to society, asking how one comes to an understanding of self and others. Unger here sees the root human predicament as the need to establish oneself as a unique individual in the world but at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context.

Unger’s aim is twofold. First, to level a critique, expansion, and defense of modern thinking about the human and society “so that this practice can better withstand the criticisms that philosophy since [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] has leveled against it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; And second, to develop a prescriptive theory of human identity centered on what Unger calls [[Passions (philosophy)|the passions]]—our raw responses to the world that are ambivalent towards reasons but also act in the service of reason. He outlines nine passions that organize and are organized by our dealings with others: lust, despair, hatred, vanity, jealousy, envy, faith, hope, and love. While these emotional states may be seen as raw emotion, their expression is always conditioned by the context within which the individual mobilizes or learns to mobilize them.

The book was critically hailed as successfully grappling with some of the most fundamental and enduring problems of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=768–771|doi=10.2307/1288775}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been put into direct dialogue with Kant's moral law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weirib|first=Ernest J.|title=Enduring Passion|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=June 1985|volume=94|issue=7|pages=1825–1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said to have provided one answer to [[Hume's Guillotine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1066-`083|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unger's analysis and the program he builds around this revolutionary understanding has also inspired new thinking and approaches to psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=791–816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Entering into a long philosophical tradition of inquiry into human nature, Unger begins by categorically rejecting the idea of a natural order to the world or a natural state of human organization. For Unger, there are no natural laws. Rather, he takes to the hilt the modernist thesis that we are shaped by context but not bound by context. As such, we have the power to work both within and beyond any constraints of social or cultural binds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Social Theory|year=2004|publisher=Verso|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This perspective is derived from the Christian-Romantic tradition. Unger argues that this tradition has two themes: interpersonal relations with love as the redemptive moment, and that a person's identity is not defined by membership in social ranks and division. This then gives expression to the idea that humans are never at home in the world and that they are constantly striving to remake the world. The modernist development takes up this theme but emphasizes interpersonal relations over impersonal reality or good so that no institutional settings can limit the possibilities of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; We “can assert [our] independence only by perpetual war against the fact of contextually…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normative force ===
In laying forth a view of human nature and prescription of self-affirmation, Unger recognizes that he faces the predicament of employing one system of thought that has developed out of particular historical circumstances and is thus no better or worse than any other system of thought. Indeed, under what auspices can such a philosophical orientation be turned into a normative prescription?

Unger turns this question from one of general principles to one of the enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="Unger 48"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.&lt;ref name="Unger 48"/&gt;

Unger looks closely at existential projects that fail: the heroic ethic (delusional about historic setting, which negates the ethic), and the impersonal absolute ethic ([[Buddhism]], which tries but cannot divest itself of the world). Both respond to the fact of the individual not being the center of the world. However, by doing so they disengage from the world and others. While [[Confucianism]] addresses interdependence, the philosophy elevates it to a level of canonical hierarchy and thus imposes strict constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Towards a psychology of empowerment ===
Unger sees the Christian-Romantic tradition as the one tradition that puts the individual at the center of the world and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat of the imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Passion begins with a long introductory foray into the [[Western philosophical tradition]] of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger that is at the heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion is at the heart of this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.&lt;ref name="BJ 1070"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1070|doi=10.2307/1340886|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5799&amp;context=faculty_scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part two, Unger attempts to explain how one becomes capable of passion. He charts out a path by which the individual first has desire, which is then augmented with imagination. The imagination reveals an insatiability of the infinite sense of self, which is but then contingent upon the acceptance of others. With this recognition, then, the contingency of the self is revealed. With the further realization of death we come to see that nothing outside of the self can fulfill desire; we want to see the self as transcending all of the fixed social world.

In part three, Unger addresses the passions themselves. As James Glass in ''Political Psychology'' writes, "Not only do these passions civilize and humanize experience; their practice transcends social status, framework, and stratification. Existing beyond class and history, they possess an autonomy that resists the disintegrative pull of power and self-interest, the historical and social differences induced by envy, jealousy, pride, and vanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glass|first=James|title=Review|journal=Political Psychology|date=December 1986|volume=7|issue=4|pages=799|doi=10.2307/3791216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unger describes each one in a way that brings out the need-danger antinomy and the context dependent-transcended dichotomy.&lt;ref name="BJ 1070"/&gt;

* Lust and despair are proto-social destructive forces that must be tamed for civil order to ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Hatred, vanity, jealousy, and envy underscore failures to accept one another's presence in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Faith, hope, and love resolve conflicts that seemed insoluble and break through barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part four charts the task ahead, which Unger says is to find the collective equivalents to the personal experiences of love, faith, and hope. We must strive to discover the structures that can realize these passions in the everyday world. All too often visions of the future human and environment exclude from social life the personal connections represented in the passions, choosing instead to focus on the recreation of the material world. Unger’s call, however, is to take full account of the passions so we may transcend our context and become more godlike.&lt;ref name="MLR 771"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book’s appendix is "A Program for Late Twentieth-Century Psychiatry," an apropos article previously published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=A Program for Late Twentieth-Century Psychiatry|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=February 1982|volume=139|issue=2|pages=155–164|doi=10.1176/ajp.139.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose argument can be summed up as "psychoanalytic theory offers opportunities to replicate, but not to transform, individual and social contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1071|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book has been met with critical but high acclaim in both legal and philosophical circles. In his ''Times'' review, Jerome Neu, celebrated the book as "some of the most brilliant writing of this kind since Hegel."  Other reviewers have similarly praised it for its "heretical presence both in contemporary social science and philosophy, a point of view that refuses both the "scorched earth campaign of radical skepticism" and the limitations of a social and political theory that roots meaning in transcendental or metaphysical absolutes."&lt;ref name="GJ 802"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glass|first=James|title=Review|journal=Political Psychology|date=December 1986|volume=7|issue=4|pages=802|doi=10.2307/3791216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet reviewers have also expressed reservations over "Unger's style, his normative reflections, his erudition and elusiveness."&lt;ref name="GJ 802"/&gt; The ''Michigan Law Review'' asked for a more concrete articulation of Unger's idea, claiming that he left both his idea of the individual and program for psychiatry too ambiguous. "That Unger's best society would be a place of playfulness and laughter is, however, only implicit in Passion, and Unger's failure to describe the mirthfulness of the world of love exemplifies the speculative tone that marks the central failure of the work as a whole."&lt;ref name="MLR 771"/&gt; Similarly, James Boyle in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' said that the speculative philosophy detracted from the effectiveness of the message, and thought the argument would have been better served with personal example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1083|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Allan Hobson, in the pages of the ''Northwestern University Law Review'', capitalized on the inspiration of Unger's thesis to develop a new psychiatric program in "advanc[ing] from a set of slogans to testable hypotheses."&lt;ref name="Hobson 792"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=792}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Unger for pinpointing the root of the problem--"Psychoanalysis is out of gas, and biological psychiatry is not yet up to speed. As a field in crisis, psychiatry is ripe for change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=791}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but found Unger's theory of personality and program "hopelessly inadequate" because it was too speculative and failed to address biological data.&lt;ref name="Hobson 792"/&gt; Hobson attempted to develop a theory that would incorporate this biological data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29000">'''Precycling''' is the practice of [[waste reduction|reducing waste]] by attempting to avoid bringing items which will generate [[waste]] into home or business. The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) also cites that precycling is the preferred method of integrated [[solid waste management]] because it cuts waste at its source and therefore trash is eliminated before it is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|pages=1382–1390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the EPA, precycling is also characterized as a decision-making process on the behalf of the consumer because it involves making informed judgments regarding a product’s waste implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=5|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implications that are taken into consideration by the consumer include: whether a product is [[Reuse|reusable]], [[durable]], or [[repairable]]; made from renewable or [[non-renewable resource]]s; [[over-packaged]]; and whether or not the container is reusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Philip R|last2=Walsh|first2=Patrick W|title=Source Reduction: Final Report|journal=Decision Maker's Guide to Solid Waste Management|date=1999|volume=2|page=6|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/municipal/dmg2/chapter5.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Precycling has the ability to build industrial, social, environmental, and economic circumstances that allow for old products to be converted into new resources &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1385}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Industrial: increasing the independence from accumulative substances, such as heavy metals, fossil fuels, synthetics, etc.
*Economic: create a [[circular economy]]
*Ecological/environmental: allowance for more extensive and diverse [[natural habitat]]s where the resources are returned to nature
*Societal: extend the capacity of precycling to meet everyone’s needs
The concept of ‘precycling’ was coined in 1988 by [[social marketing]] executive Maureen O’Rorke in a public waste education campaign for the City of Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=DiChristina|first1=Mariette|title=How We Can Win The War Against Garbage|magazine=Popular Science|year=1990|volume=237|issue=4|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The application of precycling is not limited to large corporations, but can be administered on smaller scales in local communities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The reason precycling is effective on large scales and on small scales stems from the idea that it shares a common language between experts and non-experts, buyers and sellers, economists and environmentalists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; However, it is important to consider that waste prevention systems, such as precycling, require the collaborative effort from several working parts.  These parts include prevention targets, producer responsibility, householder charging, funding for pilot projects, public involvement, engagement of private and third sectors, and public campaigns that spread awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|pages=193–219|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration of waste management==
The original three-pronged push for [[waste management]] is "[[Reduce, Reuse, Recycle]]." Precycling emphasizes "reducing and reusing", while harnessing and questioning the momentum and popularity of the term "recycle." In addition to this strategy, precycling incorporates four supplementary R’s: [[Repair]], Recondition, [[Remanufacturing|Remanufacture]] and Refuse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|pages=257–267|url= http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/ |doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste is a resource that can be reused, recycled, recovered, or treated.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1646|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precycling differs from other singular forms of waste prevention because it encompasses not one behavior, but many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=212|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reduce===
Reduce is a form of precycling that allows for the preservation of [[natural resources]] and also saves money on behalf of the manufacturer, the consumer, and the waste manager.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, effective source reduction slows the [[resource depletion|depletion of environmental resources]], prolongs the life of waste management facilities, and makes combustion and [[landfill]]s safer by removing [[toxic waste]] components.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Reuse===
[[Reuse]] is a form of precycling that reinvents items after their initial life and avoids creating additional waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bushnell|first1=Kristen|last2=Harpster|first2=Amy|last3=Simchuk|first3=Sarah|last4=Manckia|first4=Jen|last5=Stevens|first5=Cathy|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle|date=2009|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recycle===
Although precycling harnesses the familiarity of the term recycling, it is still important to note the difference between recycling and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since precycling focuses on the prevention of waste production, this entails that measures are taken before a substance, material, or product has become waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=195|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas recycling is a type of precycling that involves taking action before existing waste is abandoned to nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Recycling is a process where discarded materials are collected, sorted, processed, and used in the production of new products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=263|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/5495/|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every time a person engages in the act of recycling, they help increase the market and bring the cost down.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt; However, current research from the American Plastics Council states that only 25% of the nation’s recycling capabilities are being utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krug|first1=Donna|last2=County Agency|first2=Barton|title=It's Easy to be Green|date=2009|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally [[recycling]] requires large amounts of energy to "melt down" and then re-manufacture items. While this may cut down on the amount of trash that is going into [[landfill]]s, it is not sustainable unless the underlying energy supply is sustainable. In addition, recycling often means [[downcycling]] and always involves at least some loss of the original material, so primary extraction is still required to make up the difference. Precycling reduces these problems by using less material in the first place, so less has to be recycled.

===Repairing===
[[Repair]] is a type of precycling that corrects specified faults in a product, however the quality of a repaired product is inferior to reconditioned or remanufactured items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; One survey found that 68% of the respondents believed repairing was not cost efficient and sought alternative methods such as reconditioning or remanufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=260|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconditioning===
[[Reconditioning]] is a type of precycling that requires the rebuilding of major components to restore a product’s working condition, which is expected to be inferior to the original product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remanufacturing===
[[Remanufacturing]] is another type of precycling that involves the greatest degree of work content, which results in superior quality of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to remanufacture a product, it requires a total dismantling of the product and the subsequent restoration and replacement of its parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remanufacturing is a preferred method of waste reduction compared to repairing and reconditioning because it preserves the [[embodied energy]] that has been used to shape the components of a product for their first life and it only requires 20-25% of the initial energy used in formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=261|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refuse===
Refusal to buy certain products due to detrimental impacts on the environment or wasteful packaging is another type of precycling because the rejection of such items paves the way for products that can be reduced, reused, or recycled.&lt;ref name="Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter"/&gt;

==Zero-waste strategy==
A [[zero waste]] approach aims to prevent rather than just reduce accumulated waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero-waste goes beyond recycling to include the whole system, which includes the flow of resources and waste through human society.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This “design principle” works to maximize recycling, minimize waste, reduce consumption and ensures that products are reused, repaired or recycled back into nature or the market.&lt;ref name="Garbage &amp; Recycling"/&gt; This preventative approach is more manageable and effective than incremental approaches that focus on gradually reducing the amount of impact because it is less complex and contains less information, which permits wider public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
In regards to sustainability, the term itself is often associated with resource constraints and maintenance of the status quo rather than growth and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the implementation of a zero-waste management strategy, sustainable practices can push the status quo in order to create a society that is capable of development, technically and culturally advanced, dynamic in population and production, thoughtful with the use of non-renewable resources, and diverse, democratic, and challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1649|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic effects===
Increased waste production is often negatively associated with increased [[economic growth]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; However, a zero-waste management strategy allows for economic growth that works cohesively with sustainability rather than against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of a zero-waste strategy is part of an economic goal-set that aims to create a circular economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1383}}&lt;/ref&gt; A circular economy refers to a closed-loop socio-economic system that focuses on minimizing wastes while simultaneously maximizing stocks of resources for the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1384}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closed-loop design diverts linear (open-loop) waste disposal streams into new raw material streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=259|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a circular economy, one way to minimize waste is through the employment of precycling insurance, which allows for a full range of financed waste prevention opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of insurance would set premiums related to the risk of a product ending up as waste, and these premiums would serve to fund actions concerning waste prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; When establishing a premium for precycling insurance several factors need to calculated: recyclability or biodegradability; provision of infrastructure, habitat or collaborations for the generation of the product from new resources; the ecosystem concentrations of product components above natural levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of precycling insurance is plausible considering the aim of insurance industries is to avoid losses rather than paying for losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order for this idea to work, private and third sectors need to be involved and engaged in the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, a third sector refers to small charities and a handful of societal enterprises that coordinate with charity shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=204|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental effects===
According to the “Extended Producer Responsibility” principle,  impacts are substantially determined at the point of design where key decisions are made on materials, production process, and how products are used and disposed of at the end of life-cycle, which falls on the producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=258|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a circular economy there is the recognition that nature’s capacity needs to be maximized through the reprocess of biodegradable wastes produced by industries and human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task is accomplished through the procurement and funding of precycling insurance premiums that invest in systematic preservation of endangered habitats, careful harvesting of biological resources and expansions of productive ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in terms of climate change, precycling insurance offers a flexible alternative to the binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions and international taxation on mineral fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[waste management]] systems, the environment benefits from the reparation of products to the greatest degree because less energy is required and the majority of the original material is kept intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew M.|last2=Burgess|first2=Stuart C.|last3=Ijomah|first3=Winnie|last4=McMahon|first4=Chris A.|title=Reducing waste: repair, recondition, remanufacture or recycle?|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2006|volume=14|issue=4|page=265|doi=10.1002/sd.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal effects===
The social structure operating under a circular economy is referred to as a circular society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of a circular society is to create a cooperative culture by means of problem-prevention, resource-availability and fuller participation, with reference to precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1388}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One critique of this approach, in terms of waste management, is that it is difficult to maintain a cooperative culture within a society because it is constantly evolving and changing.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt;

==Raising awareness==
There is an increasing [[public awareness]] on the need for [[sustainable production]] and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopewell|first1=Jefferson|last2=Dvorak|first2=Robert|last3=Kosior|first3=Edward|title=Plastics recycling: challenges and opportunities|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2009|volume=364|issue=1526|page=2124|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0311|pmid=19528059|pmc=2873020}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campaign that aimed at raising awareness of precycling focused on whether people’s self-reported behaviors were affected by exposure to precycling advertisements on the radio, television, or in-store flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=12|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers concluded that the most effective results stemmed from the inclusion of social rewards that invoke an intrinsic motivation to engage in precycling behaviors.&lt;ref name=gillian&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillian|first1=Sheryl|last2=Werner|first2=Carol M.|last3=Olson|first3=Lynne|last4=Adams|first4=Dorothy|title=Teaching the concept of precycling: a campaign and evaluation.|journal=The Journal of Environmental Education|date=1996|volume=28|issue=1|page=16|doi=10.1080/00958964.1996.9942810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to raise awareness is through statistics that highlight the potential impacts that can be achieved through waste prevention. For instance, if 70 million Americans bought a half-gallon [[plastic-coated carton]] container of milk each week (instead of two quarts), then 41.6 million pounds of paper discards and 5.7 pounds of plastic discards would be reduced annually.  This transition from two quarts to a half-gallon would save $145.6 million on packaging each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
In order to effectively implement precycling practices and behaviors, the public needs to feel "enabled", "engaged", "encouraged", and "exemplified" in their efforts to partake in precycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=196|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only can the average consumer practice precycling, but industries can also participate. Purchasing from parts suppliers, reuse of chemicals, and reduction of unnecessary packaging are some methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Precycling|work=Environmental Encyclopedia|publisher=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some companies and countries that have taken it upon themselves to implement more sustainable practices that align with precycling principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seadon|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Sustainable waste management systems|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2010|volume=18|issue=16|page=1647|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2010.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Fonterra]] reduced its packaging through the implementation of bulking, reuse and redesign.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey K 2010"/&gt; Further, [[Waste in New Zealand|Waste Management New Zealand]] created Recycle New Zealand, which provided a subsidiary focusing on the collection of materials that could be diverted and sorted prior to the operations of reducing, recycling, or recovering.  Moving forward, free-trade organizations can further implement precycling practices by exploring this strategy as a new way to reduce regulations and to promote greater industrial freedom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greyson|first1=James|title=An economic instrument for zero waste, economic growth and sustainability|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2006|volume=15|issue=2007|page=1389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the individual consumer can develop precycling habits by engaging in the following practices and behaviors:

==="Enviro-shopping"===
Enviro-shopping is considered shopping with the environment and implements a precycling strategy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Marie|last2=Papadi|first2=Joan|last3=Gutter|first3=Michael|title=Enviroshopping: Buy Smarter|date=2007|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Bringing one's own grocery bag or bring old ones back to the store 
*Buying packages with the least amount of packaging 
*Buying in bulk, but not buying more than one will use
*Looking for products with reusable dishes

===Product selection===
Products to choose from in accordance with precycling principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curbside Cleanup|first1=Day|title=Garbage &amp; Recycling|journal=Earth 7|date=2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Plastic milk jugs or glass milk containers (no cartons)
*Fresh fruit and vegetables
*Concentrated products that involves less packaging
*Recycled products
*[[Rechargeable battery|Rechargeable batteries]]

===Behaviors===
In addition to shopping practices that implement precycling principles, there are also behaviors that can be undertaken to prevent waste:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Jayne|last2=Giorgi|first2=Sarah|last3=Veronica|first3=Sharp|last4=Strange|first4=Kit|last5=Wilson|first5=David C.|last6=Blakey|first6=Nick|title=Household waste prevention - a review of evidence|journal=Waste Management &amp; Research|date=2010|volume=28|issue=3|page=200|doi=10.1177/0734242x10361506}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Home [[compost]]ing
*Avoid [[Advertising mail|junk mail]]
*Buy [[used good|second-hand]]
*One way to participate in precycling is to carry a "precycling kit". Include a [[Tupperware]] or non-[[disposable]] container, [[silver (household)|silverware]] set, a [[napkin|cloth napkin]] or [[handkerchief]], and a [[thermos]] or water-bottle within a [[cloth]] bag that can double as a [[grocery bag|grocery/shopping bag]].

'''[[Probiotic]]s''' are defined to be non-pathogenic strains of organism that are incorporated into the diet to modify [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gut]] microbial ecology, leading to beneficial structural and functional changes in the gut. Some probiotics may serve as a barrier for the colonization of [[pathogen]]s to prevent disease and enhance the [[immune system]]. In addition, some may carry out [[Metabolism|metabolic]] functions such as helping the fermentation of nondigestible fibres, and storing energy in the form of short-chain [[fatty acid]]s. Of all the types of gut microbiota, ''[[Bifidobacteria]]'' and ''[[Lactobacilli]]'' are considered the two most essential bacteria beneficial to human health while ''[[Staphylococci]]'' and ''[[Clostridia]]'' are considered pathogenic to human health.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Health effects==

===Diarrhea===
As many prevention methods for diarrhea have adverse effects (e.g. intestinal [[intussusception (blood vessel growth)|intussusception]] in the usage of [[rotavirus]] vaccine), scientists are now turning to probiotics in hope of using it as a supplement to treat acute diarrhea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huang | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Bousvaros | first2 = A. | last3 = Lee | first3 =  | year = 2002 | title = Efficacy of Probiotic Use in Acute Diarrhea in Children: A Meta-analysis | url = | journal = Digestive Diseases and Sciences | volume = 47 | issue = 11| pages = 2625–2634| doi = 10.1023/A:1020501202369}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review that covered 34 masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trials related to diarrhea and probiotics, it was concluded that there was an overall reduction of 52% in antibiotic associated diarrhea, an 8% reduction in traveller’s diarrhea, and a 34% reduction in other types of acute diarrhea. These numbers reflect a protective effect against diarrhea in subjects including both adults and children. In terms of children (age &lt; 18 years), seven out of the 12 trials conducted in a health care setting showed a reduction in acute diarrhea of 57%. There was no significant difference in the protective effect of strains, namely ''[[Saccharomyces boulardii]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus rhamnosus]] GG'', ''[[Lactobacillus acidophilus]]'', and ''[[Lactobacillus bulgaricus]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sazawal|first1=S.|last2=Hiremath|first2=G.|last3=Dhingra|first3=U.|last4=Malik|first4=P.|last5=Deb|first5=S.|last6=Black|first6=R.

Probiotics were found to be effective in treating acute, infectious diarrhea in children when a review was completed in 2001, involving &gt; 700 children aged from one to 48 months with acute diarrhea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Szajewska | first1 = H. | last2 = Mrukowicz | first2 = J. | year = 2001 | title = Probiotics in the Treatment and Prevention of Acute Infectious Diarrhea in Infants and Children: A Systematic Review of Published Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials | url = | journal = Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = S17–S25 | doi=10.1097/00005176-200110002-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 review showed that ''Lactobacillus'' reduced the average duration of acute diarrhea by 0.7 days and stool frequency by 1.6 on the second day of treatment. Dosage was most effective at more than ten billion [[colony-forming unit]]s of ''Lactobacillus'' during the first 48 hours of diarrhea.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Niel | first1 = C.

====Antibiotic-associated diarrhea====
[[File:Pseudomembranous colitis.JPG|thumb|Pseudomembranous colitis.]]

This illness can generally be accounted for by ''Clostridium difficile'', a bacterium that can sometimes cause severe diarrhea known as [[pseudomembranous colitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartlett | first1 = J. G. | last2 = Chang | first2 = T. W. | last3 = Gurwith | first3 = M. | last4 = Gorbach | first4 = S. | last5 = Onderdonk | first5 = A. B. | year = 1987 | title = Antibiotic-associated Pseudomembranous Colitis due to Toxin-producing Clostridia | doi = 10.1056/nejm197803092981003| journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 298 | issue = 10| pages = 531–534 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of six trials related to antibiotic-associated diarrhea in 766 children aged one month to six years, there was an overall reduction in [[Antibiotic-associated diarrhea|AAD]] when children were fed probiotics. The reduction, when compared to placebo, was seen to be from 28.5% to 11.9%; in fact, when patients were fed probiotics along with their dose of antibiotics, one fewer patient would develop AAD out of every seven. Antibiotics fed to the children in the trials included [[amoxicillin]], [[penicillin]] and [[erythromycin]]. Evidence suggests that ''S. boulardii'' is best at preventing AAD in children, ''Lactobacillus GG'' ranking second, and a mixture of ''S. thermophilus'' and ''B. lactis'' relatively ranking last. No conclusion can be made on how probiotics can reduce the risk of AAD from any specific types of antibiotic.&lt;ref name=ReferenceC/&gt;

One of the proposed mechanisms of how probiotics protect from AAD is by regulating the composition of organisms in the intestines. Studies involving ''L. acidophilus'' and ''Bifidobacterium'' suggest that these microbes inhibit the growth of facultative [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]], which tends to increase during antibiotic treatment. As a result, it is seen that probiotics can alter and prevent changes in the intestinal [[microflora]] caused by antibiotics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yan|first1=F|last2=Polk|first2=D. B.|year=2006|title=Probiotics as Functional Food in the Treatment of Diarrhea|url=|journal=Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care|volume=9|issue=6|pages=717–721|doi=10.1097/01.mco.0000247477.02650.51|pmid=17053425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Viral diarrhea ====
[[File:Rotavirus !.jpg|thumb|a three dimensional model of [[Rotavirus]].]]

Viral diarrhea refers to the type of diarrhea that is caused by a [[rotavirus]], a virus often impacting toddlers and infants. A meta-analysis of nine previously conducted studies (those studies were conducted in Canada, Thailand, and Finland) has shown that certain types of probiotics are also effective in treating viral diarrhea in hospital-admitted children. Subjects of those studies ranged from one to above 36 months old. The study results showed that ''the duration of the illness was shortened by 0.7 days on average'' when placing the children on [[Lactobacillus]] therapy. 

Although it is still largely unknown as to how probiotics do this, two mechanisms have been currently proposed. The first mechanism suggests that ''Lactobacilli'' augment the development of intestinal [[mucins]] (glyosylated proteins), which consequently protect the body from intestinal infections.{{medical citation needed|date=August 2017}}

====Persistent diarrhea====
A 2013 review suggested probiotics are effective in treating persistent diarrhea in children, though more research is needed. Persistent diarrhea is an episode that starts acutely but then lasts for 14 days or more; In [[Developing country|developing countries]] it is an important cause of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and mortality in children under five years old. The study showed average duration reduced by four days and shorter hospital stay; stool frequency was reduced on the fifth day.&lt;ref name="Cochrane 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernaola Aponte|first=G|author2=Bada Mancilla C |author3=Carreazo N |author4= Rojas Galarza R |title=Probiotics for persistent diarrhoea in children|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=August 2013|issue=8|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007401.pub3#sthash.DwpPRows.dpuf|url=http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD007401/probiotics-for-persistent-diarrhoea-in-children|accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allergy===
Probiotics are commonly given to breast-feeding mothers and their young children to prevent eczema, but  some doubt exists over the strength of evidence supporting this practice.&lt;ref name=eczema&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cuello-Garcia CA, Brożek JL, Fiocchi A, Pawankar R, Yepes-Nuñez JJ, Terracciano L, Gandhi S, Agarwal A, Zhang Y, Schünemann HJ |title=Probiotics for the prevention of allergy: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials |journal=J.

'''Proximates''' are used in the analysis of biological materials as a decomposition of a human-consumable good into its major constituents.  They are a good approximation of the contents of packaged comestible goods and serve as a cost-effective and easy verification of nutritional panels. This means that testing can be used to verify lots, but cannot be used to validate a food processor or food processing facility; instead, a nutritional assay must be conducted on the product to qualify said producers. Nutritional panels in the United States are regulated by the FDA and must undergo rigorous testing to ensure the exact and precise content of nutrients. This should prevent food processors from making unfounded claims to the public.&lt;ref group=FDA&gt;{{cite web|title=Labeling &amp; Nutrition|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064894.htm|work=Guidance for Industry: A Food Labeling Guide (7. Nutrition Labeling; Questions G1 through P8)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industry, the standard proximates are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silliker Labs|url=http://www.merieuxnutrisciences.com/us/eng/silliker/our-solutions/chemistry/food-quality/345|work=Food Quality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Covance|url=http://nutri.covance.com/catalog/4-addassay.php?assay_id=238|work=Proximate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurofins|url=http://www.eurofinsus.com/services/Proximate_Testing.html|work=Proximate Testing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ash
*Moisture
*Proteins
*Fat
*Carbohydrates (calculated)
Analytically, four of the five constituents are obtained via chemical reactions and experiments. The fifth constituent, carbohydrates, are calculated based on the determination of the four others. Proximates should nearly always account for 100% of a food product; any deviation from 100% displays the resolution of the chemical test, as small variations in the way each test is performed accumulate or overlap the compositional make-up.

There are additional ingredients that may fall under the category of one of the five constituents. Carbohydrates, for example, include but are not limited to:
*Dietary fibers
*Sugars
*Sugar alcohol 
Whereas ash includes but is not limited to:
*Dietary minerals (sodium, potassium, iron, calcium)
*Vitamins (β-Carotene, retinol, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, B vitamins)  
Although proximates do not give the entire nutritional assay, they are an inexpensive way to track deviations in the quality of foods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3503">The '''Russian National Corpus''' (English official name; the Russian name is '''Национальный корпус русского языка''', lit. the National Corpus of the Russian language, but as the official English variant the Russian National Corpus is used) is a [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] of the [[Russian language]] that has been partially accessible through a query interface online since April 29, 2004. It is being created by the Institute of Russian language, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

It currently contains more than 600 million word forms&lt;ref&gt;http://ruscorpora.ru/&lt;/ref&gt; that are automatically lemmatized and [[Part of speech|POS]]-/grammeme-tagged, i. e. all the possible morphological analyses for each orthographic form are ascribed to it. Lemmata, POS, grammatical items and their combinations are searchable. Additionally, 6 million word forms are in the subcorpus with manually resolved [[homonymy]]. &lt;!---A statistical program that resolves homonymy using the manually tagged corpus as a [[machine-learning tool]] is already constructed and the results will be made available online soon.---&gt;

The subcorpus with resolved morphological [[homonymy]] is also automatically [[stress (linguistics)|accent]]uated. The whole corpus has a searchable tagging concerning [[lexical semantics]] (LS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Apresjan | first1 = Ju. | last2 = Boguslavsky | first2 = I. | last3 = Iomdin | first3 = B. | last4 = Iomdin | first4 = L. | last5 = Sannikov | first5 = A. | last6 = Sizov | first6 = V. | year = 2006 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.111.8165 | title = A Syntactically and Semantically Tagged Corpus of Russian: State of the Art and Prospects | conference = Proceedings of LREC | location = Genova, Italy | pages = 1378–1381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including morphosemantic POS subclasses (proper noun, reflexive pronoun etc.), LS characteristics proper (thematic class, causativity, evaluation), derivation (diminutive, adverb formed from adjective etc.).

The  RNC includes also the following subcorpora:
*a [[treebank]] of [[syntax|syntactical]] dependencies (largely based on the [[Igor Mel'čuk]]'s [[Meaning-Text Theory]])
*English⇔Russian, German⇒Russian, Ukrainian⇔Russian and Belorussian⇔Russian [[parallel corpus|parallel corpora]];
*a large (100+ million words) separate corpus of modern newspapers (2001–2011);
*a corpus of Russian [[poetry]], where the rhyming words and poetic [[Prosody (poetry)|prosody]] (including meter, stanzas etc.) is additionally tagged;
*a corpus of Russian [[dialect]]s with specific dialect grammar tagging;
*a multimedia corpus with searchable tagged fragments of Russian-language movies;
*a corpus showing the history of Russian [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]
*an educational subcorpus reflecting school standards.

All the texts have tags bearing metatextual information - the author, his/her birth date, creation date, text size, text genres (general fiction, detective story, newspaper article etc.); all these categories are browsable and searchable separately. It is possible to define a user's subcorpus to search  lemmata/POS-grammeme/semantic tags combinations only within this subset.

'''School-related gender-based violence''' ('''SRGBV''') can be defined as acts or threats of [[Sexual violence|sexual]], [[Violence|physical]] or [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]] happening in and around schools. This type of violence is due to [[Gender role|gender norms and stereotypes]]. It can include [[verbal abuse]], [[bullying]], [[sexual abuse]], harassment and other types of violence. SRGBV is widely spread around the world and is common in many societies. Millions of children and families suffer from this type of violence. Incidents related to SRGBV has been reported in all countries and regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002466/246651E.pdf|title=Global guidance on addressing school-related gender-based violence|last=UNESCO and UN Women|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UN Women|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100191-8|location=19, 23-24, 26, 28, 31, 34|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scale ==
Many governments and organizations around the world are working towards getting reliable information regarding SRGBV, as it has been proved to be an urgent matter that should be solved. Based on all the data related to SRGBV around the world collected, it is important to try to find solutions in order to tackle this problematic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For instance, [[UNICEF|UNICEF's]] report ''Hidden in Plain Sight'' included the largest collection of data relating to violence against children. As aforementioned, this report proofs how physical and sexual abuse takes place at schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2014. ''Hidden in Plain Sight: A Statistical Analysis of Violence against Children''. New York, UNICEF. http:// les.unicef.org/publications/ les/Hidden_in_plain_sight_statistical_analysis_EN_3_Sept_2014.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of abuse include:
* Bullying, with one out of three students between the ages of 13 and 15 worldwide claiming to suffer from this type of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Sexual violence, with one in 10 girls under 20 experiencing such violence. According to the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ), two out of five school directors in Southern and Eastern Africa recognize sexual harassment happened among pupils of their establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO/UNGEI. 2015. ''School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all''. Global Monitoring Report Policy Paper 17, March 2015. Paris, UNESCO. http:// unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232107e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also [[corporal punishment]] at school is considered to be a worrying type of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, M., Robles, O., Stout, K. and Suvilaakso, T. 2013. ''A Girls’ Rights to Learn without Fear: Working to end Gender-Based Violence at School''. Toronto, Plan Canada. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://plan-international.org/about-&lt;/nowiki&gt; plan/resources/publications/campaigns/a-girl2019s-right-to-learn-without-fear/&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty percent of the children population in the world live in countries where protection against corporal punishment is inexistent (at the legal and at the moral level).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Disadvantaged groups are also victims of SRGBV. It has been reported that more than 3000 schoolchildren from Uganda, out of which 24 per cent of girls between 11 and 14 years old suffering from disabilities are victims of sexual violence. 12 per cent of girls who do not suffer from disability are victims of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Devries, K., Kyegome, N., Zuurmond, M., Parkes, J., Child, J., Walakira, E. and Naker, D. 2014. Violence against primary school children with disabilities in Uganda: a cross-sectional study. ''BMC Public Health'', Vol. 14, p. 1,017.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Gay bashing|Homophobic bullying]] is one of the most common forms of bullying. According to research by [[UNESCO]], more than 60 per cent of [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBTI]] children in Chile, Mexico and Peru were bullied. More than 55 per cent of self-identified LGBTI students in Thailand communicated they were being bullied; in the United Kingdom, over 90 per cent of secondary school students reported homophobic bullying in their schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012a. Good Policy and Practice in HIV and Health Education: Education Sector Responses to Homophobic Bullying, Booklet 8. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0021/002164/216493e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Several country-based examples, including New Zealand and Norway show that lesbian, gay and bisexual students are three times more likely to be bullied than heterosexual students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016. ''Out in the open. Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cyberbullying|Cyber-bullying]] is also another issue which needs to be resolved. In the US, the majority of victims suffering from cyber-bullying encounter the same problems at school. They are also bullied within their institutions. Girls are more likely to suffer rom cyber-bullying than boys (Schneider et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, S., O’Donnell, L., Stueve, A. and Coulter, R. 2012. Cyberbullying, School Bullying, and Psychological Distress: A Regional Census of High School Students. ''American Journal of Public Health'', Vol. 102, No. 1, pp. 171–177.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Root causes&amp;nbsp;==
Social beliefs influence gender relations in all countries of the world. In this sense, the root of violence against children depends on social construction and how the populations behave vis-a-vis gender-related issues. Some of the root issues include:
* Gender discriminatory norms: These promote the belief according to which men are more powerful than women and that they can prove their power because they are stronger. In many societies, [[Gender role|dominant gender norms]] prevail and influence people. LGBTI people, who do not follow these gender norms often suffer from violence if they do not comply with these norms. Indeed, many people often consider LGBT people as not "proper" and judge them inciting violence against this group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Use of violence to show power: Authority is often shaped by held beliefs that promote male domination among women. At the school level, this implies male and female teachers are more powerful that children, perpetrating the belief that teachers have power over children. Then, authority is reinforced and maintained.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Other factors include [[Economic inequality|income inequality]], as it is a proof of social constraints.  Moreover, [[social media]], [[Child grooming#Over the Internet|online grooming]] and [[Internet troll|trolling]] – also facilitate violence among children, as this spaces are difficult to track down by the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Schools and the education system in general follow a specific social and structural framework. The dynamics of the education sector produce and reproduce environments potentially dangerous for children. It is the system itself which unintentionally exposes children to types of violence that might at times replicate, reinforce or recreate power dynamics followed by the society and the people belonging to this. There are several actors in society who are responsible for participating in and creating these dynamics, including policy-makers, authority figures, teachers, parents, other students and others. In order for these dynamics to change, a lot of effort is required at schools and in society in general.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
Being exposed or having experienced SRGBV can have critical impacts on children's development. Especially in terms of mental and physical well-being, including children's health (HIV and early pregnancy). It has been demonstrated that victims of violence are more likely to accept aggressive types of behaviors or be violent themselves after suffering from violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Heise, L. 2011. What works to prevent partner violence? London, STRIVE, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/system/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/attachments/What%20works%20to%20 prevent%20partner%20violence.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a vicious circle in which violence becomes wrongly acceptable. SRGBV can have negative and long-term consequences for the future of young people, as it forges their adult personalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Educational outcomes ===
* Lack of concentration
* Inability to study
* Falling grades
* Disruption in class
* Non-school attendance
* Dropping out of school&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Challenges of addressing SRGBV ==
Addressing SRGBV raises important challenges and is very complex. The concept is not understood by many and is considered sensitive for many. Actors from the education sector, governments and policy-makers and individuals attending schools face several challenges regarding SRGBV. These include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social cultural norms ===
Reporting on SRGBV situations around the world has become especially difficult since social and cultural norms do not promote this practice. Moreover, implicitly they discourage it. Many actors from society including teachers; school directors and policy-makers still avoid talking to children openly about gender; violence and sex. They fear promoting sensitive materials to children because of the taboo present in society. Work, time and patience are required to overcome set-ideas promoted by parents within their communities. It is necessary to start real and honest dialogues with children in order to create guaranty real and long-lasting results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gender inequality ===
[[Gender inequality|Gender inequalities]] refer to the devaluation and discrimination of women an girls in a society. This results on giving more power to men and boys, while demeaning women and girls. For instance, a study in Ethiopia highlighted that even though 93 per cent of male students recognized violence against girls to be illegal, about 33 per cent thought it is acceptable for male students to have what they want, and appeal to their charm or force to get. 21 per cent recognized behaving this way.&lt;ref&gt;ActionAid. 2004. ''Stop Violence against Girls in Schools''. London, ActionAid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Capacity constraints ===
Capacity constraints in education systems, are also responsible for slowing down the progress related to preventing SRGBV. One of the most important challenges is the training of teachers with the tools and sensitivity to teach curriculum against violence and promote gender equality. In order for real change to happen, it is necessary to introduce these new tools slowly, analyzing who is the best to communicate these elements and what skills and knowledge are needed. What's more, having enough resources will be very important to implement change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak coordination and monitoring mechanisms ===
Another factor that limits the progress related to stopping SRGBV is weak coordination and unreliable monitoring mechanisms. These render difficult the collaboration between ministries of education, police, social services, child protection and more. This is important because if this collaboration is not fluent, it will be difficult to stop SRGBV. A renewal in the organization's cultural landscape will be needed to overcome challenges, including bureaucracy that disrupts the flow of knowledge sharing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak service support for victims ===
Limited access to quality services, including child protection an social services among others (often absent) are due to the quality of services. This particularly concerns fragile communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Lack of governance ===
In the majority of countries, there is currently no legislation that protects children from violence at school, meaning not much can be done when it happens. However, it is the case that some countries have recently introduced legislations specifically for schools. This said, legislation related aspects have become a real challenge. As to stop SRGBV, perpetrators must be punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Limited evidence ===
Emerging, but limited, evidence base on what works, although this is an area that is receiving increasing attention. The few evaluations of SRGBV interventions that currently exist vary greatly in methodology, rigour, scale and scope. This makes it difficult to identify best practice and draw conclusions about effective strategies that can be transferred to other settings. There is also a growing body of promising practices and existing knowledge that has not yet been fully documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Insufficient data and research ===
As previously mentioned, many challenges slow down the reporting and impact on the quality of providing reliable data regarding certain types of violence. This implies data is incomplete in contexts such as sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability among others. This is important as all of these contexts are important to fight against SRGBV. According to a recent study by [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], to tackle SRGBV it is necessary to rely on large-scale studies which include findings that can be compared across countries; studies showing different forms of SRGBV, connections between behavior change and a discrepancy between research and practice. It is necessary to invest in strong data management system tools which divide data and will make it easier for people to analyze it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;RTI International. 2016. ''Literature Review on School-Related Gender-Based Violence: How it is Defined and Studied''. Washington, DC: U.S. Agency for International Development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Six guiding strategies for national action ==

=== Leadership: Laws, policies and education reform ===
Governments should demonstrate leadership at the national level by:
* developing and implementing laws to protect children from violence, ensuring accountability and treating all children equally
* adopting a comprehensive, multisectoral national policy and action plan to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* strengthening connections between education and child protection policies, procedures and systems
* reforming the education system for an enhanced and holistic response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Environment: Ensuring schools are safe and supportive ===
In order to render schools safer, it is important to adopt whole-school approaches that will create better environments for children. Also different types of stakeholders at the school level  should become engaged at local communities and government. There are three specific strategies:
* creating safe and welcoming spaces
* ensuring governing bodies and school management send strong messages that SRGBV is not acceptable and is taken seriously
* developing and implementing codes of conduct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Prevention: Curriculum, teaching and learning ===
At the education sector level, students should be taught in a certain way and certain topics. In order to prevent SRGBV, it is important to: 
* [[curriculum]] approaches that prevent violence and promote gender equality
* training education staff to give them the tools to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* safe spaces where co-curricular interventions can be a useful entry point for addressing SRGBV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Responses: In and around schools ===
* When SRGBV does occur, there should be clear, safe and accessible procedures and mechanisms in place for reporting incidents, assisting victims and referring cases to the appropriate authorities. Key strategies include:
* providing easily accessible, child-sensitive and confidential reporting mechanisms
* providing counseling and support
* referral to law enforcement and healthcare services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Partnerships: Collaborating with and engaging key stakeholders ===
SRGBV being a very complex issue, it is necessary to involve many and several types of stakeholders. Thus it is about creating partnerships in order to tackle SRGBV:
* coordination/collaboration between key ministries as well as at the district level
* partnerships with teachers’ unions
* participation of girls and boys
* working with families and the wider communities
* engaging civil society organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Evidence: Monitoring and evaluation ===
* National action should be informed by research and data on SRGBV, including:
* formative research on SRGBV to inform policy and programme development
* comprehensive national data collection systems
* indicators to track progress
* evaluations to assess impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''shift register lookup table''', also '''shift register LUT''' or '''SRL''', refers to a component in [[digital circuitry]]. It is essentially a [[shift register]] of variable length. The length of SRL is set by driving address pins high or low and can be changed dynamically, if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xilinx.com/itp/xilinx7/books/data/docs/lib/lib0368_354.html 16-Bit Shift Register Look-Up-Table (LUT)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521101057/http://www.xilinx.com/itp/xilinx7/books/data/docs/lib/lib0368_354.html |date=May 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SRL component is used in [[FPGA]] devices.
The SRL can be used as a programmable delay element.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18514">Animals, including siblings, compete for resources such as food, territory, and potential mating partners. In animal [[sibling rivalry]], individuals compete for parental care or limited resources, which can sometimes result in siblicide.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, J. R., and N. B. Davies. An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Sibling rivalry''' occurs in many different forms. Siblings may compete for resources in a prenatal and/or post-birth environment. The degree of rivalry varies, ranging from a low level of violence in non-aggressive to the killing of kin in siblicide.

== Function of behavior ==
[[File:Nesting bluefoot.jpg|thumb|right|Blue-footed booby nesting with multiple eggs. If more than one egg hatches successfully, the chicks may compete with each other for food and attention from parents.]]
When there are multiple offspring in a single brood, the potential for sibling rivalry arises due to competition for food and parental attention. [[Natural selection]] may favor behaviors that allow an individual offspring to gain more resources, even if the behavior decreases a sibling's fitness.  Competition for food and resources can be seen in many bird species. For example, [[blue-footed booby]] (''Sula nebouxii'')  siblings often exhibit aggression towards each other, with older chicks pecking at younger chicks. This behavior increases when there are food shortages, indicating more intense competition.&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, Hugh and Cecilia Garcia Chavelas. "Food Shortage Influences Sibling Aggression in the Blue-Footed Booby." Animal Behaviour 37.5 (1989): 806-19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In other bird species, siblings compete for food through manipulation of parental behavior rather than direct aggressive acts. Increased parental attention may mean more food for the offspring, favoring the development of begging behavior in nestlings. [[American robin]] (''Turdus migratorius'') chicks compete for food provided by their parents through louder and more prominent cheeps or other vocalizations, with the most food given to chicks exhibiting the most intense begging behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Henrik G., and Robert Montgomerie. "Nestling American Robins Compete with Siblings by Begging." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 29.4 (1991): 307-12. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sibling rivalry may not seem to align with the [[Kin selection|kin selection theory]], which predicts that altruistic behaviors may evolve if [[inclusive fitness]] benefits (including those of relatives) from such behaviors outweigh the costs.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. Maynard. "Group selection and kin selection." Nature 201 (1964): 1145-1147.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, helping relatives would allow individuals to spread genes related to their own. However, some species may show sibling rivalry when the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs outweigh the benefits of helping relatives.  Sibling relatedness can influence degree of rivalry. Canary nestlings are more selfish and competitive if other nestlings are less related.&lt;ref&gt;Kilner, R.M. “Mouth colour is a reliable signal of need in begging canary nestlings.” Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B 264 (1997): 779-804. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  When offspring beg for more food from their parents, they also are “competing” with their future siblings by decreasing the fitness of parents, reducing their ability to invest in future offspring. This is known as interbrood rivalry, which can lead to [[parent-offspring conflict]].

== Siblicide ==
{{main|Siblicide}}
Siblicide is a consequence of sibling rivalry, and its occurrence may be due to a variety of factors, such as food shortages and limited [[parental care]]. Killing a sibling could be advantageous for an animal because it monopolizes more resources through the elimination of a competitor. Moreover, there are different types of siblicide. For example, obligate siblicide is the unconditional killing of a sibling. In species of birds that exhibit this behavior, the larger chick commits the act of siblicide. On the other hand, facultative siblicide refers to situations in which the death of a sibling does not always occur, but is usually motivated by environmental factors such as limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, David J. "Evolution of Obligate Siblicide in Boobies. 1. A Test of the Insurance-Egg Hypothesis." The American Naturalist 135.3 (1990): 334. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Facultative siblicide is exhibited by the previously discussed case of the blue-footed booby (''Sula nebouxii''). In this species, senior chicks may sometimes eliminate siblings when there are food shortages. During these shortages, chicks exhibit higher levels of pecking, but this aggression decreases when food levels are brought back to sufficient levels.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, David J.; “Evolution of obligate siblicide in boobies: A test of the insurance egg hypothesis”; The American Naturalist, Vol. 135, No. 3 (March 1990); pp. 334-350.&lt;/ref&gt;
In some species, parents have evolved behaviors to take advantage of siblicide to increase their own fitness. For example, the laughing gull exhibits asynchronous hatching patterns in order to cut parental losses. In this species, birds that lay their eggs at different times produce, on average, a larger number of fledglings per nest in comparison to birds with synchronous hatches.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, D. Caldwell. "Asynchronous Hatching in the Laughing Gull: Cutting Losses and Reducing Rivalry." Animal Behaviour 29.2 (1981): 421-27. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Staggered hatching creates chicks in different stages of growth. Older, and thus larger, chicks kill their younger siblings, reducing brood size and allowing the parent to concentrate efforts when food is scarce. Once the brood is reduced, sibling rivalry decreases because there are fewer competitors, benefitting the surviving offspring. This also benefits the parents by minimizing unproductive parental investment in offspring that are unlikely to be successful. This is especially advantageous during food shortages when parents are unable to adequately feed all offspring.

=== Spotted hyena sibling aggression ===
[[File:Hyena Standoff.jpg|thumb|300px|Spotted hyenas interacting aggressively. Siblicide in this species is facultative, and it is triggered when competition increases due to limited resources.]]
Siblicide has also been noted in mammalian species. For instance, [[spotted hyena]]s (''Crocuta crocuta'') have been known to exhibit facultative siblicidal behavior. Intense sibling aggression begins only a few minutes after birth and then continues for a few days.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Laurence G., Stephen E. Glickman, and Paul Light. "Fatal sibling aggression, precocial development, and androgens in neonatal spotted hyenas." Science 252.5006 (1991). Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The function of sibling aggression is to establish and maintain rank relationship between litter mates, but this aggression does not always lead to sibling death.&lt;ref&gt;Wahaj, Sofia and K.E. Holekamp. "Functions of sibling aggression in the spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta.” Animal Behaviour 71.6 (2006): 1401-1409. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during periods of intense feeding competition, aggression can escalate to siblicide.&lt;ref&gt;Wahaj, Sofia A.,Ned J. Place, Mary L. Weldele, Stephen E. Glickman and Kay E. Holekamp. "Siblicide in the Spotted Hyena: Analysis with Ultrasonic Examination of Wild and Captive Individuals." Behavioral Ecology 18.6 (2007): 974-984. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Spotted hyena aggression demonstrates how facultative siblicide can be triggered by environmental factors.

=== Intrauterine cannibalism ===
Intrauterine cannibalism (see also: [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]]) occurs when siblings eat each other in the embryonic phase. This can take the form of embryophagy when siblings eat embryos, and [[oophagy]], when siblings eat eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Clutton-Brock, Tim H. The evolution of parental care. Princeton University Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
	Intrauterine cannibalism can benefit embryos by providing increased nutrition. [[Fire salamander]] (''Salamandra salamandra'') populations exhibiting intrauterine cannibalism have embryos that develop more quickly into larvae due to nutritional supplementation from feeding on siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, David, Marina Alcobendas, Mario García-París, and Marvalee H. Wake. "Heterochrony, cannibalism, and the evolution of viviparity in Salamandra salamandra." Evolution &amp; Development 9.1 (2007): 105-115.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lamniformes|Lamnoid shark]] embryos have adaptations to facilitate intrauterine cannibalism in the form of precocious teeth, which they use to feed on intrauterine eggs and siblings after their yolk supply is used up.&lt;ref&gt;Hamlett, William C., Allison M. Eulitt, Robert L. Jarrell, and Matthew Kelly. "Uterogestation and Placentation in Elasmobranchs." Journal of Experimental Zoology 266.5 (1993): 347-67.

Wintner, Debra L. Abercrombie, Jimiane Ashe, Andrea M. Bernard, Mahmood S. Shivji, and Kevin A. Feldheim. "The Behavioural and Genetic Mating System of the Sand Tiger Shark, Carcharias Taurus, an Intrauterine Cannibal." Biology Letters 9.3 (2013). Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the first embryo may have a different father from the eaten embryos, this form of siblicide early during development may be indirectly involved in male competition. This phenomenon of embryonic cannibalism may play a role in [[sexual selection]], as males compete post-fertilization for paternity.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Demian D., Sabine P. Wintner, Debra L. Abercrombie, Jimiane Ashe, Andrea M. Bernard, Mahmood S. Shivji, and Kevin A. Feldheim. "The Behavioural and Genetic Mating System of the Sand Tiger Shark, Carcharias Taurus, an Intrauterine Cannibal." Biology Letters 9.3 (2013). Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, intrauterine cannibalism in sharks may reflect not only sibling rivalry, but also male competition for successful mating with females, which is an example of [[sexual selection]].

==Non-lethal competition==
Not all forms of sibling rivalry in animals involve direct aggression or death of a sibling. This is not an extremely aggressive form of rivalry; however, it still results in reduced sibling fitness. [[File:Sau mit ihren Ferkeln.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Suckling piglets often exhibit strong competition for access to their mother's teats through armed sibling rivalry.]]

=== Fetal programming in sheep ===
Fetal programming (see also: [[Barker hypothesis|Barker’s Hypothesis]]) refers to the persisting effects in adult life caused by the fetal environment. In sheep, competition for resources within the uterus may lead to impaired reproductive abilities and different body composition. Sheep that were born 600 grams lighter than their twins have an impaired reproductive ability - the lighter the sheep weighed in comparison to their twin, the more impaired. Although the sheep are not competing physically like in intrauterine cannibalism, the disparity in birth weight suggests an overall fitness difference.&lt;ref&gt;Casellas, J., and G. Caja.

=== Sibling rivalry among suckling piglets ===
[[Domestic pig]]lets (''Sus scrofa'') have been shown to exhibit different forms of non-lethal competition such as uterine competition. The relative development of the embryo in the uterus can affect their chance of survival. Pig embryos follow different developmental paths because during estrus, sows will ovulate the majority of their follicles during a short period of time and then a few during a longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Pope W.F., S. Xie, D.M. Broermann, and K.P. Nephew. “Causes and consequences of early embryonic diversity in pigs”. Journal of Reproduction and Fertility (Suppl) 40:251–260. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern causes a difference in development, so the less developed embryos are less likely to survive. Competition also exists over space in the uterus of the sow. The central portion of the uterus is the most crowded and the site of the greatest competition. This competition prevents some embryos from fully growing, often resulting in a low birthweight that may put piglets at a disadvantage once out of the womb.&lt;ref&gt;Pope W.F., S. Xie, D.M. Broermann, and K.P. Nephew. “Causes and consequences of early embryonic diversity in pigs”. Journal of Reproduction and Fertility (Suppl) 40:251–260. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Neonatal competition also exists among piglets as they directly compete against their siblings for their mother’s teats only hours after their birth.&lt;ref&gt;Hartsock T.G., and H.B. Graves. “Neonatal behavioral and nutrition-related mortality in domestic swine.” Journal of Animal Science 42 (1976): 235-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition is responsible for 43% of piglet neonatal death due to starvation. Under normal conditions (i.e. stable environment, average litter size), larger piglets appear to have an advantage in survival partially due to their ability to win more fights against smaller piglets over access to teats.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Anna, David Fraser, and Daniel M. Weary. "Parent-Offspring Resource Allocation in Domestic Pigs." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 62.3 (2008): 309-19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is believed that teeth in piglets evolved as a product of an evolutionary arms race caused by sibling competition, resulting in armed sibling rivalry. Teeth become more important when the litter size is larger than normal, causing increased competition. In these situations, the teeth can help the individual piglet compete against siblings.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, David, and B. K. Thompson. "Armed Sibling Rivalry among Suckling Piglets." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 29.1 (1991): 9-15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of the parent and interbrood conflict ==
[[File:Parus.JPG|thumb|left|Great tit chicks beg for food from their parents, but their proximity to parents often determines amount of feeding. As a result, chicks compete for optimal feeding location within the nest.]]

Sibling rivalry can be mediated and/or encouraged by parents, especially in bird species. Sibling rivalry can also have a negative impact on the parent and the fitness of future offspring due to interbrood conflict which may lead to [[parent-offspring conflict]]. This conflict may force parents to exert extra energy at the expense of future broods.

Parents may play a passive role in encouraging sibling rivalry. The most common case is in food distribution. When parent birds distribute food, they do not favor any individual offspring. [[Great tits]] (''Parus major'') preferentially distribute food from similar locations, so offspring compete for those prime spots closest to the feeding site where they will get more food, leading to unequal growth of offspring. This behavior exemplified in the young can be interpreted as an [[Optimal foraging theory|optimal foraging strategy]] driven by [[scramble competition]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolliker, M., Richner, H. “Navigation in a cup: chick positioning in great tit, Parus major, nests.” Animal Behavior, 68 (2004), 941-948.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, parents may take an active role in mediating the intensity of rivalry between siblings. Again, great tit parents can choose what location to distribute food to as a means of controlling competition between nestlings. When parents feed chicks at one or two feeding locations in the nest, the distance between the male and female parents influences the level of competition between nestlings. In other words, parents may decrease sibling competition by varying the locations within the nest that receive food.

Interbrood conflict occurs when the current brood demands more at the expense of future broods. This sibling rivalry can lead to [[parent-offspring conflict]], in which there are different optimal levels of parental investments whether viewed from the parental or offspring perspective. [[signaling theory|Biological signalling theory]] suggests that young can communicate with parents to maximize the amount of food they can get. Therefore, young that need or want more food may solicit or beg at higher levels. Parents can respond to this by providing more food, but this is based on the assumption of [[Honest signaling|honest begging]], in which chicks beg only when they actually need more food. However, if all the young start soliciting at higher levels, this incurs a cost on the parents because they will need to expend more energy searching for food. The increased travel to and from the nest may attract predators as well. These factors reduce the energy and resources parents have for future offspring. This is an example of where nestling intrabrood competition can influence the parents' investment in future broods.&lt;ref&gt;Godfray, H. C. J. "Signaling of Need between Parents and Young: Parent-Offspring Conflict and Sibling Rivalry." The American Naturalist 146.1 (1995): 1-24. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Development-Entertainment Continuum.png|thumb|SBCC on the Development-Entertainment spectrum.]]
'''Social and behavior change communication''' ('''SBCC'''), often also only "'''BCC'''" or "'''Communication for Development''' ('''C4D''')" is an interactive process of any intervention with [[individuals]], [[communities]] and/or societies (as integrated with an overall program) to develop [[communication]] strategies to promote positive behaviors which are appropriate to their settings and there by solve world's most pressing health problems. This in turn provides a supportive environment which will enable people to initiate, sustain and maintain positive and desirable [[behavior]] outcomes.&lt;ref name="UNFPA"&gt;{{Cite journal

SBCC is the strategic use of communication to promote positive health outcomes, based on proven theories and models of [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]]. SBCC employs a systematic process beginning with formative research and behavior analysis, followed by communication planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Audiences are carefully segmented, messages and materials are pre-tested, and mass media (which include radio, television, billboards, print material, internet), interpersonal channels (such as client-provider interaction, group presentations) and community mobilisation are used to achieve defined behavioral objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.measureevaluation.org/prh/rh_indicators/crosscutting/bcc|title=Behavior Change Communication — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.measureevaluation.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCC should not be confused with [[behavior modification]], a term with specific meaning in a [[clinical psychiatry]] setting.

== Background ==
Providing people with information and teaching them how they should behave does not lead to desirable change in their response/behavior. However, when there is a supportive environment with information and communication (teaching) then there is a desirable change in the behavior of the target group. Thus, SBCC is proved to be an instructional intervention which has a close interface with education and communication. It is a strategic and group oriented form of communication to perceive a desired change in behavior of target group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web 
 |title=A Tool Box for Building Health Communication Capacity

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is not as easy as it sounds, as there is no one-size-fits all strategy for any intervention. Interventions are context specific. Therefore, there is a need for proper information management and sharing. It is advised to document and report the interventions that worked somewhere, for example, the kind of messages, the medium and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|displayauthors=etal|first=|date=|year=2003|title=Evidence-based behaviour change medicine: what is it and how do we achieve it?|url=|journal=Annals of Behavioral Medicine|volume=26|pages=161–171|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps==
SBCC is the comprehensive process in which one passes through the stages:

Unaware
&gt; Aware
&gt; Concerned
&gt; Knowledgeable
&gt; Motivated to change
&gt; Practicing trial behavior change
&gt; Sustained behavior change[[Image:Behavior Change Communication.jpg|thumb|SBCC in classroom practices]]

It involves the following steps:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# State program goals
# Involve stakeholders
# Identify target populations
# Conduct formative BCC assessments
# Segment target populations
# Define behavior change objectives
# Define SBCC strategy &amp; monitoring and evaluation plan
# Develop communication products
# Pretest
# Implement and monitor
# Evaluate
# Analyze feedback and revise

== Enabling factors ==
Behavior change is influenced by motivation from others (external influence) as well as from within oneself (internal influence). Internal influence plays a significant role in creating more enjoyment of a behavior change, instilling a sense of ownership of the new behavior, which in turn instills a sense of ownership of the changed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osbaldiston|first=R|last2=Sheldon|first2=K|year=2002|editor-last=Schmuck|editor-first=A|editor2-last=Schultz|editor2-first=W|title=Social dilemmas and sustainable development: Promoting the motivation to cooperate with the future.|url=|journal=Psychology of Sustainability|publisher=Boston: Kluwer|volume=|pages=37–57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When designing SBCC strategies, enabling factors that affect the outcome must be considered. The following are some of the factors:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Effective communication
* Enabling environment, which include policies, human rights community values and norms
* User-friendly, accessible services and commodities

==Theories==
SBCC has several levels at which it can be implemented. Each level includes several theories. Each level (and each theory) employs specific communication channels.

;Individual level
* Health belief theory
* Theory of reasoned action and planned behavior
* Stages of change
* Social learning

;Community level
* Diffusion of innovations theory
* Community mobilization

;Change in organizations 
* 4 stage change

;Public policy Level
* Distinct stages of initiation, action, implementation, evaluation and re-formulation

[[File:SBCC Summit 2018 Crowd in Nusa Dua, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|Over 1,200 attendees came to the 2018 SBCC Summit, where Entertainment-Education was a main topic among Social and Behavior Chance Communications professionals.]]

==Strategies==
SBCC is different from the ordinary instructional method of communication and is target specific. A society consists of many sub-groups. The strategy for SBCC will vary from group to group. The following points are important while considering the SBCC strategy.&lt;ref name="BCC_AIDS"&gt;{{Cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vulnerability/risk factor of the target group
* The vulnerability/risk factor of the group which is to be addressed
* The conflict and obstacles in the way to desired change in behavior
* Type of message and communication media which can best be used to reach the target group
* Type of resources available and assessment of existing knowledge of the target group about the issue which is going to be dealt with

There can be several more points in this list. A successful SBCC requires lots of research and meticulous planning about the knowledge content of the subject and behavior/attitude pattern of the target group.&lt;ref name="UNFPA" /&gt;

[[Social marketing]] has been described as a tool for [[sustainable behaviour]] change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Merritt|first1=Rowena|last2=Truss|first2=Aiden|last3=Hopwood|first3=Toby|title=Social marketing can help achieve sustainable behaviour change|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/social-marketing-behaviour-change|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=17 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
SBCC has proven effective in several health areas, such as increasing the use of family planning methods,reducing the spread of malaria and other infectious diseases, and improving newborn and maternal health.

SBCC is an effective tool for dealing with many community and group related problems. BCC has been adapted as an effective strategy for [[community mobilization]], health  and environment education and various public outreach programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Enhanced knowledge about the behavior change process has facilitated the design of communications programs to reduce the risk of HIV transmission and AIDS. A wide variety of health promotion strategies use communication as either an educational or norm-forming strategy. In addition, specific strategies must be designed for high-risk groups such as women, young people, injecting drug abusers, homosexuals and HIV positive groups.&lt;ref name="BCC_AIDS" /&gt;

SBCC constitutes of effective communication which is central to the success of interventions to reduce the risk of HIV infection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2661">'''Sympathy''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] συμπάθεια (sympatheia), from σύν (syn) "together" and πάθος (pathos) "passion", in this case an affection) is a short piece of [[instrumental]], music, a type of [[bagatelle (music)|bagatelle]],  that at the same time is a [[Homage (arts)|homage]], a [[requiem]] for a special person. 

[[File:S.f.P&amp;P.jpg|thumb|Peter Adrian Wulff and Natias Neutert, performing a 'sympathy' in 1988]]

== Origin ==
The earliest use of the name "sympathy" for [[instrumental]] musical work was by the German performer, poet, musician and thinker [[Natias Neutert]].  He introduced the word sympathy into the terminology of experimental music and [[performance art]] with his musical performance, titled ''Sympathy for Piano and Pump''.&lt;ref&gt;PARKETT No 15, Art Magazine, february Zürich 1988, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Laura von Spreckelsen: ''Grenzübertritte — zu den Aktivitäten von Natias Neutert in Berlin (Border Crossings — the activities of Natias Neutert in Berlin)'' In: NEW ART IN EUROPE No. 22, ’88.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Sympathy-Accord.jpg|thumb|''Sympathy Chord'' written by Natias Neutert, Faksimile 1987]]

== Premiere ==
The premiere of Natias Neutert’s  concerto within the frame of Berlin as Cultural City of Europe 1988 happened in the [[Martin-Gropius-Bau]]. It was a „kind of requiem for the great teacher [[Joseph Beuys]] whose use of a pneumatic pump as a sculptural object has inspired Neutert to convert it for this concerto into an unusual musical instrument.“ 
&lt;ref&gt;Berlin – Kulturstadt Europas 1988/Cultural City of Europe 1988/Ville Européenne de la Culture 1988, Verlag Ullstein, Frankfurt/Main – Berlin 1988, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

By virtue of his playing, pianist Adrian Wulff produces spacious arcs of sounds, and Neutert, the composer, performer and flute player himself, charms the finest sounds out oft the unusual ‚magic flute.’&lt;ref&gt;Cf Klaus Thomsen: ''Sympathy for Piano and pump — Neutert in Berlin, Hamburg, Heidelberg et al.'' In: Kunst Köln Art Cologne, Issue 4/’88.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The fact that the term sympathy imbedded itself into the terminology of experimental music and performance art as a name of such music piece, not least the young Italo-German film composer Pablo Paolo Kilian occupies, his short piece ''Time Travel - Back and Forth'' exactly the same and in this sense.

'''Timoclea''' or '''Timocleia of Thebes''' is a woman whose story is told by [[Plutarch]] in his ''Life of Alexander'', and at greater length in his ''Mulierum virtutes'' ("Virtues of Women").  According to Plutarch's biography of [[Alexander the Great]], when his forces took [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] during [[Alexander's Balkan campaign]] of 335 BC, [[Thracian]] forces pillaged the city, and a captain of the Thracian forces [[rape]]d Timocleia.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/alexandr.html Plutarch – Life of Alexander]&lt;/ref&gt;  After raping her, the captain asked if she knew of any hidden money.  She told him that she did, and led him into her garden, and told him there was money hidden in her [[Water well|well]].&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;  When the Thracian captain stooped to look into the well, Timoclea pushed him into the well, and then hurled heavy stones into the well until the captain was dead.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

Timoclea was seized by the Thracian soldiers and brought before Alexander the Great.  She comported herself with great dignity and told Alexander that her brother was Theagenes, last commander of the [[Theban Sacred Band]], who died "for the liberty of Greece" at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] in 338 BC, defeated by Alexander's father [[Philip of Macedon]].  Alexander was so impressed with Timocleia that he ordered her and her children released and she was not punished for killing the Thracian captain.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt; 

The story in the ''Mulierum virtutes'' is essentially the same, except that the captain is told that the treasure, of silver bowls, gold and some money, was at the bottom of a dry well, which he climbs down into. When Timoclea hears that he has reached the bottom, she throws down rocks on him. Alexander dismisses her without punishment but does not set her or her family free. He instead tells his officers to take special care of them and other renowned families, making sure there is no more abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F9uCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71 Excerpt in] ''Alexander the Great: A Reader'', Ian Worthington, ed, pp. 70–71, Routledge, {{ISBN|1134435924}}, 9781134435920; [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0208%3Achapter%3D24 Example 24 in the ''Mulierum virtutes'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Timoclée et Alexandre, Domenichino (Louvre INV 796) 02.jpg|thumb|Timoclea before [[Alexander the Great]], painting by [[Domenichino]], c. 1615, [[Louvre]].]]

Plutarch's main source for the incident, as he mentions in passing elsewhere, was the account by [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, N. G. L., ''Sources for Alexander the Great: An Analysis of Plutarch's "Life" and Arrian's "Anabasis Alexandrou"'', pp. 154–155, 2007, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521714710}}, 9780521714716[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gay_i14p9oEC&amp;pg=PA154 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; who knew Alexander well; this survives only in quotations by others, which may not all be accurate.  The taking of Thebes took place in the second year of Alexander's reign, and was otherwise a very bloody affair, as the city was the leader in a Greek revolt, taking advantage of Philip's assassination, against the treaties he had enforced.  Perhaps 6,000 Thebans died, and 30,000 were enslaved, and the city virtually ceased to exist for some decades.  The only other act of clemency recorded is that Alexander ordered the house and descendants of the poet [[Pindar]] (died c. 443 BC) to be left alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Thomas R., Blackwell, Christopher W., ''Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life'', pp. 48–50, 2012, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1139576534}}, 9781139576536, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4_MgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Davent bm 5.jpg|thumb|[[Léon Davent]], Etching, c.1541/45, after [[Francesco Primaticcio]].  341 x 231 mm.]]
Timoclea was a rare subject in art from the Renaissance onwards, never becoming a regular subject in the range of incidents showing classical and biblical female violence against men known as the [[Power of Women]] [[literary topos|topos]].  But she featured in cycles on the ''Life of Alexander'', and there was an increasing tendency in court art to depict Alexander as a proxy for the actual monarch, and to emphasize acts of generosity or mercy.&lt;ref&gt;Aghion I., Barbillon C., Lissarrague, F., ''Gods and Heroes of Classical Antiquity'', Flammarion Iconographic Guides, pp. 30–31, 1996, {{ISBN|2080135805}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most depictions show her brought before Alexander, which might form part of a cycle illustrating his life.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the case in the cycle of [[fresco]]s painted in the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] in the 1540s by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] and his team.  This was in the bedroom of [[Francis I of France|Francois I's]] mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly|the Duchess of Étampes]] (1508–1580), and a total of eleven compositions surviving today are known from surviving paintings or prints or drawings.  The cycle showed the life of Alexander, but with little emphasis on his military career. This was one of the three subjects from the cycle [[etching|etched]] as a print by [[Léon Davent]].&lt;ref&gt;Boorsch, Suzanne, in: Jacobson, Karen (ed), (often wrongly cat. as [[George Baselitz]]), ''The French Renaissance in Prints'', pp. 256–257, 1994, Grunwald Center, UCLA, {{ISBN|0962816221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unusually in this subject, but rather typically for the First [[School of Fontainebleau]], Timoclea is naked when brought to Alexander. 

Here and in other depictions, the subject was given a composition similar to ones of the much more common ''[[The Continence of Scipio]]''; the subject likewise emphasized the magnamimity of the commander.  Timoclea sometimes accompanied the ''Continence'' in a series,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2010/important-old-master-paintings-and-sculpture-n08610/lot.177.html "Giovanni Battista Gaulli, called Il Baciccio ''The Continence of Scipio''], [[Sotheby's]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also capable of being confused with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=715754&amp;partId=1 British Museum, Drawing Cat. 1860,0616.118], by [[Perino del Vaga]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard de Montfaucon]] paired the two stories as his "Examples of the clemency and continence of conquerors" in a book of 1724.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-b_ojfBm3EQC&amp;pg=PT122&amp;lpg=PT122 ''Supplement au livre de l'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures: tome quatrième: qui comprend la guerre, les ponts, les aqueducs, la navigation, les phares &amp; les tours octogones''], Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

As the ''Life of Alexander'' was a popular subject, the story of Timoclea probably would have been more a popular element if there had not been a grander and less sordid competitor in the form of [[The Family of Darius before Alexander]], best known from [[The Family of Darius before Alexander|Veronese's painting in London]], which was normally included in cycles, and also showed Alexander being generous to women captives brought before him.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most influential image of Timoclea's story, judging by copies in prints for two centuries after,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=timoclea British Museum search]&lt;/ref&gt; was the painting by [[Domenichino]] of c. 1615, which was in the French royal collection from the time of [[Louis XIV]], and then the [[Louvre]].  Unlike most depictions, this shows her children prominently.  A very different composition, showing only one and a half figures, with the Thracian disappearing upside down into the well, first appears in an [[engraving]] of 1629–30 by [[Matthäus Merian]], a book illustration for a popular German world history by [[Johann Ludwig Gottfried]].  This was later adapted in an oil painting by [[Elisabetta Sirani]].&lt;ref&gt;Golahny, Amy, [https://www.lycoming.edu/art/amy/Golahny-Timoclea-SOURCE-2011.pdf 1 "Elisabetta Sirani’s Timoclea and Visual Precedent", ''Source'', 30, 2011, 37–42 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later literature==
A play, now lost, called ''Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes'' was performed at [[Hampton Court Palace]] before [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and the English court at [[Candlemas]] 1574, on February 2 (this was five years before the influential English translation of Plutarch by [[Thomas North]] was published). The author is unknown, and the performers were boys from the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylor's School, London]], directed by their master [[Richard Mulcaster]].&lt;ref name=lost&gt;[https://www.lostplays.org/lpd/Timoclea_at_the_Siege_of_Thebes Lost Plays Database], University of Melbourne, "Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes", Anon. (1574) &lt;/ref&gt;  They were one of a number of [[Boy player#Children's companies|companies of boy players]] active in [[English Renaissance theatre]] in London.  The performance and its expenses was recorded in the accounts of the [[Master of the Revels]], and from the number of children's gloves paid for may have included twenty four performers.  It may not have been a great success, as the [[masque]] prepared to follow it, with ladies "with lightes being vj vertues" was "not showen for the Tediusnesse of the playe that nighte."&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;

Timoclea also appears in ''Gynaikeion or Nine Books of Various History Concerning Women'' by [[Thomas Heywood]], 1624, and as a minor character in [[John Lyly]]'s play  ''[[Campaspe (play)|Campaspe]]'',&lt;ref name=lost/&gt; a comedy also performed by boy players.  According to this, Timoclea and [[Campaspe]] were both captives at Alexander's conquest of Thebes, and are brought together before Alexander, where Timoclea's aristocratic dignity contrasts with Campaspe's self-description as "a humble handmaid to Alexander".&lt;ref&gt;''"Campaspe" and "Sappho and Phao": John Lyly", ''The Revels Plays'', eds.

In [[land use planning]], '''urban open space''' is [[open space reserve|open space]] areas for "parks," "green spaces," and other open areas&lt;ref&gt;Ranasinghe ,WC and Hemakumara, GPTS(2018),  Spatial modelling of the householders' perception and assessment of the potentiality to improve the urban green coverage in residential areas: A case study from Issadeen Town Matara, Sri Lanka, Ruhuna Journal of Science,Vol 9(1); http://rjs.ruh.ac.lk/index.php/rjs/article/view/174&lt;/ref&gt;. The landscape of urban open spaces can range from [[playing field]]s to highly maintained environments to relatively [[natural landscape]]s. Generally considered open to the public, urban open spaces are sometimes privately owned, such as [[campus|higher education campuses]], [[community gardening|neighborhood/community parks/gardens]], and institutional or corporate grounds. Areas outside city boundaries, such as [[state park|state]] and [[national park]]s as well as open space in the countryside, are not considered urban open space. Streets, piazzas, plazas and urban squares are not always defined as urban open space in land use planning.

== Scope ==

The term "urban open space" can describe many types of open areas.&lt;ref&gt;Alfirevic Djordje, Simonovic-Alfirevic Sanja. ''[https://www.academia.edu/26596496/Interpretations_of_Space_Within_Space_Concept_in_Contemporary_Open-Plan_Architecture_Primena_koncepta_prostor_u_prostoru_u_savremenoj_arhitekturi_otvorenog_plana_ Interpretations of Space Within Space Concept in Contemporary Open-Plan Architecture / Primena koncepta prostor u prostoru u savremenoj arhitekturi otvorenog plana]''. Arhitektura i urbanizam (Belgrade), No.42 (2016), pp.&amp;nbsp;24–40.&lt;/ref&gt;  One definition holds that, "As the counterpart of development, urban open space is a natural and cultural resource, synonymous with neither 'unused land' nor 'park and recreation areas." Another is "Open space is land and/or water area with its surface open to the sky, consciously acquired or publicly regulated to serve conservation and urban shaping function in addition to providing recreational opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn.  "Decision Making in Allocating Metropolitan Open Space: State of the Art."  Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science 1975.  pp 149–153.&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all instances, the space referred to by the term is, in fact, green space.  However, there are examples of urban green space which, though not publicly owned/regulated, are still considered urban open space.

From another standpoint public space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist outside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the public, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and proximity.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Francis | first1 = Jacinta | last2 = Giles-Corti | first2 = Billie | last3 = Wood | first3 = Lisa | last4 = Knuiman | first4 = Matthew | year = 2012 | title = Creating sense of community: The role of public space | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 401–409 | doi = 10.1016/j.jenvp.2012.07.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places a focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship.[[File:WashingtonPark.jpg|right|thumb|Washington Park in [[Troy, New York|Troy, NY]], U.S., an example of privately owned urban open space|alt=A grassy area with tall trees leaving shadows from the sun above. In the distance are small rowhouses, and a street is at the right.]]
== Benefits ==
The benefits that urban open space provides to citizens can be broken into three basic forms; recreation, ecology, and aesthetic value. Psychological benefits gained by visitors to urban green spaces increased with their biodiversity,&lt;ref name="fuller"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuller|first1=R.A.|last2=Irvine|first2=K.N.|last3=Devine-Wright|first3=P.|last4=Warren|first4=P.H.|last5=Gaston|first5=K.J.|year=2007|title=Psychological benefits of green-space increase with biodiversity|url=|journal=Biology Letters|volume=3|issue=4|pages=390–394|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0149|pmc=2390667|pmid=17504734}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that 'green' alone is not sufficient; the quality of that green is important as well.

===Recreational===

[[Image:Slovakia Bratislava 947.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sad Janka Kráľa]] park in [[Bratislava]] (Slovakia)]]
Urban open space is often appreciated for the recreational opportunities it provides.  Recreation in urban open space may include active recreation (such as organized sports and individual exercise) or passive recreation, which may simply entail being in the open space. Research shows that when open spaces are attractive and accessible, people are more likely to engage in physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hartig, Terry.  "Three steps to understanding restorative environments as health resources."  Open Space People Space.  Ed. Catharine Ward Thompson and Penny Travlou.  London: Taylor and Francis, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Time spent in an urban open space for recreation offers a reprieve from the urban environment and a break from over-stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Marc G., John Jonides, and Stephen Kaplan. "The cognitive benefits of interacting with nature." Psychological science 19.12 (2008): 1207-1212.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done on physically active adults middle aged and older show there are amplified benefits when the physical activities are coupled with green space environments. Such coupling leads to decreased levels of stress, lowers the risk for depression as well as increase the frequency of participation in exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Astell-Burt, Thomas, Xiaoqi Feng, and Gregory S. Kolt. "Mental health benefits of neighbourhood green space are stronger among physically active adults in middle-toolder age: evidence from 260,061 Australians." Preventive medicine 57.5 (2013): 601606.&lt;/ref&gt; Casual group walks in a green environment (nature walks) increase one's positive attitude and lower stress levels as well as risk of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Richard|year=2013|title=Is physical activity in natural environments better for mental health than physical activity in other environments?.|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=91|issue=|pages=130–134|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Ecological===
The [[conservation (ethic)|conservation of nature]] in an urban environment has direct impact on people for another reason as well.  A Toronto civic affairs bulletin entitled ''Urban Open Space: Luxury or Necessity'' makes the claim that "popular awareness of the balance of nature, of natural processes and of man’s place in and effect on nature – i.e., "ecological awareness" – is important.  As humans live more and more in man-made surroundings – i.e., cities – he risks harming himself by building and acting in ignorance of natural processes."  Beyond this man-nature benefit, urban open spaces also serve as islands of nature, promoting [[biodiversity]] and providing a home for natural species in environments that are otherwise uninhabitable due to city development.

In a sense, by having the opportunity to be within a natural urban green space people gain a higher appreciation for the nature around them. As Bill McKibben mentions in his book ''The End of Nature'', people will only truly understand nature if they are immersed within it. He follows in Henry David Thoreau's footsteps when he isolated himself in the Adirondack Mountains in order to get away from society and the overwhelming ideals it carries. Even there he writes how society and human impact follows him as he sees airplanes buzzing overhead or hears the roar of motorboats in the distance.

===Aesthetic===
The [[aesthetic value]] of urban open spaces is self-evident.  People enjoy viewing nature, especially when it is otherwise extensively deprived, as is the case in urban environments.  Therefore, open space offers the value of "substituting gray infrastructure."&lt;ref name="Eysenbach, Mary 2008"&gt;Eysenbach, Mary.  "Park System Function and Services." From Recreation to Re-creation.  American Planning Association, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; One researcher states how attractive neighborhoods contribute to positive attitudes and social norms that encourage walking and community values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ward Thompson | first1 = Catharine | year = 2013 | title = Activity, exercise and the planning and design of outdoor spaces | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 79–96 | doi = 10.1016/j.jenvp.2013.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Properties near urban open space tend to have a higher value. One study was able to demonstrate that, “a pleasant view can lead to a considerable increase in house price, particularly if the house overlooks water (8–10%) or open space (6–12%).”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luttik|first1=Joke|year=2000|title=The value of trees, water and open space as reflected by house prices in the Netherlands|url=|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=48|issue=3–4|pages=161–167|doi=10.1016/S0169-2046(00)00039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain benefits may be derived from exposure to virtual versions of the natural environment, too. For example, people who were shown pictures of scenic, natural environments had increased brain activity in the region associated with recalling happy memories, compared to people that were shown pictures of urban landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = Gwang-Won | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Functional neuroanatomy associated with natural and urban scenic views in the human brain: 3.0 T functional MR imaging | url = | journal = Korean Journal of Radiology | volume = 11 | issue = 5| pages = 507–513 | doi=10.3348/kjr.2010.11.5.507}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

=== Ancient Rome ===
The term "rus in urbe" meaning "country in the city" was used in Rome around the first century C.E.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://urbanrambles.org/background/a-brief-history-of-rus-in-urbe-1307|title=A brief history of urban green spaces|date=2015-12-28|work=Urban Rambles|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urban planning]] in Rome valued the natural landscape and took account for environmental factors. It was thought that by building a city with regard to the local countryside, the people living there would be healthier and happier.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-07-01|title=The environmental elements of foundations in Roman cities: A theory of the architect Gaetano Vinaccia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670716305686|journal=Sustainable Cities and Society|language=en|volume=32|pages=42–55|doi=10.1016/j.scs.2017.03.002|issn=2210-6707}}&lt;/ref&gt; English landscapes would later take inspiration from Roman urban planning concepts in their own open spaces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-03-15|title=Linking landscape and health: The recurring theme|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204610002860|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|language=en|volume=99|issue=3-4|pages=187–195|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2010.10.006|issn=0169-2046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== London===
[[London]] has a long history of urban open space, which has significantly influenced development of modern parks, and is still among the greenest capital cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitlondon.com/areas/parks/ Explore London with our Interactive Map Tool]. visitlondon.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis for many urban open spaces seen today across Europe and the West began its process of development in London in the 17th and 18th centuries.  What would eventually become urban open green space began as [[plaza|paved public plazas]].  Though they were intended to be open to the public, these spaces began to be re-designated as private parks around the late eighteenth century.  It was during this period that the areas became pockets of green in the urban environment, commonly modelled after the natural wild of the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Henry W.  The Greening of Squares of London: Transformation of Urban Landscapes and Ideals.  Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 83, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first parks to reverse the trend of privatization and again be opened to the public were England’s [[Royal Parks of London|royal parks]] in the nineteenth century.  This was done in response to the extensive and unexpected population movement from the country into cities.  As a result, "the need for open space was socially and politically pressing… The problems, to which the provision of parks was expected to offer some relief, were easy to describe: overcrowding, poverty, squalor, ill-health, lack of morals and morale, and so on".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Hilary A..  Garden History. "Urban Public Parks, 1840–1900: Design and Meaning".  1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such sentiments again received significant popular support during the "[[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]]" movement in America during the 1890s and 1900s.  Both trends focused on providing the public an opportunity to receive all of the perceived health and lifestyle benefits of having access to open space within urban environments.

== Current trends ==
Segmentation of urban open spaces was particularly prominent in America during the twentieth century.  Since the late 1800's romantic park systems, open space designers have been concerned with guiding, containing or separating urban growth, distributing recreation, and/or producing scenic amenity, mostly within the framework of geometric abstractions."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, William H.  "Design of Metropolitan Open Space Based on Natural Process." Metropolitan Open Space and Natural Process.  Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such segmentation was especially prominent in the 1990s, when urban open spaces took a path similar to that of parks, following the modernization trend of segmentation and specialization of areas.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Terence.  "Modern Urban Parks."  Geographical Review 1995.  Pp 535–551&lt;/ref&gt; As modernity stressed "increased efficiency, quantifiablity, predictability, and control… In concert with the additional social divisions" (Young 1995), open spaces grew more specific in purpose.  Perhaps this increase in division of social classes’ use of open space, demonstrated by the segmentation of the spaces, displays a situation similar to the privatization of London parks in the eighteenth century, which displayed a desire to make classes more distinct.

Today, places like [[Scandinavia]], which do not have a significant history of outdoor recreation and gathering places,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} are seeing a proliferation of urban open spaces and adopting a lifestyle supported by the extra urban breathing room.  An example of this can be seen in [[Copenhagen]] where an area closed to car traffic in 1962 developed, in just a few decades, a culture of public political gatherings and outdoor cafes emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Gehl, Jan. "Public Spaces for a Changing Public Life." Open Space People Space.  Ed. Catharine Ward Thompson and Penny Travlou.  London: Taylor and Francis, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only is appreciation for and use of urban open spaces flourishing in locations that historically lacked such traditions, the number of urban open spaces is increasing rapidly as well.

== Inequalities ==
Urban open space is under strong pressure. Due to increasing [[urbanization]], combined with a spatial planning policy of [[densification]], more people face the prospect of living in less green residential environments, especially people from low economic strata. This may cause [[Open Space Accessibility in California|environmental inequality]] with regard to the distribution of (access) to public green space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groenewegen | first1 = PP | last2 = den Berg | first2 = AE | last3 = de Vries | first3 = S | last4 = Verheij | first4 = RA | last5 = Vitamin | first5 = G | year = 2006 | title = Effects of green space on health, well-being, and social safety | url = | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 149 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-6-149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large epidemiological study &lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, R. and Popham, F. "Effect of exposure to natural environment on health inequalities: an observational population study." (2008) The Lancet 372(9650):pp. 1655-1660&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that wealthier individuals were generally healthier than individuals with a lower income, explained by the pattern that wealthier individuals reside in areas more concentrated with green space.  Urban open spaces in higher socioeconomic neighborhoods were also more likely to have trees that provided shade, a water feature (e.g. pond, lake and creek), walking and cycling paths, lighting, signage regarding dog access and signage restricting other activities as well.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;David Crawford, Anna Timperio, Billie Giles-Corti, Kylie Ball, Clare Hume, Rebecca Roberts, Nick Andrianopoulos, Jo Salmon, Do features of public open spaces vary according to neighbourhood socio-economic status?, ''Health &amp; Place'', Volume 14, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 889-893 doi 10.1016/j.healthplace.2007.11.002.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in Australia provided insight into how there is a correlation between community development/community safety and natural open space within the community. Open areas allow community members to engage in highly social activities and facilitate the expansion of social networks and friendship development. As people become more social they decrease the perceptions of fear and mistrust allowing a sense of community bondage.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt;

'''Wave power''' is the capture of energy of [[wind wave]]s to do useful [[mechanical work|work]] – for example, [[electricity generation]], [[water desalination]], or [[pump]]ing water. A machine that exploits wave [[power (physics)|power]] is a '''wave energy converter''' (WEC).

Wave power is distinct from [[tidal power]], which captures the energy of the current caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon. Waves and tides are also distinct from [[ocean currents]] which are caused by other forces including [[wave breaking|breaking waves]], [[wind]], the [[Coriolis effect]], [[cabbeling]], and differences in [[temperature]] and [[salinity]].

Wave-power generation is not a widely employed commercial technology, although there have been attempts to use it since at least 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsidelands.org/wave-tidal3.php|title=Wave and Tidal Energy Experiments in San Francisco and Santa Cruz|author=Christine Miller|accessdate=2008-08-16|date=August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the world's first commercial Wave Power Device, the [[Islay LIMPET]] was installed on the coast of [[Islay]] in Scotland and connected to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edie.net/news/0/Worlds-first-commercial-wave-power-station-activated-in-Scotland/3492/&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008, the first experimental multi-generator [[wave farm]] was opened in Portugal at the [[Aguçadoura Wave Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Joao Lima.

Waves are generated by wind passing over the surface of the sea. As long as the waves propagate slower than the wind speed just above the waves, there is an energy transfer from the wind to the waves. Both air pressure differences between the upwind and the lee side of a wave [[crest (physics)|crest]], as well as friction on the water surface by the wind, making the water to go into the [[shear stress]] causes the growth of the waves.&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;

[[Wave height]] is determined by wind speed, the duration of time the wind has been blowing, fetch (the distance over which the wind excites the waves) and by the depth and topography of the seafloor (which can focus or disperse the energy of the waves). A given wind speed has a matching practical limit over which time or distance will not produce larger waves. When this limit has been reached the sea is said to be "fully developed".

In general, larger waves are more powerful but wave power is also determined by wave speed, [[wavelength]], and water [[density]].

[[Ocean surface wave#Science of waves|Oscillatory motion]] is highest at the surface and diminishes exponentially with depth. However, for [[standing waves]] ([[clapotis]]) near a reflecting coast, wave energy is also present as pressure oscillations at great depth, producing [[microseism]]s.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book| first=O.M. | last=Phillips | title=The dynamics of the upper ocean |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1977 | edition=2nd | isbn=0-521-29801-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pressure fluctuations at greater depth are too small to be interesting from the point of view of wave power.

The waves propagate on the ocean surface, and the wave energy is also transported horizontally with the [[group velocity]]. The mean transport rate of the wave energy through a vertical [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of unit width, parallel to a wave crest, is called the wave energy [[flux]] (or wave power, which must not be confused with the actual power generated by a wave power device).

=== Wave power formula ===

In deep water where the water depth is larger than half the [[wavelength]], the wave [[energy flux]] is&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The energy flux is &lt;math&gt;P = \tfrac{1}{16} \rho g H_{m0}^2 c_g,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;c_g&lt;/math&gt; the group velocity, see {{Cite book

}} The group velocity is &lt;math&gt;c_g=\tfrac{g}{4\pi}T&lt;/math&gt;, see the collapsed table "''Properties of gravity waves on the surface of deep water, shallow water and at intermediate depth, according to linear wave theory''" in the section "''[[#Wave energy and wave energy flux|Wave energy and wave energy flux]]''" below.&lt;/ref&gt;

    \approx \left(0.5 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{s}} \right) H_{m0}^2\; T_e,
&lt;/math&gt;

with ''P'' the wave energy flux per unit of wave-crest length, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''m0''&lt;/sub&gt; the [[significant wave height]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt; the wave energy [[period (physics)|period]], ''ρ'' the water [[density]] and ''g'' the [[Earth's gravity|acceleration by gravity]]. The above formula states that wave power is proportional to the wave energy period and to the [[Square (algebra)|square]] of the wave height. When the significant wave height is given in metres, and the wave period in seconds, the result is the wave power in kilowatts (kW) per metre of [[wavefront]] length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Waves in ocean engineering|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|isbn=0080435661|pages=35–36|author=Tucker, M.J.|edition=1st|author2=Pitt, E.G. |editor=Bhattacharyya, R. |editor2=McCormick, M.E.|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/01-02/RE_info/wave%20power.htm|title=Wave Power|publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]]|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ocs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocsenergy.anl.gov/documents/docs/OCS_EIS_WhitePaper_Wave.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wave Energy Potential on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf|publisher=[[United States Department of the Interior]]|accessdate=2008-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711052514/http://ocsenergy.anl.gov/documents/docs/OCS_EIS_WhitePaper_Wave.pdf|archivedate=July 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/04/24110728/10 Academic Study: Matching Renewable Electricity Generation with Demand: Full Report].

Example: Consider moderate ocean swells, in deep water, a few km off a coastline,  with a wave height of 3 m and a wave energy period of 8 seconds. Using the formula to solve for power, we get

:&lt;math&gt;
  P \approx 0.5 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}^3 \cdot \text{s}} (3 \cdot \text{m})^2 (8 \cdot \text{s}) \approx 36 \frac{\text{kW}}{\text{m}},
&lt;/math&gt;

meaning there are 36 kilowatts of power potential per meter of wave crest.

In major storms, the largest waves offshore are about 15 meters high and have a period of about 15 seconds. According to the above formula, such waves carry about 1.7&amp;nbsp;MW of power across each metre of wavefront.

An effective wave power device captures as much as possible of the wave energy flux. As a result, the waves will be of lower height in the region behind the wave power device.

=== Wave energy and wave-energy flux ===

In a [[sea state]], the average(mean) [[energy density]] per unit area of [[gravity wave]]s on the water surface is proportional to the wave height squared, according to linear wave theory:&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goda&gt;{{cite book | first=Y. | last=Goda | title=Random Seas and Design of Maritime Structures | year=2000 | publisher=World Scientific | isbn=978-981-02-3256-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{16}\rho g H_{m0}^2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Here, the factor for random waves is {{frac|1|16}}, as opposed to {{frac|1|8}} for periodic waves – as explained hereafter. For a small-amplitude sinusoidal wave &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \eta=a\,\cos\, 2\pi\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\frac{t}{T}\right)&lt;/math&gt; with wave amplitude &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\,&lt;/math&gt; the wave energy density per unit horizontal area is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{2}\rho g a^2,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\frac{1}{8}\rho g H^2&lt;/math&gt; using the wave height &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H\,=\,2\,a\,&lt;/math&gt; for sinusoidal waves. In terms of the variance of the surface elevation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0=\sigma_\eta^2=\overline{(\eta-\bar\eta)^2}=\frac{1}{2}a^2,&lt;/math&gt; the energy density is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle E=\rho g m_0\,&lt;/math&gt;. Turning to random waves, the last formulation of the wave energy equation in terms of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle m_0\,&lt;/math&gt; is also valid (Holthuijsen, 2007, p. 40), due to [[Parseval's theorem]]. Further, the [[significant wave height]] is ''defined'' as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle H_{m0}=4\sqrt{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;, leading to the factor {{frac|1|16}} in the wave energy density per unit horizontal area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

where ''E'' is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area (J/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the sum of [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]] density per unit horizontal area. The potential energy density is equal to the kinetic energy,&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt; both contributing half to the wave energy density ''E'', as can be expected from the [[Equipartition theorem#Potential energy and harmonic oscillators|equipartition theorem]]. In ocean waves, surface tension effects are negligible for wavelengths above a few [[decimetre]]s.

As the waves propagate, their energy is transported. The energy transport velocity is the [[group velocity]]. As a result, the wave energy [[flux]], through a vertical plane of unit width perpendicular to the wave propagation direction, is equal to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reynolds |first=O. | authorlink=Osborne Reynolds | year=1877 |title=On the rate of progression of groups of waves and the rate at which energy is transmitted by waves | journal=Nature | volume=16 | pages=343–44 | doi = 10.1038/016341c0 |bibcode = 1877Natur..16R.341. }}&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal | title=On progressive waves | author=Lord Rayleigh (J.

:&lt;math&gt;P = E\, c_g, \, \ &lt;/math&gt;

with ''c&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' the group velocity (m/s).
Due to the [[dispersion (water waves)|dispersion relation]] for water waves under the action of gravity, the group velocity depends on the wavelength ''λ'', or equivalently, on the wave [[period (physics)|period]] ''T''. Further, the dispersion relation is a function of the water depth ''h''. As a result, the group velocity behaves differently in the limits of deep and shallow water, and at intermediate depths:&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goda/&gt;

=== Deep-water characteristics and opportunities ===

Deep water corresponds with a water depth larger than half the wavelength, which is the common situation in the sea and ocean. In deep water, longer-period waves propagate faster and transport their energy faster. The deep-water group velocity is half the [[phase velocity]]. In [[waves and shallow water|shallow water]], for wavelengths larger than about twenty times the water depth, as found quite often near the coast, the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity.&lt;ref name=Dean_Dalrymple&gt;{{cite book | title=Water wave mechanics for engineers and scientists |author1=R.

The first known patent to use energy from ocean waves dates back to 1799, and was filed in Paris by [[Pierre-Simon Girard|Girard]] and his son.&lt;ref name=cle2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Clément|year=2002 |title=Wave energy in Europe: current status and perspectives |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=405–431 |doi=10.1016/S1364-0321(02)00009-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early application of wave power was a device constructed around 1910 by Bochaux-Praceique to light and power his house at [[Royan]], near [[Bordeaux]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/0-Archive/EWPP%20archive/1976%20Leishman%20and%20Scobie%20NEL.pdf|format=PDF |title=The Development of Wave Power|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that this was the first oscillating water-column type of wave-energy device.&lt;ref name=morris2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morris-Thomas |year=2007 |title=An Investigation Into the Hydrodynamic Efficiency of an Oscillating Water Column |journal=Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=273–278 |doi=10.1115/1.2426992 |last2=Irvin |first2=Rohan J. |last3=Thiagarajan |first3=Krish P.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1855 to 1973 there were already 340 patents filed in the UK alone.&lt;ref name=cle2002/&gt;

Modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was pioneered by [[Yoshio Masuda]]'s experiments in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |title=Wave Energy Research and Development at JAMSTEC|accessdate=2009-12-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080701162330/http://www.jamstec.go.jp/jamstec/MTD/Whale/ |archivedate = July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He tested various concepts of wave-energy devices at sea, with several hundred units used to power navigation lights.

A renewed interest in wave energy was motivated by the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis in 1973]]. A number of university researchers re-examined the potential to generate energy from ocean waves, among whom notably were [[Stephen Salter]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]], [[Kjell Budal]] and [[Johannes Falnes]] from [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]] (now merged into [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]), [[Michael E. McCormick]] from [[U.S. Naval Academy]], [[David Evans (mathematician)|David Evans]] from [[Bristol University]], Michael French from [[University of Lancaster]], [[John Nicholas Newman|Nick Newman]] and [[C. C. Mei]] from [[MIT]].

Stephen Salter's [[1974 in science|1974 invention]] became known as [[Salter's duck]] or ''nodding duck'', although it was officially referred to as the Edinburgh Duck. In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity giving 81% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mech.ed.ac.uk/research/wavepower/EWPP%20archive/duck%20efficiency%20&amp;%20survival%20notes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Edinburgh Wave Energy Project|publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, as the oil price went down, wave-energy funding was drastically reduced. Nevertheless, a few first-generation prototypes were tested at sea. More recently, following the issue of climate change, there is again a growing interest worldwide for renewable energy, including wave energy.&lt;ref name=falnes2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falnes, J. |year=2007 |title=A review of wave-energy extraction |journal=Marine Structures |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=185–201 |doi=10.1016/j.marstruc.2007.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick-start the development of a wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the [http://www.emec.org.uk/ European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)] has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid-connected wave test site is situated at Billia Croo, on the western edge of the Orkney mainland, and is subject to the full force of the Atlantic Ocean with seas as high as 19 metres recorded at the site. Wave energy developers currently testing at the centre include [http://www.aquamarinepower.com/ Aquamarine Power], [http://www.pelamiswave.com/ Pelamis Wave Power], [http://www.emec.org.uk/about-us/wave-clients/scottishpower-renewables/ ScottishPower Renewables] and [http://www.wello.eu/ Wello].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emec.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern technology ==

Wave power devices are generally categorized by the '''method''' used to capture the energy of the waves, by '''location''' and by the '''power take-off system'''. Locations are shoreline, nearshore and offshore. Types of power take-off include: [[hydraulic ram]], [[Peristaltic pump|elastomeric hose pump]], pump-to-shore, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric turbine]], air turbine,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060523114110/http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/fall2003/ece441/groups/g12/White_Papers/Kelly.htm Embedded Shoreline Devices and Uses as Power Generation Sources] ''Kimball, Kelly, November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Linear motor|linear electrical generator]]. When evaluating [[wave energy]] as a technology type, it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches: point absorber buoys, surface attenuators, oscillating water columns, and overtopping devices.

[[File:Wave energy concepts overview numbered.png|thumb|300px|Generic wave energy concepts: 1. Point absorber, 2. Attenuator, 3. Oscillating wave surge converter, 4. Oscillating water column, 5. Overtopping device, 6. Submerged pressure differential]]

=== Point absorber buoy ===

This device floats on the surface of the [[water]], held in place by cables connected to the seabed. The point-absorber is deﬁned as having a device width much smaller than the incoming wavelength λ. A good point absorber has the same characteristics as a good wave-maker. The wave energy is absorbed by radiating a wave with destructive interference to the incoming waves. Buoys use the rise and fall of swells to generate [[electricity]] in various ways including directly via [[linear alternator|linear generators]],&lt;ref name="Seabased"&gt;{{cite web|title=Seabased AB wave energy technology|url=http://www.seabased.com/en/technology/seabased-wave-energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; or via generators driven by mechanical linear-to-rotary converters&lt;ref name="PowerBuoy"&gt;{{cite web|title=PowerBuoy Technology — Ocean Power Technologies|url=http://www.oceanpowertechnologies.com/powerbuoy-technology/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hydraulic pumps.&lt;ref name="CETO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perth Wave Energy Project - Carnegie’s CETO Wave Energy technology|url=https://arena.gov.au/projects/perth-wave-energy-project/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electromagnetic field|EMF]] generated by electrical transmission cables and acoustics of these devices may be a concern for marine organisms. The presence of the buoys may affect fish, marine mammals, and birds as potential minor collision risk and roosting sites. Potential also exists for entanglement in mooring lines. Energy removed from the waves may also affect the shoreline, resulting in a recommendation that sites remain a considerable distance from the shore.&lt;ref name="Tethys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/technology-type/wave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface attenuator ===

These devices act similarly to [[Wave power#Point absorber buoy|point absorber buoys]], with multiple floating segments connected to one another and are oriented perpendicular to incoming waves. A flexing motion is created by swells that drive hydraulic pumps to generate electricity. Environmental effects are similar to those of point absorber buoys, with an additional concern that organisms could be pinched in the joints.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Oscillating wave surge converter ===

These devices typically have one end fixed to a structure or the seabed while the other end is free to move. [[Energy]] is collected from the relative motion of the body compared to the fixed point. Oscillating wave surge converters often come in the form of floats, flaps, or membranes. Environmental concerns include minor risk of collision, artificial reefing near the fixed point, [[Electromotive force|EMF]] effects from subsea cables, and energy removal effecting sediment transport.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt; Some of these designs incorporate [[parabolic reflector]]s as a means of increasing the wave energy at the point of capture. These capture systems use the rise and fall motion of waves to capture energy.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McCormick |first1=Michael E. |first2=R. Cengiz |last2=Ertekin |title=Renewable sea power: Waves, tides, and thermals – new research funding seeks to put them to work for us |journal=Mechanical Engineering |publisher=ASME |volume=131 |issue=5 |year=2009 |pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the wave energy is captured at a wave source, power must be carried to the point of use or to a connection to the [[electrical grid]] by [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] [[submarine power cable|power cables]].&lt;ref name=nyt20100316&gt;

=== Oscillating water column ===

[[Oscillating Water Column]] devices can be located on shore or in deeper waters offshore. With an air chamber integrated into the device, swells compress air in the chambers forcing air through an air turbine to create [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="“grnflea"&gt;{{cite web|title=Extracting Energy From Ocean Waves|url=http://grnflea.com/extracting-energy-from-ocean-waves/|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant noise is produced as air is pushed through the turbines, potentially affecting [[birds]] and other [[marine organisms]] within the vicinity of the device. There is also concern about marine organisms getting trapped or entangled within the air chambers.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Overtopping device ===

Overtopping devices are long structures that use wave velocity to fill a reservoir to a greater water level than the surrounding ocean. The potential energy in the reservoir height is then captured with low-head turbines. Devices can be either on shore or floating offshore. Floating devices will have environmental concerns about the mooring system affecting [[benthic organism]]s, organisms becoming entangled, or EMF effects produced from [[subsea cable]]s. There is also some concern regarding low levels of turbine noise and wave energy removal affecting the nearfield habitat.&lt;ref name="Tethys"/&gt;

=== Submerged pressure differential ===
Submerged pressure differential based converters are a comparatively newer technology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurniawan|first=Adi|last2=Greaves|first2=Deborah|last3=Chaplin|first3=John|date=2014-12-08|title=Wave energy devices with compressible volumes|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/470/2172/20140559|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=470|issue=2172|pages=20140559|doi=10.1098/rspa.2014.0559|issn=1364-5021|pmc=4241014|pmid=25484609|bibcode=2014RSPSA.47040559K}}&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing flexible (usually reinforced rubber) membranes to extract wave energy. These converters use the difference in pressure at different locations below a wave to produce a pressure difference within a closed power take-off fluid system. This pressure difference is usually used to produce flow, which drives a turbine and electrical generator. Submerged pressure differential converters frequently use flexible membranes as the working surface between the ocean and the power take-off system. Membranes offer the advantage over rigid structures of being compliant and low mass, which can produce more direct coupling with the wave’s energy. Their compliant nature also allows for large changes in the geometry of the working surface, which can be used to tune the response of the converter for specific wave conditions and to protect it from excessive loads in extreme conditions.

A submerged converter may be positioned either on the sea floor or in midwater. In both cases, the converter is protected from water impact loads which can occur at the [[free surface]]. Wave loads also diminish in [[Nonlinear system|non-linear]] proportion to the distance below the free surface. This means that by optimizing the depth of submergence for such a converter, a compromise between protection from extreme loads and access to wave energy can be found. Submerged WECs also have the potential to reduce the impact on marine amenity and navigation, as they are not at the surface. Examples of submerged pressure differential converters include [http://www.m3wave.com/m3tech M3 Wave], [http://www.bomborawave.com Bombora Wave Power]'s mWave, and [http://calwave.energy CalWave].

== Environmental effects ==

{{further|Environmental impact of electricity generation#Wave}}

Common environmental concerns associated with [[marine energy]] developments include:

* The risk of [[marine mammal]]s and [[fish]] being struck by tidal [[turbine]] blades;
* The effects of [[electromagnetic field|EMF]] and underwater noise emitted from operating marine energy devices;
* The physical presence of [[marine energy]] projects and their potential to alter the behavior of marine mammals, fish, and [[seabird]]s with attraction or avoidance;
* The potential effect on nearfield and farfield marine environment and processes such as [[sediment transport]] and [[water quality]].

The [[Tethys (database)|Tethys database]] provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of wave energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110141934/http://tethys.pnnl.gov/wiki/index.php/Tethys_Home|archivedate=November 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential ==

The worldwide resource of coastal wave energy has been estimated to be greater than 2 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gunn |first=Kester |last2=Stock-Williams |first2=Clym |date=August 2012 |title=Quantifying the global wave power resource |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148112001310 |journal=Renewable Energy |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |volume=44 |pages=296–304 |access-date=27 February 2015 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2012.01.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Locations with the most potential for wave power include the western seaboard of Europe, the northern coast of the UK, and the Pacific coastlines of North and South America, Southern Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The north and south [[temperate zones]] have the best sites for capturing wave power. The prevailing [[westerlies]] in these zones blow strongest in winter.

== Challenges ==

There is a potential impact on the marine environment. Noise pollution, for example, could have negative impact if not monitored, although the noise and visible impact of each design vary greatly.&lt;ref name="ocs"/&gt; Other biophysical impacts (flora and fauna, sediment regimes and water column structure and flows) of scaling up the technology are being studied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/mre/background.asp Marine Renewable Energy Programme], [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Retrieved 2011-08-01&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of socio-economic challenges, wave farms can result in the displacement of commercial and recreational fishermen from productive fishing grounds, can change the pattern of beach sand nourishment, and may represent hazards to safe navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Hackett]]:''Economic and Social Considerations for Wave Energy Development in California'' [http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-500-2008-083/CEC-500-2008-083.PDF CEC Report Nov 2008] Ch2, pp22-44 [[California Energy Commission]]|Retrieved 2008-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Waves generate about 2,700 gigawatts of power. Of those 2,700 gigawatts, only about 500 gigawatts can be captured with the current technology.&lt;ref name="Renewable Sea Power"/&gt; Since 2008, Seabased Industry AB (SIAB) has deployed several units of wave energy converters (WECs) manufactured with different designs. Offshore deployments of WECs and underswater substation are being complicated procedures. SIAB discussed these deployments in terms of economy and time efficiency, as well as safety. Certain solutions are suggested for the various problems encountered during the deployments. It is found that the offshore deployment process can be optimized in terms of cost, time efficiency and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chatzigiannakou|first=Maria Angeliki|last2=Dolguntseva|first2=Irina|last3=Leijon|first3=Mats|date=2017-03-25|title=Offshore Deployments of Wave Energy Converters by Seabased Industry AB|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/5/2/15|journal=Journal of Marine Science and Engineering|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=15|doi=10.3390/jmse5020015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wave farms ==

{{Main|Wave farm}}A group of wave energy devices deployed in the same location is called [[wave farm]], wave power farm or wave energy park. Wave farms represent a solution to achieve larger electricity production. The devices of a park are going to interact with each other hydrodynamically and electrically, according to the number of machines, the distance among them, the geometric layout, the wave climate, the local geometry,  the control strategies. The design process of a wave energy farm is a multi-[[optimization problem]] with the aim to get a high power production and low costs and power fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Giassi|first=Marianna|last2=Göteman|first2=Malin|date=April 2018|title=Layout design of wave energy parks by a genetic algorithm|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=154|pages=252–261|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.01.096|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reading}}

'''Whole language''' describes a literacy philosophy which emphasizes that children should focus on meaning and strategy instruction. It is often contrasted with [[phonics]]-based methods of teaching reading and writing which emphasize instruction for decoding and spelling. However, from whole language practitioners' perspective, this view is erroneous and sets up a [[false dichotomy]].

Whole language practitioners teach to develop a knowledge of language including the graphophonic, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic aspects of language. Within a whole language perspective, language is treated as a complete meaning-making system, the parts of which function in relational ways.

Critics of whole language claim that it is just a "latest embodiment of the anti-phonics side of the phonics-vs-anti-phonics war existing in some form in the U.S. since the 1830’s", which keeps changing the terminology from "whole-word", "look-say", "[[sight word]]s", "meaning-emphasis" to "language experience", "eclectic", "psycholinguistics", and now to "whole language" or "literature-based".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://donpotter.net/pdf/reading-charlie-richardson.pdf |title=Reading: Phonics vs Whole-Language|first=Charles|last=Richardson|date=March 6, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has drawn criticism by those who advocate "[[back to basics (education)|back to basics]]" [[pedagogy]] or reading instruction because whole language is based on a limited body of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooks.com/ebooks/book_display.asp?IID=242691 eBooks.com – In Defense of Good Teaching: What Teachers Need to Know About the eBook&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

Whole language is an educational philosophy that is complex to describe, particularly because it is informed by multiple research fields including but not limited to education, linguistics, psychology, sociology, and anthropology (see also [[Language Experience Approach]]). It can be viewed as being founded on the educational philosophy of [[John Amos Comenius]] in the early 18th century. Several strands run through most descriptions of whole language:
*focus on making meaning in reading and expressing meaning in writing;
*[[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] approaches to knowledge creation, emphasizing students' interpretations of text and free expression of ideas in writing (often through daily journal entries);
*emphasis on high-quality and culturally diverse literature;
*integrating literacy into other areas of the curriculum, especially math, science, and social studies;
*frequent reading
**with students in small "[[guided reading]]" groups
**to students with "[[read aloud]]s"
**by students independently;
*reading and writing for real purposes;
*focus on motivational aspects of literacy, emphasizing the love of books and engaging reading materials;
*meaning-centered whole to part to whole instruction where phonics are taught contextually in "embedded" phonics (different from [[Synthetic phonics]] or [[Analytical phonics]]); and
*emphasis on using and understanding the meaning-making role of phonics, grammar, spelling, capitalization and punctuation in diverse social contexts.

Sometimes argued to be in competition with phonics methods, and that the whole language approach tends to impair learning how to spell.

=== Learning theory ===

The idea of "whole" language has its basis in a range of theories of learning related to the [[epistemology|epistemologies]] called "[[holism]]". Holism is based upon the belief that it is not possible to understand learning of any kind by analyzing small chunks of the learning system. Holism was very much a response to [[behaviorism]], which emphasized that the world could be understood by experimenting with stimuli and responses. Holists considered this a [[reductionist]] perspective that did not recognize that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."  Analyzing individual behaviors, holists argued, could never tell us how the entire human mind worked. This is—in simplified terms—the theoretical basis for the term "whole language."{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

An important element for most teachers is also the principle that education and learning are driven by engagement and engagement with reading is triggered through quality content. This dates back to the theories of [[John Amos Comenius]], who first pushed for education to move away from dull rote learning. This is also reflects a fundamental element of the concern voiced by many educators over the use of pure [[phonics]] and the [[Positivism|positivist]] view that you can accurately measure the development of reading sub-skills.

=== Chomsky and Goodman ===

Gregory Shafer, a professor of English at Mott Community College, claimed that "the seeds" of the whole language movement were "firmly rooted" in the theories of linguist [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1429&amp;context=lajm |title=Whole Language: Origins and Practice|first=Gregory|last=Shafer|year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Ken Goodman]] had an idea about reading, which he considered similar to Chomsky's, and he wrote a widely cited article calling "Reading: A psycholinguistic guessing game".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=A psycholinguistic guessing game|journal=Journal of the Reading Specialist|volume=6|issue=4|pages=126–135|doi=10.1080/19388076709556976|year = 1967|last1 = Goodman|first1 = Kenneth S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodman set out to determine whether the views of Chomsky could serve as psychological models of the reading process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://msu.edu/~dwong/StudentWorkArchive/CEP900F00-RIP/Tower-Literacy.htm |title=CEP 900: Research Interests|first=Cathy|last=Tower|date=December 11, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chided educators for attempting to apply what he saw as unnecessary [[orthography|orthographic]] order to a process that relied on holistic examination of words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a918937249&amp;db=all |title=Reading: A psycholinguistic guessing game – Literacy Research and Instruction }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Goodman was indeed inspired by Chomsky, neither Chomsky himself nor his followers have ever accepted Goodman's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004261.html |title=The globalization of educational fads and fallacies|first=Mark|last=Liberman|date=March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/~linguistics/people/faculty/pesetsky/USC_talk.pdf |title=The Battle for Language: from Syntax to Phonics|first=David|last=Pesetsky|date=April 8, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman thought that there are four "cueing systems" for reading, four things that readers have to guess what word comes next:
# graphophonemic: the shapes of the letters, and the sounds that they evoke (see [[phonetics]]).
# semantic: what word one would expect to occur based on the meaning of the sentence so far (see [[semantics]]).
# syntactic: what part of speech or word would make sense based on the grammar of the language (see [[syntax]]).
# pragmatic: what is the function of the text

The "graph" part of the word "graphophonemic" means the shape or symbol of the graphic input, i.e., the text. According to Goodman, these systems work together to help readers guess the right word. He emphasized that pronouncing individual words will involve the use of all three systems (letter clues, meaning clues from context, and syntactical structure of the sentence).

'''The graphophonemic cues''' are related to the sounds we hear (the phonological system including individual letters and letter combinations), the letters of the alphabet, and the conventions of spelling, punctuation and print. Students who are emerging readers use these cues considerably. However, in the English language there is a very imprecise relationship between written symbols and sound symbols.&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=Yetta|title=Reading Miscue Inventory|year=2005|publisher=Robert C. Owen Publishers, Inc.|location=Katonah, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes the relationships and their patterns do not work, as in the example of ''great'' and ''head''. Proficient readers and writers draw on their prior experiences with text and the other cueing systems, as well as the phonological system, as their reading and writing develops. Ken Goodman writes that, "The cue systems are used simultaneously and interdependently. What constitutes useful graphic information depends on how much syntactic and semantic information is available. Within high contextual constraints an initial consonant may be all that is needed to identify an element and make possible the prediction of an ensuing sequence or the confirmation of prior predictions."&lt;ref name="Kenneth Goodman" /&gt; He continues with, "Reading requires not so much skills as strategies that make it possible to select the most productive cues." He believes that reading involves the interrelationship of all the language systems. Readers sample and make judgments about which cues from each system will provide the most useful information in making predictions that will get them to meaning.
Goodman&lt;ref name="Kenneth Goodman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=Kenneth|title=Language and Literacy|year=1982|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-7100-0875-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a partial list of the various systems readers use as they interact with text. Within the graphophonemic system there are:

* Letter-sound relationships
* Shape (or word configuration)
* Know ‘little words’ in bigger words
* Whole know words
* Recurrent spelling patterns

'''The semantic cuing system''' is the one in which meaning is constructed. "So focused is reading on making sense that the visual input, the perceptions we form, and the syntactic patterns we assign are all directed by our meaning construction."&lt;ref name="K.Goodman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=K.|title=On Reading|year=1996|publisher=Heinemann|location=NH|isbn=978-0-435-07200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key component of the semantic system is context. A reader must be able to attach meaning to words and have some prior knowledge to use as a context for understanding the word. They must be able to relate the newly learned word to prior knowledge through personal associations with text and the structure of text.

The semantic system is developed from the beginning through early interactions with adults. At first, this usually involves labeling (e.g. This is a dog). Then labeling becomes more detailed (e.g., It is a Labrador dog. Its coat is black.) The child learns that there is a set of "dog attributes" and that within the category "dog", there are subsets of "dog" (e.g. long-hair, short-hair). The development of this system and the development of the important concepts that relate to the system are largely accomplished as children begin to explore language independently. As children speak about what they’ve done and play out their experiences, they are making personal associations between their experiences and language. This is critical to success in later literacy practices such as reading comprehension and writing. The meaning people bring to the reading is available to them through every cuing system, but it’s particularly influential as we move from our sense of the syntactic patterns to the semantic structures.&lt;ref name="Kenneth Goodman" /&gt;

To support the reader in developing the semantic system, ask, "Does that make sense"?

'''The syntactic system''', according to Goodman and Watson,&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt; includes the interrelation of words and sentences within connected text. In the English language, syntactic relations include word order, tense, number, and gender. The syntactic system is also concerned with word parts that change the meaning of a word, called morphemes. For example, adding the suffix "less" or adding "s" to the end of a word changes its meaning or tense. As speakers of English, people know where to place subjects, which pronoun to use and where adjectives occur. Individual word meaning is determined by the place of the word in the sentence and the particular semantic or syntactic role it occupies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Itzkoff|first=Seymour|title=How We Learn to Read|year=1986|publisher=Paideia Publishers|location=Ashfield, MA|isbn=978-0-913993-04-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example:
	''T''he mayor was present when he received a beautiful
	present from the present members of the board''.''

The syntactic system is usually in place when children begin school. Immersed in language, children begin to recognize that phrases and sentences are usually ordered in certain ways. This notion of ordering is the development of syntax. Like all the cueing systems, syntax provides the possibility of correct prediction when trying to make sense or meaning of written language. Goodman notes the cues found in the flow of language are:&lt;ref name="Kenneth Goodman" /&gt;

* Patterns of words (or function order)
* Inflection and inflectional agreement
* Function words such as noun markers (the, a, that)
* Intonation (which is poorly represented in writing by punctuation)

To support a reader in developing the syntactic system, ask, "Can we say it that way? Does that sound right?"

'''The pragmatic system''' is also involved in the construction of meaning while reading. This brings into play the socio-cultural knowledge of the reader. It provides information about the purposes and needs the reader has while reading. Yetta Goodman and Dorothy Watson state that, "Language has different meaning depending on the reason for use, the circumstances in which the language is used, and the ideas writers and readers have about the contextual relations with the language users. Language cannot exist outside a sociocultural context, which includes the prior knowledge of the language user. For example, shopping lists, menus, reports and plays are arranged uniquely and are dependent on the message, the intent, the audience, and the context."&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;

By the time children begin school, they may have developed an inferred understanding of some of the pragmatics of a particular situation. For example, turn taking in conversation, reading poetry or a shopping list. "While different materials may share common semantic, syntactic, and graphophonic features, each genre has its own organization and each requires certain experiences by the reader."&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;

To support the reader in developing the pragmatic system ask, "What is the purpose and function of this literacy event?"

Goodman performed a study where children first read words individually, and then read the same words in connected text. He found that the children did better when they read the words in connected text. Later replications of the experiment failed to find effects, however, when children did not read the same words in connected text immediately after reading them individually, as they had in Goodman's experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pressley, Michael |title=Reading instruction that works: the case for balanced teaching |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-1-59385-228-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gl6TWPOE2o0C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Reading+instruction+that+works:+The+case+for+balanced+teaching#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Reading instruction that works: the case for balanced teaching | author=Michael Pressley |year=2006 |publisher=|isbn=978-1-59385-228-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodman's theory has been criticized by other researchers who favor a phonics-based approach, and present research to support their viewpoint. Critics argue that good readers use decoding as their primary approach to reading, and use context to confirm that what they have read makes sense.

=== Application of Goodman's theory ===

Goodman's argument was compelling to educators as a way of thinking about beginning reading and literacy more broadly. This led to the idea that reading and writing were ideas that should be considered as wholes, learned by experience and exposure more than analysis and didactic instruction. This largely accounts for the focus on time spent reading, especially independent reading. Many classrooms (whole language or otherwise) include silent reading time, sometimes called DEAR ("[[Drop Everything And Read]]") time or SSR ([[sustained silent reading]]). Some versions of this independent reading time include a structured role for the teacher, especially Reader's Workshop. Despite the popularity of the extension of Chomsky's linguistic ideas to literacy, there is some neurological and experimental research that has concluded that reading, unlike language, is not a pre-programmed human skill. It must be learned. Dr. Sally Shaywitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/myncbi/collections/public/1-9V7emPzNapfhcT8HoP7Re/ |title=Shaywitz, Sally E research paper collection PubMed result 76 selected items }}&lt;/ref&gt; a neurologist at [[Yale University]], is credited with much of the research on the neurological structures of reading.

=== Contrasts with phonics ===

Because of this holistic emphasis, whole language is contrasted with skill-based areas of instruction, especially [[phonics]] and [[synthetic phonics]]. Phonics instruction is a commonly used technique for teaching students to read. Phonics instruction tends to emphasize attention to the individual components of words, for example, the [[phonemes]] /k/, /æ/, and /t/ are represented by the [[graphemes]] ''c'', ''a'', and ''t''. Because they do not focus exclusively on the individual parts, tending to focus on the relationship of parts to and within the larger context, whole language proponents do not favor some types of phonics instruction. Whole language advocates state that they do teach, and believe in, phonics, especially a type of phonics known as embedded phonics. In embedded phonics, letters are taught during other lessons focused on meaning and the phonics component is considered a "mini lesson". Instruction in embedded phonics typically emphasizes the [[consonants]] and the [[short vowels]], as well as letter combinations called [[Syllable rime|rimes]] or [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]]. The use of this embedded phonics model is called a "whole-part-whole" approach because, consistent with holistic thinking, students read the text for meaning first (whole), then examine features of the phonics system (part) and finally use their new knowledge while reading the text again (whole). [[Reading Recovery]] is a program that uses holistic practices with struggling readers.

This mixed approach is a development from the practice employed in the 70s and 80s when virtually no phonics was included in the curriculum at all. Theorists such as [[Ken Goodman]] and [[Frank Smith (psycholinguist)|Frank Smith]] at that time advocated a "guessing game" approach, entirely based on context and whole word analysis.

Most whole language advocates now see that children go through stages of spelling development as they develop, use and gain control over written language. Early literacy research conducted by Piagetian researcher, Emilia Ferreiro and published in her landmark book, ''Literacy Before Schooling'', has been replicated by University of Alabama professor, Maryann Manning. Based on this research "invented spelling" is another "whole-part-whole" approach: children learn to read by writing in a meaningful context, e.g. by writing letters to others. To write a word they have to decompose its spoken form into sounds and then to translate them into letters, e.g. ''k'', ''a'', ''t'' for the [[phonemes]] /k/, /æ/, and /t/.

New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; show that later orthographic development is fostered rather than hindered by these invented spellings – as long as children from the beginning are confronted with "book spellings", too.&lt;ref&gt;Brügelmann, Hans/ Brinkmann, Erika.

=== Rise of whole language and reaction ===
After its introduction by Goodman, whole language rose in popularity dramatically. It became a major educational paradigm of the late 1980s and the 1990s. Despite its popularity during this period, educators who believed that skill instruction was important for students' learning and some researchers in education were skeptical of whole language claims and said so loudly. What followed were the "Reading Wars" of the 1980s and 1990s between advocates of phonics and those of Whole Language methodology, which in turn led to several attempts to catalog research on the efficacy of phonics and whole language. This was a further turning of the wheel of conflict over how to teach reading that had been running for the whole century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jameskim/files/bookch2.pdf|title=Research and the Reading Wars|last=Kim|first=James|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Congress commissioned reading expert [[Marilyn Jager Adams]] to write a definitive book on the topic. She determined that phonics was important but suggested that some elements of the whole language approach were helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adams, Marilyn McCord |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Mass |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=978-0-262-51076-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P_Hk7-n8i1AC&amp;dq=Beginning+to+Read:+Thinking+and+Learning+about+Print&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Beginning to read: thinking and learning about print |author=Marilyn Jager Adams|year=1994 |publisher=|isbn=978-0-262-51076-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two large-scale efforts, in 1998 by the [[United States National Research Council]]'s Commission on Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Griffin, Peg |author2=Snow, Catherine E. |author3=Burns, M.

While proponents of whole language find the latter to be controversial, both panels found that phonics instruction of varying kinds, especially analytic and [[Synthetic phonics|Synthetic Phonics]], contributed positively to students' ability to read words on tests of reading words in isolation. Both panels also found that embedded phonics and no phonics contributed to lower rates of achievement for most populations of students when measured on test of reading words in isolation. The Panel recommended an approach it described as "scientifically-based reading research" (SBRR), that cited 5 elements essential to effective reading instruction, one of which was explicit, [[Systematic Phonics]] instruction (phonological awareness, reading comprehension, vocabulary, and fluency were the other 4).

In December 2005 the Australian Government endorsed the teaching of synthetic phonics, and discredited the whole language approach ("on its own"). Its Department of Education, Science and Training published a National Inquiry into the Teaching of Literacy. [http://www.dest.gov.au/nitl/documents/report_recommendations.pdf]  The report states "The evidence is clear, whether from research, good practice observed in schools, advice from submissions to the Inquiry, consultations, or from Committee members’ own individual experiences, that direct systematic instruction in phonics during the early years of schooling is an essential foundation for teaching children to read." Pg 11. See [[Synthetic phonics#Acceptance in Australia]]

In 2006 the U.K. Department for Education and Skills undertook a review of early reading that came out in favor of [[Synthetic phonics]]. Subsequently, in March 2011 the U.K. Department of Education released its White paper entitled "The Importance of Teaching" that supported systematic synthetic phonics as the best method for teaching reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/teachingandlearning/schoolswhitepaper/b0068570/the-importance-of-teaching/executive-summary/curriculum |title=Curriculum, assessment and qualifications (2012) |format= |work=UK Department of Education |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State of the debate ===

Despite these results, many whole language advocates continue to argue that their approach, including embedded phonics, has been shown to improve student achievement. Whole language advocates sometimes criticize advocates of skill instruction as "[[reductionism|reductionist]]" and describe the use of phonics as "word calling" because it does not involve the use of meaning. The United States National Reading Panel is criticized especially harshly by some in the whole language community for failing to include qualitative research designs that showed benefits for embedded phonics (the panel only considered [[field experiments|experiments]] and [[experimental techniques#Test markets|quasi-experiments]]). On the other hand, some parents and teachers have objected to the de-emphasis on phonics in whole language-based curricula such as Reading Recovery and advocated their removal from schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nrrf.org/learning/reading-recovery-bites-the-dust-in-columbus-ohio/ | title=Reading Recovery Bites the Dust in Columbus, Ohio – Learn to Read, NRRF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the California Department of Education lead the way in returning to the teaching of phonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/22/us/california-leads-revival-of-teaching-by-phonics.html|title= NY Times 1996, California Leads Revival Of Teaching by Phonics|newspaper= The New York Times|date= 1996-05-22|last1= Times|first1= The New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 the department had clear guidelines for teaching children in phonemic awareness, phonics, and segmenting and blending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter3.pdf|title= English–Language Arts, Transitional Kindergarten to Grade 1, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/rl/cf/documents/elaeldfwchapter4.pdf|title= English–Language Arts, Pedagogy Grades Two and Three, California Public Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Public School System followed; and by 2015 had abandoned Whole Language, Embedded Phonics and Balanced Literacy in favor of [[synthetic phonics|systematic phonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.engageny.org/resource/new-york-state-next-generation-english-language-arts-learning-standards|title=2015 New York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroscientists have also weighed into the debate, some of them demonstrating that the whole word method is much slower and uses the wrong brain area for reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25GI3-kiLdo&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=YouTube 'How the Brain Learns to Read' – Professor Stanilas Dehaene's short lecture (33 minutes) Oct 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/books/review/Gopnik-t.html|title=Reading in the brain, Dr. Stanilas Dehaene, 2009 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2009-12-31 |last1=Gopnik |first1=Alison }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Adoption of some whole language concepts ====

While rancor continues, much of whole language's emphasis on quality literature, cultural diversity, and reading [[Guided reading|in groups]] and [[read aloud|to students]] is widely supported by the educational community due to its benefits of increased comprehension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Benefits of Reading Aloud |url=http://www.readingrockets.org/article/reading-aloud-build-comprehension |publisher=ReadingRockets.org |accessdate=6 July 2018|date=2013-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The importance of motivation, long a central focus of whole language approaches, has gained more attention in the broader educational community in the last few years. Prominent critic of whole language Louisa Cook Moats has argued, however, that the foci on quality literature, diversity, reading groups, and motivation are not the sole property of whole language.&lt;ref&gt;Moats, L. C. (2000). ''Whole language lives on: The illusion of "Balanced Reading" instruction.''  Washington, DC: Thomas B. Fordham Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;  She, and others, contend these components of instruction are supported by educators of diverse educational perspectives. As one report states "Reading materials must be carefully chosen so as to be at the right reading level. Phonics instruction cannot stand alone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bccpac.bc.ca/upload/2016/05/reading_breaking_through_barriers.pdf |title=Reading: Breaking Through the Barriers- Copyright ©2009 Catherine Abraham and Joyce Gram}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moats contends that the principles essential to Whole Language, and those that render it ineffective and unfit for reading education are a) children learn to read from exposure to print, b) the hostility to drilling in phonics and other forms of direct instruction, and c) the tendency to endorse the use of context-clues and guess-work to decipher a word rather than phonemic decoding. In these and certain other tenets lie the essence and the error of Whole Language. Emphases on cultural diversity and quality literature is neither limited to Whole Language nor fundamental to it.

==== Balanced literacy ====
Since 1996 "[[Balanced Literacy|balanced literacy]]" has been suggested as an integrative approach, portrayed by its advocates as taking the best elements of both whole language and code-emphasizing phonics, something advocated by Adams in 1990. In 1996 the California Department of Education described the balanced approach as "one which combines the language and literature-rich activities associated with whole language with explicit teaching of the skills needed to decode words-for all children."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ericdigests.org/2000-3/reading.htm |title=Balanced Reading Instruction. ERIC Digest D144.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[New York City Department of Education|New York Public School]] system adopted balanced literacy as its literacy curriculum in 2003 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/education/new-york-s-new-approach.html|title=nytimes.com/2003/08/03|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2003-08-03|last1=Traub|first1=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;; however in 2015 it began a process to revise its English Language Arts Learning Standards. The new standards call for teaching involving "reading or literacy experiences" as well as [[phonemic awareness]] from prekindergarten to grade 1 and phonics and word recognition from grade 1 to grade 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.engageny.org/resource/new-york-state-next-generation-english-language-arts-learning-standards|title=2015 New York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of balance literacy have suggested that the term is just the disingenuous recasting of the very same whole language with obfuscating new terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ldonline.org/article/6394/|title=Whole Language Lives On: The Illusion of Balanced Reading Instruction – LD Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally vociferously, the whole language advocates have criticized the United States National Reading Panel. Allington used the term ''big brother'' to describe the government's role in the reading debate.&lt;ref&gt;Allington, R. (2002). ''Big Brother and the national reading curriculum: How ideology trumped evidence''. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[No Child Left Behind]] has brought a resurgence of interest in phonics. Its "Reading First" program addresses the reading deficiency in elementary students and requires that students must be explicitly and systematically taught five skills: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://education.findlaw.com/curriculum-standards-school-funding/the-no-child-left-behind-act-s-reading-requirement.html|title=No Child Left Behind: Reading Requirement}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2000s whole language receded to marginal status, and continues to fade.

I tipped my hand in the paragraph in [the sixth chapter of the book] which said that language is an instinct but reading is not. Like most psycholinguists (but apparently unlike many school boards), I think it's essential for children to be taught to become aware of speech sounds and how they are coded in strings of letters.|title-link=The Language Instinct}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David C.

The failure to distinguish biologically primary from biologically secondary skills has led to the development of the ''whole-language'' approach to reading. Here, it is assumed that children will acquire reading skills in the same way that they acquire language skills...Even though many of the neurobiological systems that support language also support reading, these systems have not evolved to automatically acquire reading skills...The belief that reading acquisition will occur in much the same way as language acquisition is almost certainly wrong, and the associated instructional techniques, such as whole reading, are very likely to be a disservice to many children.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Carnine, Edward Kame'enui, Jerry Silbert, Lynn Melby Gordon, [[Diane Ravitch]], and Jeanne Chall.&lt;ref&gt;Carnine, D.W., Silbert, J., Kame'enui, E.J., &amp; Tarver, S.G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="955">'''Zero address arithmetic''' is a feature of a few innovative [[computer architectures]], whereby the assignment to a physical address space is deferred until programming statement execution time. It eliminates the [[Linker (computing)|link step]] of conventional compile and link architectures, and more generally [[Relocation (computing)|relocation]].

All [[Burroughs large systems]] and [[Burroughs medium systems|medium systems]] had this property, as do their modern day successors that preserve the original physical architecture.

The 1960 announcement of the [[English Electric KDF9]] is the first announcement of a zero-address instruction format computer, rapidly followed by the [[Burroughs B5000]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res18.htm#c "The KDF9 Computer - 30 Years On"]&lt;/ref&gt;
