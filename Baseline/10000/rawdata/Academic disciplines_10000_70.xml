[[File:ATOMKI main-entrance.JPG|thumb|right|ATOMKI main entrance]]
'''ATOMKI''' is the  '''Institute for Nuclear Research, [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]'''. The institute was established in 1954 by [[Sándor Szalay (physicist)|Sándor Szalay]] the founder director.

ATOMKI became independent from the Institute of Experimental Physics of the Kossuth Lajos University (presently called [[University of Debrecen]]), where Sándor Szalay started and directed [[nuclear physics]] research for decades. At present, the main research fields of Atomki are atom-, nuclear-, and particle physics, ion beam analytics, technique of detection and signal processing, environmental analytics, radioactive dating, radiochemistry, and solid state physics. The director is Zsolt Dombrádi, [[Doctor of Sciences|D.Sc.]].

Some of its buildings were originally the National Orphanage for Teachers' Children, built in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Old photos|url=http://www.atomki.hu/regi_kepek/index_en.html|work=ATOMKI|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23358">The term '''abjection''' literally means "the state of being cast off." The term has been explored in [[post-structuralism]] as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular interpretations of abjection is [[Julia Kristeva]]'s (pursued particularly in her work ''[[Powers of Horror]]''). Kristeva describes subjective horror (abjection) as the feeling when an individual experiences, or is confronted by (both mentally and as a body), what Kristeva terms one's "corporeal reality", or a breakdown in the distinction between what is [[Self (philosophy)|self]] and what is [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of abjection is best described as the process by which one separates one's sense of self from that which immediately threatens one's sense of life. Abjection prevents the absolute realization of existence, completing the course of biological, social, physical, and spiritual cycles. The best representation of this concept can be imagined as one's reaction to gazing at a human cadaver, or corpse, as a direct reminder of the inevitability of death.

The abject is, as such, the process that separates from one's environment what "is not me."

Kristeva's concept of abjection is utilized commonly to explain popular cultural narratives of horror, and discriminatory behavior manifesting in [[misogyny]], [[misandry]], [[homophobia]], and [[genocide]]. The concept of abjection builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher &amp; Benjamin, "Abjection, melancholia and love: The work of Julia Kristeva" (2012) p. 92; Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literary critical theory==
Drawing on the French tradition of interest in the monstrous (e.g., novelist [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]),&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Brereton, ''A Short History of French Literature'' (1954), p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] as grounded in "filth" (e.g., psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]),&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994), p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Kristeva]] developed the idea of the abject as that which is rejected by/disturbs social reason{{snd}}the communal consensus that underpins a social order.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Kristeva, ''Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection'' (1982)m p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; The "abject" exists accordingly somewhere between the concept of an [[object (philosophy)|object]] and the concept of the subject, representing [[taboo]] elements of the self barely separated off in a [[Liminality|liminal]] space.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Kristeva claims that within the boundaries of what one defines as subject{{snd}}a part of oneself{{snd}}and object{{snd}}something that exists independently of oneself{{snd}}there resides pieces that were once categorized as a part of oneself or one's identity that has since been rejected{{snd}}the abject.

It is important to note, however, that Kristeva created a distinction in the true meaning of abjection: it is not the lack of "cleanliness or health" that causes abjection, but that which disturbs identity, system, and order.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror", p. 4; Guberman, "Julia Kristeva Interviews", (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the abject is situated outside the [[symbolic order]], being forced to face it is an inherently traumatic experience, as with the repulsion presented by confrontation with filth, waste, or a corpse{{snd}}an object which is violently cast out of the cultural world, having once been a subject.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/10269033/-Kristeva-Abjection-Short-Version Julia Kristeva, 'Approaching Abjection'].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the sense of the abject complements the existence of the [[superego]]{{snd}}the representative of culture, of the symbolic order:&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; in Kristeva's aphorism, "To each ego its object, to each superego its abject".&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kristeva's psychoanalytic perspective, abjection is done to the part of ourselves that we exclude: the mother. We must abject the maternal, the object which has created us, in order to construct an identity.&lt;ref name="scribd"/&gt; Abjection occurs on the micro level of the speaking being, through their subjective dynamics, as well as on the macro level of society, through "language as a common and universal law". We use [[ritual]]s, specifically those of defilement, to attempt to maintain clear boundaries between nature and society, the semiotic and the symbolic, paradoxically both excluding and renewing contact with the abject in the ritual act.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Creed, in Ken Gelder, ''The Horror Reader'' (2000), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of abjection is often coupled (and sometimes confused) with the idea of [[The Uncanny (Freud)|the uncanny]], the concept of something being "un-home-like", or foreign, yet familiar.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The abject can be uncanny in the sense that we can recognize aspects in it, despite its being "foreign": a corpse, having fallen out of the symbolic order, creates abjection through its uncanniness&lt;ref&gt;Winifred Menninghaus, ''Disgust'' (2003), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}creates a [[cognitive dissonance]].

===Cases===
* Abjection is a major theme of the 1949 work ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'' (Journal du Voleur) by French author [[Jean Genet]], a fictionalised account of his wanderings through Europe in the 1930s, wherein he claims as a criminal outcast to actively seek abjections as an [[existentialist]] form of 'sainthood'&lt;ref&gt;Gene A. Plunka, ''The Rites of Passage of Jean Genet'' (1992), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) has been analysed as an example of how in [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]] monstrous representations of the female resonate with the abject archaic figure of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Creed]], ''The Monstrous Feminine'' (1993), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Bodily dismemberment, forcible impregnation, and the chameleon nature of the alien itself may all be seen as explorations of phantasies of the [[primal scene]], and of the encounter with the boundaryless nature of the original abject mother.&lt;ref&gt;Creed, p. 17 and p. 26–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1990s-era Australian literary genre [[grunge lit]] often focuses on young adult characters with "abject" bodies &lt;ref&gt;Gelder K. and Salzman P. ''After the celebration: Australian fiction 1989–2007''. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; that are deteriorating and characters facing health problems. For example, the male and female lead characters in [[Andrew McGahan]]'s book ''[[Praise]]'', Gordon Buchanan and Cynthia Lamonde, both have diseased bodies, with Cynthia facing skin that breaks out in rashes. Karen Brooks states that Clare Mendes'  ''Drift Street'', Edward Berridge's ''[[The Lives of the Saints (fiction)|The Lives of the Saints]]'', and ''[[Praise]]'' "...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other" and "opening up" new "limnal [boundary] spaces" where the concept of an abject human body can be explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks states that the marginalized characters in ''The Lives of the Saints'', ''Drift Street'' and ''Praise'') are able to stay in "shit creek" (an undesirable setting or situation) and "diver[t]... flows" of these "creeks", thus claiming their rough settings' "limnality" (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own "abjection" (having "abject bodies" with health problems, disease, etc.) as "sites of symbolic empowerment and agency".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Karen|year=1998|title=Shit Creek: Suburbia, Abjection and Subjectivity in Australian 'Grunge' Fiction.|url=|journal=Australian Literary Studies|volume=18.4|pages=87–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social critical theory==
"Abjection" is often used to describe the state of often-[[marginalized]] groups, such as women, unwed mothers, people of minority religious faiths, sex workers, convicts, poor and disabled people. From a deconstruction of sexual discourses and gender history Ian McCormick has outlined the recurring links between pleasurable transgressive desire, deviant categories of behaviour and responses to body fluids in 18th and 19th-century discussions of prostitution, sodomy, and masturbation (self-pollution, impurity, uncleanness).&lt;ref&gt;''Sexual Outcasts''. 4 vols., edited with introductions by Ian McCormick (London and New York: Routledge, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salih|first1=Sara|title=Judth Butler|date=2002|page=63|url=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Salih-Butler-Performativity-Chapter_3.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term space of abjection is also used, referring to a space that abjected things or beings inhabit.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===In organizational studies===
[[Organizational theory]] literature on abjection has attempted to illuminate various ways in which institutions come to silence, exclude or disavow feelings, practices, groups or discourses within the workplace. Studies have examined and demonstrated the manner in which people adopt roles, identities and discourses to avoid the consequences of social and organizational abjection.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny (2010); Bulter (2004); cited in Risque, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279–80.&lt;/ref&gt; In such studies the focus is often placed upon a group of people within an organization or institution that fall outside of the norm, thus becoming what Kristeva terms "the one by whom the abject exists," or "the deject" people.&lt;ref&gt;"Powers of Horror", p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions and organizations typically rely on rituals and other structural practices to protect symbolic elements from the [[semiotic]], both in a grander organizational focus that emphasizes the role of policy-making, and in a smaller interpersonal level that emphasizes social rejection. Both the organizational and interpersonal levels produce a series of exclusionary practices that create a "zone of inhabitability" for staff perceived to be in opposition to the organizational norms.

One such method is that of "collective instruction," which refers to a strategy often used to defer, render abject and hide the inconvenient "dark side" of the organization, keeping it away from view through corporate forces.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson, "Changing the memory of suffering: An organizational aesthetics on the dark side" (2014), p. 281–3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the process by which an acceptable, unified meaning is created{{snd}}for example, a corporation's or organization's [[mission statement]]. Through the controlled release of information and belief or reactionary statements, people are gradually exposed to a firm's persuasive interpretation of an event or circumstance, that could have been considered abject. This [[spin (public relations)|spun meaning]] developed by the firm becomes shared throughout a community. That event or circumstance comes to be interpreted and viewed in a singular way by many people, creating a unified, accepted meaning. The purpose such strategies serve is to identify and attempt to control the abject, as the abject ideas become ejected from each individual memory.

Organizations such as hospitals must negotiate the divide between the symbolic and the semiotic in a unique manner.&lt;ref&gt;Risq, "States of Abjection" (2013), p. 1279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nurses, for example, are confronted with the abject in a more concrete, physical fashion due to their proximity to the ill, wounded and dying. They are faced with the reality of death and suffering in a way not typically experienced by hospital administrators and leaders. Nurses must learn to separate themselves and their emotional states from the circumstances of death, dying and suffering they are surrounded by. Very strict rituals and power structures are used in hospitals, which suggests that the dynamics of abjection have a role to play in understanding not only how anxiety becomes the work of the health team and the organization, but also how it is enacted at the level of hospital policy.

===In sociological studies===
The abject is a concept that is often used to describe bodies and things that one finds repulsive or disgusting, and in order to preserve one's identity they are cast out. Kristeva used this concept to analyze xenophobia and anti-Semitism, and was therefore the first to apply the abject to cultural analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Imogen Tyler&lt;ref&gt;"Revolting subjects: Social abjection and resistance in neoliberal Britain" (2013), p. 599&lt;/ref&gt; sought to make the concept more social in order to analyze abjection as a social and lived process and to consider both those who abject and those who find themselves abjected, between representation of the powerful and the resistance of the oppressed. Tyler conducted an examination into the way that contemporary Britain had labelled particular groups of people{{snd}}mostly minority groups{{snd}}as revolting figures, and how those individuals revolt against their abject identity, also known as marginalization, stigmatizing and/or social exclusion.

There has also been exploration done into the way people look at others whose bodies may look different from the norm due to illness, injury or birth defect. Researchers such as Frances&lt;ref&gt;"Damaged or unusual bodies: Staring, or seeing and feeling" (2014), p. 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize the importance of the interpersonal consequences that result from this looking. A person with a disability, by being similar to us and also different, is the person by whom the abject exists and people who view this individual react to that abjection by either attempting to ignore and reject it, or by attempting to engage and immerse themselves in it. In this particular instance, Frances claims, the former manifests through the refusal to make eye contact or acknowledge the presence of the personal with a disability, while the latter manifests through intrusive staring. The interpersonal consequences that result from this are either that the person with a disability is denied and treated as an 'other'{{snd}}an object that can be ignored{{snd}}or that the individual is clearly identified and defined as a deject.

==In psychotherapy==
By bringing focus onto concepts such as abjection, psychotherapists may allow for the exploration of links between lived experience and cultural formations in the development of particular psychopathologies. Bruan Seu&lt;ref&gt;cited in Dryden, Ussher and Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014), p. 1343.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the critical importance of bringing together Foucauldian ideas of self-surveillance and positioning in discourse with a psychodynamic theorization in order to grasp the full significance of psychological impactors, such as shame.

Concerning psychopathologies such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), the role of the other{{snd}}actual, imagined or fantasized{{snd}}is central, and ambivalence about the body, inflated by shame, is the key to this dynamic. Parker&lt;ref&gt;"Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014), p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that individuals suffering from BDD are sensitive to the power, pleasure and pain of being looked at, as their objective sense of self dominates any subjective sense. The role of the other has become increasingly significant to developmental theories in contemporary psychoanalysis, and is very evident in body image as it is formed through identification, projection and introjection. Those individuals with BDD consider a part of their body unattractive or unwanted, and this belief is exacerbated by shame and the impression that others notice and negatively perceive the supposed physical flaw, which creates a cycle. Over time, the person with BDD begins to view that part of their body as being separate from themselves, a rogue body part{{snd}}it has been abjected. Consider also those who experience social anxiety, who experience the subjectification of being abject is a similar yet different way to those with Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Abject, here, refers to marginally objectionable material that does not quite belong in the greater society as a whole{{snd}}whether this not-belonging is real or imagined is irrelevant, only that it is perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; For those with social anxiety, it is their entire social self which is perceived to be the deject, straying away from normal social rituals and capabilities.

Studying abjection has proven to be suggestive and helpful for considering the dynamics of self and body hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Dryden, Ussher &amp; Perz, "Young women's construction of their post-cancer fertility" (2014); Parker, "Critical looks: An analysis of body dysmorphic disorder" (2014); Schott &amp; Sordengaard, "School bullying: New theories in context" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This carries interesting implications for studying such disorders as separation anxiety, biologically centered phobias, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

==In art==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}

The roots of abject art go back a long way. The Tate defines abject art as that which "explore themes that transgress and threaten our sense of cleanliness and propriety[,] particularly referencing the body and bodily functions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art |title=Abject Art |work=[[Tate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painters expressed a fascination for blood long before the Renaissance but it was not until the [[Dada]] movement that the fascination with transgression and taboo made it possible for abject art, as a movement, to exist. It was influenced by [[Antonin Artaud]]'s ''[[Theatre of Cruelty]]''. The [[Whitney Museum]] in [[New York City]] identified abject art in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, Hal. "Obscene, abject, traumatic." October (1996): 107–124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kutzbach, Konstanze | author2=Mueller, Monika | title=The abject of desire : the aestheticization of the unaesthetic in contemporary literature and culture | publication-date=2007 | publisher=Rodopi | isbn=978-90-420-2264-5 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was preceded by the films and performances of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese actionists]], in particular, [[Hermann Nitsch]], whose interest in Schwitter's idea of a [[gesamtkunstwerk]] (total artwork) led to his setting up the radical theatre group, known as the [[Orgien-Mysterien-Theater]]. The group used animal carcasses and bloodshed in a ritualistic way. Nitsch served time in jail for blasphemy before being invited to New York in 1968 by Jonas Mekas. Nitsch organised a series of performances which influenced the radical New York art scene. Other members of the [[Viennese Actionism|Viennese Actionists]], [[Gunter Brus]], who began as a painter, and [[Otto Muehl]] collaborated on performances. The performances of [[Gunter Brus]] involved publicly urinating, defecating and cutting himself with a razor blade. [[Rudolf Schwarzkogler]] is known for his photos dealing with the abject.  
In the late 1960s, [[performance art]] become popular in New York, including by [[Carolee Schneemann]]. [[Mary Kelly (artist)|Mary Kelly]], [[Genesis P. Orridge]] and [[GG Allin]] did this type of art.

In the 1980s and 1990s, fascination with the ''[[Powers of Horror]]'', the title of a book by [[Julia Kristeva]], led to a second wave of radical performance artists working with bodily fluids including [[Ron Athey]], [[Franko B]], [[Lennie Lee]] and [[Kira O' Reilly]]. Kristeva herself associated aesthetic experience of the abject, such as art and literature, with poetic catharsis{{snd}}an impure process that allows the artist or author to protect themselves from the abject only by immersing themselves within it.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, "Powers of Horror" (1982), p. 15; Spittle, "'Did this game scare you? Because it sure as hell scared me!' F.E.A.R., the abject and the uncanny" (2011); Oliver, "Psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and politics in the work of Kristeva" (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the abject became a theme of radical Chinese performance artists [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]] and [[Yang Zhichao]]. The abject also began to influence mainstream artists including [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Gilbert and George]], [[Robert Gober]], [[Kiki Smith]] and [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]] who were all included in the 1993 Whitney show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/abject-art "Abject Art"] Retrieved on 2010-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artists working with abjection include New York photographers, [[Joel Peter Witkin]], whose book ''[[Love and Redemption]]'' and [[Andres Serrano]] whose piece entitled ''[[Piss Christ]]'' caused a scandal in 1989.

Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its [[exoteric]] practical applications and its [[esoteric]] spiritual aspects, despite the arguments of scholars like [[Eric John Holmyard|Holmyard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marie-Louise von Franz|von Franz]]&lt;ref name="FRAALC97"&gt;{{harvp|von Franz|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that they should be understood as complementary. The former is pursued by [[History of the physical sciences|historians of the physical sciences]] who examine the subject in terms of [[History of chemistry|early chemistry]], [[History of medicine|medicine]], and [[charlatanism]], and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred. The latter interests historians of [[esotericism]], [[History of psychology|psychologists]], and some philosophers and [[Spirituality|spiritualists]]. The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts. Despite this split, which von Franz believes has existed since the Western traditions' origin in a mix of [[Greek philosophy]] that was mixed with [[Ancient Egyptian technology|Egyptian]] and [[Mesopotamian science|Mesopotamian technology]],&lt;ref name="FRAALC97" /&gt; numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as [[Pseudo-Democritus]]'s first-century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|ad}} ''On Physical and Mystical Matters'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Physika kai Mystika}}).&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Martelli, ''The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus'' (Maney, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Although alchemy is popularly associated with magic, historian [[Lawrence M. Principe]] writes "Most readers probably are aware of several common claims about alchemy—for example, ... that it is akin to magic, or that its practice then or now is essentially deceptive. These ideas about alchemy emerged during the eighteenth century or after. While each of them might have limited validity within a narrow context, none of them is an accurate depiction of alchemy in general."&lt;ref&gt;Principe, Lawrence M. The secrets of alchemy.

{{anchor|Etymology}}

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Chemistry (etymology)}}
The word alchemy comes from [[Old French]] ''alquemie'', ''alkimie'', used in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''alchymia''. This name was itself brought from the [[Arabic]] word ''al-kīmiyā’'' ({{rtl-lang|ar|الكيمياء}} or {{rtl-lang|ar|الخيمياء}}) composed of two parts: the [[Late Greek]] term ''khēmeía'' (χημεία), ''khēmía'' (χημία), meaning 'to fuse or cast a metal',&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0017630#DWS-M_EN_GB-037342 alchemy], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the etymology for χημεία in {{Cite book| edition = Eighth edition, revised throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George|author2=Robert Scott| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1901| isbn = 978-0-19-910205-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Arabic [[definite article]] ''[[al-]]''  ({{rtl-lang|ar|الـ}}), meaning 'The'.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|alchemy}} Or see {{OEtymD|alchemy|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Together this association can be interpreted as 'the process of [[Magnum opus (alchemy)|transmutation]] by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form'. Its roots can be traced to the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name  ''kēme'' (hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 ''khmi'' ), meaning ‘black earth’ which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the Nile valley, as opposed to red desert sand.&lt;ref name=OED /&gt;

According to the Egyptologist [[Wallis Budge]], the Arabic word ''al-kīmiyaʾ'' actually means "the Egyptian [science]", borrowing from the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] word for "Egypt", ''kēme'' (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval [[Bohairic]] dialect of Coptic, ''khēme''). This Coptic word derives from [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] ''kmỉ'', itself from ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''kmt''. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour "black" (Egypt was the "Black Land", by contrast with the "Red Land", the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname "Egyptian black arts". However, according to [[Carl August Friedrich Mahn|Mahn]], this theory may be an example of [[folk etymology]].&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt; Assuming an Egyptian origin, chemistry is defined as follows:

:'''Chemistry''', from the ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word "khēmia" meaning transmutation of earth, is the [[science]] of [[matter]] at the [[atom]]ic to [[molecular]] scale, dealing primarily with  collections of atoms, such as [[molecule]]s, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s.

Thus, according to Budge and others, chemistry derives from an Egyptian word ''khemein'' or ''khēmia'', "preparation of black powder", ultimately derived from the name ''khem'', Egypt. A decree of [[Diocletian]], written about 300 AD in Greek, speaks against "the ancient writings of the Egyptians, which treat of the ''khēmia'' [[Chrysopoeia|transmutation]] of gold and silver".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary#Electronic versions|Oxford English Dictionary Online]],'' s.v. alchemy&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medieval Latin form was influenced by Greek ''chymeia'' (χυμεία) meaning ‘mixture’ and referring to [[pharmaceutical chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, both the etymology given in the Oxford English Dictionary and also that for χυμεία in {{Cite book| edition = A new edition, revised and augmented throughout| publisher = Clarendon Press| last = Liddell| first = Henry George|author2=Robert Scott|author3=Henry Stuart Jones| title = A Greek-English Lexicon| location = Oxford| year = 1940|url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=xumeia&amp;la=greek#lexicon| isbn = 978-0-19-910205-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Alchemy is several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents. These traditions' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and "genetic" relationships. One can distinguish at least three major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: [[Chinese alchemy]], centered in China and its zone of cultural influence; [[Rasayana|Indian alchemy]], centered on the [[Indian subcontinent]]; and Western alchemy, which occurred around the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and whose center has shifted over the millennia from [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]], to the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], and finally [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoism]] and Indian alchemy with the [[Indian religions|Dharmic faiths]], whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of, but influenced by, various [[Western religion]]s. It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

=== Hellenistic Egypt ===
[[File:Zosimosapparat.jpg|thumb|left|300px| Ambix, cucurbit and retort of [[Zosimos of Panopolis|Zosimos]], from [[Marcelin Berthelot]], ''Collection des anciens alchimistes grecs'' (3 vol., Paris, 1887–1888).]]

The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and [[Hellenistic Egypt]], where the city of [[Alexandria]] was a center of alchemical knowledge, and retained its pre-eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods.&lt;ref&gt;''New Scientist'', 24–31 December 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Here, elements of technology, religion, mythology, and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], each with their own much longer histories, combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the West. [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] wrote the oldest known books on alchemy,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} while [[Mary the Jewess]] is credited as being the first non-fictitious Western alchemist. They wrote in [[Greek language|Greek]] and lived in [[Egypt]] under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule.

'''Mythology''' – Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic Egypt]] where it was the domain of the priestly class, though there is little to no evidence for his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garfinkel|first=Harold|title=Ethnomethodological Studies of Work|publisher=Routledge &amp;Kegan Paul|year=1986|pages=127|isbn=978-0-415-11965-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy. 'Roman and European Mythologies'. University of Chicago Press, 1992. pp. 211–213&lt;/ref&gt;  These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets, [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Jason]], and many others.

The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is [[Hermes Trismegistus]] (or Thrice-Great Hermes). His name is derived from the [[deity|god]] [[Thoth]] and his Greek counterpart [[Hermes]]. Hermes and his [[caduceus]] or serpent-staff, were among alchemy's principal symbols. According to [[Clement of Alexandria]], he wrote what were called the "forty-two books of Hermes", covering all fields of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter IV.|Clement, ''Stromata'', vi. 4.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Hermetica]]'' of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the [[hermeticism|hermetic philosophy]] by its early practitioners. These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era.

'''Technology''' – The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of [[metallurgy]], extending back to 3500&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many writings were lost when the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Diocletian]] ordered the burning of alchemical books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partington|first=James Riddick|title=A Short History of Chemistry|year=1989|pages=20|isbn=978-0-486-65977-0|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria ({{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;292). Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the [[Stockholm papyrus]] and the [[Leyden papyrus X]]. Dating from {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;300–500, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of [[Bolus of Mendes]] (or [[Pseudo-Democritus]]), which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the [[classical elements]].&lt;ref name="Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13"&gt;''A History of Chemistry'', Bensaude-Vincent, Isabelle Stengers, ''Harvard University Press'', 1996, '''p13'''&lt;/ref&gt; Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|1996|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophy''' – Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of [[Pythagoreanism]], [[Platonism]], [[Stoicism]] and [[Gnosticism]] which formed the origin of alchemy's character.&lt;ref name="Chemistry, Bensaude-Vincent 1996, p13" /&gt; An important example of alchemy's roots in Greek philosophy, originated by [[Empedocles]] and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Water (classical element)|water]], and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]]. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lindsay, Jack | title=The Origins of Alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt | location=London | publisher=Muller | year=1970 | isbn= 978-0-389-01006-7 | page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are; "...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=66 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.

Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging [[Christianity]]. [[Lactantius]] believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth. [[Augustine of Hippo|St&amp;nbsp;Augustine]] later affirmed this in the 4th &amp; 5th centuries, but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry.&lt;ref&gt;Fanning, Philip Ashley. ''Isaac Newton and the Transmutation of Alchemy: An Alternative View of the Scientific Revolution.'' 2009. p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Pagan, Christian, and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period.

Most of the Greco-Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms, such as [[Moses of Alexandria|Moses]], Isis, [[Cleopatra the Alchemist|Cleopatra]], [[Pseudo-Democritus|Democritus]], and [[Ostanes]]. Others authors such as Komarios, and [[Chymes]], we only know through fragments of text. After {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;400, Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;F. Sherwood Taylor. ''Alchemists, Founders of Modern Chemistry.'' p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and early modern chemistry: papers from Ambix.'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; It was at that time that [[Khalid Ibn Yazid]] sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world, facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar. ''Late antiquity: a guide to the postclassical world.'' p. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
{{Main|Rasayana}}
{{See also|History of metallurgy in the Indian subcontinent}}
The [[Vedas]] describe a connection between eternal life and gold.&lt;ref name=eb /&gt; The use of [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] for alchemy is first documented in the 3rd- or 4th-century ''[[Arthashastra]]''. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold. Greek alchemy may have been introduced to Ancient India through the invasions of [[Alexander the Great]] in 325&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the Greeks like [[Gandhāra]], although hard evidence for this is lacking.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;Multhauf, Robert P. &amp; Gilbert, Robert Andrew (2008). ''Alchemy''. Encyclopædia Britannica (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th-century [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Persian chemist]] and [[Medicine in medieval Islam|physician]] [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]], who visited Gujarat as part of the court of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], reported that they
{{bquote|have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which in [[Sanskrit]] is called [[Rasayāna]] and in Persian [[Rasavātam]]. It means the art of obtaining/manipulating ''Rasa'': nectar, mercury, and juice. This art was restricted to certain operations, metals, drugs, compounds, and medicines, many of which have mercury as their core element. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.}}
The goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body (Sanskrit ''divya-deham'') and immortality while still embodied (Sanskrit ''jīvan-mukti'').  Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur, that are homologized with the semen of the god Śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Devī.

Some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of [[Matsyendranath]].  Other early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise ''Kalyāṇakārakam'' of Ugrāditya, written in South India in the early 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meulenbeld|first1=G. Jan|title=History of Indian Medical Literature|date=1999–2002|publisher=Egbert Forsten|location=Groningen|pages=IIA, 151–155|ref=HIML}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were [[Nagarjuna (metallurgist)|Nāgārjuna Siddha]] and Nityanātha Siddha. Nāgārjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk. His book, ''Rasendramangalam'', is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine. Nityanātha Siddha wrote ''Rasaratnākara'', also a highly influential work. In Sanskrit, ''rasa'' translates to "mercury", and Nāgārjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold.&lt;ref&gt;See Dominik Wujastyk, "An Alchemical Ghost: The Rasaratnākara of Nāgarjuna" in ''Ambix'' 31.2 (1984): 70-83.

[[File:Jabir ibn Hayyan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Jabir ibn Hayyan]] (Geber), considered the "father of [[chemistry]]", introduced a [[Scientific method|scientific]] and [[experiment]]al approach to alchemy.]]

After [[The fall of the roman empire|the fall of the Roman Empire]], the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World. Much more is known about [[Islam]]ic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=46 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''alchemy'' itself was derived from the Arabic word ''al-kīmiyā’'' (الكيمياء). The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. [[Plato]]nic and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations and scholarship.

In the late 8th century, [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Latinized as "Geber" or "Geberus") introduced a new approach to alchemy, based on [[scientific method]]ology and controlled [[experiment]]ation in the [[laboratory]], in contrast to the ancient Greek and Egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible, with very little concern for laboratory work.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt; Jabir is thus "considered by many to be the father of [[chemistry]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Zygmunt S.|last=Derewenda|year=2007|title=On wine, chirality and crystallography|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A|volume=64|issue=Pt 1|pages=246–258 [247]|doi=10.1107/S0108767307054293|pmid=18156689|bibcode = 2008AcCrA..64..246D |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit others reserve that title for [[Robert Boyle]] or [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. The science historian, Paul Kraus, wrote:

{{quote|To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir's alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources, it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the [[Greek language]]. One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us. Collected by [[Byzantine science|Byzantine scientists]] from the tenth century, the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments, going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages.

The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results, and the later researchers, among them in particular Mrs. Hammer-Jensen, Tannery, Lagercrantz, von Lippmann, Reitzenstein, Ruska, Bidez, Festugiere and others, could make clear only few points of detail ....

The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging. An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory: even the supposedly technical writings, in the state where we find them today, are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation.

It is different with Jabir's alchemy. The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati, the methodical classification of the substances, mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts. The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity. More than with the other Arab authors, one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching, between the ''[[Ilm (Arabic)|`ilm]]'' and the ''`amal''. In vain one would seek in the Greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented, for example, in the ''Book of Seventy''.&lt;ref name=Kraus&gt;Kraus, Paul, Jâbir ibn Hayyân, ''Contribution à l'histoire des idées scientifiques dans l'Islam. I. Le corpus des écrits jâbiriens. II. Jâbir et la science grecque,''. Cairo (1942–1943). Repr. By Fuat Sezgin, (Natural Sciences in Islam. 67–68), Frankfurt. 2002:
(cf. {{cite web|author=[[Ahmad Y Hassan]]|title=A Critical Reassessment of the Geber Problem: Part Three|url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/geber/geber%2003.html|accessdate=16 September 2014}})&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation:

{{bquote|The first essential in chemistry is that thou shouldest perform practical work and conduct experiments,&lt;br /&gt; for he who performs not practical work nor makes experiments will never attain to the least degree of mastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1931|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Early Islamic chemists such as [[Jābir ibn Hayyān|Jabir Ibn Hayyan]], [[Al-Kindi]] ("Alkindus") and [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi]] ("Rasis" or "Rhazes") contributed a number of key chemical discoveries, such as the muriatic ([[hydrochloric acid]]), [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]]s, and more. The discovery that [[aqua regia]], a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids, could dissolve the noblest metal, gold, was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.

Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism. The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir. Jabir's ultimate goal was ''[[Takwin]]'', the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to, and including, human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of ''hotness'', ''coldness'', ''dryness'', and ''moistness''.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29 /&gt; According to Jabir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.&lt;ref name=burckhardt29&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=29 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate [[numerology]] whereby the root letters of a substance's name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element's physical properties.

The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir. His original system consisted of seven elements, which included the five [[classical element]]s ([[aether (classical element)|aether]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], and [[Water (classical element)|water]]) in addition to two [[chemical element]]s representing the metals: [[Sulfur|sulphur]], "the stone which burns", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties. Shortly thereafter, this evolved into eight elements, with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles: sulphur giving flammability or combustion, mercury giving volatility and stability, and [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] giving solidity.&lt;ref name="r8"&gt;Strathern, Paul. (2000), ''Mendeleyev's Dream – the Quest for the Elements'', New York: [[Berkley Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[atomic theory]] of [[corpuscularianism]], where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles, also has its origins in the work of Jabir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distilling knowledge: alchemy, chemistry, and the scientific revolution|first=Bruce T.|last=Moran|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-674-01495-4|page=146|quote=a corpuscularian tradition in alchemy stemming from the speculations of the medieval author Geber (Jabir ibn Hayyan)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 9th to 14th centuries, alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists, including [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]],&lt;ref&gt;Felix Klein-Frank (2001), "Al-Kindi", in [[Oliver Leaman]] &amp; [[Hossein Nasr]], ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 174.

[[File:Esoteric Taijitu.svg|thumb| upright=0.5|Taoist alchemists often use this alternate version of the [[taijitu]].]]
Whereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine. The [[philosopher's stone]] of European alchemists can be compared to the [[Elixir of life|Grand Elixir of Immortality]] sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher's stone was often equated with the [[Panacea (medicine)|universal panacea]]; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears.

[[Black powder]] may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists. As previously stated above, [[China|Chinese]] alchemy was more related to medicine. It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a [[potion]] for eternal life. Described in 9th-century texts{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} and used in [[fireworks]] in China by the 10th century,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} it was used in [[cannon]]s by 1290.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} From China, the use of [[gunpowder]] spread to Japan, the [[Mongol]]s, the Muslim world, and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe by the 14th century.

Chinese alchemy was closely connected to [[Taoist]] forms of [[traditional Chinese medicine]], such as [[Acupuncture]] and [[Moxibustion]], and to martial arts such as [[T'ai chi ch'uan|Tai Chi Chuan]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} and [[Kung Fu]] (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of Taoism, not Alchemical). In fact, in the early [[Song dynasty]], followers of this Taoist idea (chiefly the elite and upper class) would ingest [[cinnabar|mercuric sulfide]], which, though tolerable in low levels, led many to suicide.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens, the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} (the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} mastering of the [[qi]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} etc.)

[[File:WMS 446, R. Lullius, Ymage de Vie, late 15th Wellcome L0031726.jpg|thumb|"An illuminated page from a book on alchemical processes and receipts", ca. 15th century.]]

The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to 11 February 1144, with the completion of [[Robert of Chester]]'s translation of the Arabic ''Book of the Composition of Alchemy''. Although European craftsmen and technicians preexisted, Robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing. The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th-century [[Toledo, Spain]], through contributors like [[Gerard of Cremona]] and [[Adelard of Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of the time included the [[Turba Philosophorum]], and the works of [[Avicenna]] and [[al-Razi]]. These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent. Alcohol, carboy, elixir, and athanor are examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism, thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought. The 11th-century [[Anselm of Canterbury|St&amp;nbsp;Anselm]] put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context. In the early 12th century, [[Peter Abelard]] followed Anselm's work, laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West. In the early 13th century, [[Robert Grosseteste]] used Abelard's methods of analysis and added the use of observation, experimentation, and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations. Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.&lt;ref name=hollister294f&gt;{{cite book | author=Hollister, C. Warren | title=Medieval Europe: A Short History | location=Blacklick, Ohio | publisher=McGraw–Hill College | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-07-557141-4 | edition=6th |pages=294f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through much of the 12th and 13th centuries, alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered on translations, and new Latin contributions were not made. The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists. In the 13th century, [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Roger Bacon]] were the most notable of these, their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms.&lt;ref&gt;John Read. ''From Alchemy to Chemistry.'' 1995 p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Albertus Magnus, a [[Dominican Order|Dominican monk]], is known to have written works such as the ''Book of Minerals'' where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes and Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time. Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna, where they concerned the transmutation of metals. From the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century, more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him, a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Weisheipl. ''Albertus Magnus and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays.'' PIMS. 1980. p.187-202&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert's student [[Thomas Aquinas]].

Roger Bacon, a [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan monk]] who wrote on a wide variety of topics including [[optics]], [[comparative linguistics]], and medicine, composed his ''[[Opus Majus|Great Work]]'' ({{lang-la|Opus Majus}}) for {{nowrap|[[Pope Clement IV]]}} as part of a project towards rebuilding the [[medieval university]] curriculum to include the new learning of his time. While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic, he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy's connections to [[soteriology]] and Christian theology. Bacon's writings integrated morality, salvation, alchemy, and the prolongation of life. His correspondence with Clement highlighted this, noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Brehm. "Roger Bacon's Place in the History of Alchemy." ''Ambix.'' Vol. 23, Part I, March 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Greeks before him, Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres. He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle, the natural philosophers, and all Latin writers of his time. The practical, however, confirmed the theoretical thought experiment, and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later European legend, however, Bacon became an archmage. In particular, along with Albertus Magnus, he was credited with the forging of a [[brazen head]] capable of answering its owner's questions.

Soon after Bacon, the influential work of [[Pseudo-Geber]] (sometimes identified as [[Paul of Taranto]]) appeared. His ''Summa Perfectionis'' remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods. It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur-mercury theory, and the unusual clarity with which they were described.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|pp=134–141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 13th century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (for example, if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the [[soul|human soul]]). They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded [[jargon]] set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made [[observation]]s and [[theory|theories]] about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man's soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam. By purifying the two parts of man's soul, man could be reunited with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | page=149 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th century, alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars. Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' University of Chicago Press, 2007. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante]], [[Piers Plowman]], and [[Chaucer]] all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars. [[Pope John XXII]]'s 1317 edict, ''[[Spondent quas non exhibent]]'' forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo-alchemists.&lt;ref&gt;John Hines, II, R. F. Yeager. ''John Gower, Trilingual Poet: Language, Translation, and Tradition.'' Boydell &amp; Brewer. 2010. p.170&lt;/ref&gt; In 1403, Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals (although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically, and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV&lt;ref&gt;D. Geoghegan, "A licence of Henry VI to practise Alchemy" Ambix, volume 6, 1957, pages 10-17&lt;/ref&gt;). These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo-alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy, which continued with an increasingly Christian tone. The 14th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of [[Petrus Bonus]], [[John of Rupescissa]], and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leah DeVun]]. ''From Prophecy, Alchemy, and the End of Time: John of Rupescissa in the late Middle Ages.'' Columbia University Press, 2009. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolas Flamel]] is a well-known alchemist, but a good example of [[pseudepigraphy]], the practice of giving your works the name of someone else, usually more famous. Although the historical Flamel existed, the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nicolas Flamel. Des Livres et de l'or" by Nigel Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; Flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the [[philosopher's stone]]. His work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of 'his' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Titus | last=Burckhardt | authorlink=Titus Burckhardt | title=Alchemy: Science of the Cosmos, Science of the Soul | location=Baltimore | publisher=Penguin | year=1967 | pages=170–181 | others=Trans. William Stoddart | isbn=978-0-906540-96-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[late Middle Ages|14th and 15th centuries]], alchemists were much like Flamel: they concentrated on looking for the philosophers' stone. [[Bernard Trevisan]] and [[George Ripley (alchemist)|George Ripley]] made similar contributions. Their cryptic allusions and [[symbol]]ism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art.

During the [[Renaissance]], Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy. The dawn of medical, pharmaceutical, occult, and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed.

In the late 15th century, [[Marsilo Ficino]] translated the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] and the works of Plato into Latin. These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent. [[Renaissance Humanism]] and [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel.

Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism, fusing it with magic, astrology, and Christian cabala.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Forshaw. '"Chemistry, That Starry Science" - Early Modern Conjunctions of Astrology and Alchemy' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Forshaw, 'Cabala Chymica or Chemia Cabalistica – Early Modern Alchemists and Cabala' (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; A key figure in this development was German [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] (1486–1535), who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists. In his ''De Occulta Philosophia'', he attempted to merge [[Kabbalah]], Hermeticism, and alchemy. He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee. ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition.'' Cornell University Press. 2008. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke. ''The Western Esoteric Traditions: A Historical Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2008 p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippus Aureolus [[Paracelsus]], (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493–1541) cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of Agrippa's occultism and moving away from [[chrysopoeia]]. Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote, "Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Edwardes, Michael | title=The Dark Side of History | location=New York | publisher=Stein and Day | year=1977 | page=47 | isbn=978-0-552-11463-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Debus, Allen G.]] |author2=Multhauf, Robert P. | title=Alchemy and Chemistry in the Seventeenth Century | location=Los Angeles | publisher=William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, University of California. | year=1966 | pages=6–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paracelsian practical alchemy, especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named [[spagyric]] (a synonym for alchemy from the Greek words meaning ''to separate'' and ''to join together'', based on the Latin alchemic maxim: ''solve et coagula'').&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham. ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 5, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Physiological Alchemy.'' Cambridge University Press. P.9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iatrochemistry]] also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus.

[[John Dee]] (13 July 1527 – December, 1608) followed Agrippa's occult tradition. Although better known for angel summoning, divination, and his role as [[astrologer]], cryptographer, and consultant to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], Dee's alchemical&lt;ref&gt;“''Monas hieroglyphica'' is not a traditional alchemical work, but has important theoretical insights about a cosmic vision, in which alchemy played an important part.”{{cite web | last = Szőnyi| first = György E.| year = 2015 | url = http://www.renesancni-texty.upol.cz/soubory/publikace/Latin_Alchemical_Literature_of_Czech_Provenance.pdf | title = 'Layers of Meaning in Alchemy in John Dee's Monas hieroglyphica and its Relevance in a Central European Context'| publisher =  Centre for Renaissance Texts, 2015, 118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monas Hieroglyphica'', written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work.

''Secrets of Nature: Astrology and Alchemy in Early Modern Europe''. MIT Press, 2001. P.173.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, a short-lived "supernatural" interpretation of alchemy became popular, including support by fellows of the [[Royal Society]]: [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Elias Ashmole]]. Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the [[philosopher's stone]] might be used to summon and communicate with angels.&lt;ref&gt;* ''Journal of the History of Ideas, 41'', 1980, '''p. 293-318'''

Entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe. Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining, medical services, and the production of chemicals, medicines, metals, and gemstones.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the late 16th century, famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague, including Dee and his associate [[Edward Kelley]]. [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV of Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. iii, (1901), 99, 202, 206, 209, 330, 340, 341, 353, 355, 365, 379, 382, 389, 409.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], [[Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], [[Augustus, Elector of Saxony]], [[Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn]], and [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] all contracted alchemists.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.85-98&lt;/ref&gt; John's son [[Arthur Dee]] worked as a court physician to [[Michael I of Russia]] and [[Charles I of England]] but also compiled the alchemical book ''[[Fasciculus Chemicus]]''.

Although most of these appointments were legitimate, the trend of pseudo-alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance. ''Betrüger'' would use sleight of hand, or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage. Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as [[Michael Maier]] and [[Heinrich Khunrath]] wrote about fraudulent transmutations, distinguishing themselves from the [[con artist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tara E. Nummedal. ''Alchemy and authority in the Holy Roman Empire.'' p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud.

The terms "chemia" and "alchemia" were used as synonyms in the early modern period, and the differences between alchemy, chemistry and small-scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day. There were important overlaps between practitioners, and trying to classify them into alchemists, chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic. For example, [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601), an alchemist better known for his [[astronomical]] and [[astrological]] investigations, had a laboratory built at his [[Uraniborg]] observatory/research institute. [[Michał Sędziwój|Michael Sendivogius]] (''Michał Sędziwój'', 1566–1636), a [[Poland|Polish]] alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling [[oxygen]] in a lab sometime around 1600. Sendivogious taught his technique to [[Cornelius Drebbel]] who, in 1621, applied this in a submarine. [[Isaac Newton]] devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy (see [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]]) than he did to either optics or physics. Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include [[Robert Boyle]], and [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]]. Their Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science.

=== Late modern period ===
[[File:The Shannon Portrait of the Hon Robert Boyle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert Boyle]]]]
[[File:Alchemist.png|thumb|right|An alchemist, pictured in Charles Mackay's ''[[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds]]''.]]
The decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for "ancient wisdom". Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century. As late as 1781 [[James Price (chemist)|James Price]] claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold. Early modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories, practices, and purposes: "Scholastic and anti-Aristotelian, Paracelsian and anti-Paracelsian, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, mechanistic, vitalistic, and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof."&lt;ref name="Alchemy Restored"&gt;Principe, Lawrence M. "Alchemy Restored." Isis 102.2 (2011): 305-12. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data. Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Pilkington, Roger | title=Robert Boyle: Father of Chemistry | location=London | publisher=John Murray | year=1959 | page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[John Dalton]].

Beginning around 1720, a rigid distinction was drawn between "alchemy" and "chemistry" for the first time.&lt;ref name="NewmanPrincipe2002p37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Newman|Principe|2002|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp386"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1740s, "alchemy" was now restricted to the realm of gold making, leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans, and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud.&lt;ref name="Alchemy Restored" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp386" /&gt; In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected, academic writers during the scientific Enlightenment attempted, for the sake of survival, to divorce and separate the "new" chemistry from the "old" practices of alchemy. This move was mostly successful, and the consequences of this continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, and even to the present day.&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanpp386–7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|pp=386–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the occult revival of the early 19th century, alchemy received new attention as an occult science.&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp387"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KripalShuck2005p27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kripal|Shuck|2005|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The esoteric or occultist school, which arose during the 19th century, held (and continues to hold) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience.&lt;ref name="NewmanPrincipe2002p37" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eliade|1994|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp388"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination, as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals, and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual, moral or mystical processes.&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp388" /&gt;

In the 19th-century revival of alchemy, the two most seminal figures were [[Mary Anne Atwood]] and [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]], who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: "No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy."&lt;ref name="PrincipeNewmanp391"&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rutkin2001p143"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rutkin|2001|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including [[Eliphas Levi]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]]. Hitchcock, in his ''Remarks Upon Alchymists'' (1855) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron [[Carl Reichenbach]], published his studies on [[Odic force]], a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Merkur. ''Gnosis: An Esoteric Tradition of Mystical Visions and Unions.'' SUNY Press. 1993 p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women in alchemy ===

Several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy. [[Michael Maier]] names [[Mary the Jewess]], [[Cleopatra the Alchemist]], [[Medera]], and [[Taphnutia]] as the four women who knew how to make the philosopher's stone.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.'' p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Zosimos' sister Theosebia (later known as Euthica the Arab) and [[Isis the Prophetess]] also played a role in early alchemical texts.

The first alchemist whose name we know is said to have been [[Mary the Jewess]] (c. 200 A.D.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in Chemistry: Their Changing Roles from Alchemical Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century|author1=Rayner-Canham, M  |author2=Rayner-Canham, G|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|year=2005|isbn=9780941901277|location=|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early sources claim that Mary (or Maria) devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes. The laboratory water-bath, known eponymously (especially in France) as the [[bain-marie]], is said to have been invented or at least improved by her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book|last=Patai|first=R|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=9780691006420|location=|pages=60–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially a double-boiler, it was (and is) used in chemistry for processes that require gentle heating. The tribikos (a modified distillation apparatus) and the kerotakis (a more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The origins of alchemy in Graeco-Roman Egypt|last=Lindsay|first=J|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|year=1970|isbn=9780389010067|location=New York|pages=240–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occasional claim that Mary was the first to discover hydrochloric acid is not accepted by most authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1094-alchemy#anchor2|title=Alchemy|last=Gaster|first=Moses|date=2011|website=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company|access-date=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although we have no writing from Mary herself, she is known from the early-fourth-century writings of [[Zosimos of Panopolis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book|last=Patai|first=R|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780691006420|location=|pages=81–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the proliferation of [[pseudepigrapha]] and anonymous works, it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women. After the Greco-Roman period, women's names appear less frequently in the alchemical literature. Women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods, aside from the fictitious account of [[Perenelle Flamel]]. [[Mary Anne Atwood]]'s ''A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery'' (1850) marks their return during the nineteenth-century occult revival.

=== Modern historical research ===
The history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study.&lt;ref name="Antoine Faivre 1995. p.viii–xv"&gt;Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.viii–xvi&lt;/ref&gt;   As the language of the alchemists is analyzed, historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the evolution of science and [[philosophy]], the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities, [[Kabbalah|kabbalism]], [[spiritualism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and other mystic movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://centres.exeter.ac.uk/exeseso/ See Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism website]&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at [[Indiana University]], the [[University of Exeter]] Centre for the Study of Esotericism (EXESESO), the [[European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism]] (ESSWE), and the [[University of Amsterdam]]'s Sub-department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents. A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the [[Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica]] in Amsterdam. A recipe found in a mid-19th-century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold. The author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jewishnews.com/2015/09/27/old-jewish-book-outlines-how-to-turn-copper-into-gold|title=Old Jewish Book Outlines how to Turn Copper into Gold|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include '[[Ambix]]', published by the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry, and '[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]', published by The History of Science Society.

== Core concepts ==
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0006104 Theosophie ^ Alchemie ^ Judentum ^ Kabbala.jpg|thumb|Mandala illustrating common alchemical concepts, symbols, and processes. From ''Spiegel der Kunst und Natur''.]]
Western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born. Concepts were imported from [[Neoplatonism]] and earlier Greek [[cosmology]]. As such, the [[Classical elements]] appear in alchemical writings, as do the seven [[Classical planets]] and the corresponding seven [[metals of antiquity]]. Similarly, the gods of the Roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature. The concepts of [[prima materia]] and [[anima mundi]] are central to the theory of the [[philosopher's stone]].

=== Hermeticism ===
{{Hermeticism}}
In the eyes of a variety of esoteric and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] practitioners, alchemy is fundamentally spiritual. Transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation, purification, and perfection.&lt;ref name="Antoine Faivre 1995. p.96"&gt;Antoine Faivre, Wouter J. Hanegraaff. ''Western esotericism and the science of religion.'' 1995. p.96&lt;/ref&gt; The writings attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]] are a primary source of alchemical theory. He is named "alchemy's founder and chief patron, authority, inspiration and guide".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Linden|2003|pp=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early alchemists, such as [[Zosimos of Panopolis]] (c. AD 300), highlight the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest, symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul.&lt;ref&gt;Allen G. Debus. ''Alchemy and early modern chemistry.'' The Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry. p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach continued in the Middle Ages, as metaphysical aspects, substances, physical states, and material processes were used as metaphors for [[spirit]]ual entities, spiritual states, and, ultimately, transformation. In this sense, the literal meanings of 'Alchemical Formulas' were a blind, hiding their true [[spiritual philosophy]]. Practitioners and patrons such as [[Melchior Cibinensis]] and [[Pope Innocent VIII]] existed within the ranks of the church, while [[Martin Luther]] applauded alchemy for its consistency with Christian teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Patai. ''The Jewish Alchemists: A History and Source Book.'' Princeton University Press. p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea symbolized evolution from an imperfect, diseased, corruptible, and ephemeral state toward a perfect, healthy, incorruptible, and everlasting state, so the philosopher's stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible. Applied to the alchemist himself, the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment, and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal. In texts that are written according to this view, the cryptic [[alchemical symbol]]s, diagrams, and textual imagery of late alchemical works typically contain multiple layers of meanings, allegories, and references to other equally cryptic works; and must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning.

In his 1766 ''Alchemical Catechism'', Théodore Henri de Tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver?
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the Philosophers are full of life.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Henri de Tschudi. Hermetic Catechism in his ''L'Etoile Flamboyant ou la Société des Franc-Maçons considerée sous tous les aspects.'' 1766.  (A.E. Waite translation as found in ''The Hermetic and Alchemical Writings of Paracelsus.'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

=== Magnum opus ===
{{Main|Magnum opus (alchemy)}}
The Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors.

*''[[nigredo]]'', a blackening or melanosis
*''[[Albedo (alchemy)|albedo]]'', a whitening or leucosis
*''[[citrinitas]]'', a yellowing or xanthosis
*''[[rubedo]]'', a reddening, purpling, or iosis&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham. ''Science &amp; Civilisation in China: Chemistry and chemical technology. Spagyrical discovery and invention: magisteries of gold and immortality.'' Cambridge. 1974. p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern alchemy ==
Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature, and the 18th-century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry; the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those focusing on the exoteric, such as historians of science [[Lawrence M. Principe]] and [[William R. Newman]], have interpreted the 'decknamen' (or code words) of alchemy as physical substances. These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Conniff. "Alchemy May Not Have Been the Pseudoscience We All Thought It Was." [http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/alchemy-may-not-been-pseudoscience-we-thought-it-was-180949430/#ixzz2sYcrpZl7 Smithsonian Magazine.] February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite end of the spectrum, focusing on the esoteric, scholars, such as George Calian&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last= Calian |first= George |title= Alkimia Operativa and Alkimia Speculativa. Some Modern Controversies on the Historiography of Alchemy |publisher= Annual of Medieval Studies at CEU |year= 2010 |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |bibcode= |asin= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |ol= |osti= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |url= https://archive.org/stream/AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnThe/FlorinGeorgeCalian-AlkimiaOperativaAndAlkimiaSpeculativa.SomeModernControversiesOnTheHistoriographyOfAlchemy#page/n0/mode/2up |accessdate= |ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Anna Marie Roos,&lt;ref&gt;Anna Marie Roos (2013), Review of ''The Secrets of Alchemy'',  [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613001143 ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Science'' '''44''']&lt;/ref&gt; who question the reading of Principe and Newman, interpret these same decknamen as spiritual, religious, or psychological concepts.

Today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated, sometimes merging in concepts from [[New Age]] or radical environmentalism movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Principe|Newman|2001|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups like the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] and [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism. Since the Victorian revival of alchemy, "occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice, involving the self-transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances",&lt;ref name="Alchemy Restored" /&gt; which has contributed to a merger of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and alchemy in popular thought.

=== Traditional medicine ===
{{Main|Ayurveda|Traditional Chinese medicine}}
Traditional medicine can use the concept of the transmutation of natural substances, using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques. In [[Ayurveda]], the [[Samskara (Ayurvedic)|samskaras]] are claimed to transform [[heavy metals]] and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity. These processes are actively used to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Junius, Manfred M; ''The Practical Handbook of Plant Alchemy: An Herbalist's Guide to Preparing Medicinal Essences, Tinctures, and Elixirs''; Healing Arts Press 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Spagyrists of the 20th century, [[Frater Albertus|Albert Richard Riedel]] and Jean Dubuis, merged Paracelsian alchemy with occultism, teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods. The schools they founded, ''Les Philosophes de la Nature'' and ''The Paracelsus Research Society'', popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products.&lt;ref&gt;Joscelyn Godwin.  ''The Golden Thread: The Ageless Wisdom of the Western Mystery Traditions.'' Quest Books, 2007. p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The courses, books, organizations, and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a New Age medicinal practice.

=== Psychology ===
Alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung|Carl Gustav Jung]]. Initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images, after being given a copy of the translation of ''The Secret of the Golden Flower'', a Chinese alchemical text, by his friend Richard Wilhelm, Jung discovered a direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner, symbolic images coming up in dreams, visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients. A process, which he called "process of individuation". He regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this "process of [[individuation]]" of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal.&lt;ref name="Jung, C. G. 1944"&gt;Jung, C. G. (1944). Psychology and Alchemy (2nd ed. 1968 Collected Works Vol. 12 {{ISBN|0-691-01831-6}}). London: Routledge. E.g. §41, §116, §427, §431, §448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33"/&gt; Together with his alchemical ''mystica soror'', Jungian Swiss analyst [[Marie-Louise von Franz]], Jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available, compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross-references&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens: ''On Jung.'' (A new and authoritiative introduction to Jung's life and thought), Penguin Books, London 1990, {{ISBN|0140124942}}, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; and pored over them. The volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy's popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer, spirit and matter are reunited in the ''[[hieros gamos]]''  or divine marriage. His writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams, symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces ([[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]])&lt;ref name="Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33"&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath, Terence Dawson. ''The Cambridge companion to Jung.'' Cambridge University Press. 1997. p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Jung Preface to [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]]'s translation of the [[I Ching]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.-G. Jung Preface to the translation of [[Secret of the Golden Flower|The Secret of The Golden Flower]].&lt;/ref&gt; that influence all of life.

Both von Franz and Jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture. Jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is Volume 14 of his Collected Works, ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis|Mysterium Conuinctionis]].''

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Alchemy in art and entertainment}}
Alchemy has had a long-standing relationship with art, seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment. ''Literary alchemy'' appears throughout the history of English literature from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] to [[J. K. Rowling]], and also the popular Japanese manga [[Full Metal Alchemist]]. Here, characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus. In the 14th century, Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of Terry Pratchett.

Visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy. While some of them used alchemy as a source of satire, others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work. Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers. In the last hundred years, alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction, film, television, novels, comics and video games.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4293">The [[Architects Act 1997|Architects Act]] was amended in 2008 by a [[statutory instrument]] made by a minister of the United Kingdom government under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;An unofficial copy of the amended text of the Act may be found on [http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/Architects_Act_1997_:_amendment_of_June_2008_under_the_European_Communities_Act_1972 RIBApedia]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119141914/http://wiki-riba01.seoss.co.uk/wiki/Architects_Act_1997_%3A_amendment_of_June_2008_under_the_European_Communities_Act_1972 |date=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the '''Architects (Recognition of European Qualifications etc and Saving and Transitional Provision) Regulations 2008''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100808053418/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081331_en.pdf S.I. 2008 No. 1331]&lt;/ref&gt; which came into force on 20 June 2008.  An Explanatory Memorandum was issued with the Regulations and a fuller Explanatory Memorandum presented to Parliament.

The Architects Act 1997 had resulted from the policy of allowing certain restrictions to apply (for well over 60 years, in the United Kingdom) to the use of the simple word "[[architect]]" in connection with a statutory [[Register of Architects]] operated under Westminster primary legislation by which the executant body was renamed as the [[Architects Registration Board]] from 1997 (previously the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]]).  The amendment (under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]]) has introduced pages of complicated text to a piece of legislation which was otherwise tolerably trim, neat and comprehensible in its consolidated form in the 1997 Act.  But the amendment has been made pursuant to a European Directive made in 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:255:0022:01:EN:HTML Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council]&lt;/ref&gt; and the treaty obligations binding upon the United Kingdom and other states of the European Union, and in that respect an amendment under the European Directive was inevitable.

==Non-departmental public body==

The [[Architects Registration Board]] has been assigned the function of the "[[competent authority]]" which has to be designated by every [[European Union]] state. It has been classed as a "[[non-departmental public body]]" in the language being used by government departments.  The majority of the Board is appointed by one such government department under the provisions of the Architects Act 1997.

==Impact==

In connection with architects registration in the United Kingdom it is likely that as a result of the amendment of 2008 there will be a commensurate need to expand the human and other resources employed for giving effect to the additional activity prescribed for the Architects Registration Board to perform; and that the impact upon the annual fee which the Act enables the Board to demand is unlikely to be favourable to architects in the United Kingdom who, by application or retention, choose to become registrants on what, by the amendment, has become "Part 1" of the Register. The general effect on teaching and practice, or on the inter-disciplinary process in the service of the built environment, is uncertain.  Independent observers may consider (as had the author of the Warne Report, concerning the reform of architects registration which preceded the amending legislation of 1996) that the public is best served by means of statutory regulations of universal application (such as [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]]) on the one hand and arrangements free from the taint of [[monopoly]] on the other (for which see the article on the [[Warne Report]] and the legislative changes concerning trade descriptions and consumer protection, introduced in May 2008, that are referred to in the article on [[Architects Registration in the United Kingdom]]).

'''Aristarchus of Samothrace''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀρίσταρχος ὁ Σαμόθραξ}}; c. 220 &amp;ndash; c. 143 BC) was a [[Philologist|grammarian]] noted as the most influential of all scholars of [[Homer]]ic poetry. He was the [[librarian]] of the [[Library of Alexandria|library]] [[Alexandria|of Alexandria]] and seems to have succeeded his teacher [[Aristophanes of Byzantium|Aristophanes]] [[Byzantium|of Byzantium]] in that role.

He left Samothrace island at a young age and went to [[Alexandria]]  where he studied with the director of the [[Library of Alexandria|library]]. Later at first he was a teacher at the Royal courtyard and then director of the library from 153 to 145 BC. After he was persecuted by his disciple Ptolemy the Benefactor, he found refuge in [[Cyprus]] where he died. 

It said that Aristarchus had a remarkable memory and was completely indifferent as to his external appearance.

He established the most historically important critical edition of the Homeric poems, and he is said to have applied his teacher's accent system to it, pointing the texts with a careful eye for metrical correctness. His rejection of doubtful lines&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ad Fam. iii.11.5, ix.10.1; in Pis. 30.73&lt;/ref&gt; made his severity proverbial.&lt;ref&gt;Hor. A. P. 450&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that he, or more probably, another predecessor at Alexandria, [[Zenodotus]], was responsible for the division of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' into twenty-four books each. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', Aristarchus wrote 800 treatises ({{lang|grc|ὑπομνήματα}}) on various topics; these are all lost but for fragments preserved in the various ''[[scholia]].'' His works cover such writers as Alcaeus, Anacreon, Pindar, Hesiod, and the tragedians.

Accounts of his death vary, though they agree that it was during the persecutions of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt|of Egypt]]. One account has him, having contracted an incurable [[Edema|dropsy]], starving himself to death while in exile on [[Cyprus]].

He modified the system of the ancient Greek textual signs (''semeia'') and from some point on these signs were called [[Aristarchian symbols]]. The historical connection of his name to [[literary criticism]] has created the term '''''aristarch''''' for someone who is a judgmental critic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11663">{{Refimprove|date=August 2008}}
'''"Blackleg Miner"''' is a 19th-century [[England|English]] [[folk song]], originally from [[Northumberland]] (as can be deduced from the dialect in the song and the references in it to the [[village]]s of [[Seghill]] and [[Seaton Delaval]]). Its [[Roud number]] is 3193.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vwml.org/roudnumber/3193&lt;/ref&gt;  The song is one of the most controversial English folk songs owing to its depiction of violence against [[strikebreaker]]s.

==Origins==
The song is believed to originate from the miners' [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] of 1844.  Although this was a national lock-out, the language of the song suggests that it refers to the dispute in the north-east coalfield, which lasted roughly 20 weeks.  The lockout largely collapsed as a result of "blackleg" labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=19 July 2015 |quote=The song, Blackleg Miner, is thought to originate from the 1844 Miners' Lockout in the North East Coalfield. The Miners' Association of Great Britain and Ireland (MAGBI), founded in 1841 by Martin Jude, was in dispute over the yearly bonding systems. The union was demanding fortnightly contracts. The lockout in the North East lasted twenty weeks and collapsed largely as a result of the introduction of 'blackleg labour'.|page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village of Seghill, mentioned in the song, was the site of a mass eviction of striking miners during the 1844 lockout.  [[Thomas Burt]] wrote of the situation:
:the very magnitude of the evictions, extending over nearly the whole of the mining districts of Northumberland and Durham, made it impossible to find house accommodation for a twentieth part of the evicted.  Scores of the Seghill families camped out by the roadside between that village and the Avenue Head.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Burt, ''An Autobiography'' (1924), pages 36-37 in {{cite book|last1=Douglass|first1=David John|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|year=2005|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song depicts the determined, uncompromising stance against [[strikebreaker]]s adopted by unionized strikers.  The term ''blackleg'' for a strikebreaker has its origins in coal mining, as strikebreakers would return covered in black coal dust which would give away that they had been working whilst others had been on strike.&lt;ref name="StrikeNotTheEnd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglass|first1=David John|title=Strike, not the end of the story|publisher=National Coal Mining Museum for England|location=Overton, Yorkshire, UK|year=2005|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The coal-mining sector in the UK was always heavily unionised, and mining strikes such as in [[UK miners' strike (1926)|1926]], [[UK miners' strike (1974)|1974]] and [[UK miners' strike (1984-85)|1984-5]] have had big impacts on British society.  The strikes caused [[Resentment|bitterness]] both within and between pit [[communities]], but also gave rise to expressions of solidarity such as sympathy strikes, material assistance such as food, and a feeling of belonging to a proud and powerful community of workers.

The lyrics describe tactics common for attacking strikebreakers in the 19th century.  ''Across the way they stretch a line/ To catch the throat and break the spine/ Of the dirty blackleg miner'' describes how a rope was often stretched across the entrance to a colliery to catch strikebreakers by the throat and flick them backwards, often causing them to injure themselves through falling.  Strikebreakers were often stripped of their clothes and working tools once caught.

==Revival==
For a period in the 1960s and 1970s, the song's uncompromising [[lyrics]] were appreciated for their directness and militancy by many young people radicalized by the student rebellions of 1968, and the song was often sung at folk music societies. In particular, a 1970 recording by [[Steeleye Span]] became very popular.&lt;ref name="SteeleyeSpan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/14091/1/575419.pdf |title=THE NOTTINGHAMSHIRE MINERS', THE UNION OF DEMOCRATIC MINEWORKERS AND THE 1984-85 MINERS STRIKE: SCABS OR SCAPEGOATS? |last1=Amos |first1=David |date=December 2011 |publisher=University of Nottingham |access-date=19 July 2015 |quote=The song 'Blackleg Miner' was revamped by the folk-rock group Steeleye Span in 1970, and became part of their repertoire in live performances during the 1970s and 1980s. During the 1984-85 miners' strike the song was used by striking miners in some coalfields to intimidate those who continued to work. The song became a political statement for supporters of the strike.|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's sleeve notes read:
:It is strange that a song as powerful and as singable as this should be so rare, yet it has only once been collected, from a man in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, in 1949. Seghill and Seaton Delaval (presumably the Delaval mentioned in the song) are adjacent mining villages about six miles north of Newcastle upon Tyne, but it is difficult to date the song due to the innumerable mining strikes which have occurred. It is, however, interesting as much as it illustrates the violent hatred felt by the “union” men towards the blacklegs. Ashley Hutchings: “This is the most modern traditional song on the album, possibly dating from the early part of the 20th Century, and is sometimes sung by singers from Northumberland. I believe it was suggested by Tim.”

This was not entirely accurate: the song had been released on a number of records of miners' songs in the 1960s and also featured on Ray and [[Archie Fisher]]'s 1964 album ''The Hoot'nanny Show Volume 2''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mainlynorfolk.info/louis.killen/songs/blacklegminers.html Mainly Norfolk page on ''Blackleg Miner'']&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the song dated from the 1844 strike - much earlier than indicated by Steeleye Span.

Ewan MacColl noted a variant named ''The Blackleg Leaders'', sung when union leaders did not support unofficial strikes.&lt;ref name=LastInterview&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Allan F |last2=Vacca|first2=Giovanni |date=2014 |title=Legacies of Ewan MacColl: The Last Interview|location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd. |isbn=978-1-4094-2430-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in 1984–85 strike==
The song gained another revival during the hard-fought [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|strike of the 1980s]], and playing it became a political statement in support of the strike. The Steeleye Span recording was often played to intimidate working miners.&lt;ref name="SteeleyeSpan"/&gt; 

Violent clashes during the 1980s strike (most notably the attacks on Michael Fletcher and [[Killing of David Wilkie|David Wilkie]]) made some {{who|date=February 2018}} uncomfortable with the song's advocacy of violence against strikebreakers.{{cn|date=February 2018}} Some folk clubs avoided the song for this reason.{{cn|date=February 2018}} 

"Blackleg Miner" has been unwelcome in areas where most miners worked through the 1984-85 strike, such as Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire.{{cn|date=February 2018}} However, there has also been an increase in bands covering the song since the strike.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Scottish folk musician [[Dick Gaughan]] wrote of the change in attitude to the song after the strike of 1984-5:
:many folksong-loving conservatives who the previous year would have quite cheerfully sung that quaint old ditty, "Blackleg Miner", were suddenly forced to confront the unpalatable fact that what they had always regarded as a harmless little song about some far-off past events was in reality a venomous attack on scab labour and that it was now impossible to sing it without that being interpreted as a thunderous declaration of support for the NUM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dickgaughan.co.uk/discography/dsc-true.html Historical footnote to the album ''True and Bold: songs of the Scottish miners'', Dick Gaughan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Covers==
The song is still performed regularly in setlists by Steeleye Span.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/steeleye-span-2bd6a026.html?song=Blackleg+Miner&lt;/ref&gt;  After their initial 1970 recording on ''[[Hark! The Village Wait]]'', they recorded a second version with their 1986 album ''[[Back in Line]]'', a third version on the 2002 release ''[[Present – The Very Best of Steeleye Span]]'' and a fourth version on the 2006 release ''[[Folk Rock Pioneers in Concert]]''. The band's recordings put great stress on the line that threatens death against strikebreakers.  The village of Seghill has been modified to "Cleghill" in the second, third and fourth recordings (but not the first).

Other artists to have played this song include [[Ferocious Dog]], the Ian Campbell Folk Group, the High Level Ranters, Highland Reign, the Houghton Weavers, [[Broom Bezzums]], [[Ryan's Fancy]], the New Minstrel Revue, Blue Horses, New Celeste, FinTan, Duo Noir, Cameron Muir, [[Smoky Finish]] and [[Clatterbone]], Len Wallace, John Maggs, [[Seven Nations (band)|Seven Nations]], [[Sol Invictus (band)|Sol Invictus]], [[Louis Killen]], the [[Angelic Upstarts]] as well as [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Dick Gaughan]], [[Aengus Finnan]], Jon Boden, Maddy Prior, Andy Wainwright, John Hewitt, [[The Inchtabokatables]], [[Banjax]], [[Eric Fish]], [[The Dixie Bee-Liners]], Settlers Match and [[David Wrench (singer)|David Wrench]] with [[Black Sheep (anarcho-folk band)|Black Sheep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.headheritage.co.uk/spades-and-hoes-and-plows/ |title=David Wrench/Black Sheep — Spades &amp; Hoes &amp; Plows, |publisher=Headheritage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Offa Rex (Olivia Chaney &amp; Decemberists)

==Lyrics==
In the Northumbrian dialect, the word ''work'' rhymes with ''dark''.  However, virtually all singers fail to realise this and do not rhyme the first two lines of the song.  Ewan MacColl (1978) is one of the exceptions, as he attempted to sing the song with Northumbrian pronunciation throughout.  ''Divint gaan'' is Northumbrian dialect for ''don't go''.  Some versions say ''dinna gang'', which is actually the dialect for an area slightly further north, in [[Scotland]].

&lt;br&gt;It's in the evening after dark,
&lt;br&gt;When the blackleg miner creeps to work,
&lt;br&gt;With his moleskin pants and dirty shirt,
&lt;br&gt;There gaans the blackleg miner!

&lt;br&gt;Well he takes his tools and doon he gaans
&lt;br&gt;To hew the coal that lies below,
&lt;br&gt;There's not a woman in this town-row
&lt;br&gt;Will look at the blackleg miner.

&lt;br&gt;Oh, Delaval is a terrible place.
&lt;br&gt;They rub wet clay in the blackleg's face,
&lt;br&gt;And aroond the heaps they run a foot race,
&lt;br&gt;To catch the blackleg miner!

&lt;br&gt;So, divvint gaan near the Seghill mine.
&lt;br&gt;Across the way they stretch a line,
&lt;br&gt;To catch the throat and break the spine
&lt;br&gt;Of the dirty blackleg miner.

&lt;br&gt;They grab his duds and his pick as well,
&lt;br&gt;And they hoy them down the pit of hell.
&lt;br&gt;Doon ye gaan, and fare ye well,
&lt;br&gt;You dirty blackleg miner!

&lt;br&gt;So join the union while you may.
&lt;br&gt;Divvin't wait till your dying day,
&lt;br&gt;For that may not be far away,
&lt;br&gt;You dirty blackleg miner!

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===
Isabeau is mourning the death of her newborn daughter, alone. Count Lisiac, a former suitor of Isabeau, seizes the opportunity of her husband's absence and her grief to approach Isabeau. When his attempts fail he turns to violence, assaulting the Castle Agrazant and kidnapping Isabeau. Isabeau conceals a note giving details of her abduction before she is taken.

Elsewhere, Richard of Agrazant is returning from Jerusalem. He passes Lisiac Hall ignorant that his wife is imprisoned there. He arrives at Castle Agrazant and sees evidence of the assault. He finds his daughter dead in the cradle and the note from Isabeau. He pledges 
revenge.

===Act 2===
Isabeau is feted at Lisiac Hall, but takes no part in the celebrations. Geoffrey becomes inebriated and is more forward with Isabeau. As events spin out of control, Geoffrey's men debate protecting Isabeau from Geoffrey. A herald then announces the arrival of traveling
musicians - a monk, a minstrel, and a boy. Geoffrey commands them to perform but asks Isabeau to select a happy song. She requests a song of Nazareth, and Richard (disguised as the monk) thereby confirms she has no desire to stay with Geoffrey.

The Boy then sings of the recent assault of Castle Agrazant, to the astonishment of Geoffrey and his men. Filled with superstitious dread, Lisiac orders the musicians cast out. The Monk interjects, offering to sing a different song - and his voice is recognized by Isabeau as her Richard's. Richard sings of his love for Isabeau and remorse at going to Jerusalem and leaving 'far from home and wife and child'.

Removing his disguise, Richard challenges Geoffrey and a melee ensues. In the melee, Isabeau is stabbed by Geoffrey; Geoffrey is run through by Richard's sword. Richard seizes Isabeau and escapes, followed by the boy and musician.

===Act 3===
Richard enters, assisting Isabeau. She asks to rest and Richard encourages her to continue on. She weakens further, they do rest, apparently sleeping for the night. In the morning, Richard uses his helmet to fetch water and tells of his visit to Jerusalem. His assessment is that his crusade was in error, he sacrificed all that was worthy in its pursuit. He breaks his blade. Placing the fragments on a rock, he returns to Isabeau. Isabeau bemoans their sad fate and begins to hallucinate that she is comforting her daughter; she hears the horns of Lisiac approaching. She and Richard sing a duet extolling the possibility of living in a brighter realm in the future, forever.

The '''City Mayors Foundation''', also known as '''City Mayors''', is an international think tank dedicated to urban affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newing |first=Rod |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f149eb60-6190-11df-aa80-00144feab49a.html#axzz1aIYappPj |title=Funding and social capital are key factors in financing regeneration |publisher=FT.com |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been active since 2003 and runs the biennial [[World Mayor]] award, as well as providing pro bono consultancy services.  Unlike [[Eurocities]] and [[United Cities and Local Governments]] it is wholly independent of any city.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/city_mayors.html |title=City Mayors: About City Mayors  |work=citymayors.com |year=2012 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City Mayors has instituted a Code of Ethics for city leaders who wish to perform their duties beyond all reproach. Preamble from the Code: "Good and honest local government is the foundation of any nation that strives to provide its citizens with happiness, security and prosperity. Incompetence, corruption and misconduct in local government threaten fundamental decency in a society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.citymayors.com/gratis/code-ethics.html |title=City Mayors: Code of Ethics  |work=citymayors.com|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation also publishes books as an imprint on urban affairs.

The City Mayors Foundation commissions the trophy presented as the World Mayor Award. The trophy was designed by artist Manuel Ferrari and is handmade out of steel by the metalworker Kaspar Swankey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.swankeypankey.com/g004.html |title=Kaspar Swankey  |work=swankeypankey.com  |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The City Mayors Foundation was set up in 2003 by Tann vom Hove (UK/Germany), Ruth Maguire (UK), Guy Kervella (UK/France), Nick Swift (Canada) and Josh Fecht (USA). In 2004 Andrew Stevens (UK), Mayraj Fahim (USA), Tony Favro (USA) and Adriana Maciel (Mexico) joined City Mayors.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17053">In cultural and social studies, configurations are patterns of [[behaviour]], movement (→[[movement culture]]) and [[thinking]], which research observes when analysing different [[cultures]] and/ or historical changes. The term “configurations” is mostly used by comparative [[anthropological]] studies and by [[cultural history]]. '''Configurational analysis''' became a special method by the Stuttgart school of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] during the 1970s and later by [[body culture studies]] in Denmark.
	
'''Configurational analysis''' is marked by its distance towards the [[history of ideas]] and [[intention]]s, which are conceived as mainstreams in historical studies. Configurations of human behaviour and movement have attracted special attention in the framework of phenomenology (→[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]) and particularly in [[materialist]] phenomenology.

== Configurations in earlier cultural studies ==

Configurations in different cultures were studied since early twentieth century.

[[Ruth Benedict]] (1934) contributed to the anthropology of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] by using the term of “configurations” as a translation of German “[[wikt:gestalt|Gestalt]] [[:de:Gestalt]]”. Configuration denoted a whole of social attitudes, practices and beliefs and was nearly identical with “[[culture]]”. It was used for comparison – between the [[Hopi]] Indians and the Indians of the prairies, between Japanese and Western culture – and in a perspective of [[cultural relativism]]: Each culture has configurations of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Ruth 1934: ''Patterns of Culture.'' Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gaston Bachelard]] (1938) used the term ”diagram” to describe an order of conceived reality both in scientific and in literary understanding. This was his key to a "materialist [[psychoanalysis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard, Gaston 1938: ''La psychanalyse du feu;'' English 1964: ''Psychoanalysis of fire.'' Boston: Beacon&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelard’s approach became later a source of inspiration for [[Michel Foucault]].

[[Norbert Elias]] (1939, 1970) described certain patterns of relations between human beings as ''figuration [http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/figuration]'' – in English: ”configuration” – becoming visible in play of cards, dance and football. He described these configurations as ''das sich wandelnde Muster, das die Spieler miteinander bilden'' (the changing pattern, which players form with each other), ''Spannungsgefüge'' (relations of suspense), ''Interdependenz der Spieler'' (interdependence of players), and ''das fluktuierende Spannungsgleichgewicht, das Hin und Her einer Machtbalance'' (the fluctuating balance of suspense, the to-and-fro of a balance of power).&lt;ref&gt;Elias, Norbert 1939: ''Über den Prozess der Zivilisation. Soziogenetische und psychogenetische Untersuchungen.'' Frankfort/ Main Suhrkamp; English 1982: ''The Civilizing Process.'' Oxford Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; This became a key to his sociology of [[civilization]].

[[Michel Foucault]] (1966) used the term ''la configuration'' in historical studies of philosophy, in order to characterize “the order of the things”, patterns of knowledge changing in [[epistemological]] disruptions. The configurations of savoir changed, according to Foucault, in following historical steps:&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel 1966: ''Les mots et les choses.'' Paris: Gallimard; English 1970: ''The Order of Things. An Archeology of the Human Sciences.'' New York: Pantheon&lt;/ref&gt;

: The age of [[Renaissance]] focused on the chains of similarities, going from sign to sign. [[Cervantes]] shaped an ironical picture of this configuration by the phantasmas of [[Don Quixote]].

: The 18th century constructed the tableau as an universal grammar. On this base, [[Linné]] constructed the genealogical trees of plants and animals as a tableau of life. An ironical picture of this configuration was given by [[Laurence Sterne]] in his [[Tristram Shandy]].

: The 19th century discovered [[progress (history)|progress]] and [[evolution]] – in [[life science]] as [[natural history]], in economy as [[Manufacturing|production]], and in language as [[linguistic history]]. On the background of these modern configurations, which took their form around 1800, individual [[subjectivity]] was constructed, as well as the dynamic of industrial life developed.

There are indicators that these configurations may disappear or transform again in a [[post-modern]] age.

== Configurations in historical behaviour studies ==

Configurational analysis (in German ''Konfigurationsanalyse'') became a particular methodological approach in the framework of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]], as they were developed at the University of Stuttgart during the 1970s by the historians August Nitschke and [[Henning Eichberg]]. Nitschke analyzed ''raum-zeitliche Muster'' (patterns of space and time) and ''Körperanordnungen'' (orders of the body) as “configurations” when comparing patterns of [[art]] and patterns of [[social behavior]]. Configurations were similarities, analogies and changing patterns of figures in a given space.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1975: ''Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen.'' Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog; id. 1975 (ed.): ''Verhaltenswandel in der industriellen Revolution.'' Stuttgart: Kohlhammer&lt;/ref&gt;

This analytical approach was comparable to concepts, which in recent time have challenged historiography: [[mentality]] ([[Georges Duby]]), affect control ([[Norbert Elias]]) (→[[Affect control theory]]), perception ([[Lucien Febvre]]), structural thinking ([[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]), needs ([[David McClelland]]), and interaction ([[George Herbert Mead]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1981: ''Historische Verhaltensforschung.'' Stuttgart: Ulmer&lt;/ref&gt; 
The configurational approach contrasted deliberately with the mainstream of [[historiography]] explaining history by the aims of its actors ([[pragmatism]]), as an expression of [[weltanschauung]] ([[psychology]] and [[history of ideas]]) or by interests (in [[social history]]).&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August 1975: ''Kunst und Verhalten. Analoge Konfigurationen.'' Stuttgart-Bad-Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog&lt;/ref&gt;

The configurational analysis was especially applied to [[comparative]] and historical studies of [[sport]] and [[dance]] as indicators of [[social change]]. The [[comparative]] analysis of [[Track and field athletics|athletics]], [[ball games]], [[equestrianism]], [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], and [[dance]] showed some common configurations as: the functional parceling of space, a new dynamic of “progress” and speed, the modern taste of [[suspense]], the principle of [[competition]], and the production of result tables. The configurations of [[movement culture]] prefigured the patterns of [[productivity]] orientation, which characterized the [[Industrialisation|Industrial Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Eichberg, Henning 1978: ''Leistung, Spannung Geschwindigkeit. Sport und Tanz im gesellschaftlichen Wandel des 18./19. Jahrhunderts.'' Stuttgart: Klett-Cotta&lt;/ref&gt;

The applied concept of “configuration” was here different from "system" (→[[cultural system]]) (being more static and systematic, and related to the negative term of the non-systematic), from “style” (being more [[aesthetic]] and having undertones of taste, [[subjectivity]] and stylization), and from “[[structure]]” (having undertones of “the functional”, as a heritage from [[structural functionalism]] in sociology). In contrast to these terms, configuration denotes a more dynamic pattern in change.

Configurations as patterns of behaviour, movement and thinking reflect man's perception of [[reality]]. They give an epochal pattern of [[perception]] which concurrently defines a framework for action.  But in no way they describe the whole reality of an epoch. Furthermore, their power to explain individual actions is limited. The epochal "reality" is no straitjacket which does not allow freedom of action. Nevertheless, in each epoch there are typical ways to act or to behave, to move or to think. They correspond with the way people perceive reality. Acting or thinking in this way may be right or wrong – it is typical anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Nitschke, August (1962): ''Heilige in dieser Welt. Persönliche Autorität und politische Wirksamkeit''. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer; Kalckhoff, Andreas (1982): "Historische Verhaltensforschung: Ethnologie unserer Vergangenheit. Die Konfiguration eines Aufstandes im 10. Jahrhundert", in Gehlen, Rolf &amp; Wolf, Bernd (eds.): ''Werner Müller zu seinem 75.Geburtstag, Unter dem Pflaster liegt der Strand 11''. Berlin: Karin Kramer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Configurations in body culture studies ==

Studies of [[Human body|body]] culture, which spread in Denmark during the 1980s, developed the configurational analysis further, revealing inner tensions and contradictions of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;Dietrich, Knut 2001 (ed.): ''How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport.'' University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences; Eichberg, Henning 1998: ''Body Cultures.'' London: Routledge; id. - 2001: “Thinking contradictions. Towards a methodology of configurational analysis, or: How to reconstruct the societal signification of movement culture and sport.” In: Knut Dietrich (ed.): ''How Societies Create Movement Culture and Sport.'' University of Copenhagen: Institute of Exercise and Sport Sciences, 10-32; id. 2010: ''Bodily Democracy.'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; 
The configurative approach was applied to the analysis and especially to comparison of different fields of activities: popular [[festivity]], [[fitness culture]] (→[[physical fitness]]), sportive and non-sportive [[ball games]], sport [[racing]] and [[parcour]], different [[outdoor activities]], and different [[health]] cultures. Configurational analysis focused on bodily movement in time and space, on the energy of movement, on interpersonal relations, and on the objectification of movement. Above this basis, analysis included the superstructure of [[institutions]] and [[idea]]s (→[[Base and superstructure]]), which organize and reflect collective actions and interests.

: ''Time of bodily movement'' is marked, among others, by contradictions between acceleration and slowness – between living rhythm and mechanical pace – between linear-abstract and irreversible time – between cyclical, progressing and situational time. Historical change saw for instance the transformation from the noble [[exercises]] of the eighteenth century with their circulating and formally measured patterns to modern [[gymnastics]] and [[sports]] with their patterns of speed, acceleration, and flow, which characterized industrial behaviour more generally.

: ''Space of bodily movement'' is characterized by contradictions between the straight line and the [[labyrinth]] – between connection and parcellation of spaces – between geometrical and directed space – between space, place and intermediary space. [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]’s study of the [[panopticon]] as a specific modern way of organising the space of movement and bodily visibility around 1800 showed the societal depth of this analysis.

: ''Energy of bodily movement'' consists of a multiplicity of different atmospheres, radiations, moods and modes of attunement. Modern suspension ([[suspense]], tension, thrill, excitement – in German ''Spannung''') emerged in eighteenth and nineteenth century’s [[boxing]] and [[ball games]] at the same time as it appeared in [[detective novels]]. This coincidence was illustrative for the configurational change towards [[industrial society]]. Social energy was also illustrated by the study of [[laughter]] in the tradition of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]’s analysis of [[Renaissance]] society.

: ''[[Interpersonal relations]]'' in bodily movement tell about power and [[gender]] – about winners and losers – about you- and we-relations in motion. The study of sports has especially been enriched by the attention to gender unbalances in body culture.

: ''[[Objectification]] of bodily movement'' is especially characteristic for modern body cultures. Bodily movement is reified in a tension between process and result – between [[social production]], reproduction and a-productive encounters in bodily activity – between producing data or pictures by movement. The production of records by modern sports has been a central point for understanding modern industrial behaviour.

: Above these basic body-cultural processes, body culture shows patterns of organizational and institutional character as well as the meanings and ideas, which are ascribed to bodily practices. Mainstream studies of sport often over-emphasize these ''superstructures'' (→[[Base and superstructure]]), while the configurational analysis of body culture gives priority to the focus on bodily practice, in the framework of a [[materialist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

== Further configurational approaches ==

Configurational analysis can be compared with other contemporary approaches in cultural and social studies.

: [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1966/67, 1979) launched the concept of ”[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]” to describe patterns of action, of bodily practice and presentation, of taste and aesthetic form (comparable to the [[Gothic style]] of Medieval  cathedrals). Like configuration, habitus was illustrative for a certain homology, which could be found inside a given social formation or class and as distinction between different [[social classes]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre 1966/67: "Champs intellectuel et projet créateur." In: ''Temps modernes'', 22, 865-906; id. 1979: ''La distinction.'' Paris: Minuit. – English 1984: ''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste.'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

: [[Peter Sloterdijk]] (1998/99) developed a cultural ”morphology”, which described the [[psychosocial]] geometry of people’s living space and inhabitations, their world and their understanding of God. Micro- and macrospheres were related to each other by characteristic configurations.&lt;ref&gt;Sloterdijk, Peter 1998/2004: ''Sphären. Plurale Sphärologie.'' Vols.1-3, Frankfurt/Main: Suhrkamp&lt;/ref&gt;

In any of these approaches, “configuration” made it possible to compare concrete human practice – i.e. “material” bodily phenomena – with larger spheres of [[society]] and [[culture]].

The '''College of Computer Studies''' ('''CCS''') is one of the seven colleges of [[De La Salle University]]. It was established in 1981 as the '''Center for Planning, Information, and Computer Science''' offering only a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Computer Science]]. The department was formally declared as a college in 1984. In 1990, the college was transferred to its new building, the INTELLECT (Information Technology Lecture) Building, which was eventually renamed as the Gokongwei Building. In 1996 the college was granted semi-autonomous status along with the Graduate School of Business which led into the establishment of [[De La Salle-Professional Schools, Inc.]]. The college became a part of De La Salle Professional Schools but later transferred back to the university.

==Accreditation==
The BS Computer Science program of the college was the first Computer Science program in the country to be given accreditation by the [[Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities]] in 1989. It was granted a Level II accreditation in 1993, and was re-accredited to Level II in 1998. In 2000, the college was named as one of the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]]'s Center of Development and Excellence in [[Information Technology]]. In 2005, the [[Computer Science]] program of the college received a Level III accreditation by PAASCU, becoming the first Level III Accredited Computer Science Program in the Philippines {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. It is the highest accreditation granted in the [[Philippines]] to this date for Computer Science programs. In March 2007, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] recognized the college as Center of Excellence in [[Information Technology]].

==Academic Research Centers==
[[Image:Gox.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gokongwei Hall Administration and Faculty Offices]]

===Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing and Networking (AdRIC)===
Formerly known as Advanced Research Institute for Computing (AdRIC), the Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing and Networking is the research center of the college. The aim of the center is to produce both local and international researches through faculty researchers. The center was established in 1994 to facilitate research directives of the college. It also has its research laboratories on the fourth floor of the Gokongwei Hall. The following are the activities done by the center:
*Symposium on Semantic Web and Ontology
*2nd Natural Language Processing Research Symposium
*Constraint-based Action Planning
*De La Salle University Science and Technology Congress 2005
*[[Department of Science and Technology (Philippines)|DOST]] Research Proposal Preparation
*Machine Translation Project

===Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET)===
The Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET) is a multidisciplinary research and professional laboratory at the College of Computer Studies that investigates the science of complex adaptive systems and explores innovative ways of interacting with computing solutions. Aside from performing research, the center also functions as a development laboratory for the creation of various civic computing solutions, integrating research done internally.

COMET is currently composed of lead researchers, cohorts, and research assistants. The lead researchers come from the fields of computing, statistics, mathematics and physics. The cohorts and research assistants are students from the different programs and specializations under the College of Computer Studies. The research lab also leverages its research in complex adaptive systems and computer-human interaction with the development of civic computing solutions. It also provides avenues for the professional growth of its lead researchers and cohorts.

The lab has three divisions, namely: Complex Systems, Seamless Interactions (Human-Computer Interaction), and Civic Services.

===Consulting and Education Center===
Consulting and Education Center is a continuing non-degree computer training center of the college currently headed by Engr. Jesus Gonzalez. The center provides quality education for both professionals and students. Included in its services are corporate trainings, tutorials, and summer classes catering children, secondary students, and professionals. As an academic center of the college, it also holds seminars and major conferences such as the Emerging Technologies for Philippines 2020 (ETFP) held last April 17–18, 2006 at the New World Renaissance Hotel.

===Cisco Academy Training Center ===
The college is the Cisco Academy Training Center for Expanded Courses (Sponsored Curriculum) or CATC-SC of the country. The center is responsible for conducting trainings on sponsored curriculum courses such as Fundamentals of Unix, Fundamentals of Java, IT Essentials, and Voice and Data Cabling. Under DLSU, trainings for sponsored curriculum courses are categorized into two: instructor and professional trainings.

===Center for Empathic Human-Computer Interactions (CEHCI)===
The Center for Empathic Human-Computer Interactions laboratory investigates the problem of multimodal emotion modeling and empathic response modeling to build human-centered design systems. By multimodal, we mean we recognize a human’s emotion based on facial expressions, speech, and movement (such as posture and gait). Because we extend a computing system from a  software to a physical space, novel approaches to providing empathic responses are required.  To achieve this, we  use emotion-based interactions together with sensor-rich, ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence.

Currently, we are focused on the development of a self-improving, ambient intelligent empathic space. It is a three-year project funded by the Philippine Government's Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for Advanced Science and Technology Research and Development. It is on its first year with an initial grant of PhP 3,300,000.

'''Diplomatics''' (in American English, and in most anglophone countries), or '''diplomatic''' (in British English),&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|diplomatic, adj. and n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beal"/&gt; is a scholarly discipline centred on the critical analysis of [[document]]s: especially, [[historical document]]s. It focuses on the conventions, protocols and formulae that have been used by document creators, and uses these to increase understanding of the processes of document creation, of information transmission, and of the relationships between the facts which the documents purport to record and reality.

The discipline originally evolved as a tool for studying and determining the authenticity of the official [[charter]]s and [[diploma]]s issued by royal and papal [[chancery (medieval office)|chanceries]]. It was subsequently appreciated that many of the same underlying principles could be applied to other types of official document and [[legal instrument]], to non-official documents such as private [[Letter (message)|letters]], and, most recently, to the [[metadata]] of electronic records.

Diplomatics is one of the [[auxiliary sciences of history]]. It should not be confused with its sister-discipline of [[palaeography]].&lt;ref name="Duranti12"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duranti |first=Luciana |authorlink=Luciana Duranti |title=Diplomatics: New uses for an Old Science |journal=Archivaria |volume=28 |year=1989 |url=http://archivaria.ca/index.php/archivaria/article/viewFile/11567/12513 |pages=7–27 (12) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, its techniques have more in common with those of the literary disciplines of [[textual criticism]] and [[historical criticism]].

==Etymology==
[[File:De re diplomatica 17765.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of [[Jean Mabillon]]'s ''De re diplomatica'' (1681)]]

Despite the verbal similarity, the discipline has nothing to do with [[diplomacy]]. Both terms are derived, by separate linguistic development, from the word ''diploma'', which originally referred to a folded piece of writing material—and thus both to the materials which are the focus of study in diplomatics, and to accreditation papers carried by diplomats.

The word ''diplomatics'' was effectively coined by the [[Benedictine]] monk [[Jean Mabillon]], who in 1681 published his treatise, ''De re diplomatica'' ([[Latin]]: roughly, "The Study of Documents"). From there, the word entered the French language as ''diplomatique'', and then English as ''diplomatic'' or ''diplomatics''.

==Definitions==
''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' (1828) defines diplomatics as the "science of diplomas, or of ancient writings, literary and public documents, letters, decrees, charters, codicils, etc., which has for its object to decipher old writings, to ascertain their authenticity, their date, signatures, etc."&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Dictionary'' (1828); quoted in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (2d ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Giorgio Cencetti (1908–1970) defined the discipline as "the study of the ''Wesen'' [being] and ''Werden'' [becoming] of documentation, the analysis of genesis, inner constitution and transmission of documents, and of their relationship with the facts represented in them and with their creators".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Giorgio |last=Cencetti |chapter=La Preparazione dell'Archivista |title=Antologia di Scritti Archivistici |editor-first=Romualdo |editor-last=Giuffrida |place=Rome |publisher=Archivi di Stato |year=1985 |page=285}} Translation from Duranti 1989, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commission International de Diplomatique]] has defined diplomatics as "the science which studies the tradition, the form and the issuing of written documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.cei.lmu.de/VID/VID.php?1 |title=Vocabulaire Internationale de Diplomatique |editor-first=Maria Milagros |editor-last=Cárcel Ortí |edition=2nd |place=Valencia |year=1997 |publisher=Collecció Oberta |page=21 |quote=La Diplomatique est la science qui étudie la tradition, la forme et l'élaboration des actes écrits. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More pragmatically, Peter Beal defines diplomatics as "the science or study of documents and records, including their forms, language, script and meaning. It involves knowledge of such matters as the established wording and procedures of particular kinds of document, the deciphering of writing, and document analysis and authentication".&lt;ref name="beal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter|last=Beal |title=A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology, 1450–2000 |year=2008 |place=Oxford| publisher=Oxford University Press| page=121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theo Kölzer defines diplomatics as "the teaching and the study of charters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kölzer |first=Theo |chapter=Diplomatics |title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms – methods – trends |editor-first=Albrecht |editor-last=Classen |place=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |year=2010 |isbn=9783110184099 |volume=1 |pages=405–424 (405) }}&lt;/ref&gt; He treats the terms "charter", "diploma", and "document" as broadly synonymous, and refers to the German scholar [[Harry Bresslau]]'s definition of "documents" as "written declarations recorded in compliance with certain forms alternating according to the difference in person, place, time, and matter, which are meant to serve as a testimony of proceedings of a legal nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bresslau |first=Harry |authorlink=Harry Bresslau |title=Handbuch der Urkundenlehre für Deutschland und Italien |volume=1 |edition=4th |year=1969 |place=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly speaking, and as usually understood by present-day scholars, diplomatics is concerned essentially with the analysis and interpretation of the linguistic and textual elements of a document. It is, however, closely associated with several parallel disciplines, including [[palaeography]], [[sigillography]], [[codicology]], and [[provenance]] studies, all of which are concerned with a document's physical characteristics and history, and which will often be carried out in conjunction with a diplomatic analysis. The term diplomatics is therefore sometimes used in a slightly wider sense, to encompass some of these other areas (as it was in Mabillon's original work, and as is implied in the definitions of both Webster and Beal quoted above). The recent development of the science in non-English Europe is expanding its scope to a cultural history of documentation including aspects of [[pragmatic literacy]] or [[symbolic communication]].

[[Christopher N. L. Brooke|Christopher Brooke]], a distinguished teacher of diplomatics, referred to the discipline's reputation in 1970 as that of "a formidable and dismal science ... a kind of game played by a few scholars, most of them medievalists, harmless so long as it does not dominate or obscure historical enquiry; or, perhaps, most commonly of all, an aid to understanding of considerable use to scholars and research students if only they had time to spare from more serious pursuits".&lt;ref name="brooke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooke |first=Christopher N. L. |authorlink=Christopher N. L. Brooke |title=The teaching of Diplomatic |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=4 |year=1970 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.1080/00379817009513930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[image:Traité de diplomatique tome 4 17008.jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume 4 of [[René-Prosper Tassin|Tassin]] and [[Charles-François Toustain|Toustain]]'s ''Nouveau traité de diplomatique'' (1759)]]
In the [[Ancient history|ancient]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] periods, the authenticity of a document was considered to derive from the document's place of preservation and storage, in, for example, temples, public offices, and archives. As a result, those with nefarious motives were able to give [[Forgery|forged documents]] a spurious authenticity by depositing them in places of authority. Diplomatics grew from a need to establish new standards of authenticity through the critical analysis of the textual and physical forms of documents.&lt;ref name="Duranti12"/&gt;

The first notable application of diplomatics was by [[Nicolas of Cusa]], in 1433, and [[Lorenzo Valla]], in 1440, who determined, independently, that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which had been used for centuries to legitimize papal temporal authority, was a forgery.  Diplomatics became important during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 1989, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Its emergence as a recognisably distinct sub-discipline, however, is generally dated to the publication of [[Jean Mabillon|Mabillon's]] ''De re diplomatica'' in 1681. Mabillon had begun studying old documents with a view towards establishing their authenticity as a result of the doubts raised by the [[Jesuit]] [[Daniel van Papenbroek]] over supposed [[Merovingian]] documents from the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the production of spurious [[charter]]s and other documents had been common, either to provide written documentation of existing rights or to bolster the plausibility of claimed rights. Mabillon's work engendered a far livelier awareness of the potential presence of forged or spurious documents, in the fields of both [[history]] and [[law]].

Although Mabillon is still widely seen as the "father" of diplomatics, a more important milestone in the formation of the battery of practical techniques which make up the modern discipline was the publication of [[René-Prosper Tassin]] and [[Charles-François Toustain]]'s ''Nouveau traité de diplomatique'', which appeared in six volumes in 1750–65.

The most significant work in English was [[Thomas Madox]]'s ''Formulare Anglicanum'', published in 1702. In general, however, the discipline was always studied more intensively by continental scholars than by those in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison |first=Charlotte |title=Thomas Madox and the Origins of English Diplomatic Scholarship |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=147–169 |doi=10.1080/00379810902916282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomatics is often associated with the study of documents of the medieval period. However, scholars such as [[Luciana Duranti]] have argued that many of its theories and principles can be adapted and applied to contemporary [[archival science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams |first=Caroline |title=Diplomatic Attitudes: from Mabillon to Metadata |journal=Journal of the Society of Archivists |volume=26 |year=2005 |pages=1–24 |doi=10.1080/00039810500047417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duranti 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The study of diplomatics is a valuable tool for [[historian]]s, enabling them to determine whether alleged [[historical document]]s and [[archive]]s are in fact genuine or [[forgery|forgeries]]. Its techniques may also be used to help date undated documents.

Diplomatics has many similar applications in the field of [[law]].

Some famous cases in which the principles of diplomatics have been employed have included:
* [[Lorenzo Valla]]'s proof of the forgery of the [[Donation of Constantine]]. Valla's work preceded Mabillon by roughly two centuries, and was the first application of the principles of modern, scientific diplomatics.
* The [[Hitler diaries]] [[hoax]] (1983).
* The [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|National Archives forgeries]] (the Martin Allen forgeries, or [[Himmler]] forged documents) (2005).

==Diplomatic editions and transcription==
A '''diplomatic edition''' is an edition (in print or online) of an historic manuscript text that seeks to reproduce as accurately as possible in typography all significant features of the manuscript original, including spelling and punctuation, abbreviations, deletions, insertions, and other alterations. Similarly, '''diplomatic transcription''' attempts to represent by means of a system of editorial signs all features of a manuscript original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gregory A. |last=Pass |title=Descriptive Cataloging of Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and Early Modern Manuscripts |place=Chicago |publisher=Association of College and Research Libraries |year=2003 |page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''semi-diplomatic'' is used for an edition or transcription that seeks to reproduce only some of these features of the original. A diplomatic edition is thus distinguished from a ''normalized edition'', in which the editor, while not altering the original wording of the text, renders it using normal (modern) [[orthography]].

A diplomatic edition is also to be distinguished both from a ''[[facsimile]] edition'', which, in the modern era, normally employs photographic or digital images; and from a ''type facsimile'' (such as [[Abraham Farley]]'s [[Publication of Domesday Book#Abraham Farley's edition (1773–1783)|edition of ''Domesday Book'']]), which seeks to reproduce the appearance of the original through the use of a [[Record type|special typeface]] or [[Medieval Unicode Font Initiative|digital font]].

[[File:Down shifting on the Rogue.jpg|thumb|275x275px|An example of what a down shifting lifestyle may allow more time for.]]
The term down-shifting in the English language refers to the act of reducing the gear of a motor vehicle while driving a [[manual transmission]]. This title or term has now been re purposed and applied to describe a [[social behavior]] or [[Social Trends|trend]] in which individuals live simpler lives to escape from what critics call the [[rat race]].

The long-term effect of downshifting can include an escape from what has been described as [[economic materialism]], as well as reduce the "stress and psychological expense that may accompany [[economic materialism]]". This new social trend emphasizes finding an improved [[Work–life balance|balance between leisure and work]], while also focusing life goals on personal fulfillment, as well as building personal relationships instead of the all-consuming pursuit of economic success.

Down-shifting, as a concept, shares many characteristics with [[simple living]]. However, it is distinguished as an alternative form by its focus on moderate change and concentration on an individual comfort level and a gradual approach to living.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"&gt;Tracey Smith, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, this new form of simple living began appearing in the [[mainstream media]], and has continually grown in popularity among populations living in [[Industrial society|industrial societies]], especially the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 67;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values and motives==
Down-shifters are people that adopt long-term [[voluntary simplicity]] in their lives. A few of the main practices of down-shifters include accepting less money for fewer hours worked, while placing an emphasis on consuming less in order to reduce their ecological footprint.  One of the main results of these practices is being able to enjoy more [[Leisure|leisure time]] in the company of others, especially loved ones.  

The primary motivations for downshifting are gaining leisure time, escaping from [[consumerism|work-and-spend cycle]], and removing the clutter of unnecessary possessions. The personal goals of downshifting are simple:  To reach a holistic self-understanding and satisfying meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its personalized nature and emphasis on many minor changes, rather than complete lifestyle overhaul, it attracts downshifters or participants across the socioeconomic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Both of Hamilton's case studies in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  An intrinsic consequence of downshifting is increased time for non-work-related activities, which, combined with the diverse demographics of downshifters, cultivates higher levels of [[civic engagement]] and [[Social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of participation is limitless, because all members of society &amp;mdash; adults, children, businesses, institutions, organizations, and governments &amp;mdash; are able to downshift.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;

In practice, down-shifting involves a variety of [[behavior change (public health)|behavioral and lifestyle changes]]. The majority of these down-shifts are voluntary choices. Natural life course events, such as the loss of a job, or birth of a child can prompt involuntary down-shifting. There is also a [[Time|temporal dimension]], because a down-shift could be either temporary or permanent.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"&gt;Schor 1998, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

===Work and income===
The most common form of down-shifting is work (or income) down-shifting. Down-shifting is fundamentally based on dissatisfaction with the conditions and consequences of the workplace environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  The philosophy of work-to-live replaces the social [[ideology]] of live-to-work. Reorienting economic priorities shifts the [[work–life balance]] away from the workplace.

Economically, work downshifts are defined in terms of reductions in either actual or potential [[income]], work hours, and spending levels.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  Following a path of earnings that is lower than the established market path is a downshift in potential earnings in favor of gaining other non-material benefits.

On an individual level, work downshifting is a voluntary reduction in annual income. Downshifters desire meaning in life outside of work and, therefore, will opt to decrease the amount of time spent at work or work hours.  Reducing the number of hours of work, consequently, lowers the amount earned.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, pps. 66-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply not working [[overtime]] or taking a half-day a week for leisure time, are work downshifts.

Career downshifts are another way of downshifting economically and entail lowering previous aspirations of [[wealth]], a promotion or higher [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Juniu 2000, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Quitting a job to work locally in the community, from home or to start a business are examples of career downshifts.  Although more radical, these changes do not mean stopping work altogether.

Many reasons are cited by workers for this choice and usually center on a personal [[cost–benefit analysis]] of current working situations and the quality extracurricular activities. High stress, pressure from employers to increase productivity, and long [[Commuting|commutes]] can be factors that contribute to the costs of being employed.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  If the down-shifter wants more [[quality time|non-material benefits]] like leisure time, a healthy family life, or personal freedom, then, switching jobs could be a desirable option.

Work down-shifting may also be a key to considerable [[Health#Maintaining|health benefit]]s as well as a healthy [[retirement]]. People are retiring later in life than previous generations.

===Spending habits===
Another aspect of down-shifting is being a [[Ethical consumerism|conscious consumer]] or actively practicing alternative forms of consumption. Proponents of down-shifting point to [[consumerism]] as a primary source of stress and dissatisfaction because it creates a society of individualistic consumers who measure both social status and general happiness by an [[affluenza|unattainable quantity of material possessions]]. Instead of buying goods for personal satisfaction, consumption down-shifting, purchasing only the necessities, is a way to focus on quality of life rather than quantity.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"/&gt;

This realignment of spending priorities promotes the functional utility of goods over their ability to convey status which is evident in downshifters being, in general, less [[brand]]-conscious.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; These consumption habits also facilitate the option of working and earning less because annual spending is proportionally lower. Reducing spending is less demanding than more extreme downshifts in other areas, like employment, as it requires only minor lifestyle changes.

===Policies that enable downshifting===
Unions, business, and governments could implement more [[Flextime|flexible working hours]], [[Part-time contract|part-time]] work, and other non-traditional work arrangements that enable people to work less, while still maintaining employment. Small business legislation, reduced filing requirements and reduced tax rates encourage small-scale individual [[entrepreneurship]] and therefore help individuals quit their jobs altogether and work for themselves on their own terms.&lt;ref name=GreenIllusions&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|url=http://www.greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment consequences===
The catch-phrase of International Downshifting Week is "Slow Down and Green Up".&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;  Whether intentional or unintentional, generally, the choices and practices of down-shifters nurture environmental health because they reject the fast-paced lifestyle fueled by [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] and adopt more sustainable lifestyles. The [[Manifest and latent functions and dysfunctions|latent function]] of consumption down-shifting is to reduce, to some degree, the [[carbon footprint]] of the individual down-shifter.  An example is to shift from a corporate suburban rat race lifestyle to a small eco friendly farming lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444327204577615972288993492 ''The Ultimate Growth Business; Many corporate refugees think green acres are the place to be. How do they make the transition?]'' October 12, 2012 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Down-shifting geographically===
As a response the hectic pace of life and stresses in urban areas, downshifting geographically is a relocation to a smaller, rural, or more slow-paced community.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  This is a more drastic change, but because the access to the internet is widespread and possible, downshifting geographically does not bring total removal from mainstream culture.

==Sociopolitical implications==
Although downshifting is primarily motivated by personal desire and not by a conscious political stance, it does define societal [[overconsumption]] as the source of much personal discontent. By redefining life satisfaction in non-material terms, downshifters assume an alternative lifestyle but continue to coexist in a society and political system preoccupied with the economy. In general, downshifters are politically apathetic because mainstream politicians mobilize voters through the ''hip-pocket nerve'', proposing governmental solutions to periods of financial hardship and [[recession|economic recessions]]. This economic rhetoric is meaningless to downshifters who have forgone worrying about money.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Jan. 2003, pps. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Although consumers do hold the majority in the United States, the UK, and Australia, a significant minority, approximately 20 to 25 percent,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Both 2003 Studies&lt;/ref&gt; of these countries' citizens identify themselves in some respect as downshifters. Downshifting is not an isolated or unusual choice.  Politics still centers around consumerism and unrestricted growth, but downshifting value, such as family priorities and workplace regulation, are appearing in political debates and campaigns.

Like downshifters, the [[The Cultural Creatives|Cultural Creatives]] is another social movement whose ideology and practices diverge from mainstream [[consumerism]] and according to Paul Ray, are followed by at least a quarter of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''In Praise of Slowness'', Carl Honoré relates followers of downshifting and [[simple living]] to the global [[Slow movement (culture)|Slow Movement]].

The emergence of a large and diverse class of downshifters challenges the economically bias ideas for improving society.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, pps. 35-37&lt;/ref&gt;  Downshifting and similar, [[Post-materialism|post-materialist]] ideologies are rising in popularity, but as a result of their [[grassroots]] nature, and relatively inconspicuous, non-confrontational subcultures, they represent unorganized [[List of social movements|social movements]] without political aspirations or motivating grievances.

'''Enculturation''' is the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding [[culture]] and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary in that culture and worldviews.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"&gt;Grusec, Joan E.; Hastings, Paul D. "Handbook of Socialization: Theory and Research", 2007, Guilford Press; {{ISBN|1-59385-332-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-332-7}}; p&amp;nbsp;547.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this process, the influences that limit, direct, or shape the individual (whether deliberately or not) include parents, other adults, and peers. If successful, enculturation results in competence in the language, values, and rituals of the culture.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

Enculturation is related to [[socialization]]. In some academic fields, socialization refers to the deliberate shaping of the individual. In others, the word may cover both deliberate and informal enculturation.&lt;ref name="GrusecHastings"/&gt;

[[Conrad Phillip Kottak]] (in ''Window on Humanity'') writes:

{{quote|Enculturation is the process where the culture that is currently established teaches an individual the accepted norms and values of the culture or society where the individual lives. The individual can become an accepted member and fulfill the needed functions and roles of the group. Most importantly the individual knows and establishes a context of boundaries and accepted behavior that dictates what is acceptable and not acceptable within the framework of that society. It teaches the individual their role within society as well as what is accepted behavior within that society and lifestyle.}}

''Enculturation'' is sometimes referred to as ''[[acculturation]]'', a word recently used to more distinctively refer only to exchanges of cultural features with foreign cultures. Note that this is a recent development, as ''acculturation'' in some literatures has the same meaning as ''enculturation''.

'''Energetics''' (also called '''energy economics''') is the study of energy under [[energy transformation|transformation]]. Because energy flows at all scales, from the [[quantum physics|quantum]] level to the [[biosphere]] and [[cosmos]], energetics is a very broad discipline, encompassing for example [[thermodynamics]], [[chemistry]], [[Biological thermodynamics|biological energetics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[ecological energetics]]. Where each branch of energetics begins and ends is a topic of constant debate. For example, Lehninger (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;21) contended that when the science of thermodynamics deals with energy exchanges of all types, it can be called energetics.

==Aims==
In general, energetics is concerned with defining relationships to describe the tendencies of [[energy transfer|energy flows]] and [[energy storage|storages]] under transformation, defined here as phenomena which behave like historical invariants under repeated observations. When some critical number of people have observed such invariance, such a principle is usually then given the status of a '[[Physical law|fundamental law]]' of science. As in all scientific inquiry, whether a theorem or principle is considered a fundamental law appears to depend on how many people agree to the proposition. The ultimate aim of energetics therefore is the description of fundamental laws. Philosophers of science have held that the fundamental [[laws of thermodynamics]] can be treated as laws of energetics, (Reiser 1926, p.&amp;nbsp;432). By continuing to more accurately describe these laws, energetics aims to produce reliable predictions about energy flow and storage transformations at any scale.

==History==
Energetics has a controversial history. Some authors maintain that the its origins may be found in the work of the ancient Greeks, but that the mathematical formalisation began with the work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. [[Richard de Villamil]] (1928) said that [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] formulated the science of energetics in his paper ''Outlines of the Science of Energetics'' published in the Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1855. W. Ostwald and E. Mach subsequently developed the study, and by the late 1800s energetics was understood to be incompatible with the atomic view of the atom forwarded by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s gas theory. Proof of the atom settled the dispute but not without significant damage. In the 1920s [[Lotka]] attempted to build on Boltzmann's views through a mathematical synthesis of energetics with biological evolutionary theory. Lotka proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation. This view subsequently influenced the further development of ecological energetics, especially the work of [[Howard T. Odum]].

De Villamil attempted to clarify the scope of energetics with respect to other branches of physics by positing a system that divides [[mechanics]] into two branches; energetics (the science of [[energy]]), and "pure", "abstract" or "rigid" [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] (the science of [[momentum]]). According to Villamil energetics can be mathematically characterised by scalar equations, and rigid dynamics by vector equations. In this division the dimensions for dynamics are ''space'', time and mass, and for energetics, ''length'', time and mass (Villamil 1928, p.&amp;nbsp;9). This division is made according to fundamental suppositions about the properties of bodies, e.g.:

# Are the particles comprising the system rigidly fixed together?
# Is there any machinery for stopping moving bodies?

In Villamil's classification system, dynamics says yes to 1 and no to 2, whereas energetics says no to 1 and yes to 2. Therefore, in Villamil's system, dynamics assumes that particles are rigidly fixed together and cannot vibrate, and consequently must all be at zero kelvin. The [[conservation of momentum]] is a consequence of this view, however it is considered valid only in logic and not to be a true representation of the facts (Villamil, p.&amp;nbsp;96). In contrast energetics does not assume that particles are rigidly fixed together, and thus are free to vibrate, and consequently can be at non-zero temperatures.

==Theories==
[[Image:Genomics GTL Program Payoffs.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ecological analysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an [[ecosystem]]]]
As a general statement of energy flows under transformation, the principles of energetics include the first four [[laws of thermodynamics]] which seek a rigorous description. However the precise place of the laws of thermodynamics within the principles of energetics is a topic currently under debate. If the ecologist [[Howard T. Odum]] was right, the principles of energetics take into consideration a hierarchical ordering of energy forms, which aims to account for the concept of [[energy quality]], and the evolution of the universe. [[Albert Lehninger]] (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;2) called these hierarchical orderings the

{{quote|... successive stages in the flow of energy through the biological macrocosm}}

Odum proposed 3 further energetic principles and one corollary that take [[Energy quality#Ranking_energy_quality|energy hierarchy]] into account. The first four principles of energetics are related to the same numbered laws of [[thermodynamics]], and are expanded upon in that article.

'''Episodic storytelling''' is when a story is narrated through [[episode|episodes]], as opposed to chapters, which are typically seen in novels. The term used in [[literature]] to refer to a body of work composed of episodes or similar installments is [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]. [[episodic fiction|Serials]] are also known as [[episodic fiction]]. 

Multiple episodes are usually grouped together into a [[Serial (radio and television)|series]] through a unifying [[story arc]]. Episodes may not always contain the same characters, but each episode draws from a broader group of characters, or cast, all of whom exist in the same [[story world]].

The '''eye–hand span''' is the distance across part of a text, usually a linguistic text that is being copied via typing or a piece of [[Music notation|notated music]] that is being performed, defined as the distance between the position of the [[human eye|eye]]s acquiring that information and the [[hand]](s) typing or performing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Land |first=Michael F. |last2=Tatler |first2=Benjamin W. |title=Looking and Acting |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=2009 |page=67 |isbn=978-0-19-857094-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the eye–hand span is typically measured from the location of [[Fovea centralis|central visual input]], and stretches between the [[syllable]] or [[Chord (music)|chord]] currently being typed or performed, and the lateral location of the simultaneous fixation.  This distance may be measured either in units of linear measurement or in characters or other "bits" of data.  Some authors refer to the eye–hand span as the "perceptual span" for the visual information perceivable around the region of center of vision used in reading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Rayner|title=Eye Movements in Reading: Perceptual and Language Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lx51Brw60cMC&amp;pg=PA81|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-323-14628-9|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases including [[peripheral vision|peripheral input]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Keith |last=Rayner |first2=Alexander |last2=Pollatsek |title=Eye Movements, the Eye-Hand Span, and the Perceptual Span during Sight-Reading of Music |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=49–53 [p. 49] |jstor=20182443 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep11512647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eye–hand span is analogous to the eye–voice span in [[Reading (process)|reading]] [[language]] aloud and in [[singing]].

==Quintilian Development==
The art of facilitas was most notably taught by [[Quintilian]], the Roman rhetorician, in the latter part of the first century A.D.

In this system, students, generally young boys, were trained daily from the age of six to about eighteen. There were two levels of masters who taught the children: the grammaticus, who helped children with imitations, speaking and writing exercises, and the rhetor, who prepared students for the final stage of declamation, when they gave fictitious speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J.J. (1996). Quintilian. In T. Enos (Ed.), Encyclopedia of rhetoric and composition: Communication from ancient times to the information age (581–585). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal of Quintilian’s curriculum was for men to have facilitas: the ability to speak extemporaneously on any subject at any time.&lt;ref&gt;Bourelle, Andrew.

'''The Federation of Children's Book Groups''' is a national charity in the [[United Kingdom]] that promotes children's books and reading for pleasure for all ages of children, from newborns to teenagers. The organisation is run by volunteers interested in supporting children and their books, both at a national level, through an executive, and a local level, through local groups, with the support also of individuals and professional members. The Federation liaises with publishers, libraries, schools and other bodies with an interest in literacy, reading and young people. 

The Federation owns and coordinates the [[Red House Children's Book Award]], the UK's only national book award voted for entirely by children.

The Federation promotes [[National Share-a-Story Month]] (every May) and [[National Non-Fiction Day]] (every November). It holds an annual conference each spring (with the help of local groups) as well as various one day regional conferences. The Federation regularly publishes booklists for children of different ages, as well as producing newsletters three times a year, and providing general advice and information on children's books and reading for enjoyment.

In 2011 The Federation of Children's Book Groups won the [[Eleanor Farjeon Award]] for distinguished service to the world of British children's books.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/news/4162_the_federation_of_childrens_book_groups_wins_award&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Anne Wood]], a British children's television producer, and creator of the [[Teletubbies]], established the first Book Group to promote enthusiasm for and about children's book in 1965. Soon more groups were created and the Federation of Children's Book Groups was created in 1968. Many of the original local groups are still in existence, though new groups are developing every year.

==Local Book Groups==
There are currently over 25 separate Book Groups throughout England, Scotland and Wales. Each group is different but typically a local group holds
*Meetings for adults to discuss children's books.
*Events with visiting speakers, including authors and illustrators.
*Activities for children such as storytelling and book exhibitions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3407">'''Galactic astronomy''' is the study of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and all its contents. This is in contrast to [[extragalactic astronomy]], which is the study of everything outside our galaxy, including all other galaxies.

Galactic astronomy should not be confused with [[galaxy formation and evolution]], which is the general study of [[galaxy|galaxies]], their formation, structure, components, dynamics, interactions, and the range of forms they take.

The [[Milky Way]] galaxy, where the [[Solar System]] belongs, is in many ways the best studied galaxy, although important parts of it are obscured from view in visible [[wavelength]]s by regions of [[cosmic dust]]. The development of [[radio astronomy]], [[infrared astronomy]] and [[submillimetre astronomy]] in the 20th Century allowed the gas and dust of the Milky Way to be mapped for the first time.

Meffe, C. Ronald Carroll and Contributors. ''Principles of Conservation Biology'' (3rd ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tool used in [[wildlife conservation]] to identify gaps in conservation lands (e.g., [[protected area]]s and [[nature reserve]]s) or other wildlands where significant plant and animal species and their habitat or important ecological features  occur. 

Conservation managers or scientists can use it as a basis for providing recommendations to improve the representativeness of nature reserves or the effectiveness of protected areas so that these areas provide the best value for conserving [[biodiversity|biological diversity]]. With the information that a gap analysis yields, the boundaries of protected areas may be designed to subsume 'gaps' containing significant populations of wildlife species that can enhance the long-term survival of a larger [[metapopulation]] of the species already within the managed or protected area, or to include a diversity of wildlife species or [[ecosystem]]s that merit protection but are inadequately represented in an existing protected area network. Gap assessments can be done using the [[geographic information system]]: land maps that delineate topography, biological and geological features ([[forest cover]], plains, rivers, etc.), boundaries, land ownership and use are overlaid with the distribution of wildlife species. How much of the species' distribution fall within or without the conservation lands, or within a highly exploited area etc. can be identified.


At its simplest, a gap analysis is an assessment of the extent to which a protected area system meets protection goals set by a nation or region to represent its biological diversity. Gap analyses can vary from simple exercises based on a spatial comparison of biodiversity with existing protected areas to complex studies that need detailed data gathering and analysis, mapping and use of software decision packages. All gap analyses should consider a range of different “gaps” in a protected area network:


'''Representation gaps:''' either no representations of a particular species or ecosystem in any protected area, or not enough examples of the species or ecosystem represented to ensure long-term protection.

'''Ecological gaps:''' while the species or ecosystem occurs in the protected area system, occurrence is either of inadequate ecological condition, or the protected area(s) fail to address species'' movements or specific ecological conditions needed for long-term survival or ecosystem functioning.

'''Management gaps:''' protected areas exist but management regimes (management objectives, governance types, or management effectiveness) do not provide full security for particular species or ecosystems given local conditions.

The obsolete [[German language|German]] legal concept ''Kranzgeld'' (literally "wreath money") is '''heart balm''' (see [[breach of promise]]) rewarded as compensation to a woman of "immaculate reputation" if a man broke off his [[engagement]] (or caused it to be broken off e.g. through unfaithfulness) after having had [[sexual intercourse]] with her. Immaculate reputation in this context meant mainly [[virginity]], but could also be lost though other factors such as being convicted of a crime.

The loss of virginity, it was assumed, would diminish the woman's expectations to gain a good [[matchmaking|match]] for a [[husband]]. Thus, the money is a form of legal [[damages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reverso.net/german-english/kranzgeld Kranzgeld]. Reverso Dictionary. Accessed May 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term refers to the [[wreath]] that a [[bride]] traditionally wears at her [[wedding]]. In some European cultures, notably Germany, a virgin bride was entitled to wear a wreath of [[Myrtus|myrtle]] flowers; a non-virgin bride, on the other hand, had to wear a wreath made of [[straw]].

In [[Germany]], ''Kranzgeld'' was regulated in paragraph §1300 of the [[family law]], part of the [[civil code]] ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' published in 1896 and taking effect in 1900. After being long considered irrelevant, it was finally abolished on May 4, 1998, when the entire law was renewed, on the occasion of a [[trial]] in 1993 where the [[judge]]s decided the law was outdated. A woman had then tried to sue for 1000 [[German mark|DM]] (in 2004, roughly €500 or $500), but the request was denied on the grounds of [[Gender equality|equal rights]] between man and woman.

'''Hellenistic glass ''' was [[glass]] produced during the [[Hellenistic period]], from the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] (356-323 BC) to the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]] (second half of the 1st century BC - 476) in the Mediterranean, Europe, western Asia and northern Africa. Glassmaking at this time was based on the technological traditions of the [[Classical antiquity]] and the [[Late Bronze Age]],&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1969; Grose 1981; Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt; but was marked by  transition from limited production of luxury objects made for the social elite to mass production of affordable glass vessels used by the broader public to satisfy everyday needs.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1979; Grose 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of translucent and transparent glass, attempts were made to mimic precious and semi-precious stones, as well as [[Quartz|rock crystal]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:1210 - Keramikos Museum, Athens - Glass unguentaria, ca. 150 AD - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 12 20.jpg|thumb|Glass unguentaria]]
{{further information|Hellenistic art}}
Core-formed glass vessels produced in the Mediterranean from 1525 to 50 BC were the most numerous and widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Core-formed vessels were generally small in size,  [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]  and designed to store perfumes, scented oils and cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The most common shapes were [[alabastra]], [[amphoriskoi]], [[aryballoi]] and lentoid aryballoi, [[oinochoai]] (jugs), and for the first time in the Hellenistic period [[hudriskai]] (three-handled flasks) and [[unguentaria]] (unguent bottles).&lt;ref&gt;Fossing 1940&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hellenistic Glasamphora from Olbia Antikensammlung Berlin 3.jpg|thumb|A Greek glass [[amphora]], 2nd half of the 2nd century BC, from [[Olbia (archaeological site)|Olbia]], now in the [[Altes Museum]]]]
During the second half of the 3rd century BC, mosaic glass, also known as '[[millefiori]]', literally, a thousand flowers, emerged. The group consists mostly of fused and slumped broad plates and shallow dishes with upright or out-splayed rims or hemispherical bowls. Sub-groups of mosaic glass production are 'network' or 'lacework' hemispherical bowls and vessels with meandering or spiral decorative patterns that imitate onyx. Often these bowls had a rim formed of a single ‘network’ cane of spirally twisted threads which gives a 'striped' effect.&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It is best represented in burial contexts from several large tombs in [[Canosa]] di Puglia (ancient Canusium) in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt; They are open vessels since they are made with a mould but still opaque, like the widely produced core-formed vessels.

The origins of the mosaic glassworking technique are traced back in the 15th century BC in the Mesopotamian glassmaking centres, such as Tell-al-Rimah, ΄Aqar Qūf and Marlik. Although the mosaic technique at the time was practiced in a desultory way, it is the predecessor of the elaborated mosaic vessels of high quality of the Alexandrian workshops, after the foundation of the city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt in 332 BC by [[Alexander the Great]], which is said to be the main production centre of these vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1969; Goldstein 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 2nd century BC, monochrome drinking vessels, mainly hemispherical and sub-conical bowls were introduced. They were made in considerable quantities in the Syro-Palestinian coast and were widely traded and exported to several trading centres throughout the Mediterranean. Earlier examples were made of clear greenish, brownish or almost colourless glass, while later on they often had green, amber, blue or wine-purple colour. Usually, they were decorated with linear-cut concentric circles at the bottom or right under the rim either on the inside or the outside (Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004). They were made in an open mould, which is in fact a relatively cheap technique that requires less effort put and it was this that allowed their large-scale production.

Within the production of these drinking vessels, from the mid-2nd century BC onwards, translucent or transparent glass tableware (plates, dishes, bowls, drinking vessels, such as skyphoi, footed bowls or handled cups) was introduced; glass tableware production once established enjoyed several glassworking centres and contributed in the dramatic increase of the Hellenistic glass industry.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1981; Grose 1984; Tatton-Brown and Andrews 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that glass vessels were widely consumed by the broader public as a widespread commodity, something that continued ever since and was achieved in a higher degree with the invention of the even more economical [[glassblowing]] technique.

During the 1st century BC, new types of monochrome glass vessels were introduced and ribbed bowls started to be produced. They were mould-press bowls with ribs on the outside and their production centres were concentrated in the [[Levant]] and the Syro-Palestinian coast, like the monochrome hemispherical/conical bowls.

However, the production of luxury glass vessels did not cease and glass vessels imitating precious metal vessels (gold- and silver-ware) were produced with new glassworking techniques to satisfy the needs of the elite social strata market. [[Gold sandwich glass]] vessels and [[gold glass|gold-band]] alabastra were innovations of the late Hellenistic period addressed to a more limited range of wealthy customers. The manufacturing techniques were the same, namely the mould-press and core-form mosaic techniques respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1969; Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were developed further more in order to achieve a quite elaborate decorative aspect.

==Other glass objects==
Hellenistic glass industry also included a range of other objects, mainly for decorative purposes. The broadest groups of glass objects were these of glass beads and [[inlays]], like in all periods since the introduction of glassmaking in the ancient world. The mass production of glass beads of many varieties is well represented in the context of a Hellenistic glass workshop in Rhodes, where 10,000 beads of 40 different shapes and colours have been found;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Triantafyllidis 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Rings, pendants, gemstones, amulets, small sculptures were also made with the mould-casting technique.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Inlays were produced to decorate wooden articles, furniture, chests, sarcophagi and jewellery in combination with other, often precious materials, such as gold leaf or ivory.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatiadou 2002&lt;/ref&gt; For example, glass inlays decorated the ionic capitals of north porch of the Erechtheion in the Athenian Acropolis.&lt;ref&gt;Stern 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Inlays were deeply rooted in the Egyptian glassmaking industry and their production, with the mosaic technique after the Pharaonic tradition, continued to flourish during the Hellenistic period with old or new repertories inspired from the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;Nenna 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Game counters and gaming pieces were made also as one way to recycle scrap glass left over from the manufacture of other articles.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatiadou 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in many other occasions, these objects are well represented and archaeologically found along with various types of glass vessels in rich burial contexts, e.g. this of Amphipolis.&lt;ref&gt;Romiopoulou 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary production centres==
Glassmaking and glassworking were considered two totally separate crafts and took place in different regions (Grose 1981). Each craft was characterized by its own technological tradition, know-how and equipment. Glassmakers and glassworkers did not need to have an understanding of glass vessel manufacture and primary production respectively, in order to carry out their tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Stern 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Glassmaking had to take place as close as possible to the sources of the raw materials used, namely sand and mineral [[natron]]  when it comes to the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;Shortland et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Raw glass was traded throughout the Mediterranean in the form of ingots (Stern 1999) and it was then worked and shaped into vessels, inlays, jewellery, etc., in numerous sites of the Hellenistic world.

Hellenistic glass is the typical '''soda-lime-silica glass''', to which lime was not intentionally added, but it was provided through the agent of sand.&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1956a&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it cannot be argued with certainty where the Hellenistic primary production of raw glass was geographically located from the archaeological record, we can hypothesize that a large part of glass production took place in the Syro-Palestinian coast or the broader Levant and Egypt . In favor of this argument are comments of classical writers of the period or a little later, like Strabo (63 BC) who mentioned the [[Belus River|Belus]] river on the Syrian coast to have been used for glassmaking or even by writers other such as [[Pliny the Elder]] (23-79 AD) or [[Tacitus]] (c. 56-c. 117 AD).&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1956b&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeological evidence firmly indicate that primary production of glass, as well as glassworking took place on the island of [[Rhodes]] in the Aegean, during the [[Hellenistic period]] and, particularly, after the foundation of the city of Rhodes in 408 BC, and even earlier through the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1983; Triantafyllidis 1998; Rehren 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spatial distribution==
Glassworking took place in several centres of the Hellenistic world. Raw glass was brought to glassworkers in the form of ingots, except from the Rhodian workshop which included both glassmaking and glassworking, and in turn they produced glass vessels, inlays, jewellery, etc., which were then widely traded. Although most probably core-formed vessels were traded for their content, mosaic or monochrome and transparent tableware were traded per se.

Major glassworking centres were located at the Syro-Palestinian coast, e.g. monochrome hemispherical bowls, and in [[Alexandria]], since its foundation in 332 BC, e.g. mosaic glass vessels and inlays.&lt;ref&gt;Nenna 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of the Alexandrian workshop is well understood from luxury glass vessels decorated with Egyptian-style buildings or characteristic scenes found as far as Italy and Afghanistan or, even, produced there (Auth 2001). Glass vessels, both core-formed and mould-press, were also made in Ionia, Cyprus, Sidon, the Levant, [[Tel Anafa]] in [[Upper Galilee]], Rome and Roman Italy, Crete, Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Grose 1981; Grose 1984; Barag 1985; Ignatiadou 2002; Jennings 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly interesting is the core-formed vessels’ trade and spatial distribution, since this was the group produced throughout the Hellenistic period from its very beginning to the invention of [[glassblowing]] (c. 50 BC). Core-formed bottles, along with other types of glass vessels, are found throughout the Mediterranean in the Aegean (e.g. Delos, Crete, Athens), throughout Greece, Asia Minor and western Asia (e.g. Ephesus, Sardis, Dura-Europos, Babylon, Nimrud, Nineveh, the Levant, Phoenicia), Magna Greacia (e.g. Rhegium, Morgantina) and Italy, Mesopotamia, the Balkans, Russia, the transalpine lands, Spain (Emporion) and the Balearics, northern Africa (Carthage) and Cerne on the Atlantic coast of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Harden 1956; Harden 1969; Harden 1981; Grose 1984; Barag 1985; Jennings 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Glass production of vessels or other glass objects was mainly of two distinct technological traditions, these of core-formed glass and mould-press or cast glass (Grose 1981).
* ''Core-formed glass'': is the best represented and probably the earliest manufacturing technique applied. First, a core with the bottle’s shape was shaped around a metallic rod most probably by a combination of clay, sand, mud and/or animal dung. Then, molten glass was either trailed onto the core with the aid of a second tool or directly from dipping it into a container of molten glass. The surface was smoothed by continual re-heating and rolling on a flat slab. Finally, vessels were removed from the metallic rod, they slowly cooled down in a side chamber of the [[glass melting furnace]] and, then, the core material was scraped out of the interior. Common body colours were translucent dark or cobalt blue, opaque white, brown, red or olive-green and of the decoration opaque yellow, orange, white or turquoise trails in zigzag or feather patterns. This technique limited considerably the size of the vessels, which were mainly close vessels with thick walls.
* ''Mould-press or cast glass'': it was first practiced by the Hellenistic glassworkers from the 3rd century BC onwards. Although different decorative results were achieved by variations in colours, the technique was virtually the same for ''mosaic, monochrome hemispherical bowls, transparent tableware and gold-sandwich vessels'', both luxurious fine ware and more affordable types. Mould-press or cast vessels were mainly open bowls, shallow dishes and jars, but some closed vessels were produced as well. They were made from a single mould on which a piece of glass was [[slumping|slumped]].
* Mosaic glass: vessels, namely bowls and plates, as well as inlays were produced with the mosaic technique. A multicoloured effect is achieved as a result of a variety of diverse cane configurations and colour combinations fused together and then slumped on an open mould.
* Network: a type of mosaic glass made of canes of spirally twisted glass threads of different colours laid side by side.
* Gold-sandwich glass: also found for the first time during the Hellenistic period. It technique consists of a ‘sandwich’ of two [[decolorized glass]] layers which enclose a sheet of gold leaf between them. The vessels were formed of two castings and they were carefully ground and polished.
* Cold-cutting: grinding and polishing by the application of stone-cutting techniques and by using harder materials, such us [[quartz]]. It was used as a supplementary technique to other processes as finishing and decoration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12622">'''Heritage conservation in Canada''' deals with actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life. Historic objects in [[Canada]] may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the [[Government of Canada|federal government]], the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]], or a [[local government in Canada|municipal government]].
The [[Heritage Canada Foundation]] acts as Canada's lead advocacy organization for heritage buildings and landscapes.

==Federal level==
There are a number of heritage designations at the federal level for historic sites in Canada:
* [[National Historic Sites of Canada]] are places that have been designated by the federal [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]] on the advice of the [[Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada]] (HSMBC), as being of national historic significance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/system-reseau/sec1/sites-lieux9.aspx |title=National Historic Sites of Canada System Plan - Introduction |author= |year=2000 |work= |publisher=Parks Canada |accessdate=August 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006084833/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/system-reseau/sec1/sites-lieux9.aspx |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act|Heritage Railway Stations]] are train stations owned by federally licensed railway companies recommended for protection by the HSMBC; 
* [[Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act|Heritage Lighthouses]] are lighthouses deemed to be historically significant; and
* [[Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office|Federal Heritage Buildings]] are buildings owned by the federal government which are determined to be of historical and/or architectural value.

The federal government also operates related programs for the recognition of historic persons ([[Persons of National Historic Significance|National Historic Persons]]) and events ([[Events of National Historic Significance (Canada)|National Historic Events]]).

==Provinces==
[[File:Provincial historic resource of Alberta plaque.JPG|thumb|This [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] indicates that the building is protected by the [[Government of Alberta]]]]
Each provincial government has distinct systems and approaches to heritage conservation.  They may delegate the authority to preserve historic buildings to municipalities, and / or have a provincial [[heritage register]].

For example, in the province of [[Alberta]], only sites owned by the provincial government and run as a functioning historic site or museum are known as [[Provincial historic sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Sites or Provincial Historic Areas]].  Buildings and sites owned by [[privately owned|private citizens and companies]] or [[Canadian federalism|other levels or branches of government]] may gain one of two levels of historic designation, "Registered Historic Resource" or "Provincial Historic Resource".&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/default.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Alberta's Historic Places Designation Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Historic designation in Alberta is governed by the Historic Resources Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/Documents/acts/H09.CFM Alberta Queen's Printer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The province also lists buildings deemed historically significant by municipal governments on the Alberta Register of Historic Places, which is also part of the larger [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] although this does not imply provincial or federal government status or protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/municipal.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Alberta's Historic Places Designation Program - Municipal Historic Resource Designation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205022849/http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/designation/municipal.aspx |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To supplement this system, the province also run the Alberta Main Street Program  which helps to preserve historic buildings in the [[downtown]]s of [[List of communities in Alberta|smaller communities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albertamainstreet.org/ The Alberta Main Street Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623100324/http://albertamainstreet.org/ |date=2011-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basis for the preservation system in Alberta is the Heritage Survey Program, which is a survey of 80,000 historic buildings in Alberta which lack a protected status but are documented for possible future protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/heritagesurveyprogram.aspx Alberta Culture and Community Spirit - Historic Resources Management - Historic Places Stewardship Section - Heritage Survey Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164327/http://culture.alberta.ca/heritage/resourcemanagement/historicplacesstewardship/heritagesurveyprogram.aspx |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], the [[Répertoire du patrimoine culturel du Québec]] is the main heritage register, it includes both protected and unprotected properties.  The [[Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec]] is a non-profit organization created in 1995 to promote the conservation of churches and other religious heritage buildings in the province.&lt;ref name="patrimoine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrimoine-religieux.qc.ca/en/organisme/mission.php|title=Conseil du patrimoine religieux du Québec|accessdate=2009-03-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621103711/http://www.patrimoine-religieux.qc.ca/en/organisme/mission.php|archivedate=2008-06-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipalities==
Cities, towns, counties and other [[local government in Canada]] may use [[zoning]] and other [[bylaws]] to restrict the demolition of individual historic buildings or districts.  They may maintain a municipal heritage register, such as [[Edmonton]]'s "Register of Historic Resources in Edmonton".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmonton.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_284_220_0_43/http%3B/CMSServer/COEWeb/infrastructure+planning+and+building/Historic+Resources/ City of Edmonton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Vancouver]] uses a traditional heritage register&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/planning/heritage/Fact8.htm Vancouver.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; and a new system called a [[density bank]], under which developers are rewarded for preserving and restoring heritage buildings by being awarded exceptions to restrictions (usually height restrictions) on other sites they own.&lt;ref&gt;http://cityhallwatch.wordpress.com/special-topics/density-bank-transfers-and-more/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Montreal]], one of Canada's oldest and most historically rich cities, the [[Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal]] advises the municipal government on matters related to heritage building preservation.&lt;ref name="Conseil du patrimoine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=2981,3122714&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=Le Conseil du patrimoine de Montréal|publisher=City of Montreal|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of non-governmental groups have worked to preserve Montreal historic buildings since the 1970s: [[Save Montreal]], co-founded by [[Michael Fish (architect)|Michael Fish]] in 1974, and [[Heritage Montreal]], founded by [[Phyllis Lambert]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Gravenor, Kristian (October 23, 2003).

== Government approach to policy ==
Two of the primary conservation tools in Canada are the [[Canadian Register of Historic Places]] and the ''[[Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]]''. This document  was the result of a major collaborative effort among federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments, heritage conservation professionals, heritage developers and many individual Canadians.  A pan–Canadian collaboration, it is intended to reinforce the development of a culture of conservation in Canada, which will continue to find a unique expression in each of the jurisdictions and regions of the country.  In the document, conservation approaches are broken down into three categories: Preservation, Rehabilitation, and Restoration.  As published in the ''[[Standards and Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]]'', these conservation approaches are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=terms&gt;[http://www.historicplaces.ca/nor-sta/request.aspx?page=sec2/page2b_e Standards and Guidelines - Definitions of Some Key Terms], ''Canada's Historic Places''. Retrieved 30 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Preservation:''' the action or process of protecting, maintaining, and/or stabilizing the existing materials, form, and integrity of a historic place or of an individual component, while protecting its heritage value. Preservation can include both short-term and interim measures to protect or stabilize the place, as well as long-term actions to retard deterioration or prevent damage so that the place can be kept serviceable through routine maintenance and minimal repair, rather than extensive replacement and new construction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Rehabilitation:''' the action or process of making possible a continuing or compatible contemporary use of a historic place or an individual component, through repair, alterations, and/ or additions, while protecting its heritage value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Restoration:''' the action or process of accurately revealing, recovering or representing the state of a historic place or of an individual component, as it appeared at a particular period in its history, while protecting its heritage value.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
When a school district fails its legal obligations to students with disabilities, the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] permits the parent to seek a hearing before an impartial hearing officer.  A school district may also request a due process hearing against parents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-698.ZO.html/ Schaffer v Weast], Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49 (2005) (Justice O’Connor, Opinion of the Court).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   Hearings are rare.  Only 5 in 10,000 students seek a hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03897.pdf/ GAO 03-0897], United States Government Accountability Office.  “GAO Report 03-897,” September 2003.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Expert witnesses have a critical role at due process hearings.  They provide the technical expertise about the student’s disability and the care and educational services the student needs in the classroom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; 

In 1986, Congress passed the Handicapped Children’s Protection Act, allowing parents who prevail in due process hearings and litigation under the IDEA to recover their legal fees and costs.  The language was modeled on similar provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-5k).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/94-970.pdf/ CRS Report 2008], Henry Cohen.  “Awards of Attorneys' Fees by Federal Courts and Federal Agencies” (Congressional Research Service), June 20, 2008.  Retrieved 18 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress’ Joint Conference Committee Report explained that the courts would have discretion to award attorneys’ fees as part of the costs of litigation.  It noted that “The conferees intend that the term ‘attorneys’ fees as part of the costs’ include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian’s case in the action or proceeding.”&lt;ref&gt;132 Congressional Record 16823-25 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;  The statute also directed the GAO to study the costs to parents, including costs of “attorneys and
consultants” in IDEA proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-18.ZD.html/ Murphy J. Souter Opinion] Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 (2006) (Justice Souter, Dissent) (quoting Handicapped Children’s Protection Act, Public Law 99-372, Section 4(b)(3), 100 Stat. 796, 797–98 (1986)).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006, however, the Supreme Court decided the case of [[Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy]].  The Court ruled that because the statutory text of the IDEA did not explicitly state that expert witness fees were covered, parents could not recover them.  The Court reasoned that because the IDEA was enacted under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, the law must “unambiguously” give notice in its statutory text that parents could recover fees.  This meant Congress had to declare in the body of the statute that parents could recover expert witness fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-18.ZO.html/ Murphy Majority Opinion] Arlington Central School District v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291 (2006) (Justice Alito, Opinion of the Court).  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will amend the statutory text of the IDEA to permit recovery of expert witness fees. Until Congress does, parents must pay their own expert witness fee expenses, even when they prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autcom.org/pdf/briefing-memo-idea-fairness.pdf Analysis IDEA Fairness Act] Autism National Committee.  Analysis, IDEA Fairness Restoration Act.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the Bill==

The IDEA permits parents who prevail in IDEA cases to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/20/1415.html/ 20 USC 1415] 20 United States Code 1415(i)(3)(B).&lt;/ref&gt;  The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will enable them to also recover the reasonable costs of expert witnesses.  It will amend Section 615(i)(3) of the IDEA by adding the following at the end, “Inclusion of expert witness fees and other expenses as attorneys' fees. In this paragraph, the term ‘attorneys' fees’ shall include the fees of expert witnesses, including the reasonable costs of any test or evaluation necessary for the preparation of the parent or guardian's case in the action or proceeding.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
Parents can recover expert witness fees only when they prevail, and the school system has been found, after an impartial hearing, to have wrongfully denied a child an appropriate education as defined in IDEA. fees.  Parents cannot recover fees if they do not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=E2419&amp;dbname=2007_record/ Cong Rec 2007], Congressman Chris Van Hollen.  “Introduction of the IDEA Fairness Restoration Act,” Congressional Record, November 14, 2007.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill will align the IDEA with other civil rights statutes that permit recovery of expert witness fees, including Title VII,&lt;ref&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21/ Title VII] 42 United States Code 2000e-5(k).&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12205-/ ADA] 42 United States Code 12205.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several federal laws permit recovery of expert witness fees, including Voting Rights Act of 1965, Consumer Product Safety Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud Abuse and Prevention Act, Endangered Species Act, the Patent and Copyright Acts, PROTECT Act, Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, Presidential and Executive Office Accountability Act, and the Whistleblower Protections for Contractor Employees of Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Act.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Statement of Senator Harkin on introduction==
When Senator Harkin introduced the bill, he explained the reasons for enactment. He said, “This critical legislation will remove the financial barrier that families, especially low- and middle-income families, face as they pursue their children's rights to the free, appropriate public education they deserve and are entitled to under the Fourteenth Amendment...There are . . .times when schools have not fulfilled their responsibilities to provide an appropriate education. In these cases, IDEA provides parents the right to challenge the schools through mediation and due process. To make their argument, families often need access to expert witnesses who can assess the student's needs and testify about whether the current IEP meets those needs. These expert witnesses are a resource that many families cannot afford, but without access to them, families may be unable to make their case. ”&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=S1834&amp;dbname=2011_record/ Cong Rec 2011]  Senator Tom Harkin,   Congressional Record, March 17, 2011.  Retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2002 study found that more than 1/3 of children with disabilities lived in households with incomes of $25,000 or less, compared to 24% of the general population, and 2/3 of children with disabilities lived in families that earned less than $50,000 a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seels.net/designdocs/SEELS_Children_We_Serve_Report.pdf.

'''The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED)''' is one of the ten [[research]] institutes of the Faculty of Science of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]. IBED employs more than 100 researchers, with PhD students and Postdocs forming a majority, and 30 supporting staff. The total annual budget is around 10 m€, of which more than 40 per cent comes from external grants and contracts.  The main output consist of publications in peer reviewed journals and books (on average 220 per year). Each year around 15 PhD students defend their thesis and obtain their degree from the Universiteit van Amsterdam. The institute is managed by a general director appointed by the Dean of the Faculty for a period of five years, assisted by a business manager.

==Mission statement==

The mission of the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is to increase our insights in the functioning and [[biodiversity]] of [[ecosystems]] in all their complexity. Knowledge of the interactions between living [[organisms]] and processes in their physical and chemical environment is essential for a better understanding of the dynamics of ecosystems at different temporal and spatial scales.

==Organization of IBED Research==

IBED research is organized in the following three themes:

===Theme I: Biodiversity and Evolution===
The main question of Theme I research is how patterns in biodiversity can be explained from underlying processes: [[speciation]] and [[extinction]], dispersal and the (dis)appearance of [[geographical]] barriers, [[reproductive isolation]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] of taxa. Modern reconstructions of the history of life on earth rely heavily on analyses of [[DNA]] data that contain the footprints of the past. Research related to human-made effects on biodiversity includes the identification of endangered biodiversity hotspots affected by global change, potential risks of an escape of transgenes from crops to wild [[species]], and the consequences of [[habitat fragmentation]] for the viability and [[genetic diversity]] of [[populations]] and species.

===Theme II: Geo-ecology===
Research in Theme II concentrates on the physical and [[chemical]] properties of [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]], and how these affect the [[living organisms]] in an [[ecosystem]]. The spatial and temporal scale ranges from fluxes at the [[molecular]] level to the reconstruction of [[Quaternary]] [[climate change]] in different continents. Research related to human effects on ecosystems includes the fate of chemical [[pollutants]] in the system, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestering, [[nutrient]] fluxes and [[soil fertility]] and the effects of [[land use]] on [[erosion]] and [[desertification]].

===Theme III: Community Dynamics===
Research in Theme III aims to understand the dynamics of natural communities given the diversity and behaviour of the organisms present in the system. Individual variation - for instance in [[Prenatal development (biology)|developmental stage]] or in [[Genetics|genetic]] response - can have a major impact on the stability of complex [[biological systems]]. The research of Theme III has many applications: control of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[Plague (disease)|plagues]], prevention of toxic [[algal blooms]], managing fish populations by harvesting and restocking, and control of [[turbidity]] in [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] systems.

==Organization of IBED Education==
IBED is closely involved in several [[BSc]] and [[MSc]] programmes of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]. Especially the MSc programmes that are taught in English are highly integrated within the research of IBED.

==Notable staff==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3111">The '''Institute of Jewish Affairs''' (IJA) was founded in February 1941 as a research institute to provide analysis of political, legal and economic issues affecting Jewish life.

==History==
The Institute of Jewish Affairs was launched and sponsored by the [[World Jewish Congress]] (WJC) and the [[American Jewish Congress]]. IJA’s headquarters were situated in [[New York City]] until 1965 when the institution relocated to [[London]]. In 1994 it was reestablished in London as [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Troen, Selwyn Illan (1999) “Jewish Centers and Peripheries: Europe Between America and Israel Fifty Years After World War II,” Transaction Publishers, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute’s founder Dr [[Jacob Robinson]] argued that Jewish leaders, struggling for the interests of the Jewry after [[World War I]], “were hampered by the lack of up-to-date information on the situation of the Jews and no less by the lack of research into relevant legal and political options.”&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, Cohen (2010 a). "Dr. Jacob Robinson, the Institute of Jewish Affairs and the Elusive Jewish voice in Nuremberg," David Bankier and Dan Michman (eds.), Holocaust and Justice: representation and Historiography of the Holocaust in Post-War Trials, Yad Vashem and Berghahn Books, Jerusalem, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The IJA was established to bridge the gap. The Institute’s research focused on the analysis of the political, legal and economic aspects of Jewish life since [[World War I]]. Their reports examined a number of topics including: the situation of Jewish communities in various countries, [[anti-Semitism]], human rights related to minorities and migration, and the [[Holocaust]] and its aftermath.  The organization was also involved in formulating a postwar policy to secure Jewish rights and freedom internationally.

Dr [[Jacob Robinson]], IJA’s founder, served as its first director (1941–1947). He was succeeded by [[Nehemiah Robinson]] (1947–1964) and [[Oscar Karbach]] (1964–1973).&lt;ref name="AJA"&gt;American Jewish Archives (2002) A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982 (bulk 1940-1980).

Accessed on-line at: http://americanjewisharchives.org/collections/ms0361/ms0361.html#seriesC on 8.8.2014&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1940s, the organization, together with WJC’s Political Department, was engaged in the preparation of reports submitted to the [[United Nations]] and other organizations.&lt;ref name="AJA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13267">The '''International Association of Applied Linguistics''' ({{lang-fr|Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquée}}), or '''AILA''', was formed in 1964 as an association of various national organizations for [[applied linguistics]]. AILA has more than 8,000 members in more than 35 different applied linguistics associations around the world.&lt;ref name="Ayoun2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dalila Ayoun|title=French Applied Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkGhsJczLaAC&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=3 February 2013|year=2007|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-90-272-1972-5|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; AILA continues to grow, working with existing and emerging regional networks, such as AILA East Asia, AILA Europe, AILA Arabia, and AILA Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perrin |first1=Daniel |title=AILA President message |url=https://aila.info/about/messages/ |website=aila.info |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most high-profile activity is the World Congress of Applied Linguistics, which takes place once every three years. It also has two publications, ''AILA News'', a newsletter, and the ''AILA Review'', an academic journal.

== History ==
AILA was founded in 1964 at an international colloquium at the [[University of Nancy]], [[France]]. Its founding had been preceded by two years of preparation,&lt;ref name="Byram2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michaël Byram|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Language Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PirCWxMpAHkC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=4 February 2013|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-12085-2|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which two central figures were the French linguists [[Antoine Culioli]] and Guy Capelle.&lt;ref name="Ayoun2007" /&gt; As part of this preparation, the association had published the first issue of its official journal, the ''International Review of Applied Linguistics'', in 1963.&lt;ref name="Berns2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berns|first=Margie|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUMqGSbeEXAC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=3 February 2013|date=20 March 2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-08-096503-1|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1969, the association had gained affiliate organizations in the form of national associations, centers for applied linguistics, and applied linguistics working groups, in a total of 18 different countries. In this year, the association held its second meeting, this time sponsored by the [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]].&lt;ref name="Berns2010" /&gt;

== Activities ==
'''World Congress of Applied Linguistics'''
AILA’s most high-profile activity is the World Congress of Applied Linguistics, an international conference hosted by one of the affiliate national associations every three years. The one exception to the three-year pattern was the first World Congress in Nancy, France, as there was a five-year gap between that and the second World Congress in Cambridge, England.&lt;ref name="Spolsky1999"/&gt;

== Publications ==
AILA has two main publications, ''AILA News'' and the ''AILA Review''.&lt;ref name="Spolsky1999"/&gt; ''AILA News'' is a newsletter, published three times a year, and the ''AILA Review'' is a journal, published once a year and edited by guest editors.&lt;ref name="Byram2000" /&gt; Each edition of the ''AILA Review'' either contains collections of papers on a particular topic, or a collection of papers from one of the World Congresses. In addition to these two publications, AILA also works with the [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]], the [[American Association for Applied Linguistics]], and [[Oxford University Press]] to publish the journal ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]''.&lt;ref name="Spolsky1999"/&gt;

== Governance ==
Decisions in the association are made by the executive board and the international committee. The executive board makes recommendations to the international committee, on which all the national affiliated associations of applied linguistics can vote. These votes take place once a year, at different sites around the world.&lt;ref name="Spolsky1999"/&gt;

The executive board has eleven posts, seven of which are fixed roles. These are the president, a past president, the treasurer, the secretary general, the research networks coordinator and the publications coordinator. The remaining four posts do not have a fixed role, and their holders are known as ''members at large''. Members of the board cover their own expenses.&lt;ref name="AILAOrganization"&gt;{{cite web|title=Organization|url=http://www.aila.info/about/organization.html|publisher=International Association of Applied Linguistics|accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities''' is an honorary [[lecture series]] established in 1972 by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH).  According to the NEH, the Lecture is "the highest honor the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the [[humanities]]."&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture Jefferson Lecture] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Jefferson Lecture==
The Jefferson Lecturer is selected each year by the National Council on the Humanities, the 26-member citizen advisory board of the NEH.   The honoree delivers a lecture in [[Washington, D.C.]], generally in conjunction with the spring meeting of the Council, and receives an honorarium of $10,000.  The stated purpose of the honor is to recognize "an individual who has made significant scholarly contributions in the humanities and who has the ability to communicate the knowledge and wisdom of the humanities in a broadly appealing way."&lt;ref name="jefflect" /&gt;

The first Jefferson Lecturer, in 1972, was [[Lionel Trilling]].  He spoke on "Mind in the Modern World." Among other things, Trilling suggested that [[humanism]] had become the basis for social improvement, rather than science and the [[scientific method]] as has been predicted by [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Lectures' namesake.&lt;ref name="Krebs"&gt;Alvin Krebs and [[Robert McG. Thomas]], [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EED91738F931A25756C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print "Notes on People; Jeffersonian Theory Gets New Lease on Life,"] ''New York Times'', May 12, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten years later, [[Gerald Holton]], the first scientist invited to deliver the lecture, drew attention for responding to Trilling, proposing that Jefferson's vision of science as a force for social improvement was still viable, opining that there had been a "relocation of the center of gravity" of scientific inquiry toward solving society's important problems,&lt;ref name="Krebs"/&gt;  and cautioning that science education had to be improved dramatically or only a small "technological elite" would be equipped to take part in self-government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article.aspx?ref=226614 "Holton, in Jefferson Lecture, Criticizes Science Education,"] ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'', May 15, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection of the 2000 Jefferson Lecturer led to a spate of controversy.  The initial selection was President [[Bill Clinton]].  [[William R. Ferris]], chairman of the NEH, said that his intent was to establish a new tradition for every President to deliver a Jefferson Lecture during his or her presidency, and that this was consistent with the NEH's broader effort to increase public awareness of the humanities.  However, some scholars and political opponents objected that the choice of Clinton represented an inappropriate and unprecedented politicization of the NEH. The heads of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] and the National Humanities Alliance expressed concerns about introducing political considerations into the selection, while [[William J. Bennett]], a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and former chairman of the NEH under President [[Ronald Reagan]], charged that the proposal was an example of how Clinton had "corrupted all of those around him."&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Molotsky, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE7D91F3CF932A1575AC0A96F958260 "Choice of Clinton to Give Humanities Lecture Meets Resistance," ] ''[[New York Times]]'', September 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of the controversy, President Clinton declined the honor; a [[White House]] spokesperson said the President "didn't want the work of the National Endowment for the Humanities to be called into question."&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E3DC173FF931A1575AC0A96F958260 "National News Briefs; Clinton Declines Offer To Give Scholarly Talk,"] ''[[New York Times]]'', September 22, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately the 2000 honor went to historian [[James M. McPherson]], whose lecture turned out to be very popular. Subsequently, the NEH revised the criteria for the award to place more emphasis on speaking skills and public appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Southwick, [http://chronicle.com/free/v47/i06/06a03001.htm "NEH Wants Jefferson Lectures to Have More Public Appeal,"] ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'',  October 6, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next Jefferson Lecture, by playwright [[Arthur Miller]], again led to attacks from conservatives&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Craig, "Arthur Miller's Jefferson Lecture Stirs Controversy," in [http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/ncc.html "Capital Commentary"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122153656/http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2001may/ncc.html |date=2008-11-22 }}, ''OAH Newsletter'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[published by &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Organization of American Historians]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Jay Nordlinger]], who called it "a disgrace,"&lt;ref&gt;Jay Nordlinger, [http://www.nationalreview.com/impromptus/impromptus042202.asp "Back to Plessy, Easter with Fidel, Miller’s new tale, &amp;c."] ''[[National Review]]'', April 22, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Will]], who did not like the political content of Miller's lecture and argued that Miller was not legitimately a "scholar."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Will]], [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/will041001.asp  "Enduring Arthur Miller: Oh, the Humanities!"]  ''[[Jewish World Review]]'', April 10, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent Jefferson Lecturers have included journalist/author [[Tom Wolfe]];&lt;ref&gt;David Epstein, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/05/11/wolfe "A Speech in Full,"] ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', May 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Straussian]] conservative political philosopher [[Harvey Mansfield]];&lt;ref&gt;Philip Kennicott, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/08/AR2007050802282.html "A Strauss Primer, With Glossy Mansfield Finish,"] ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 9, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt; and novelist [[John Updike]], who, in a nod to the NEH's [http://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ ''Picturing America''] arts initiative, devoted his 2008 lecture to the subject of [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Howard, [http://chronicle.com/news/article/4541/in-jefferson-lecture-updike-says-american-art-is-known-by-its-insecurity "In Jefferson Lecture, Updike Says American Art Is Known by Its Insecurity,"] ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay Tolson,[https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2008/05/23/john-updike-on-american-art.html "John Updike on American Art,"] ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 2009 lecture, [[bioethicist]] and self-described "[[humanism|humanist]]" [[Leon Kass]] expressed his view that science has become separated from its humanistic origins, and the humanities have lost their connection to metaphysical and theological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Serena Golden, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/05/22/kass "Tough Love for the Humanities"], ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', May 22, 2009 (retrieved May 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the NEH went in a different direction, selecting film director [[Martin Scorsese]].  He was the first filmmaker chosen for the honor, and he spoke on "the evolution of his films, the art of storytelling, and the inspiration he draws from the humanities".&lt;ref&gt;Dave Itzkoff, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/hes-talking-to-you-scorsese-to-give-jefferson-lecture-for-national-endowment-for-the-humanities/ "He’s Talking to You: Scorsese to Give Jefferson Lecture for National Endowment for the Humanities"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the Jefferson Lecturer was author [[Walter Isaacson]],&lt;ref name="Nola2014"&gt;Chris Waddington, [http://www.nola.com/celebrities/index.ssf/2014/01/best-selling_biographer_walter.html "Best-selling biographer Walter Isaacson will deliver prestigious Jefferson Lecture in 2014"], ''[[Times-Picayune]]'', January 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2015 honoree was playwright and actress [[Anna Deavere Smith]].&lt;ref name="Deveare Smith NYT"&gt;Jennifer Schuessler, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/anna-deavere-smith-to-deliver-jefferson-lecture/?_r=0 "Anna Deavere Smith to Deliver Jefferson Lecture"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the NEH's celebration of its fiftieth anniversary in 2016, it selected documentarian [[Ken Burns]] to deliver the lecture.&lt;ref name="BurnsNYT"/&gt;  The 2017 lecturer is [[University of Chicago]] philosophy and law professor [[Martha Nussbaum]], who delivered her lecture, entitled "Powerlessness and the Politics of Blame", on May 1, 2017.&lt;ref name="NussbaumIHE"/&gt;

==Publications based on Jefferson Lectures==
A number of the Jefferson Lectures have led to books, including Holton's ''The Advancement of Science, and Its Burdens'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Holton]], ''The Advancement of Science, and Its Burdens: The Jefferson Lecture and Other Essays'' (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press 1986), {{ISBN|0-521-27243-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hope Franklin]]'s ''Racial Equality in America'',&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hope Franklin]], ''Racial Equality in America'' (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1993), {{ISBN|0-8262-0912-2}} .&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Louis Gates]]' ''The Trials of Phillis Wheatley''&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates]], ''The Trials of Phillis Wheatley: America's First Black Poet and Her Encounters with the Founding Fathers'' (Basic Civitas Books, 2003), {{ISBN|0-465-02729-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jaroslav Pelikan]]'s ''The Vindication of Tradition''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaroslav Pelikan]], ''The Vindication of Tradition: The 1983 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986), {{ISBN|0-300-03638-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Updike's 2008 lecture was included in his posthumous 2012 collection ''Always Looking''.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Dixon, [http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/a-critic-keeping-it-surreal-219248.html "A critic keeping it surreal"], ''[[Irish Examiner]]'', January 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''kerb crawler''' (or [[curb (road)|curb]] crawler) is a person who drives around areas known for [[street prostitution]] [[soliciting]] [[prostitution|prostitutes]] for [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. The act is known as "kerb crawling" because the person will typically drive very slowly along the [[kerb (road)|kerbside]]. 

Where prostitution is illegal, kerb crawlers are widely regarded as a [[public nuisance]]: they help keep street prostitutes in business in [[red-light district]]s and often [[solicit]] [[pedestrian]]s who are not prostitutes for sex. As a result, kerb-crawling is illegal in many [[jurisdiction]]s.

[[Sting operation]]s in which [[undercover police]] wait for kerb crawlers to [[proposition]] them are a common method for tackling kerb crawling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Amelia |title=The policewomen who pose as prostitutes to trap kerb crawlers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/15/ukcrime.gender |website=The Guardian |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en |date=15 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerb crawling is illegal in [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution laws around the world |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/128029/at-a-glance-prostitution-laws/ |website=Global News |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en |date=20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name="cps" /&gt; the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=US Federal and State Prostitution Laws and Related Punishments |url=https://prostitution.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000119 |website=prostitution.procon.org |publisher=ProCon.org |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Ian |title=Research Projects |url=https://research.northumbria.ac.uk/urbanfutures/research-projects/prostitution |website=Imagining Urban Futures |accessdate=29 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution in India and it's legal analysis |url=http://www.lawyersclubindia.com/articles/Prostitution-in-India-and-it-s-legal-analysis--9151.asp |website=Lawyers Club India |accessdate=29 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police may also collect [[Vehicle registration plate|licence-plate number]]s of vehicles that appear to be kerb crawling and may contact their [[Vehicle registration|registered]] owners. 

Following the recommendations of the 1984 [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]] report ''Prostitution on the Street'', the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Sexual Offences Act 1985]] introduced an offence of kerb crawling to persistently solicit women for the purposes of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual Offences Act 1985 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/44/pdfs/ukpga_19850044_en.pdf |website=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=29 November 2018 |quote=Section 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vulnerable"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hubbard |first1=Phil |last2=Scoular |first2=Jane |editor1-last=Canter |editor1-first=D |editor2-last=Ioannou |editor2-first=M |editor3-last=Youngs |editor3-first=D |title=Safer Sex in the City: The Experience and Management of Street Prostitution |date=2010 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=0754626156 |pages=135-153 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1057567710373119 |language=en |chapter=Making the vulnerable more vulnerable?

==John schools==
{{main|John school}}
A John school is a form of educational intervention aimed at clients of [[prostitution|prostitutes]], who are informally known as 'johns' in North America. John schools are usually a [[diversion program]] for people - almost exclusively men - arrested for [[solicitation|soliciting]] the services of a prostitute, or another related offense. This often acts as an alternative to criminal prosecutions. However, in some jurisdictions, courts may sentence men to attend a john school program as a condition of probation.

Whether the John school is a [[diversion program]] or a sentencing condition, the client will often pay a fee to enroll. The fee frequently covers the cost of the program and sometimes contributes to programs to aid prostitutes, or community projects within [[red light districts]]. John schools often last for one day. Their focus is often on the experiences and harms of prostitution, such as the violence associated with [[prostitution]], the [[sexually transmitted disease]] risks of prostitution, and the effects of prostitution on families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perc.ca/PEN/1998-11/s-boddy.html "John School Helps Break the Cycle of Prostitution"] by Sharon Boddy, ''Peace and Environment News'', November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519,hunter,63812,5.html "School for Johns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918062417/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519%2Chunter%2C63812%2C5.html |date=2007-09-18 }} by Aina Hunter, ''[[Village Voice]]'', May 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the provisions of the act there is to be a ‘Land Rights and Responsibilities Statement’, setting out the Scottish Government’s objectives for [[Land reform in Scotland|land reform]], a [[Scottish Land Commission]] is to take forward the land reform process, preparing a strategic plan, for the approval of Scottish ministers. One of the new land commissioners is to be a Tenant Farming Commissioner who must be neither an agricultural landlord nor a tenant but who is to be responsible for reviewing issues relating to [[tenant farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Mike|title=A Brief Guide to Land Reform in Scotland|url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf|publisher=Gillespie Macandrew LLP|accessdate=5 March 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further provision is the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] and extended by the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]], the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows [[crofting]] communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community rights to buy in Scotland – which is which, and what are they for?|url=http://www.brodies.com/node/8185|website=Brodies|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis. 

Other provisions of the act include new regulations to require persons who control land to be identified, with information obtained to appear in the Land Register of Scotland; the removal of sporting rights exemption from rates, which are to be re-valued; and further powers for [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] to control deer management. It also makes provision for notice and consultation where core paths are to be amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/18/pdfs/asp_20160018_en.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt''''' (Aeronautical Research Institute, '''LFA''', also known as the ''[[Hermann Göring]] Research Institute'')&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, John.  ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire:  History Press, 2013), p.43 caption.&lt;/ref&gt; was a secret [[Germany|German]] facility for [[airframe]], [[aircraft engine|aeroengine]], and aircraft weapons testing during the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.25-6, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Germany's "most advanced and extensive [aviation] research establishment,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; outside of the existing ''Erprobungsstelle'' network of military aviation evaluation facilities, themselves headquartered at [[Rechlin-Lärz Airfield|Rechlin]].

Located near [[Völkenrode]], on the western outskirts of [[Braunschweig]] (Brunswick), near what became the [[Inner German Border]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.25 and 40, and map p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a {{convert|1000|acre|ha|sing=on}} site begun in October 1935. The first wind tunnel was begun in November 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the sixty buildings, scattered around the site, did not exceed treetop height, and all were well-[[camouflage]]d,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the chance of them being detected by [[aerial reconnaissance]] and to avoid making them targets, as the wind tunnels of the ''[[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt]]'' (''DVL'') in [[Adlershof]] (near [[Berlin]]) or the [[:de:Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt|''Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt'']] (''AVA'', part of today's [[German Aerospace Centre|DLR agency]]) at the [[University of Göttingen]] were.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The buildings were in five groups.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute of Aerodynamics had five [[wind tunnel]]s, while the Institute of Gas Dynamics had its own high-speed tunnel; both were at the southern end of the campus.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; The static testing station of the Institute of Strength Properties was to the west;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.40-1.&lt;/ref&gt; the Institute of Engine Research, the east.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; Weapons research was done by the Institute of Kinematics in a {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on|}}-long tunnel in the northwest corner.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; These were accompanied by administration buildings, a [[Cafeteria|canteen]], a [[telephone exchange]], guard houses, generators, and other facilities.

To help reduce the risk of detection, there were no [[Rail transport|railway]] lines in, nor overhead power lines, nor any chimneys; and uniquely for an aviation research facility of its time in Germany, no runways, taxiways or hardstands for active aviation operations; just about all of the facilitiy's infrastructure needs were supplied underground from Braunschweig, including [[steam]] [[heating|heat]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, there were four hundred houses in Völkenrode for the 1,500 or so workers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each of the wind tunnels at ''LFA'' was given an "A" number. A1 had a circular nozzle {{convert|2.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter, producing a maximum speed of {{convert|123|mph|km/h kn|abbr=on}}; it entered service in 1937, the year after construction began on facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; A2 measured {{convert|4|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long and had a test section {{convert|2.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter (coated with [[Keratylene]] to keep the flow smooth),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; capable of generating test speeds (depending on the model's [[Scale (ratio)|scale]]) of between [[Mach number|Mach]] 1 and 1.2.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; It was driven by a pair of {{convert|600|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Direct current|DC]] [[electric motor|motor]]s, and fitted with [[Interferometry|interferometer]] and [[Turbulence|striation]] gear for study of flow patterns. Begun in 1937, it first ran in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; It did, however, suffer with problems of vibration,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; leading the research teams to rely on a [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Börsig]] [[Feuerlilie#Feuerlilie F-25|F25]] free-flight research rocket with models mounted in the nose.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--TV doc on Avro Arrow says the Avro team did the same; can anybody confirm?--&gt; The A3 tunnel, largest at the ''LFA'' site, had an {{convert|8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} test section with a maximum speed of {{convert|95|m/s|mph kn|abbr=on}} and a working length of {{convert|11|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, enough to accommodate a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]'s  fuselage.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt; It was powered by a pair of {{convert|6|MW|hp PS|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;  The A9 building housed a pair of supersonic wind tunnels, each driven by a {{convert|4|MW|hp PS|abbr=on}} motor, with a maximum speed of Mach 1.5, but a test section diameter of only {{convert|80|cm2|in2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with direct aerodynamic research, ''LFA'' did testing on materials (though not, apparently, of parts) and on aircraft engines.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.52-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The engine work included testing of [[turbine]] and turbine blade shapes, [[ceramic]] turbine blades, cooling of turbine blades (including liquid cooling), bearings, [[Detonation#In engines and firearms|detonation]], and several types of [[heat exchanger]]s, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The test centre assisted the [[BMW]] firm in developing the factory-produced forward [[cowling]] — which had the engine's [[oil cooler]] integrated into it from the beginning — for the Bavarian firm's [[BMW 801]] fourteen-cylinder radial engine used in many German Luftwaffe military aircraft, most importantly the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]]A;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.47-8.&lt;/ref&gt; trials indicated it was possible to reduce drag enough to save {{convert|150|-|200|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to maximize pressure build-up to assist cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also helped in development of the pioneering [[Argus As 014]] [[pulsejet]] used in the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]].  In collaboration with [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and ''DVL'' (Berlin-[[Adlershof]]), it also contributed to the development of the [[swept wing]] (what Germans called ''Pfeilflüge'', or "arrow wing").&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.47-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the engine projects worked on at ''LFA'' was a [[Swing-piston engine|toroidal]] (swing-piston) design by [[Otto Lutz]] of [[Büssing]], a concept akin to the [[Wankel engine|Wankel]]; work was also done by [[Junkers]] and [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

''LFA'' remained so secret, the Allied air forces never bombed it.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.42 and 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Postwar, [[Fedden Mission|the site was visited]] by a [[Ministry of Aircraft Production]] team led by [[Roy Fedden]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medicine Unboxed''' is a project arising from a view that good medicine demands more than scientific and technical expertise, and that it necessitates ethical judgment, an understanding of human experience, empathy, professionalism and wisdom.

==History==
Medicine Unboxed is a not-for-profit organisation that has held eight international conferences (Unboxing Medicine, 2009; Stories, Language and Medicine, 2010; Medicine and Values, 2011; Belief, 2012; Voice, 2013; Frontiers, 2014; Mortality, 2015; Wonder, 2016; MAPS, 2017) in [[Cheltenham]], UK. The aim of Medicine Unboxed is to explore "understanding medicine through the arts and humanities", and engage the public and front-line [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] staff with a view of medicine that is infused and elaborated by the humanities, with a view to promoting dialogue around the goals and values of medicine within society. Contributors to the conferences include artists, writers, the clergy, poets, philosophers, lawyers, linguists, musicians, theatre, ethicists, academics and doctors. 

Medicine Unboxed is curated by Dr. Sam Guglani, Consultant Oncologist at [[Gloucestershire Royal Hospital|Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], that supports the organisation along with the [[Wellcome Foundation]]. The Creative Director is [[Peter_James_Thomas|Peter Thomas]]. Its advisors are Dr. Sean Elyan and Dame Janet Trotter and its patrons are [[Jo Shapcott]] and [[Raymond Tallis]]. 

Medicine Unboxed has been widely reported in the medical press including ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/19/studying-arts-literature-doctors-humane-competent-mid-staffs{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[The Lancet]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61351-9 |title=Outside of the box |journal=The Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9686 |pages=282 |year=2009 |last1=Guglani |first1=Sam }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00773-4 |title=All or nothing? |journal=The Lancet |volume=386 |issue=10006 |pages=e34 |year=2015 |last1=Potter |first1=Christopher }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00771-0 |title=Words on the borders of the body |journal=The Lancet |volume=386 |issue=10006 |pages=1816 |year=2015 |last1=Gross |first1=Philip }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00545-0 |title=The given world |journal=The Lancet |volume=386 |issue=10004 |pages=1622 |year=2015 |last1=Guglani |first1=Samir }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Medical Journal]] Online&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.bmj.com/medical-humanities/2009/08/15/medicine-unboxed-conference-october-19th-2009/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lapidus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lapidus.org.uk/Nov10.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321120334/http://www.lapidus.org.uk/Nov10.php |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a move to a larger venue at the Parabola Arts Centre, [[Cheltenham]], the third event in the Medicine Unboxed series was '''Medicine and Values''', which took place on 15 October '''2011''' and included contributions by [[Lionel Shriver]], [[Jo Shapcott]], Revd.

'''Methanogens''' are microorganisms that produce [[methane]] as a [[metabolic]] byproduct in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] conditions. They are prokaryotic and belong to the domain of [[archaea]]. They are common in [[wetland]]s, where they are responsible for [[marsh gas]], and in the digestive tracts of animals such as [[ruminant]]s and [[human]]s, where they are responsible for the methane content of [[belching]] in ruminants and [[flatulence]] in humans.&lt;ref&gt;

==Physical description==

Methanogens are coccoid (spherical shaped) or bacilli (rod shaped). There are over 50 described species of methanogens, which do not form a [[monophyletic]] group, although all methanogens belong to [[Archaea]].  They are mostly [[anaerobic organism]]s that cannot function under aerobic conditions, but recently a species (''[[Candidatus]] [[Methanothrix paradoxum]]'') has been identified that can function in anoxic microsites within aerobic environments. They are very sensitive to the presence of [[oxygen]] even at trace level. Usually, they cannot sustain oxygen stress for a prolonged time. However, ''[[Methanosarcina barkeri]]'' is exceptional in possessing a [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD) [[enzyme]], and may survive longer than the others in the presence of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peters V |author2=Conrad R |date=1995 |title=Methanogenic and other strictly anaerobic bacteria in desert soil and other oxic sois |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1673–1676|pmid=16535011 |pmc=1388429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spacecenter.uark.edu/JillJabstract.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327135553/http://spacecenter.uark.edu/JillJabstract.doc |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some methanogens, called [[hydrogenotroph]]ic, use [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a source of carbon, and [[hydrogen]] as a [[reducing agent]].

The reduction of [[carbon dioxide]] into [[methane]] in the presence of [[hydrogen]] can be expressed as follows:

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reacted with the hydrogen to produce methane, which creates an [[electrochemical gradient]] across cell membrane, used to generate [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] through [[chemiosmosis]]. In contrast, [[plant]]s and [[algae]] use water as their [[reducing agent]].

Methanogens lack [[peptidoglycan]], a polymer that is found in the [[cell wall]]s of the [[Bacteria]] but not in those of Archaea. Some methanogens have a cell wall that is composed of [[pseudopeptidoglycan]]. Other methanogens do not, but have at least one [[paracrystalline]] array (S-layer) made up of [[protein]]s that fit together like a [[jigsaw puzzle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00495/abstract|title=Bergey's Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria|last=Boone|first=David R.|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9781118960608|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00495/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extreme living areas==
Methanogens play the vital ecological role in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic environments]] of removing excess hydrogen and fermentation products that have been produced by other forms of [[anaerobic respiration]]. Methanogens typically thrive in environments in which all [[electron acceptor]]s other than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (such as [[oxygen]], [[nitrate]],  ferric[[iron]] (Fe(III)), and [[sulfate]]) have been depleted.  In deep [[basalt]]ic rocks near the [[mid ocean ridge]]s, they can obtain their [[hydrogen]] from the [[Serpentinite#Serpentinite reactions|serpentinisation]] reaction of [[olivine]] as observed in the [[Lost City (hydrothermal field)|hydrothermal field of Lost City]].

The thermal breakdown of water and water [[radiolysis]] are other possible sources of hydrogen.

Methanogens are key agents of remineralization of [[organic carbon]] in [[continental margin]] sediments and other aquatic sediments with high rates of sedimentation and high sediment organic matter.  Under the correct conditions of pressure and temperature, biogenic methane can accumulate in massive deposits of [[methane clathrate]]s,&lt;ref name="Kvenvolden 1995"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kvenvolden| first= K.| date=1995| title= A review of the geochemistry of methane in natural gas hydrate| journal= Organic Geochemistry| volume=23| issue=11–12| pages=997–1008| doi= 10.1016/0146-6380(96)00002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which account for a significant fraction of organic carbon in continental margin sediments and represent a key reservoir of a potent greenhouse gas.&lt;ref name="Milkov 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milkov| first=Alexei V| date=2004| title= Global estimates of hydrate-bound gas in marine sediments: how much is really out there?| journal= Earth-Science Reviews| volume=66| issue=3–4| pages=183–197| doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2003.11.002| bibcode=2004ESRv...66..183M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanogens have been found in several extreme environments on Earth – buried under kilometres of ice in [[Greenland]] and living in hot, dry desert soil. They are known to be the most common archaebacteria in deep subterranean habitats. Live microbes making methane were found in a glacial ice core sample retrieved from about three kilometres under Greenland by researchers from the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. They also found a constant metabolism able to repair macromolecular damage, at temperatures of 145 to –40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.0507601102|title=Microbial origin of excess methane in glacial ice and implications for life on Mars|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=102|issue=51|pages=18292|year=2005|last1=Tung|first1=H.

Another study&lt;ref&gt;Icarus (vol. 178, p. 277)cs:Methanogen&lt;/ref&gt; has also discovered methanogens in a harsh environment on Earth. Researchers studied dozens of soil and vapour samples from five different desert environments in [[Utah]], [[Idaho]] and [[California]] in the [[United States]], and in [[Canada]] and [[Chile]]. Of these, five soil samples and three vapour samples from the vicinity of the [[Mars Desert Research Station]] in Utah were found to have signs of viable methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientistspace.com/article/dn8428-extreme-bugs-back-idea-of-life-on-mars.html Extreme bugs back idea of life on Mars]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have proposed that the presence of methane in the [[Mars|Martian]] atmosphere may be indicative of native methanogens on that planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/051220_science_tuesday.html|title=Crater Critters: Where Mars Microbes Might Lurk|work=Space.com|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely related to the methanogens are the anaerobic methane oxidizers, which utilize methane as a substrate in conjunction with the reduction of sulfate and nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1038/440878a | author=Thauer, R. K. |author2=Shima, S. |last-author-amp=yes | title=Biogeochemistry: Methane and microbes | journal = Nature | date = 2006 | volume = 440 | issue =  7086| pages=878–879 | pmid=16612369 |bibcode = 2006Natur.440..878T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most methanogens are [[autotrophic]] producers, but those that [[oxidize]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are classed as [[chemotroph]] instead.

==Comparative genomics and molecular signatures==

Comparative genomic analysis has led to the identification of 31 signature proteins which are specific for the methanogens (also known as ''Methanoarchaeota''). Most of these proteins are related to methanogenesis, and they could serve as potential molecular markers for the methanogens.&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gao B |author2=Gupta RS |date=2007 |title=Phylogenomic analysis of proteins that are distinctive of Archaea and its main subgroups and the origin of methanogenesis |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=8 |page=86 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-8-86 |pmid=17394648 |pmc=1852104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 10 proteins found in all methanogens which are shared by ''[[Archaeoglobus]]'', suggest that these two groups are related.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt; In phylogenetic trees, the methanogens are not monophyletic and they are generally split into three clades.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gribaldo S |author2=Brochier-Armanet C |title=The origin and evolution of Archaea: a state of the art |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |date=2006 |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=1007–1022 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1841 |pmid=16754611 |pmc=1578729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the unique shared presence of large numbers of proteins by all methanogens could be due to lateral gene transfers.&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

== Metabolism ==

=== Methane production ===
Methanogens are known to produce methane from substrates such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, acetate, formate, methanol and methylamines in a process called [[methanogenesis]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blaut|first=M.|date=1994|title=Metabolism of methanogens|journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|volume=66|issue=1–3|pages=187–208|issn=0003-6072|pmid=7747931|doi=10.1007/bf00871639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different methanogenic reactions are catalyzed by unique sets of [[enzyme]]s and [[coenzymes]]. While reaction mechanism and energetics vary between one reaction and another, all of these reactions contribute to net positive energy production by creating ion [[concentration gradient]]s that are used to drive ATP synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dybas|first=M|last2=Konisky|first2=J|date=1992|title=Energy transduction in the methanogen Methanococcus voltae is based on a sodium current.|url=|journal=J Bacteriol|volume=174 | issue = 17 |pages=5575–5583|via=|doi=10.1128/jb.174.17.5575-5583.1992|pmc=206501}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall reaction for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanogenesis is:

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + 4 H2 -&gt; CH4 + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt; (∆G˚’ = -134 kJ/mol CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)

Well-studied organisms that produce methane via H2/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanogenesis include ''Methanosarcina barkeri'', ''Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum'', and ''Methanobacterium wolfei''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karrasch|first=M.|last2=Börner|first2=G.|last3=Enssle|first3=M.|last4=Thauer|first4=R.

In the earliest stage of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methanogenesis, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binds to [[methylfuran]] (MF) and is reduced to formyl-MF. This [[Endergonic reaction|endergonic]] reductive process (∆G˚’= +16 kJ/mol) is dependent on the availability of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is catalyzed by the enzyme formyl-MF dehydrogenase.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;CO2 + H2 + MF -&gt; HCO-MF + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The formyl constituent of formyl-MF is then transferred to the coenzyme [[tetrahydromethanopterin]] (H4MPT) and is catalyzed by a soluble enzyme known as [[Formyltransferase|formyl transferase]].  This results in the formation of formyl-H4MPT.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

:&lt;chem&gt;HCO-MF + H4MPT -&gt; HCO-H4MPT + MF&lt;/chem&gt;

Formyl-H4MPT is subsequently reduced to methenyl-H4MPT. Methenyl-H4MPT then undergoes a one-step hydrolysis followed by a two-step reduction to methyl-H4MPT. The two-step reversible reduction is assisted by [[Coenzyme F420|coenzyme F&lt;sub&gt;420&lt;/sub&gt;]] whose hydride acceptor spontaneously oxidizes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Once oxidized, F&lt;sub&gt;420&lt;/sub&gt;’s electron supply is replenished by accepting electrons from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This step is catalyzed by methylene H4MPT dehydrogenase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zirngibl|first=C|date=February 1990|title=N5,N10-Methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has hydrogenase activity|url=|journal=Laboratorium fir Mikrobiologie|volume=261 | issue = 1 |pages=112–116|via=|doi=10.1016/0014-5793(90)80649-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wastewater treatment===
Methanogens are widely used in anaerobic digestors to treat wastewater as well as aqueous organic pollutants. Industries have selected methanogens for their ability to perform [[biomethanation]] during wastewater decomposition thereby rendering the process sustainable and cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;Appels, Lise; et.al. (2008). "Principles and potential of the anaerobic digestion of waste-activated sludge" Progress in Energy and Combustion Science. 34 (6): 755 -781. doi: 10.1016/j.pecs.2008.06.002&lt;/ref&gt;

Bio-decomposition in the anaerobic digester involves a four-staged cooperative action performed by different microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Thomas H; et.al. (2010). "Anaerobic Digestion: Process" Solid Waste Technology &amp; Management, Volume 1 &amp; 2. doi: 10.1002/9780470666883.ch372&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is the hydrolysis of insoluble polymerized organic matter by anaerobes such as Streptococcus and Enterobacterium.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Fayyaz Ali, et. al. (2014). “Microbial Ecology of Anaerobic Digesters: The Key Players of Anaerobiosis” ScientificWorldJournal. 3852369 (1). doi:10.1155/2014/183752&lt;/ref&gt; In the second stage, acidogens breakdown dissolved organic pollutants in wastewater to [[fatty acids]]. In the third stage, acetogens convert fatty acids to [[acetates]]. In the final stage, methanogens metabolize acetates to gaseous [[methane]]. The byproduct methane leaves the aqueous layer and serves as an energy source to power wastewater-processing within the digestor, thus generating a self-sustaining mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lettinga | first1 = G | year = 1995 | title = Anaerobic Digestion and Wastewater Treatment Systems | url = | journal = Antonie van Leeuwenhoek | volume = 67 | issue = 1| pages = 3–28 | doi = 10.1007/bf00872193 | pmid = 7741528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanogens also effectively decrease the concentration of organic matter in wastewater run-off and minimizes [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="doi_10.1016/j.procbio.2010.05.017"/&gt; For instance, agricultural wastewater, highly rich in organic material, has been a major cause of aquatic ecosystem degradation. The chemical imbalances can lead to severe ramifications such as [[eutrophication]]. Through anaerobic digestion, the purification of wastewater can prevent unexpected blooms in water systems as well as trap [[methanogenesis]] within digesters. This allocates biomethane for energy production and prevents a potent greenhouse gas, methane, from being released into the atmosphere.

The organic components of wastewater vary vastly. Chemical structures of the organic matter select for specific methanogens to perform anaerobic digestion. An example is the members of [[Methanosaeta]] genus dominate the digestion of palm oil mill effluent (POME) and brewery waste.&lt;ref name="doi_10.1016/j.procbio.2010.05.017"/&gt; Modernizing wastewater treatment systems to incorporate higher diversity of microorganisms to decrease organic content in treatment is under active research in the field of microbiological and chemical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Marihiro, Takashi., Sekiguchi, Yuji.

The '''National Art Honor Society''' was established in 1978 in the [[United States]] by the [[National Art Education Association]] for [[high school]] students grades 9-12 from the National Art Honor Society.&lt;ref name="arteducators"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arteducators.org/community/national-art-honor-societies/learn-more|title=Learn about the National Art Honor Society programs |publisher=National Art Education Association|accessdate=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAEA also offers a [[National Junior Art Honor Society]] for students in grades 6-8.

Its purpose is to assist student members to attain their highest potential in all forms of art, and to raise awareness of art education throughout the school and community.

Member students are eligible to apply to the Charles M. Robertson Memorial Scholarship, a special four-year scholarship to the [[Pratt Institute]]'s School of Art and Design in New York.

Members and their school art program are eligible for several awards and grant programs, encouraged to submit articles and art work for publication in the ''NAHS News'', published twice a year and is received by students as well as sponsors.  Students and their sponsors can attend the group's annual convention and receive professional publications for inclusion into the school's resource library.

'''Niklas Luhmann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|m|ən}}; {{IPA-de|ˈluːman|lang}}; December 8, 1927 – November 6, 1998) was a [[Germany|German]] [[sociologist]], philosopher of social science, and a prominent thinker in [[systems theory]], who is considered one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bechmann and Stehr, 'The Legacy of Niklas Luhmann' Society (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Luhmann was born in [[Lüneburg]], [[Prussia]], where his father's family had been running a [[brewery]] for several generations. After graduating from the Johanneum school in 1943, he was conscripted as a [[Luftwaffenhelfer]] in [[World War II]] and served for two years until, at the age of 17, he was taken [[prisoner of war]] by American troops in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;In an interview Luhmann once said: ''"... die Behandlung war –&amp;nbsp;gelinde gesagt&amp;nbsp;– nicht nach den Regeln der internationalen Konventionen".'' Source: Detlef Horster (1997), ''Niklas Luhmann'', München, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war Luhmann studied law at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]] from 1946 to 1949, when he obtained a law degree, and then began a career in Lüneburg's public administration. During a sabbatical in 1961, he went to [[Harvard]], where he met and studied under [[Talcott Parsons]], then the world's most influential social systems theorist.

In later years, Luhmann dismissed Parsons' theory, developing a rival approach of his own. Leaving the civil service in 1962, he lectured at the national [[Deutsche Hochschule für Verwaltungswissenschaften]] (University for Administrative Sciences) in [[Speyer]], Germany, until 1965, when he was offered a position at the [[Sozialforschungsstelle]] (Social Research Centre) of the [[University of Münster]], led by [[Helmut Schelsky]].
1965/66 he studied one semester of sociology at the University of Münster.

Two earlier books were retroactively accepted as a PhD thesis and [[habilitation]] at the University of Münster in 1966, qualifying him for a university professorship. In 1968/1969, he briefly served as a lecturer at [[Theodor Adorno]]'s former chair at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] and then was appointed full professor of sociology at the newly founded [[University of Bielefeld]], Germany (until 1993). He continued to publish after his retirement, when he finally found the time to complete his magnum opus, ''Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft'' (literally, "The Society of Society"), which was published in 1997, and translated subsequently in English, under the title "Theory of Society" (volume I in 2012 and volume II in 2013).

==Works==
Luhmann wrote prolifically, with more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles published on a variety of subjects, including law, economy, politics, art, religion, ecology, mass media, and love. While his theories have yet to make a major mark in American sociology, his theory is currently well known and popular in German sociology,&lt;ref name="(Roth 2011)"&gt;Roth, S. (2011) Les deux angleterres et le continent. Anglophone sociology as the guardian of Old European semantics, Journal of Sociocybernetics, Vol. 9, No. 1-2, available for [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2265350 download at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been rather intensively received in [[Japan]] and Eastern Europe, including [[Russia]]. His relatively low profile elsewhere is partly due to the fact that translating his work is a difficult task, since his writing presents a challenge even to readers of German, including many sociologists. (p. xxvii Social Systems 1995)

Much of Luhmann's work directly deals with the operations of the legal system and his autopoietic theory of law is regarded as one of the more influential contributions to the [[sociology of law]] and socio-legal studies.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N, ''A Sociological Theory of Law'' (1985) and ''Law As a Social System'', translated by Klaus A. Ziegert (Oxford University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Luhmann is probably best known to North Americans for his debate with the [[critical theory|critical theorist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] over the potential of [[social system]]s theory. Like his one-time mentor [[Talcott Parsons]], Luhmann is an advocate of "grand theory," although neither in the sense of philosophical foundationalism nor in the sense of "meta-narrative" as often invoked in the critical works of post-modernist writers. Rather, Luhmann's work tracks closer to complexity theory broadly speaking, in that it aims to address any aspect of social life within a universal theoretical framework - of which the diversity of subjects he wrote about is an indication. Luhmann's theory is sometimes dismissed as highly abstract and complex, particularly within the Anglophone world, whereas his work has had a more lasting influence on scholars from German-speaking countries, Scandinavia and Italy.&lt;ref name="(Roth 2011)"/&gt;

Luhmann himself described his theory as "labyrinth-like" or "non-linear" and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood "too quickly", which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings.&lt;ref&gt;"Niklas Luhmann: Unverständliche Wissenschaft: Probleme einer theorieeigenen Sprache, in: Luhmann, ''Soziologische Aufklärung 3: Soziales System, Gesellschaft, Organisation''. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag, 4th. ed. 2005, pp. 193-205, quote on p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems theory===
Luhmann's systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work.&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann (1975), "Systemtheorie, Evolutionstheorie und Kommunikationstheorie", in: ''Soziologische Gids'' 22 3. pp.154–168&lt;/ref&gt;
# Systems theory as societal theory
# Communication theory and
# Evolution theory
The core element of Luhmann's theory, pivots around the problem of the contingency of the meaning and thereby it becomes a theory of [[communication]]. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society.&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann. (1982). The World Society as a Social System. International Journal of General Systems, 8:3, 131-138.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[system]] is defined by a boundary between itself and its [[social environment|environment]], dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called "reduction of complexity".
The criterion according to which information is selected and processed is meaning (in German, ''Sinn''). Both social systems and psychic  systems (see below for an explanation of this distinction) operate by processing meaning.

Furthermore, each system has a distinctive identity that is constantly reproduced in its communication and depends on what is considered meaningful and what is not. If a system fails to maintain that identity, it ceases to exist as a system and dissolves back into the environment it emerged from. Luhmann called this process of reproduction from elements previously filtered from an over-complex environment [[autopoiesis]] (pronounced "auto-poy-E-sis"; literally: self-creation), using a term coined in [[cognitive biology]] by Chilean thinkers [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]]. Social systems are ''operationally closed'' in that while they use and rely on resources from their environment, those resources do not become part of the systems' operation. Both thought and digestion are important preconditions for communication, but neither appears in communication as such. Note, however, that Maturana argued very vocally that this appropriation of autopoietic theory was conceptually unsound, as it presupposes the autonomy of communications from actual persons. That is, by describing social systems as operationally closed networks of communications, Luhmann (according to Maturana) ignores the fact that communications presuppose human communicators. Autopoiesis only applies to networks of processes that reproduce themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varela, F., Maturana, H., &amp; Uribe, R.|title=Autopoiesis: The organization of living systems, its characterization and a model|journal=Biosystems|year=1974|volume=5|pages=187–196|doi=10.1016/0303-2647(74)90031-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but communications are reproduced by humans. For this reason, the analogy from biology to sociology does not, in this case, hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maturana, H., &amp; Poerkson, B.|title=From Being to Doing: The Origins of the Biology of Cognition|year=2004|publisher=Carl Auer International|isbn=3896704486|pages=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Luhmann explicitly stressed that he does not refer to a "society without humans", but to the fact that communication is autopoietic. Communication is made possible by human bodies and consciousness&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, pp.56.&lt;/ref&gt;, but this does not make communication operationally open. To "participate" in communication, one must be able to render one's thoughts and perceptions into elements of communication. This can only ever occur as a communicative operation (thoughts and perceptions cannot be directly transmitted) and must therefore satisfy internal system conditions that are specific to communication: intelligibility, reaching and addressee and gaining acceptance&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Social Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1995, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Luhmann likens the operation of autopoiesis (the filtering and processing of information from the environment) to a [[program (management)|program]], making a series of logical distinctions (in German, ''Unterscheidungen''). Here, Luhmann refers to the British mathematician [[G. Spencer-Brown]]'s logic of distinctions that Maturana and Varela had earlier identified as a model for the functioning of any cognitive process. The supreme criterion guiding the "self-creation" of any given system is a defining [[binary code]]. This binary code is not to be confused with the computers operation: Luhmann (following Spencer-Brown and [[Gregory Bateson]]) assumes that auto-referential systems are continuously confronted with the dilemma of disintegration/continuation. This dilemma is framed with an ever-changing set of available choices; every one of those potential choices can be the system's selection or not (a binary state, selected/rejected). The influence of Spencer-Brown's book, ''[[Laws of Form]]'', on Luhmann can hardly be overestimated.

Although Luhmann first developed his understanding of social systems theory under Parsons' influence, he soon moved away from the Parsonian concept. The most important difference is that Parsons framed systems as forms of [[Action theory (sociology)|action]], in accordance with the [[AGIL paradigm]]. Parsons' systems theory treats systems as [[Open system (systems theory)|operationally open]], and interactive through an [[Input/output|input and output schema]]. Influenced by [[second-order cybernetics]], Luhmann instead treats systems as [[autopoietic]] and [[Open_and_closed_systems_in_social_science#Sociology|operationally closed]]&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Social Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Introduction to Systems Theory''. Polity, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. Systems must continually construct themselves and their perspective of reality through processing the distinction between system and [[Environment (systems)|environment]], and self-reproduce themselves as the product of their own elements. Social systems are defined by Luhmann not as action but as [[Recursion|recursive]] communication. Modern society is defined as a world system consisting of the sum total of all communication happening at once&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, pp. 83-99.&lt;/ref&gt;, and individual function systems (such as the economy, politics, science, love, art, the media, etc.) are described as social subsystems which have "outdifferentiated" from the social system and achieved their own operational closure and autopoiesis&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 2''. Stanford University Press, 2013, pp. 65ff.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Another difference is that Parsons asks how certain subsystems contribute to the functioning of overall society. Luhmann starts with the  [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation of the systems]]  themselves out of a nondescript environment. While he does observe how certain systems fulfill functions that contribute to "society" as a whole, he dispenses with the assumption of ''a priori'' [[Collective consciousness|cultural or normative consensus]] or "complimentary purpose" which was common to Durkheim and Parsons' conceptualization of a social function&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;. For Luhmann, functional differentiation is a consequence of selective pressure under temporalized complexity, and it occurs as function systems independently establish their own ecological niches by performing a function&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, esp. pp. 336-343.&lt;/ref&gt;. Functions are therefore not the coordinated components of the organic social whole, but rather contingent and selective responses to reference problems which obey no higher principle of order and could have been responded to in other ways.

Finally, the systems' autopoietic closure is another fundamental difference from Parsons' concept. Each system works strictly according to its very own code and can observe other systems only by applying its code to their operations. For example, the code of the economy involves the application of the distinction between payment and non-payment. Other system operations appear within the economic field of references only insofar as this economic code can be applied to them. Hence, a political decision becomes an economic operation when it is observed as a government spending money or not. Likewise, a legal judgement may also be an economic operation when settlement of a contractual dispute obliges one party to pay for the goods or services they had acquired. The codes of the economy, politics and law operate autonomously, but their "interpenetration"&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Social Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1995, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; is evident when observing "events"&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 2''. Stanford University Press, 2013, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; which simultaneously involve the participation of more than one system.

One seemingly peculiar, but within the overall framework strictly logical, axiom of Luhmann's theory is the human being's position outside any social system, initially developed by Parsons. Consisting of "pure communicative actions" (a reference to [[Jürgen Habermas]]) any social system requires human consciousnesses (personal or psychical systems) as an obviously necessary, but nevertheless environmental resource. In Luhmann's terms, human beings are neither part of society nor of any specific systems, just as they are not part of a conversation. Luhmann himself once said concisely that he was "not interested in people". That is not to say that people were not a matter for Luhmann, but rather, the communicative actions of people are constituted (but not defined) by society, and society is constituted (but not defined) by the communicative actions of people: society is people's environment, and people are society's environment. Thus, sociology can explain how persons can change society; the influence of the environment (the people) on the system (the society), the so-called ''"structural coupling"''. In fact Luhmann himself replied to the relevant criticism by stating that "In fact the theory of autopoietic systems could bear the title ''Taking Individuals Seriously'', certainly more seriously than our humanistic tradition" (Niklas Luhmann, ''Operational Closure and Structural Coupling: The Differentiation of the Legal System'', Cardozo Law Review, vol. 13: 1422). This approach has attracted criticism from those who argue that Luhmann has at no point demonstrated the operational closure of social systems, or in fact that autopoietic social systems actually exist. He has instead taken this as a premise or presupposition, resulting in the logical need to exclude humans from social systems, which prevents the social systems view from accounting for the individual behavior, action, motives, or indeed existence of any individual person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autopoiesis in Organization: Theory and Practice|year=2009|publisher=Emerald|location=Bingley, UK|pages=111–129|author=Fuchs, C., &amp; Hofkirchner, W.|chapter=Autopoiesis and Critical Social Systems Theory. In Magalhães, R., Sanchez, R., (Eds.),}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luhmann was devoted to the ideal of non-normative science introduced to sociology in the early 20th century by [[Max Weber]] and later re-defined and defended against its critics by [[Karl Popper]]. However, in an academic environment that never strictly separated descriptive and normative theories of society, Luhmann's sociology has widely attracted criticism from various intellectuals, including [[Jürgen Habermas]].{{fact|date=March 2017}}

===Luhmann's reception===
Luhmann's systems theory is not without its critics; his definitions of "autopoietic" and "social system" differ from others.
At the same time his theory is being applied or used worldwide by sociologists and other scholars. It is often used in analyses dealing with [[Corporate Social Responsibility|corporate social responsibility]], organisational [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]], [[Governance|governance structures]] as well as with [[sociology of law]] and of course general [[sociology]].
===Miscellaneous===
Luhmann also appears as a character in [[Paul Wühr]]'s work of literature ''[[Das falsche Buch]]'', together with - among others - [[Ulrich Sonnemann]], [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]].

Luhmann owned a pub ("Pons") in his parents' house in his native town of [[Lüneburg]]. The house, which also contained his father's brewery, had been in his family's hands since 1857.

{{Literature}}
A '''novel''' is a relatively long work of [[narrative]] [[fiction]], normally in [[prose]], which is typically published as a [[book]].

The entire [[genre]] has been seen as having "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years",&lt;ref name="The True Story of the Novel"&gt;Margaret Anne Doody, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBYU6jyA3MUC&amp;pg=PA1 ''The True Story of the Novel'']. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1996, rept. 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;1. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with its origins in classical [[Classical Greece|Greece]] and [[Classical Rome|Rome]], in [[medieval]] and early [[Modern history|modern]] [[Chivalric romance|romance]], and in the tradition of the Italian renaissance [[novella]]. (Since the 18th century, the term "novella", or "novelle" in German, has been used in English and other European languages to describe a long [[short story]] or a short novel.)

Murasaki Shikibu's ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' (1010) has been described as the world's first novel. Spread of printed books in China led to the appearance of [[Four Great Classical Novels|classical Chinese novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). Parallel European developments occurred after the [[Spread of the printing press|invention of the printing press]]. [[Miguel de Cervantes]], author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (the first part of which was published in 1605), is frequently cited as the first significant European [[novelist]] of the [[modern era]].&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 1995"&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature''.  Kathleen Kuiper, ed. 1995. Merriam-Webster, Springfield, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Watt]], in ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957), suggested that the modern novel was born in the early 18th century.

[[Walter Scott]] made a distinction between the novel, in which (as he saw it) "events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society" and the '''romance''', which he defined as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.&amp;nbsp;129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;xxv. Romance should not be confused with [[Harlequin Romance]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, many such romances, including the [[Historical novel|historical romances]] of Scott,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning, pp.&amp;nbsp;xxv–xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''&lt;ref name="Moers, Ellen 1978"&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers''[1976] (London: The Women’s Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick] Robert McCrum, "The Hundred best novels: Moby Dick", ''The Observer'', Sunday 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a "kindred term". This sort of romance is in turn different from the [[genre fiction]] love romance or [[romance novel]]. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''."&lt;ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15"&gt;Doody (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining the genre==
[[File:Madame de Pompadour.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Madame de Pompadour]] spending her afternoon with a book ([[François Boucher]], 1756)]]
A novel is a long, fictional narrative which describes intimate human experiences. The novel in the [[modern era]] usually makes use of a literary prose style. The development of the prose novel at this time was encouraged by innovations in [[printing]], and the introduction of cheap paper in the 15th century.

The present English (and Spanish) word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''novella'' for "new", "news", or "short story of something new", itself from the [[Latin]] ''novella'', a singular noun use of the neuter plural of ''novellus'', diminutive of ''novus'', meaning "new".&lt;ref&gt;''Britannica Online Encyclopedia'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110453/novel] accessed 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most European languages use the word "romance" (as in French, Dutch, Russian, Slovene, [[Serbo-Croatian]], Romanian, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian "roman"; Finnish "romaani"; German "Roman"; Portuguese "romance" and Italian "romanzo") for extended narratives.
* A fictional narrative
[[Fiction]]ality is most commonly cited as distinguishing novels from [[historiography]]. However this can be a problematic criterion. Throughout the [[early modern period]] authors of historical narratives would often include inventions rooted in traditional beliefs in order to embellish a passage of text or add credibility to an opinion. Historians would also invent and compose speeches for didactic purposes. Novels can, on the other hand, depict the social, political and personal realities of a place and period with clarity and detail not found in works of history.
* Literary prose
While prose rather than verse became the standard of the modern novel, the ancestors of the modern European novel include verse epics in the [[Romance languages|Romance language]] of southern France, especially those by [[Chrétien de Troyes]] (late 12th century), and in [[Middle English]] ([[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s (c. 1343 – 1400) ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Doody (1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;18–3, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 19th century, fictional narratives in verse, such as [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1824), [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s ''[[Eugene Onegin|Yevgeniy Onegin]]'' (1833), and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856), competed with prose novels. [[Vikram Seth]]'s ''[[The Golden Gate (Vikram Seth novel)|The Golden Gate]]'' (1986), composed of 590 [[Onegin stanza]]s, is a more recent example of the verse novel.&lt;ref&gt;Doody (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Content: intimate experience
Both in 12th-century Japan and 15th-century Europe, prose fiction created intimate reading situations. On the other hand, verse epics, including the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]'', had been recited to a select audiences, though this was a more intimate experience than the performance of plays in theaters. A new world of individualistic fashion, personal views, intimate feelings, secret anxieties, "conduct", and "gallantry" spread with novels and the associated prose-romance.
* Length
The novel is today the longest genre of narrative prose fiction, followed by the [[novella]]. However, in the 17th century, critics saw the romance as of epic length and the novel as its short rival. A precise definition of the differences in length between these types of fiction, is, however, not possible.The requirement of length has been traditionally connected with the notion that a novel should encompass the "totality of life."&lt;ref&gt;[[György Lukács]] ''The Theory of the Novel. A historico-philosophical essay on the forms of great epic literature'' [first German edition 1920], transl. by Anna Bostock (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early novels==

[[File:Tosa Mitsuoki—Portrait of Murasaki Shikibu.jpg|thumb|Paper as the essential carrier: [[Murasaki Shikibu]] writing her ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' in the early 11th century, 17th-century depiction]]
Although early forms of the novel are to be found in a number of places, including [[classical Rome]], 10th– and 11th-century Japan, and [[Elizabethan England]], the European novel is often said to have begun with ''[[Don Quixote]]'' in 1605.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 1995" /&gt;

Early works of extended fictional prose, or novels, include works in [[Latin]] like the ''[[Satyricon]]'' by [[Petronius Arbiter|Petronius]] (c. 50 AD), and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' by [[Apuleius]] (c. 150 AD), works in [[Ancient Greek]] such as ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' by [[Longus]] (c. late second century AD), works in [[Sanskrit]] such as the 6th– or 7th-century ''[[Daśakumāracarita]]'' by [[Daṇḍin]], and in the 7th-century ''[[Kadambari]]'' by [[Banabhatta]], [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s 11th-century Japanese work ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', the 12th-century ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (or ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', the 17th-century Latin title) by [[Ibn Tufail]], who wrote in [[Arabic]], the 13th-century ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'' by [[Ibn al-Nafis]], another Arabic novelist, and ''[[Blanquerna]]'', written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] by [[Ramon Llull]] (1283), and the 14th-century Chinese ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Jeffrey|title=Longus: Daphnis and Chloe; Xenophon of Ephesus: Anthia and Habrocomes|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press: Loeb Classical Library|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0674996335|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murasaki Shikibu's ''[[Tale of Genji]]'' (1010) has been described as the world's first novel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/581365/The-Tale-of-Genji "The Tale of Genji"]  Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Japanese''. Reischauer, Edwin O. Belknap Press.  Cambridge, MA 1980. p.&amp;nbsp;49. {{ISBN|0674471784}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and shows essentially all the qualities for which [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]]'s novel ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'' (1678) has been praised: individuality of perception, an interest in character development, and psychological observation.&lt;ref&gt;''Identity in Asian Literature'' edited by Lisbeth Littrup. Richmond, Surrey: Curzon Press, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanization and the spread of printed books in [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) China led to the evolution of oral storytelling into fictional [[Four Great Classical Novels|novels]] by the [[Ming dynasty#Literature and arts|Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644). Parallel European developments did not occur until after the invention of the printing press by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1439, and the rise of the publishing industry over a century later allowed for similar opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/printing-press | title=Printing press &amp;#124; History &amp; Types}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, Ibn Tufail's ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'' and Ibn al-Nafis' ''Theologus Autodidactus'' are works of didactic philosophy and theology. In this sense, ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'' would be considered an early example of a [[philosophical novel]],&lt;ref name=Jon&gt;Jon Mcginnis, ''Classical Arabic Philosophy: An Anthology of Sources'', p.&amp;nbsp;284, [[Hackett Publishing Company]], {{ISBN missing}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Attar&gt;[[Samar Attar]], ''The Vital Roots of European Enlightenment: Ibn Tufayl's Influence on Modern Western Thought'', Lexington Books, {{ISBN missing}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Theologus Autodidactus'' would be considered an early theological novel.&lt;ref name=Meyerhof&gt;[[Muhsin Mahdi]] (1974), "''The Theologus Autodidactus of Ibn at-Nafis'' by Max Meyerhof, Joseph Schacht", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''94''' (2), pp.&amp;nbsp;232–34. {{doi|10.2307/600915}}. {{JSTOR|600915}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hayy ibn Yaqdhan'', with its story of a human outcast surviving on an island, is also likely to have influenced [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), because the work was available in an English edition in 1711.&lt;ref&gt;''The Improvement of Human Reason, exhibited in the life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan: written in Arabic above 500 Years ago, by Abu Jaafar Ebn Tophail'' [...] ''newly translated from the original Arabick, by Simon Ockley'' (London: W. Bray, 1711).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epic poetry]] exhibits some similarities with the novel, and the Western tradition of the novel reaches back into the field of verse epics, though again not in an unbroken tradition. The epics of Asia, such as the [[Sumer]]ian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' (1300–1000 BC), and [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' (400 BCE and 200 CE), and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (4th century BC) were as unknown in [[early modern Europe]] as was the [[Anglo-Saxon]] epic of ''[[Beowulf]]'' (c. 750–1000 AD), which was rediscovered in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Other non-European works, such as the [[Torah]], the [[Koran]], and the [[Bible]], are full of stories, and thus have also had a significant influence on the development of prose narratives, and therefore the novel. Then at the beginning of the 18th century, French prose translations brought Homer's works to a wider public, who accepted them as forerunners of the novel.

Classical Greek and Roman prose narratives&lt;ref name="Morgan &amp; Stoneman"&gt;John Robert Morgan, Richard Stoneman, ''Greek fiction: the Greek novel in context'' (Routledge, 1994), Gareth L. Schmeling, and Tim Whitmarsh (hrsg.) ''The Cambridge companion to the Greek and Roman novel'' (Cambridge University Press 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; included a didactic strand, with the philosopher [[Plato]]'s (c. 425 – c. 348 BC) dialogues; a satirical dimension with [[Petronius]]' ''[[Satyricon]]''; the incredible stories of [[Lucian of Samosata]]; and [[Lucius Apuleius]]' proto-[[picaresque]] ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', as well as the heroic romances of the Greeks [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]] and [[Longus]]. Longus is the author of the Greek novel, ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'' (2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="Morgan &amp; Stoneman" /&gt;

==Medieval period 1100–1500==

===Chivalric Romances===
{{Main|Chivalric romance}}
[[File:Chaucer Troilus frontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] reciting ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'': early-15th-century manuscript of the work at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]]]
Romance or chivalric romance is a type of [[narrative]] in [[prose]] or [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] popular in the aristocratic circles of [[High Middle Ages|High Medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]]. They were marvel-filled [[adventure]]s, often of a [[knight-errant]] with [[hero]]ic qualities, who undertakes a [[quest]], yet it is "the emphasis on heterosexual love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the ''[[chanson de geste]]'' and other kinds of [[epic poetry|epic]], which involve heroism."&lt;ref&gt;"Chivalric romance", in Chris Baldick, ed., ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In later romances, particularly those of French origin, there is a marked tendency to emphasize themes of [[courtly love]].

Originally, romance literature was written in [[Old French]], [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Occitan]], later, in [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[German language|German]]. During the early 13th century, romances were increasingly written as prose.

The shift from verse to prose dates from the early 13th century. The ''[[Lancelot-Grail|Prose Lancelot]]'' or ''Vulgate Cycle'' includes passages from that period. This collection indirectly led to [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' of the early 1470s. Prose became increasingly attractive because it enabled writers to associate popular stories with serious histories traditionally composed in prose, and could also be more easily translated.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Caxton]]'s preface to his 1485 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular literature also drew on themes of romance, but with [[Irony|ironic]], [[Satire|satiric]] or [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]] intent. Romances reworked [[legend]]s, [[fairy tale]]s, and history, but by about 1600 they were out of fashion, and [[Miguel de Cervantes]] famously [[burlesque]]d them in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605). Still, [[Medievalism|the modern image of medieval]] is more influenced by the romance than by any other medieval genre, and the word "medieval" evokes knights, distressed damsels, dragons, and such tropes.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Discarded Image]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;9 {{ISBN|0521477352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1800, the connotations of "romance" was modified with the development [[Gothic fiction]].

===The novella===
{{Main|Novella}}

The term "novel" originates from the production of short stories, or [[novella]] that remained part of a European oral culture of storytelling into the late 19th century. Fairy tales, jokes, and humorous stories designed to make a point in a conversation, and the [[exemplum]] a priest would insert in a sermon belong into this tradition. Written collections of such stories circulated in a wide range of products from practical compilations of examples designed for the use of clerics to compilations of various stories such as [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (1386–1400). The ''[[Decameron]]'' (1354) was a compilation of one hundred [[novelle]] told by ten people—seven women and three men—fleeing the [[Black Death]] by escaping from [[Florence]] to the Fiesole hills, in 1348.

==Renaissance period: 1500–1700==
[[File:1474 Melusine Ausgabe Augsburg Johann Bämler Blatt 2.png|thumb|1474: The customer in the copyist's shop with a book he wants to have copied. This illustration of the first printed German [[Melusine]] looked back to the market of manuscripts.]]

The modern distinction between history and fiction did not exist in the early sixteenth century and the grossest improbabilities pervade many historical accounts found in the early modern print market. [[William Caxton]]'s 1485 edition of [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' (1471) was sold as a true history, though the story unfolded in a series of magical incidents and historical improbabilities. [[Sir John Mandeville]]'s ''Voyages'', written in the 14th century, but circulated in printed editions throughout the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;The [[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] notes 29 editions published between 1496 and 1785 [http://estc.bl.uk/F/YMU7APITB3P8CLP4R6J16RSRKXTRGRN9HE79F36U1UPQP8QVU9-05108?func=short-sort&amp;set_number=093136&amp;sort_option=01---A02---A ESTC search result]&lt;/ref&gt; was filled with natural wonders, which were accepted as fact, like the one-footed Ethiopians who use their extremity as an umbrella against the desert sun. Both works eventually came to be viewed as works of fiction.

In the 16th and 17th centuries two factors led to the separation of history and fiction. The invention of printing immediately created a new market of comparatively cheap entertainment and knowledge in the form of [[chapbooks]]. The more elegant production of this genre by 17th- and 18th-century authors were ''[[belles lettres]]—''that is, a market that would be neither low nor academic. The second major development was the first best-seller of modern fiction, the Spanish ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'', by García Montalvo. However, it was not accepted as an example of ''belles lettres''. The ''Amadis'' eventually became the archetypical romance, in contrast with the modern novel which began to be developed in the 17th century.

===Chapbooks===
{{Main|Chapbook}}
A chapbook is an early type of [[popular literature]] printed in [[early modern Europe]]. Produced cheaply, chapbooks were commonly small, paper-covered booklets, usually printed on a single sheet folded into books of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages. They were often illustrated with crude [[woodcut]]s, which sometimes bore no relation to the text. When illustrations were included in chapbooks, they were considered [[popular prints]]. The tradition arose in the 16th century, as soon as [[printing press|printed]] books became affordable, and rose to its height during the 17th and 18th centuries and Many different kinds of [[ephemera]] and popular or folk literature were published as chapbooks, such as [[almanac]]s, [[children's literature]], [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[nursery rhyme]]s, [[pamphlet]]s, [[poetry]], and political and religious [[Tract (literature)|tracts]].&lt;ref name=mit.edu&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapbooks: Definition and Origins|url=http://web.mit.edu/21h.418/www/nhausman/chap1.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "chapbook" for this type of literature was coined in the 19th century. The corresponding French and German terms are ''[[bibliothèque bleue]]'' (blue book) and ''[[Volksbuch]]'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;From ''[[chapmen]]'', chap, a variety of [[peddler]], which folks circulated such literature as part of their stock.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Margaret Spufford|last=Spufford|first=Margaret |date=1984|title= The Great Reclothing of Rural England|publisher= Hambledon Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0907628477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Leitch, R. |date=1990|title='Here Chapman Billies Take Their Stand': A Pilot Study of Scottish Chapmen, Packmen and Pedlars|work=Proceedings of the Scottish Society of Antiquarians 120|pages= 173–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal historical subject matter of chapbooks was abridgements of ancient historians, popular medieval histories of knights, stories of comical heroes, religious legends, and collections of jests and fables.&lt;ref&gt;See Rainer Schöwerling, ''Chapbooks. Zur Literaturgeschichte des einfachen Lesers. Englische Konsumliteratur 1680–1840'' (Frankfurt, 1980), [[Margaret Spufford]], ''Small Books and Pleasant Histories. Pleasant Fiction and its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England'' (London, 1981) and Tessa Watt, ''Cheap Print and Popular Piety 1550–1640'' (Cambridge, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The new printed books reached the households of urban citizens and country merchants who visited the cities as traders. Cheap printed histories were, in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially popular among apprentices and younger urban readers of both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;See Johann Friedrich Riederer German satire on the widespread reading of novels and romances: "Satyra von den Liebes-Romanen", in: ''Die abentheuerliche Welt in einer Pickelheerings-Kappe'', vol. 2 (Nürnberg, 1718). [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1718-liebes-romane.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The early modern market, from the 1530s and 1540s, divided into low [[chapbooks]] and high market expensive, fashionable, elegant [[belles lettres]]. The ''[[Amadis]]'' and [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' were important publications with respect to this divide. Both books specifically addressed the new customers of popular histories, rather than readers of ''belles lettres''. The Amadis was a multi–volume fictional history of style, that aroused a debate about style and elegance as it became the first best-seller of popular fiction. On the other hand, ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', while it adopted the form of modern popular history, in fact satirized that genre's stylistic achievements. The division, between low and high literature, became especially visible with books that appeared on both the popular and ''belles lettres'' markets in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries: low  chapbooks included abridgments of books such as [[Miguel Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605/1615)

The term "chapbook" is also in use for present-day publications, commonly short, inexpensive booklets.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"/&gt;

===Heroic romances===
{{main|Heroic romances|17th-century French literature}}
Heroic Romance is a genre of imaginative literature, which flourished in the 17th century, principally in France.

The beginnings of modern fiction in France took a pseudo-[[bucolic]] form, and the celebrated ''[[L'Astrée]]'', (1610) of [[Honore d'Urfe]] (1568–1625), which is the earliest French novel, is properly styled a [[pastoral]]. Although its action was, in the main, languid and sentimental, there was a side of the Astree which encouraged that extravagant love of glory, that spirit of " panache", which was now rising to its height in France. That spirit it was which animated [[Marin le Roy de Gomberville]] (1603–1674), who was the inventor of what have since been known as the Heroical Romances. In these there was experienced a violent recrudescence of the old medieval elements of romance, the impossible valour devoted to a pursuit of the impossible beauty, but the whole clothed in the language and feeling and atmosphere of the age in which the books were written. In order to give point to the [[chivalrous]] actions of the heroes, it was always hinted that they were well-known public characters of the day in a romantic disguise.

===Satirical romances===
[[File:Richard Head 1666.png|left|thumb|[[Richard Head]], ''The English Rogue'' (1665)]]
Stories of witty cheats were an integral part of the European novella with its tradition of [[fabliaux]]. Significant examples include ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' (1510), ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]'' (1554), [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]]'s ''[[Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus|Simplicissimus Teutsch]]'' (1666–1668) and in England [[Richard Head]]'s ''The English Rogue'' (1665). The tradition that developed with these titles focused on a hero and his life. The adventures led to satirical encounters with the real world with the hero either becoming the pitiable victim or the rogue who exploited the vices of those he met.

A second tradition of satirical romances can be traced back to [[Heinrich Wittenwiler]]'s ''Ring'' (c. 1410) and to [[François Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (1532–1564), which parodied and satirized heroic romances, and did this mostly by dragging them into the low realm of the burlesque. Cervantes' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1606/1615) modified the satire of romances: its hero lost contact with reality by reading too many romances in the Amadisian tradition.

Other important works of the tradition are [[Paul Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (1651–57), the anonymous French ''Rozelli'' with its satire on Europe's religions, [[Alain-René Lesage]]'s ''[[Gil Blas]]'' (1715–1735), [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' (1742) and ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), and [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]]'' (1773, printed posthumously in 1796).&lt;ref&gt;Compare also: Günter Berger, ''Der komisch-satirische Roman und seine Leser. Poetik, Funktion und Rezeption einer niederen Gattung im Frankreich des 17. Jahrhunderts'' (Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universitätsverlag, 1984), Ellen Turner Gutiérrez ''The reception of the picaresque in the French, English, and German traditions'' (P. Lang, 1995), and Frank Palmeri, ''Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815'' (University of Delaware Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Histories===
[[File:1719-heathcot-robinson-crusoe.png|thumb|1719 newspaper reprint of ''Robinson Crusoe'']]
A market of literature in the modern sense of the word, that is a separate market for fiction and poetry, did not exist until the late seventeenth century. All books were sold under the rubric of "History and politicks" in the early 18th century, including [[pamphlet]]s, [[memoir]]s, [[travel literature]], political analysis, serious histories, romances, poetry, and novels.

That fictional histories shared the same space with academic histories and modern journalism had been criticized by historians since the end of the Middle Ages: fictions were "lies" and therefore hardly justifiable at all. The climate, however, changed in the 1670s.

The romance format of the quasi–historical works of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], [[César Vichard de Saint-Réal]],&lt;ref&gt;See his ''Dom Carlos, nouvelle histoire'' (Amsterdam, 1672) and the recent dissertation by Chantal Carasco, ''Saint-Réal, romancier de l'histoire: une cohérence esthéthique et morale'' (Nantes, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean Lombard, ''Courtilz de Sandras et la crise du roman à la fin du Grand Siècle'' (Paris: PUF, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]], allowed the publication of histories that dared not risk an unambiguous assertion of their truth. The literary market-place of the late 17th and early 18th century employed a simple pattern of options whereby fictions could reach out into the sphere of true histories. This permitted its authors to claim they had published fiction, not truth, if they ever faced allegations of libel.

Prefaces and title pages of 17th– and early 18th-century fiction acknowledged this pattern: histories could claim to be romances, but threaten to relate true events, as in the ''[[Roman à clef]]''. Other works could, conversely, claim to be factual histories, yet earn the suspicion that they were wholly invented. A further differentiation was made between private and public history: [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' was, within this pattern, neither a "romance" nor a "novel". It smelled of romance, yet the preface stated that it should most certainly be read as a true private history.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Defoe, [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1719-robinson-crusoe/p-iii.html ''Robinson Crusoe''] (London: W. Taylor, 1719)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cervantes and the modern novel===
{{See also|Picaresque novel}}

The rise of the novel as an alternative to the romance began with the publication of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Novelas ejemplares|Novelas Exemplares]]'' (1613). It continued with [[Paul Scarron|Scarron]]'s ''Roman Comique'' (the first part of which appeared in 1651), whose heroes noted the rivalry between French romances and the new Spanish genre.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Scarron, ''The Comical Romance'', Chapter XXI. "Which perhaps will not be found very Entertaining" (London, 1700) with its call for the new genre. [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/library/e-1700-0002.html#c21 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 17th-century critics looked back on the history of prose fiction, proud of the generic shift that had taken place, leading towards the modern novel/novella.&lt;ref&gt;See [Du Sieur,] "Sentimens sur l'histoire" in: ''Sentimens sur les lettres et sur l'histoire, avec des scruples sur le stile'' (Paris: C. Blageart, 1680) [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1683-1712-novels.html online edition] and Camille Esmein's ''Poétiques du roman. Scudéry, Huet, Du Plaisir et autres textes théoriques et critiques du XVIIe siècle sur le genre romanesque'' (Paris, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The first perfect works in French were those of Scarron and [[Madame de La Fayette]]'s "Spanish history" ''Zayde'' (1670). The development finally led to her ''[[La Princesse de Clèves|Princesse de Clèves]]'' (1678), the first novel with what would become characteristic French subject matter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Europe witnessed the generic shift in the titles of works in French published in Holland, which supplied the international market and English publishers exploited the novel/romance controversy in the 1670s and 1680s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Robert Letellier|Robert Ignatius Letellier]], ''The English novel, 1660–1700: an annotated bibliography'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary critics listed the advantages of the new genre: brevity, a lack of ambition to produce epic poetry in prose; the style was fresh and plain; the focus was on modern life, and on heroes who were neither good nor bad.&lt;ref&gt;See the preface to ''The Secret History of Queen Zarah'' (Albigion, 1705)– the English version of Abbe Bellegarde, "Lettre à une Dame de la Cour, qui lui avoit demandé quelques Reflexions sur l'Histoire" in: ''Lettres curieuses de littérature et de morale'' (La Haye: Adrian Moetjens, 1702) [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1683-1712-novels.html online edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel's potential to become the medium of urban gossip and scandal fuelled the rise of the novel/novella. Stories were offered as allegedly true recent histories, not for the sake of scandal but strictly for the moral lessons they gave. To prove this, fictionalized names were used with the true names in a separate key. The ''[[Mercure Gallant]]'' set the fashion in the 1670s.&lt;ref&gt;DeJean, Joan. ''The Essence of Style: How the French Invented Fashion, Fine Food, Chic Cafés, Style, Sophistication, and Glamour'' (New York: Free Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Collections of letters and memoirs appeared, and were filled with the intriguing new subject matter and the [[epistolary novel]] grew from this and led to the first full blown example of scandalous fiction in [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'' (1684/ 1685/ 1687). Before the rise of the literary novel, reading novels had only been a form of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, William B.

However, one of the earliest English novels, [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719), has elements of the romance, unlike these novels, because of its exotic setting and story of survival in isolation. ''Crusoe'' lacks almost all of the elements found in these new novels: wit, a fast narration evolving around a group of young fashionable urban heroes, along with their intrigues, a scandalous moral, gallant talk to be imitated, and a brief, conciseness plot.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The new developments did, however, lead to [[Eliza Haywood]]'s epic length novel, ''Love in Excess'' (1719/20) and to [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1741).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some literary historians date the beginning of the English novel with Richardson's ''Pamela'', rather than ''Crusoe.''&lt;ref name="asj.upd.edu.ph"&gt;Cevasco, George A.

==18th century novels==
{{main|Augustan prose}}

The idea of the "rise of the novel" in the 18th century is especially associated with [[Ian Watt]]'s influential study ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Ian Watt's, ''The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding'' (London, 1957).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2018}} In Watt's conception, a rise in fictional realism during the 18th century came to distinguish the novel from earlier prose narratives.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Novel'' (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1963), p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1769 Laurence Sterne Tristram Shandy v6 p70.jpg|thumb|[[Laurence Sterne]], ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', vol.6, pp.&amp;nbsp;70–71 (1769)]]

===Philosophical novel===
{{main|Philosophical fiction}}
The rising status of the novel in 18th-century can be seen in the development of philosophical&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jonathan Israel|Jonathan Irvine Israel]], ''Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;591–599, Roger Pearson, ''The fables of reason: a study of Voltaire's "Contes philosophiques"'' (Oxford University Press 1993), Dena Goodman, ''Criticism in action: Enlightenment experiments in political writing'' ([[Cornell University Press]] 1989), Robert Francis O'Reilly, ''The Artistry of Montesquieu's Narrative Tales'' (University of Wisconsin., 1967), and René Pomeau and Jean Ehrard, ''De Fénelon à Voltaire'' (Flammarion, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[experimental novel]]s.

Philosophical fiction was not exactly new. [[Plato]]'s dialogues were embedded in fictional narratives and his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is an early example of a [[Utopia]]. The tradition of works of fiction that were also philosophical texts continued with [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) and [[Tommaso Campanella]]'s ''[[The City of the Sun|City of the Sun]]'' (1602). However, the actual tradition of the [[philosophical novel]] came into being in the 1740s with new editions of More's work under the title ''Utopia: or the happy republic; a philosophical romance'' (1743).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Voltaire]] wrote in this genre in ''[[Micromégas|Micromegas: a comic romance, which is a biting satire on philosophy, ignorance, and the self-conceit of mankind]]'' (1752, English 1753). His ''[[Zadig]]'' (1747) and ''[[Candide]]'' (1759) became central texts of the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and of the modern novel.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

An example of the [[experimental novel]] is [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759–1767), with its rejection of continuous narration.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tristram-Shandy].&lt;/ref&gt; In it the author not only addresses readers in his preface but speaks directly to them in his fictional narrative. In addition to Sterne's narrative experiments, there has visual experiments, such as a marbled page, a black page to express sorrow, and a page of lines to show the plot lines of the book. The novel as a whole focuses on the problems of language, with constant regard to [[John Locke]]'s theories in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=griffin&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffin |first=Robert J. |year=1961 |title=Tristram Shandy and Language |journal=College English |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=108–12|jstor=372959 |doi=10.2307/372959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The romance genre in the 18th century===
[[File:Richardson pamela 1741.jpg|left|thumb|[[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'' (1741)]]

The rise of the word novel at the cost of its rival, the romance, remained a Spanish and English phenomenon, and though readers all over Western Europe had welcomed the novel(la) or short history as an alternative in the second half of the 17th century, only the English and the Spanish had, however, openly discredited the romance.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

But the change of taste was brief and [[François Fénelon|Fénelon's]] ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) already exploited a nostalgia for the old romances with their heroism and professed virtue. [[Jane Barker]] explicitly advertised her ''Exilius'' as "A new Romance", "written after the Manner of Telemachus", in 1715.&lt;ref&gt;See the preface to her [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1715-exilius.html ''Exilius''] (London: E. Curll, 1715)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robinson Crusoe]] spoke of his own story as a "romance", though in the preface to the third volume, published in 1720, Defoe attacks all who said "that [...] the Story is feign'd, that the Names are borrow'd, and that it is all a Romance; that there never were any such Man or Place".

The late 18th century brought an answer with the [[romanticism|Romantic]] Movement's readiness to reclaim the word romance, with the [[gothic romance]], and the [[historical novel]]s of [[Walter Scott]]. ''Robinson Crusoe'' now became a "novel" in this period, that is a work of the new realistic fiction created in the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===The sentimental novel===
{{main|Sentimental novel}}
Sentimental novels relied on emotional responses, and feature scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot is arranged to advance emotions rather than action. The result is a valorization of "fine feeling", displaying the characters as models of refined, sensitive emotional effect. The ability to display such feelings was thought at this time to show character and experience, and to help shape positive social life and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Maxwell and Katie Trumpener, eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Fiction in the Romantic Period'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this genre is [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740), composed "to cultivate the Principles of Virtue and Religion in the Minds of the Youth of Both Sexes", which focuses on a potential victim, a heroine that has all the modern virtues and who is vulnerable because her low social status and her occupation as servant of a libertine who falls in love with her. She, however, ends in reforming her antagonist.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Male heroes adopted the new [[sentimental novel|sentimental]] character traits in the 1760s. [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[Yorick]], the hero of the ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy|Sentimental Journey]]'' (1768) did so with an enormous amount of humour. [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield|Vicar of Wakefield]]'' (1766) and [[Henry Mackenzie]]'s ''Man of Feeling'' (1771) produced the far more serious role models.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Thees works inspired a [[Subculture|sub]]- and [[counterculture]] of [[pornography|pornographic]] novels, for which Greek and Latin authors in  translations had provided elegant models from the last century.&lt;ref&gt;The elegant and clearly fashionable edition of ''The Works of [[Lucian]]'' (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1711), would thus include the story of "Lucian's Ass", vol.1 pp.&amp;nbsp;114–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography includes [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1748), which offered an almost exact reversals of the plot of novel's that emphasised virtue. The prostitute Fanny Hill learns to enjoy her work and establishes herself as a free and economically independent individual, in editions one could only expect to buy under the counter.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Darnton, ''The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France'' (New York: Norton, 1995), Lynn Hunt, ''The Invention of Pornography: Obscenity and the Origins of Modernity, 1500–1800'' (New York: Zone, 1996), Inger Leemans, ''Het woord is aan de onderkant: radicale ideeën in Nederlandse pornografische romans 1670–1700'' (Nijmegen: Vantilt, 2002), and Lisa Z. Sigel, ''Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815–1914'' (January: Scholarly Book Services Inc, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

Less virtuous protagonists can also be found in satirical novels, like [[Richard Head]]'s ''English Rogue'' (1665), that feature brothels, while women authors like [[Aphra Behn]] had offered their heroines alternative careers as precursors of the 19th-century [[femme fatale|femmes fatales]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]]'' (1684/ 1685/ 1687)&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;

The genre evolves in the 1770s with, for example, Werther in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774) realising that it is impossible for him to integrate into the new conformist society, and [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]] in ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' (1782) showing a group of aristocrats playing games of intrigue and amorality.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

===The social context of the 18th century novel===

====Changing cultural status====
By around 1700, fiction was no longer a predominantly aristocratic entertainment, and printed books had soon gained the power to reach readers of almost all classes, though the reading habits differed and to follow fashions remained a privilege. Spain was a trendsetter into the 1630s but French authors superseded [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Francisco de Quevedo|de Quevedo]], and [[Mateo Alemán|Alemán]] in the 1640s. As [[Pierre Daniel Huet|Huet]] was to note in 1670, the change was one of manners.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Daniel Huet, ''The History of Romances'', transl. by Stephen Lewis (London: J. Hooke/ T. Caldecott, 1715), pp.&amp;nbsp;138–140.&lt;/ref&gt; The new French works taught a new, on the surface freer, gallant exchange between the sexes as the essence of life at the French court.

The situation changed again from 1660s into the 1690s when works by French authors were published in Holland out of the reach of French censors.&lt;ref&gt;See for the following: Christiane Berkvens-Stevelinck, H. Bots, P.G. Hoftijzer (eds.), ''Le Magasin de L'univers: The Dutch Republic as the Centre of the European Book Trade: Papers Presented at the International Colloquium, Held at Wassenaar, 5–7 July 1990'' (Leiden/ Boston, MA: Brill, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch publishing houses pirated of fashionable books from France and created a new market of political and scandalous fiction. This led to a market of European rather than French fashions in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;See also the article on [[Pierre Marteau]] for a profile of the European production of (not only) political scandal.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1711 The Court and City Vagaries.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|Intimate short stories: ''The Court and City Vagaries'' (1711).]]

By the 1680s fashionable political European novels had inspired a second wave of private scandalous publications and generated new productions of local importance. Women authors reported on politics and on their private love affairs in The Hague and in London. German students imitated them to boast of their private amours in fiction.&lt;ref&gt;See ''George Ernst Reinwalds Academien- und Studenten-Spiegel'' (Berlin: J.A. Rüdiger, 1720), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–427 and the novels written by such "authors" as Celander, Sarcander, and Adamantes at the beginning of the 18th century.&lt;/ref&gt; The London, the anonymous international market of the Netherlands, publishers in Hamburg and Leipzig generated new public spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry Into a Category of the Bourgeois Society'' [1962], translated by Thomas Burger (MIT Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Once private individuals, such as students in university towns and daughters of London's upper class began write novels based on questionable reputations, the public began to call for a reformation of manners.&lt;ref&gt;See the ''Entertainments'' pp.&amp;nbsp;74–77, Jane Barker's preface to her [http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1715-exilius.html ''Exilius''] (London: E. Curll, 1715), and ''George Ernst Reinwalds Academien- und Studenten-Spiegel'' (Berlin: J.A. Rüdiger, 1720), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important development in Britain, at the beginning of the century, was that new journals like ''[[Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' and ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' reviewed novels. In Germany [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''Briefe, die neuste Literatur betreffend'' (1758) appeared in the middle of the century with reviews of art and fiction. By the 1780s such reviews played had an important role in introducing new works of fiction to the public.

Influenced by the new journals, reform became the main goal of the second generation of 18th-century novelists. ''The Spectator'' Number 10 had stated that the aim was now "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality […] to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses"). Constructive criticism of novels had until then been rare.&lt;ref&gt;See Hugh Barr Nisbet, Claude Rawson (eds.), ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism'', vol. IV (Cambridge University Press 1997); and Ernst Weber, ''Texte zur Romantheorie: (1626–1781)'', 2 vols. (München: Fink, 1974/ 1981) and the individual volumes of Dennis Poupard (et al.), ''Literature Criticism from 1400 to 1800: '' (Detroit, Mich.: Gale Research Co, 1984 ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; The first treatise on the history of the novel was a preface to Marie de La Fayette's  novel ''Zayde'' (1670).

A much later development was the introduction of novels into school and later university curricula.{{when|date=July 2018}}

====The acceptance of novels as literature====

The French churchman and scholar [[Pierre Daniel Huet]]'s ''[[Traitté de l'origine des romans]]'' (1670) laid the ground for a greater acceptance of the novel as literature, that is comparable to the [[classics]], in the early 18th century. The theologian had not only dared to praise fictions, but he had also explained techniques of theological interpretation of fiction, which was a novelty. Furthermore, readers of  novels and romances could gain insight not only into their own culture, but also that of distant, exotic countries.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

When the decades around 1700 saw the appearance of new editions of the classical authors [[Petronius]], [[Lucian]], and [[Heliodorus of Emesa]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of T. Petronius Arbiter'' [...] ''second edition'' [...] (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1710); ''The Works of Lucian,'', 2 vols. (London: S. Briscoe/ J. Woodward/ J. Morphew, 1711). See ''The Adventures of Theagenes and Chariclia'' [...]'', 2 vols. (London: W. Taylor/ E. Curll/ R. Gosling/ J. Hooke/ J. Browne/ J. Osborn, 1717),&lt;/ref&gt; the publishers equipped them with prefaces that referred to Huet's treatise. and the [[Western canon|canon]] it had established. Also exotic works of Middle Eastern fiction entered the market that gave insight into Islamic culture. ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' was first published in Europe from 1704 to 1715 in French, and then translated immediately into English and German, and was seen as a contribution to Huet's history of romances.&lt;ref&gt;August Bohse's (alias Talander) "Preface" to the German edition. (Leipzig: J.L. Gleditsch/ M.G. Weidmann, 1710).&lt;/ref&gt;

The English, ''Select Collection of Novels in six volumes'' (1720–22), is a milestone in this development of the novel's prestige. It included Huet's ''Treatise'', along with the European tradition of the modern novel of the day: that is, novella from [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s to [[Marie de La Fayette]]'s masterpieces. [[Aphra Behn]]'s novels had appeared in the 1680s but became classics when reprinted in collections. [[François Fénelon|Fénelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' (1699/1700) became a classic three years after its publication. New authors entering the market were now ready to use their personal names rather than pseudonyms, including [[Eliza Haywood]], who in 1719 following in the footsteps of Aphra Behn used her name with unprecedented pride.

==19th century novels==

===Romanticism===
{{main|Romanticism}}
{{See also|Newgate novel}}
[[File:Walter Scott Waverley illustration (Pettie-Huth).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Image from a Victorian edition of [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'']]
The very word [[romanticism]] is connected to the idea of romance, and the romance genre experienced a revival, at the end of the 18th century, with [[gothic fiction]], that began in 1746 with English author [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', subtitled (in its second edition) "A Gothic Story". Other important works are [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' (1794) and [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]]'s ''[[The Monk]]'' (1795).

The new romances challenged the idea that the novel involved a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] depictions of life, and destabilized the difference the critics had been trying to establish, between serious classical art and popular fiction. Gothic romances exploited the [[grotesque]],&lt;ref&gt;See Geoffrey Galt Harpham,'' On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature'', 2nd ed. (Davies Group, Publishers, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and some critics thought that their subject matter deserved less credit than the worst medieval tales of [[Arthurian romance|Arthurian knighthood]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gerald Ernest Paul Gillespie, Manfred Engel, and Bernard Dieterle, ''Romantic prose fiction'' (John Benjamin's Publishing Company, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of this new type of fiction were accused of exploiting all available topics to thrill, arouse, or horrify their audience. These new [[romanticism|romantic]] novelists, however, claimed that they were exploring  the entire realm of fictionality. And psychological interpreters, in the early 19th century, read these works as encounters with the deeper hidden truth of the human imagination: this included sexuality, [[Angst|anxieties]], and insatiable [[desire (emotion)|desires]]. Under such readings, novels were described as exploring deeper human motives, and it was suggested that such artistic freedom would reveal what had not previously been openly visible.

The romances of [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom|Les 120 Journées de Sodome]]'' (1785), [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' (1840), [[Mary Shelley]], ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), and [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], ''[[Die Elixiere des Teufels]]'' (1815), would later attract 20th-century psychoanalysts and supply the images for 20th- and 21st-century horror films, [[romance novel|love romances]], [[fantasy]] novels, [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] computer games, and the [[surrealism|surrealists]].

The [[historical romance]] was also important at this time. But, while earlier writers of these romances paid little attention to historical reality, [[Walter Scott]]'s [[historical novel]] ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'' (1814) broke with this tradition, and he invented "the true historical novel".&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885"&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davis. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;885.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time he was influenced by [[gothic romance]], and had collaborated in 1801 with [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|'Monk' Lewis]] on ''Tales of Wonder''.&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885" /&gt; With his [[Waverley novels]] Scott "hoped to do for the Scottish border" what [[Goethe]] and other German poets "had done for the [[Middle Ages]], "and make its past live again in modern romance".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne Davis, p.&amp;nbsp;884.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's novels "are in the mode he himself defined as romance, 'the interest of which turns upon marvelous and uncommon incidents'".&lt;ref name=norton&gt;''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', vol.2, 7th edition, ed. M.H. Abrams. New York: Norton, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; He used his imagination to re-evaluate history by rendering things, incidents and protagonists in the way only the novelist could do. His work remained historical fiction, yet it questioned existing historical perceptions. The use of historical research was an important tool: Scott, the novelist, resorted to documentary sources as any historian would have done, but as a romantic he gave his subject a deeper imaginative and emotional significance.&lt;ref name=norton/&gt; By combining research with "marvelous and uncommon incidents", Scott attracted a far wider market than any historian could, and was the most famous novelist of his generation, throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="The Bloomsbury Guide p. 885" /&gt;

In the 19th century the relationship between authors, publishers, and readers, changed. Authors originally had only received payment for their manuscript, however, changes in [[History of copyright law|copyright laws]], which began in 18th and continued into 19th century&lt;ref&gt;See Mark Rose, ''Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright'' 3rd ed. (Harvard University Press, 1993) and Joseph Lowenstein, ''The Author's Due: Printing and the Prehistory of Copyright'' (University of Chicago Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; promised royalties on all future editions. Another change in the 19th century was that novelists began to read their works in theaters, halls, and bookshops.&lt;ref&gt;See Susan Esmann, "Die Autorenlesung&amp;nbsp;– eine Form der Literaturvermittlung", ''Kritische Ausgabe'' 1/2007 [http://kritische-ausgabe.de/hefte/werkstatt/esmann.pdf PDF; 0,8 MB].&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the nineteenth century the market for [[popular fiction]] grew, and competed with works of literature. New institutions like the [[circulating library]] created a new market with a mass reading public.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Altick and Jonathan Rose, ''The English Common Reader: A Social History of the Mass Reading Public, 1800–1900'', 2nd ed. (Ohio State University Press, 1998) and William St. Clair, ''The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another difference was that novels began to deal with more difficult subjects, including current political and social issues, that were being discussed in newspapers and magazines. The idea of social responsibility became a key subject, whether of the citizen, or of the artist, with the theoretical debate concentrating on questions around the moral soundness of the modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;See: James Engell, ''The committed word: Literature and Public Values'' (Penn State Press, 1999) and Edwin M. Eigner, George John Worth (ed.), ''Victorian criticism of the novel'' (Cambridge: CUP Archive, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about artistic integrity, as well as [[aestheticism|aesthetics]], including, for example. the idea of "[[art for art's sake]]", proposed by writers like [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], were also important.&lt;ref&gt;Gene H. Bell-Villada, ''Art for Art's Sake &amp; Literary Life: How Politics and Markets Helped Shape the Ideology &amp; Culture of Aestheticism, 1790–1990'' (University of Nebraska Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Major British writers such as [[Charles Dickens]]&lt;ref&gt;Arthur C. Benson, "Charles Dickens". ''The North American Review'', Vol. 195, No. 676 (Mar., 1912), pp.&amp;nbsp;381–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;Jane Millgate, "Two Versions of Regional Romance: Scott's ''The Bride of Lammermoor'' and Hardy's ''Tess of the d'Urbervilles''. ''Studies in English Literature'', 1500–1900, Vol. 17, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1977), pp.&amp;nbsp;729–38.&lt;/ref&gt; were influenced by the romance genre tradition of the novel, which had been revitalized during the Romantic period. The [[Brontë sisters]] were notable mid-19th-century authors in this tradition, with [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' and [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucasta Miller, ''The Brontë Myth''. London: Vintage, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Publishing at the very end of the 19th century, [[Joseph Conrad]] has been called, "a supreme 'romancer'".&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory'', ed. J.A. Cuddon, 4th ed., revised C.E. Preston (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;761.&lt;/ref&gt; In America "the romance ... proved to be a serious, flexible, and successful medium for the exploration of philosophical ideas and attitudes." Notable examples include [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'', and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.&lt;ref name="Literary Terms 1995 p.450"&gt;''A Handbook of Literary Terms'', 7th edition, ed. Harmon and Holman (1995), p.&amp;nbsp;450.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of European novelists were similarly influenced influenced during this period by the earlier romance tradition, along with the [[Romantic Movemennticism|Romanticism]], including [[Victor Hugo]], with novels like ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' (1831) and ''[[Les Misérables]]'' (1862), and [[Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov]] with ''[[A Hero of Our Time]]'' (1840).

[[File:UncleTomsCabinCover.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852)]]

Many 19th-century authors dealt with significant social matters.&lt;ref&gt;For the wider context of 19th-century encounters with history see: [[Hayden White]], ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (Baltimore: [[Johns Hopkins University]], 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]]'s novels depicted the world of the [[working class]]es, which [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]'s non-fiction explores. In the United States slavery and racism became topics of far broader public debate thanks to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852), which dramatizes topics that had previously been discussed mainly in the abstract. [[Charles Dickens]]' novels led his readers into contemporary [[workhouses]], and provided first-hand accounts of [[child labor]]. The treatment of the subject of war changed with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1868/69), where he questions the facts provided by historians. Similarly the treatment of crime is very different in [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), where the point of view is that of a criminal. Women authors had dominated fiction from the 1640s into the early 18th century, but few before [[George Eliot]] so openly questioned the role, education, and status of women in society, as she did.

As the novel became a platform of modern debate, [[nationalist|national literatures]] were developed that link the present with the past in the form of the [[historical novel]]. [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'' (1827) did this for Italy, while novelists in Russia and the surrounding Slavonic countries, as well as [[Scandinavia]], did likewise.

Along with this new appreciation of history, the future also became a topic for fiction. This had been done earlier in works like [[Samuel Madden]]'s ''[[Memoirs of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1733) and [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1826), a work whose plot culminated in the catastrophic last days of a mankind extinguished by the plague. [[Edward Bellamy]]'s ''[[Looking Backward]]'' (1887) and [[H.G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) were concerned with technological and biological developments. [[Industrialization]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s [[theory of evolution]] and Marx's theory of [[social class|class]] divisions shaped these works and turned historical processes into a subject of wide debate. Bellamy's ''Looking Backward'' became the second best-selling book of the 19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe's ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Scott Donaldson and Ann Massa ''American Literature: Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries'' (David &amp; Charles, 1978), p.&amp;nbsp;205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Parfait, ''The Publishing History of Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852–2002'' (Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Such works led to the development of a whole genre of popular [[science fiction]] as the 20th century approached.

[[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922) had a major influence on modern novelists, in the way that it replaced the 18th- and 19th-century narrator with a text that attempted to record inner thoughts, or a "[[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]]". This term was first used by [[William James]] in 1890 and is used (or the related [[interior monologue]]) by [[modernists]] like [[Dorothy Richardson]], [[Marcel Proust]], as well as, later [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[William Faulkner]].&lt;ref&gt;See Erwin R. Steinberg (ed.) ''The Stream-of-consciousness technique in the modern novel'' (Port Washington, N.Y: Kennikat Press, 1979). On the extra-European usage of the technique see also: Elly Hagenaar/ Eide, Elisabeth, "Stream of consciousness and free indirect discourse in modern Chinese literature", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', 56 (1993), p.&amp;nbsp;621 and P.M. Nayak (ed.), ''The voyage inward: stream of consciousness in Indian English fiction'' (New Delhi: Bahri Publications, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1920s [[expressionist]] [[Alfred Döblin]] went in a different direction with ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' (1929), where interspersed non-fictional text fragments exist alongside the fictional material to create another new form of realism, which differs from that of stream-of-consciousness.

Later works like [[Samuel Beckett]]'s trilogy ''[[Molloy (novel)|Molloy]]'' (1951), ''[[Malone Dies]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]'' (1953), as well as [[Julio Cortázar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cortázar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963) and [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' (1973) all make use of the stream-of-consciousness technique. On the other hand, [[Robert Coover]] is an example of those authors who, in the 1960s,  fragmented their stories and challenged time and sequentiality as fundamental structural concepts.

The 20th century novels deals with a wide range of subject matter. [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1928) focusses on young German's experiences of [[World War I]]. The [[Jazz Age]] is explored by American [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], and the [[Great Depression]] by fellow American [[John Steinbeck]]. The rise of [[totalitarian]] states is the subject of British writer [[George Orwell]]. France's existentialism is the subject of French writers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' (1938) and [[Albert Camus]]' ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'' (1942). The [[counterculture of the 1960s]] led to revived interest in [[Hermann Hesse]]'s ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'' (1927), and produced such iconic works of its own like [[Ken Kesey]]'s ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' and [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]''. Novelist have also been interested in the subject of racial and [[gender identity]] in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Susan Hopkins, ''Girl Heroes: The New Force In Popular Culture'' (Annandale NSW:, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Kavadlo of [[Maryville University]] of St. Louis has described [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (1996) as "a closeted [[Feminism|feminist]] critique".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kavadlo|first=Jesse|date=Fall/Winter 2005|title=The Fiction of Self-destruction: Chuck Palahniuk, Closet Moralist|url=|journal=Stirrings Still: The International Journal of Existential Literature|volume=2|issue=2|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]] were feminist voices during this period.

Furthermore, the major political and military confrontations of the 20th and 21st centuries have also influenced novelists. The events of [[World War II]], from a German perspective, are dealt with by [[Günter Grass]]' ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' (1959) and an American by [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'' (1961). The subsequent [[Cold War]] influenced popular [[spy fiction|spy novels]]. Latin American self-awareness in the wake of the (failing) left revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s resulted in a "[[Latin American Boom]]", linked to with the names of novelists [[Julio Cortázar]], [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Carlos Fuentes]] and [[Gabriel García Márquez]], along with the invention of a special brand of postmodern [[magic realism]].

Another major 20th-century social events, the so-called [[sexual revolution]] is reflected in the modern novel.&lt;ref&gt;See: Charles Irving Glicksberg, ''The Sexual Revolution in Modern American Literature'' (Nijhoff, 1971) and his ''The Sexual Revolution in Modern English Literature'' (Martinus Nijhoff, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.H. Lawrence]]'s ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' had to be published in Italy in 1928; British censorship lifted its ban as late as 1960. [[Henry Miller]]'s ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' (1934) created the comparable US scandal. Transgressive fiction from [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]'' (1955) to [[Michel Houellebecq]]'s ''[[Les Particules élémentaires]]'' (1998) entered a literary field that eventually led to more pornographic works such as [[Anne Desclos]]' ''[[Story of O]]'' (1954) to [[Anaïs Nin]]'s ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' (1978).

In the second half of the 20th century, [[postmodernism|Postmodern]] authors subverted serious debate with playfulness, claiming that art could never be original, that it always plays with existing materials.&lt;ref&gt;See for a first survey [[Brian McHale]], ''Postmodernist Fiction'' (Routledge, 1987) and John Docker, ''Postmodernism and popular culture: a cultural history'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that language is self-referential was already an  accepted truth in the world of [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]]. A postmodernist re-reads popular literature as an essential cultural production. Novels from [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' (1966), to [[Umberto Eco]]'s ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980) and ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' (1989) made use of [[intertextuality|intertextual]] references.&lt;ref&gt;See Gérard Genette, ''Palimpsests'', trans.

While the reader of so-called [[Classic book|serious literature]] will follow public discussions of novels, popular fiction production employs more direct and short-term marketing strategies by openly declarating of the work's genre. Popular novels are based entirely on the expectations for the particular genre, and this includes the creation of a series of novels with an identifiable brand name. e.g. the [[Sherlock Holmes]] series by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]

Popular literature holds a larger market share. [[Romance fiction]] had an estimated $1.375&amp;nbsp;billion share in the US book market in 2007. [[Inspirational literature]]/religious literature followed with $819&amp;nbsp;million, [[science fiction]]/[[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] with $700&amp;nbsp;million, [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] with $650&amp;nbsp;million and then classic literary fiction with $466&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;See the page [http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics Romance Literature Statistics: Overview]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085813/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics |date=2007-12-23 }} (visited March 16, 2009) of ''[http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home Romance Writers of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140439/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home |date=2010-12-03 }}'' homepage.

Genre literature might be seen as the successor of the early modern [[chapbook]]. Both fields share a focus on readers who are in search of accessible reading satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Richetti ''Popular Fiction before Richardson. Narrative Patterns 1700–1739'' (Oxford: OUP, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century love romance is a successor of the novels [[Madeleine de Scudéry]], [[Madame de La Fayette|Marie de La Fayette]], [[Aphra Behn]], and [[Eliza Haywood]] wrote from the 1640s into the 1740s. The modern [[adventure novel]] goes back to [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719) and its immediate successors. Modern [[pornography]] has no precedent in the chapbook market but originates in libertine and hedonistic belles lettres, of works like [[John Cleland]]'s ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1749) and similar eighteenth century novels. [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[James Bond]]'' is a descendant of the anonymous yet extremely sophisticated and stylish narrator who mixed his love affairs with his political missions in ''La Guerre d'Espagne'' (1707). [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]]'s ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'' is influenced by [[Tolkien]], as well as [[Arthurian literature]], including its 19th-century successors. Modern [[horror fiction]] also has no precedent on the market of chapbooks but goes back to the elitist market of early-19th-century [[Romantic literature]]. Modern popular science fiction has an even shorter history, from the 1860s.

The authors of popular fiction tend to advertise that they have exploited a controversial topic and this is a major difference between them and so-called elitist literature. [[Dan Brown]], for example, discusses, on his website, the question whether his ''Da Vinci Code'' is an anti-Christian novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Brown on his [http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html website] visited February 3, 2009. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116181432/http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/faqs.html |date=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And because authors of popular fiction have a fan community to serve, they can risk offending [[literary critic]]. However, the boundaries between popular and serious literature have blurred in recent years, with [[postmodernism]] and [[poststructuralism]], as well as by adaptation of popular literary classics by the film and television industries.

Crime became a major subject of 20th and 21st century genre novelists and [[crime fiction]] reflects the realities of modern industrialized societies. Crime is both a personal and public subject: criminals each have their personal motivations; detectives, see their moral codes challenged. [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s [[psychological thriller|thrillers]] became a medium of new psychological explorations. [[Paul Auster]]'s ''[[The New York Trilogy|New York Trilogy]]'' (1985–1986) is an example of experimental [[postmodern]]ist literature based on this genre.

[[Fantasy]] is another major area of commercial fiction, and a major example is [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954/55), a work originally written for young readers that became a major cultural artefact. Tolkien in fact  revived the tradition of European [[epic (genre)|epic]] literature in the tradition of [[Beowulf]], the North Germanic [[Edda]] and the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Cycles]].

[[Science fiction]], is another important type of genre fiction and it has developed in a variety of ways, ranging from the early, technological adventure [[Jules Verne]] had made fashionable in the 1860s, to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) about Western [[consumerism]] and technology. [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) deals with [[totalitarianism]] and [[surveillance]], among other matters, while [[Stanisław Lem]], [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] produced modern classics which focus on the interaction between humans and machines. The surreal novels of [[Philip K Dick]] such as ''[[The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch]]'' explore the nature of reality, reflecting the widespread recreational experimentation with drugs and cold-war paranoia of the 60's and 70's. Writers such as [[Ursula le Guin]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] explore feminist and broader social issues in their works. [[William Gibson]], author of the cult classic ''[[Neuromancer]]'' (1984), is one of a new wave of authors who explore post-apocalyptic fantasies and [[virtual reality]].

The {{Nihongo|'''Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University'''|沖縄科学技術大学院大学|Okinawa Kagaku Gijutsu Daigakuin Daigaku|'''OIST'''}} is an interdisciplinary graduate school located in [[Onna, Okinawa|Onna]], [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. The school offers a 5-year [[PhD]] program in Science. Over half of the faculty and students are recruited from outside Japan, and all education and research is conducted entirely in English.

OIST relies on public subsidies paid by the Japanese government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=D|last=Cyranoski |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v474/n7353/full/474541b.html |title=Made in Japan |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|pages=541–542|doi=10.1038/474541b|volume=474 |issue=7353 |date=29 June 2011|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government subsidy for OIST comes in two areas: a subsidy for operations and a subsidy for facilities.

==Graduate school==
The [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] program is taught entirely in English and is individually tailored to each student. Students are encouraged to focus their research on cross-disciplinary areas of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Degree structure|url=https://admissions.oist.jp/degree-structure|publisher=oist.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
In June 2001 [[Kōji Omi]], former Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs and former Minister of State for Science and Technology Policy, announced plans to establish a new graduate university in Okinawa. A Board of Governors was appointed in 2004 and the following year, the [[National Diet|Diet]] recognized OIST as an "Independent Administrative Institution".&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=About — History|url=https://www.oist.jp/history|publisher=oist.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first batch of students were welcomed in September 2012 after receiving approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Normile|first1=Dennis|title=Japan's New Okinawa Institute Officially Becomes Graduate University|journal=Science|date=28 October 2011|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/10/japans-new-okinawa-institute-officially-becomes-graduate-university|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open Discourse''' is a [[Technical terminology|technical term]] used in [[discourse analysis]] and [[Sociolinguistics]] and is commonly contrasted with ''Closed Discourse''. The concept of open and closed discourse is associated with the overlay of open and closed [[discourse community|discourse communities]] and open and closed communication events. Keys to determining whether a discourse is open or closed include [[Information access|access to information]], [[Equity theory|equity]] of access, [[Open access (publishing)|open access]], quality of discourse and mechanisms and modalities of discourse control: overt, covert, implicit and incidental. As a conceptual filter and cultural construct, [[ideology]] is a function and mechanism of discourse control. [[Channel (communications)|Channel]] and [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] of a communication event and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of communication together control discourse and therefore, determine the degree of [[social inclusion]] and [[social exclusion]] and, by extension, the relative efficiency of that communication event. Open and closed discourse operate along a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] where absolute closure and complete openness are theoretically untenable due to [[Communication noise|noise]] in the channel. The nature of the channel, signal, code, replicability, recording, transmissibility, cataloguing, recall or other variable of a communication event and its information control and context of transmission-as-event, impact its relative position along the continuum between open and closed discourse. In all cases, open discourse is assumed to be sustained discourse.

[[Teun A. van Dijk|Van Dijk]] (c.2003: p.&amp;nbsp;357) holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although most discourse control is contextual or global, even local details of meaning, form, or style may be controlled, e.g. the details of an answer in class or court, or choice of lexical items or jargon in courtrooms, classrooms or newsrooms (Martin Rojo 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, Teun A. (c2003). "Critical Discourse Analysis." Cited in: Schiffrin, Deborah; Tannen, Deborah; Hamilton, Heidi Ehernberger (2003). ''The handbook of discourse analysis''.

==Internet, weblogging and social media==
In regards to the Internet as [[cultural artifact]] and information as [[complex adaptive system]] with [[emergent properties]] of open discourse such as [[Blog|weblogs]] and [[social media]], Boyd (February 2009) holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Web is the most important and valuable human artifact ever created. And, it is not owned by any single group, government, company, or person. It is not patented, no one is in charge, and we have no idea whatsoever as to how much we have invested in it, or even how much it costs us to keep it running.... The Web – and in particular the rise of the so-called blogosphere – has led to a resurgence of open public discourse that is unparalleled since the emergence of independent newspapers and pamphleteers at the outset of the Industrial revolution. The Web has grown from a handful of websites to millions of individuals and organizations publishing on every conceivable topic from every imaginable perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Stowe (February 2009). "Open Social Discourse and Web Culture." ''We Magazine''. Source: [http://www.we-magazine.net/we-volume-02/open-social-discourse-and-web-culture/] (accessed: Monday April 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Open discourse as open-endedness: text and context as living document==
Open discourse as [[living document]] may also be understood as the open-endedness in both a communication event and the inability to collapse a communication event into definitives, the unequivocal import of a cultural artifact and the associated inability to resolve ambiguity due to noise and ever-changing context and audience, as Graham (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;5) further states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...I  understand  the  play  on  multiplicity  of  interpretation  and  open‐endedness  that  ambiguity signifies  however,  the  term  ambiguous  is  itself  ambiguous  –  it  not  only  means  “open  to various interpretations” but also “of doubtful and uncertain nature; difficult to understand” and “lacking clearness or definiteness, obscure” (Macquarie Essential Dictionary, 1999: 23).&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Linda J.(2005). "Discourse analysis and the critical use of Foucault." Queensland University of Technology. Paper presented at Australian Association for Research in Education; 2005 Annual Conference, Sydney: 27th November – 1st December.

==Medicine, scientific publishing and pharmacology==
Dayton (2006) frames the transition from open access to open discourse in the [[Internet]] discourse community in regards to the parameters of scientific publishing thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [I]nternet is expanding the realm of scientific publishing to include free and open public debate of published papers. Journals are beginning to support web posting of comments on their published articles and independent organizations are providing centralized web sites for posting comments about any published article. The trend promises to give one and all access to read and contribute to cutting edge scientific criticism and debate." [http://internetisapropernoun.net/ NB: proper noun of 'Internet' repaired from the error 'internet'.]&lt;ref&gt;Dayton, Andrew (2006). "Beyond open access: open discourse, the next great equalizer." ''Retrovirology''. Source: [http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/55] (accessed: Monday April 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Urban planning and public discourse==
Ter Borg and Dijking (1995) explore discourse control in relation to [[urban planning]], [[urban development]], [[public participation]] and [[stakeholder engagement]] in their analysis of two [[case studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth ter Borg &amp; Gertjan Dijkink (1995). "Naturalising Choices and Neutralising Voices? Discourse on Urban Development in Two Cities." ''Urban Studies'', Vol. 32, No. 1, pp.49-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogical discourse==
Dawson &amp; Taylor (1998) have documented experiential learnings of the logistics of open and critical discourse in the discourse community of the science classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Vaille M. &amp; Taylor, Peter C. (1998). "Establishing open and critical discourses in the science classroom: Reflecting on initial difficulties."  ''Research in Science Education''. Netherlands: Springer. ISSN 0157-244X (Print) 1573-1898 (Online). Volume 28, Number 3 / September, 1998. Source: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/up681k2252k73r52/] (accessed: Monday April 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In framing the relationship between the discourse community of a classroom and therefore [[pedagogical]] discourse throughout all media and associating open discourse to a democratic ideology Celce-Murcia &amp; Olshtain (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;11) hold that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...it is important that teachers understand what critical discourse analysis is and that they are at the very least sensitized to the potentially discriminatory and demeaning discourse that may arise in the classroom and in teaching materials and be prepared to deal with it constructively (i.e., to use such instances of discourse as opportunities for discussions and activities that can make the language classroom a more democratic and open discourse community)."&lt;ref&gt;Celce-Murcia, Marianne &amp; Olshtain, Elite (2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">An '''ordinary law''' is a normal [[law]], generally distinguished from a [[constitutional law]], [[organic law]], or other similar law. Typically, ordinary laws are subordinate to constitutional and organic laws, and are more easily changed than constitutional or organic laws, though that should not be assumed to be the case in all jurisdictions. (For example, the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] has ruled that Spain's [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Laws]] are not hierarchically superior to ordinary laws, but simply apply to different matters.&lt;ref&gt;Sentencia de 13 de febrero de 1981, Tribunal Constitucional de España&lt;/ref&gt;) Ordinary laws often govern areas beyond the scope of constitutional or organic laws.

Normally, in a democracy, an ordinary law must first obtain a [[majority|simple majority]] of a [[congress]], [[parliament]], or other legislature, and then be signed into law by the representative of [[executive power]]. The process leading to a legislative vote may vary vastly from one jurisdiction to another: the process may be initiated by either house of a [[bicameral legislature]] or from the sole house of a [[unicameral legislature]]; from the [[head of government]] or [[head of state]]; or by popular [[initiative]]. Different jurisdictions may allow ordinary laws to be proposed by one or all of these means, and may have restrictions on which body may take the initiative for certain types of laws (for example, in some bicameral systems, tax-related laws must begin in the lower chamber of the legislature). In some jurisdictions, the legislature has a means to override an executive [[veto]] by a [[supermajority]], or the voting populace have the means to override a law by a [[referendum]].

Under [[federalism|federal]] systems, ordinary laws may be created at the level of a [[sovereign state]] but also by its constituent components: for example, by [[states of the United States]] or [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Spain]].

'''Science North''' ({{lang-fr|Science Nord}}) is an interactive [[science museum]] in [[Greater Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Canada.

The science centre, which is [[Northern Ontario]]'s most popular tourist attraction, consists of two [[snowflake]]-shaped buildings on the southwestern shore of [[Ramsey Lake]], just south of the city's downtown core, and a former [[ice hockey]] arena which includes the complex's entrance and an [[IMAX]] theatre. The snowflake buildings are connected by a rock tunnel, which passes through a billion-year-old [[geologic fault]]. This fault line was not known to be under the complex during the construction of the building in the early 1980s. Where the walkway reaches the larger snowflake, the Vale Cavern [[auditorium]] is frequently used for temporary exhibits, [[press conference]]s, and other gala events by Science North and the wider community.

Inside the main building, a 20-metre [[fin whale]] skeleton recovered from [[Anticosti Island]] hangs from the ceiling.

The complex also features a boat tour, the ''William Ramsey'', which offers touring cruises of the scenic Ramsey Lake. The [[Jim Gordon (politician)|Jim Gordon]] [[Boardwalk]] also extends from the facility to the city's [[Bell Park (Sudbury)|Bell Park]] along the western shore of the lake.

The facility was designed by architect [[Raymond Moriyama]], one of the founding partners of Moriyama &amp; Teshima Architects, based in Toronto.

An agency of the provincial government of Ontario, Science North is overseen by the provincial [[Ministry of Culture (Ontario)|Ministry of Culture]].

==Facilities==

===First level===

* '''IMAX With Laser''' - Science North has a 3D [[IMAX with Laser]] theatre. The theatre opened in 1994, and was converted to 3D in February 2009.
* '''Planetarium''' - In June 2009 Science North added a planetarium. It has an 8-metre dome and 36 seats.
* '''Vale Cavern''' - Wildfires! A Firefighting Adventure in 3D
* '''TD Canada Trust Toddler's Treehouse''' - a children's educational play area

===Second level===

* '''[[Nature Exchange]]''' - visitors collect and research natural items from the wild and are swapped for points in a database. The points can be used to "purchase" other natural artifacts from around the world (i.e.: Rocks, sea shells, fossils, etc.)
* '''Lapidary Lab''' - Visitors learn how to cut, grind and polish rocks to turn them from ordinary stones into works of art.
* '''F. Jean MacLeod Butterfly Gallery''' - A glass-enclosed [[butterfly house]] home to more than 400 butterflies from 30 different tropical species.

===Third level===

The exhibits on the third floor are divided into four main areas:
* '''Northern Forests''' - This area focuses on animals who live in northern forests. Some of the animals ambassadors for the Northern Forest include Drifter and Kashkuanashku (Kash) the beavers, Maple the porcupine and Saunders the skunk. Other notable animals include the Northern Flying Squirrels, the Grey Rat Snake and the Big Brown bats. One of the biggest improvements to the third floor include a nocturnal room, allowing people to see active nocturnal animals during the day  and better equipment habitats for the animals and for visitors. Also, there is an intricate [[bee]] hive, behind a plate glass window, which allows visitors to see into the hive. 

* '''Lakes and Rivers''' - In this area, animals that live in rivers and lakes are featured. The animals ambassadors on this floor include Kash the Beaver, the Common Snapping Turtle, the Northern Water Snakes and local fish found in Northern Ontario Lakes. This sections allow people to get a better understanding of the aquatics systems that surround Northern Ontario and the difficulties and challenges these systems are currently facing. As well, the stream table (also known as the sand table) shows people what is erosion and how erosion can shape the landscape around us.
* '''Wetlands'''  - The wetlands area teaches about the complex wetlands ecosystems. With Lilly creek situated right beside Science North, people are able to go on Lilly Creek tours (weather permitting) and get a personal look of what makes wetland such an important landmass for our ecosystems. Some of the animal ambassadors include Northern Ontario frogs (including Green Frogs, Wood Frogs, Tree Frogs and Bullfrogs), American Toads, The Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake and the [[painted turtle]]. This section also houses the SO2 monitor, which measures the sulphur dioxide levels in Sudbury. There is also an interactive computer that displays the current reading of other sulphur dioxide monitors located throughout the Greater Sudbury region.
* '''Discovery Theatre''' - The discovery theatre is located in the centre of the third and fourth levels of Science North. Here, live science shows cover topics ranging from fire to sound. A daily schedule, located in front of the theatre and on the LCD screens around the Science Centre, is kept up to date and people can schedule their day around the shows they want to see. Usually, upbeat music will be played two minutes before the show starts to allow people to know the show is about to begin. Wheelchair accessibly is offered on the first, and third level of the discovery theater.
* '''The Northern Garden''' - The Northern Garden is located outside of the science centre. This gives people the opportunity to learn about native plant species in Northern Ontario, plant growth and general garden maintenance.

===Fourth level===
* '''BodyZone''' - BodyZone teaches about DNA and how it makes people unique, and how bodies work. There are also many exhibits allowing visitors to measure their performance, such as the race track. The Club Genome object theatre entrance is also in BodyZone.
* '''Racetrack''' - Build a race car and run it on the figure 8 track. This area also features a [[K'Nex]] table, a [[Lego]] play area, and the ball wall.
* '''[[FedNor]] CyberZone''' - The focus of CyberZone is on computer and communications technology. Visitors can mix music at the DJ station, play with green screen technology, and create stop-motion animation movies.
* '''Space Place''' - This lab focuses on astronomy and space exploration. Exhibits include a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} gravity well, a microgravity drop tower, exhibits on [[SNOLAB]], and information on Canadian space exploration. The entrance to the "Between the Stars" object theatre is also found in Space Place. This show explores the topic of dark matter - why we know it exists, and how we are trying to detect it. Between the Stars opened in June 2010 and is designed to appeal to all age ranges with a cartoon character named String Man narrating the story of a topic that is quite complex.
*''' TechLab''' - Technology and engineering area where visitors can create circuits, take apart old electronics, and play with pulleys and gears.

===Object theatres===

Special film and video exhibits which change over time; current exhibits include
* '''The [[Global warming]] Changing Climate Show''' -- narrated by [[Rick Mercer]] and talks about the change in climate. This show was updated and reopened in March 2011.
* '''Club Genome''' -- talks about DNA
* '''Legends of the Great Lakes''' -- This 16-minute show focuses on the bald eagle, the sturgeon, and the woodland caribou. The information is presented as a story that a father tells his daughter before they go to sleep while camping on the shores of Lake Superior.
* '''Between the Stars''' -- This show is on the science of dark matter. It lasts 16 minutes and features holographic technology, creating a 3-D effect. The main themes on the show are an exploration of the evidence for dark matter, what it might be, and how scientists are trying to detect it at [[SNOLAB]].
* ''' Ready, Set, Move!''' -- This fully immersive, active and interactive theatre will take you on a journey into the world of healthy living. Movement-sensing technology allows your own activity to contribute to the story. You will jump, dodge, twist and play throughout the show, your actions helping our heroine Anna and her quest to save her family from an ominous, dark fog.


===Outdoor grounds===

* '''Polaris Boulevard''' - is a line which reaches from a large sundial right up the side of the building which points directly at Polaris (the north star).
* '''Terra''' - Visited stand on this one-millionth scale world model, outdoors near Science North’s main entrance. At sunset and sunrise, the Earth's shadow moves across Canada. The benchmark at the centre of Terra is:  46° 28' 12.00" N and 80° 59' 45.70" W.
*''' a sculpture''' honouring local [[bush plane]] pilot [[Rusty Blakey]].
* '''Lily Creek''' - a marsh located opposite to the centre, Lily Creek is home to many species of creatures.
* '''The Northern Forest''' - This outdoor exhibit features many of the tree species grown in northern Ontario that Domtar relies on for its sawmills and for the manufacture of pulp and paper at the Espanola mill.

==Other activities==

Science North, which was opened in 1984, also owns and operates Sudbury's [[Dynamic Earth]] facility, an earth sciences exhibition which is home to the [[Big Nickel]], one of the city's most famous landmarks. From January 22, 2001 to May 10, 2003, the Big Nickel was temporarily located on the primary Science North grounds while Dynamic Earth was under construction.

The [[Science North Production Team]] produces object theatres, multi-media presentations and large format film productions for science museums and educational facilities around North America.

Science North's former science director, [[Alan Nursall]], is a correspondent for the Canadian science newsmagazine series ''[[Daily Planet (TV series)|Daily Planet]]'', which airs on [[Discovery Channel Canada]] and [[CTV television network|CTV]]. The institution's first science director, [[David Pearson (scientist)|David Pearson]], returned to the position in 2007.

Science North has also worked extensively with the city's [[Laurentian University]] on scientific and environmental research and as a partner in the university's graduate program in [[science communication]].

Science North runs [[day camps]] in the summer, autumn, and winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Science North Fall/Winter Programs|url=https://webapps.sciencenorth.ca/4DACTION/W_Camps?fallwinter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Summer Science Camps|url=http://sciencenorth.ca/promos/summercamps/index.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12099">[[Image:ESAG office.jpg|thumb|alt=neo-classical house at Eretria|The Swiss School house at Eretria]]
The '''Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece''' ([http://www.esag.swiss ESAG]) ({{lang-fr|École Suisse d'Archéologie en Grèce}}; {{lang-de|Schweizer Archäologische Schule in Griechenland}}; {{lang-it|Scuola Elvetica d'Archeologia in Grecia}}; {{lang-el|Ελβετική Αρχαιολογική Σχολή στην Ελλάδα}}) is one of the [[List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece|foreign archaeological institutes]] operating in [[Greece]]. 
Since 1964, the Swiss archaeologists have been excavating the remains of the ancient site of [[Eretria]] ([[Euboea]]), a medium-sized city which has extensively contributed to the development and the influence of the Greek civilisation. Hosted in [[Switzerland]] by the [[University of Lausanne]], the Swiss School has its head office in [[Athens]], in an Art Nouveau building at Odos Skaramanga 4B. The school has also offices in a 19th-century neoclassical house in Eretria, Odos Apostoli 15.

== History ==

Swiss archaeologists started to work in [[Euboea]] in April 1964, but the Greek Archaeological Council had already accepted the principle of Swiss participation in the excavation and study of the ruins of [[Eretria]] in 1962. 
Vasilis Petrakos, who was then the epimelete in charge of Eretria, had drawn the attention of the Greek archaeological authorities to the threat to Eretria's ancient remains posed by the development of the small modern town. In fact, no other foreign archaeological team had been involved in studying the site since 1895, when the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]] completed its work. 
In 1975, after the end of the rule of the [[Greece|military junta]] (1967–1974), the Swiss Mission requested and received the title, habitual in Greece, of "School of Archaeology". 
The activities of the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece in Eretria are multiple: they include the exploration of the city's past by the excavation of its ruins, the study of the material discovered, the publication of research, the preservation of archaeological remains in the field and in the Museum, and their development and presentation to the public.

== A few milestones ==
[[Image:Heroon.jpg|thumb|alt=Eretria geometric heroon|The geometric Heroon]]

The forty years of Swiss archaeological excavations in [[Eretria]] (1964–2004) can be divided into three phases. 
The first phase, which extends from the beginning until 1982, is that of the great discoveries: the rich necropolis from the [[Geometric Period]] ([[Heroon]]), the structures predating the temple of [[Apollo]] Daphnephoros uncovered under the foundations of the 6th century BC temple, and the sumptuous dwellings of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]]-[[Hellenistic Period]], including the [http://www.unil.ch/esag/page20777_en.html House of the Mosaics]. 
The second phase, from 1982 to 1995, is that of consolidation, research on the material excavated, and finally a more moderate extension of the terrain (the West Quarter, the North Gymnasium, the acropolis, the Sacrificial area north of the Sanctuary of Apollo). 
The third phase (1996–2009) is marked by a new spurt of excavation activity with the exploration of a sector located not far from the House of the Mosaics, which led to the discovery of the Industrial Quarter as well as remains going back to the second millennium BC.

== Funding research ==

During the first eighteen years of its existence (1964–1982), the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece, relied on the [[Swiss National Science Foundation]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20101101112619/http://www.snf.ch/E/pages/default.aspx SNF)] as the sole source of financial support for its activities. 
Created in 1983, the "Foundation of the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece" assumed responsibility for high-level administration and for seeking indispensable financial income from various donors: patrons, foundations, industries and companies, Swiss universities, and the Swiss Academy of Human and Social Sciences ([http://www.sagw.ch/sagw.html SAGW)]. 
The [[University of Lausanne]] ([http://www.unil.ch/index.html UNIL)], which has served as the Foundation's headquarters in [[Switzerland]] since 1982, plays a crucial role in its organization. 

== Research and training ==

Thanks to the excavations it has conducted and the research it has organized -from the study of the data gathered in the field to their publication- the Swiss School of Archaeology in Greece provides a valuable framework for cultural exchange: many professors, doctoral candidates, advanced students, and interns from Swiss universities have in fact taken part in the activities of the School and in the study of [[Eretria]]'s past. It is clear that much remains to be discovered. Only a tiny part of ancient Eretria has been excavated, while the materials deposited in the Museum and the documentation of older excavations have not yet yielded all the information they hold. In the years to come, we hope to learn more about the beginnings of the city and about the occupation of the territory, to cite only a few of the research projects underway. 
All the projects are subject to the authorization of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081220075235/http://www.culture.gr/war/index_en.jsp Greek government's Ministry of Culture], and the provision of advance notice to the Ephorate of Euboean Antiquities, which is also responsible for overseeing the activities.

== Restoration, preservation, and publications ==
[[Image:Theatre3.jpg|thumb|alt=aerial view of the ancient theater at Eretria|The theater]]

The School has conceived, financed and carried out the expansion of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071025041553/http://www.unil.ch/esag/page27319.html archaeological Museum], as well as the construction of a pavilion to protect and display the mosaics of the [http://www.unil.ch/esag/page20777_en.html House of the Mosaics] (1987–1991). It preserves and maintains the archaeological remains it excavates. It has proposed various projects for the preservation and presentation of the [http://www3.unil.ch/esag/theater/www.easyknow.ch/eretria/files/home.html Theater]. 
The results of its investigations are published annually in the Swiss journal [https://web.archive.org/web/20090331162227/http://www.antikekunst.ch/index.php?lang=en Antike Kunst] and summaries appear in the series [https://web.archive.org/web/20090825141124/http://www.unil.ch/esag/page20444_en.html Eretria, Excavations and Researches] (20 volumes published to date). Eretria has continued to provide numerous subjects for articles, books and university dissertations.

== Archaeology and modern urban development ==

From the outset, the School has taken an interest in the origins of the modern town of [[Eretria]]. In 1974‒75, a team from the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich]] drew up a map showing numerous [http://www.unil.ch/esag/page38793.html 19th-century houses] and proposed that they be preserved. A project was submitted to municipal and governmental authorities, and then presented in two exhibitions, one in Eretria, the other in [[Athens]]. 
The creation of an archaeological zone in the region between the Temple of [[Apollo]] Daphnephoros and the House of the Mosaics, which constituted an important part of the 1975 project, has sporadically inspired interest. 
In 1998, the Swiss School gave a new impulse to studies on modern and contemporary Eretria that led to the publication of a book. 
In terms of specific accomplishments, the School has restored a 19th-century house that belonged to Admiral Nikodimos, one of the heroes of the [[Greek War of Independence]], and also established its headquarters in Eretria.

'''Transdisciplinarity''' connotes a research strategy that crosses many [[Discipline (academia)|disciplinary]] boundaries to create a [[Holism|holistic]] approach. It applies to research efforts focused on problems that cross the boundaries of two or more disciplines, such as research on effective [[information system]]s for [[biomedical research]] (see [[bioinformatics]]), and can refer to concepts or methods that were originally developed by one discipline, but are now used by several others, such as [[ethnography]], a field research method originally developed in [[anthropology]] but now widely used by other disciplines.
The Belmont Forum &lt;ref&gt;http://www.belmontforum.org&lt;/ref&gt; elaborated that a transdisciplinary approach is enabling inputs and scoping across scientific and non-scientific stakeholder communities and facilitating a systemic way of addressing a challenge. This includes initiatives that support the capacity building required for the successful transdisciplinary formulation and implementation of research actions.

==Usage==
Transdisciplinarity has two common meanings:

===German usage===
In German-speaking countries, ''Transdisziplinarität'' refers to the integration of diverse forms of research, and includes specific methods for relating knowledge in problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;Mittelstrass 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 conference held at the [[University of Göttingen]] showcased the diverse meanings of multi-, inter- and transdisciplinarity and made suggestions for converging them without eliminating present usages.&lt;ref&gt;Brand/Schaller/Völker 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

When the very nature of a problem is under dispute, transdisciplinarity can help determine the most relevant problems and research questions involved.&lt;ref&gt;(Funtowicz &amp; Ravetz 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; A first type of question concerns the cause of the present problems and their future development (system knowledge). Another concerns which values and norms can be used to form goals of the problem-solving process (target knowledge). A third relates to how a problematic situation can be transformed and improved (transformation knowledge). Transdisciplinarity requires adequate addressing of the complexity of problems and the diversity of perceptions of them, that abstract and case-specific knowledge are linked, and that practices promote the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch Hadorn et al. 2008, Jaeger &amp; Scheringer 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Transdisciplinarity arises when participating experts interact in an open discussion and dialogue, giving equal weight to each perspective and relating them to each other. This is difficult because of the overwhelming amount of information involved, and because of incommensurability of specialized languages in each field of expertise. To excel under these conditions, researchers need not only in-depth knowledge and know-how of the disciplines involved, but skills in moderation, mediation, association and transfer.

===Wider usage===
Transdisciplinarity is also used to signify a unity of knowledge beyond disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolescu 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Piaget]] introduced this usage of the term in 1970, and in 1987, the International Center for Transdisciplinary Research (CIRET) adopted the Charter of Transdisciplinarity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inters.org/Freitas-Morin-Nicolescu-Transdisciplinarity Charter of Transdisciplinarity]&lt;/ref&gt; at the 1st World Congress of Transdisciplinarity, Convento da Arrabida, Portugal, November 1994.

In the CIRET approach, transdisciplinarity is radically distinct from [[interdisciplinarity]]. Interdisciplinarity, like pluridisciplinarity, concerns the transfer of methods from one discipline to another, allowing research to spill over disciplinary boundaries, but staying within the framework of disciplinary research.

As the prefix "trans" indicates, transdisciplinarity concerns that which is at once between the disciplines, across the different disciplines, and beyond each individual discipline. Its goal is the understanding of the present world, of which one of the imperatives is the overarching unity of knowledge.

Another critical defining characteristic of transdisciplinary research is the inclusion of stakeholders in defining research objectives and strategies in order to better incorporate the diffusion of learning produced by the research. Collaboration between stakeholders is deemed essential&amp;nbsp;– not merely at an academic or disciplinary collaboration level, but through active collaboration with people affected by the research and community-based stakeholders. In such a way, transdisciplinary collaboration becomes uniquely capable of engaging with different ways of knowing the world, generating new knowledge, and helping stakeholders understand and incorporate the results or lessons learned by the research.&lt;ref&gt;Wickson, F., Carew, A.L. &amp; Russell, A.W. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Transdisciplinarity is defined by [[Basarab Nicolescu]] through three methodological postulates: the existence of levels of Reality, the logic of the included middle, and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Transdisciplinarity&amp;nbsp;– Theory and Practice (Ed.), Hampton Press, Cresskill, NJ, USA, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of several levels of Reality the space between disciplines and beyond disciplines is full of information. Disciplinary research concerns, at most, one and the same level of Reality ; moreover, in most cases, it only concerns fragments of one level of Reality. On the contrary, transdisciplinarity concerns the dynamics engendered by the action of several levels of Reality at once. The discovery of these dynamics necessarily passes through disciplinary knowledge. While not a new discipline or a new superdiscipline, transdisciplinarity is nourished by disciplinary research; in turn, disciplinary research is clarified by transdisciplinary knowledge in a new, fertile way. In this sense, disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are not antagonistic but complementary. As in the case of disciplinarity, transdisciplinary research is not antagonistic but complementary to multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity research.

According to Nicolescu, transdisciplinarity is nevertheless radically distinct from multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity because of its goal, the understanding of the present world, which cannot be accomplished in the framework of disciplinary research.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The goal of multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity always remains within the framework of disciplinary research. If transdisciplinarity is often confused with interdisciplinarity or multidisciplinarity (and by the same token, we note that interdisciplinarity is often confused with multidisciplinarity) this is explained in large part by the fact that all three overflow disciplinary boundaries. Advocates maintain this confusion hides the huge potential of transdisciplinarity.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2010). Theme-based research in the transdisciplinary field of educational linguistics. In F.M. Hult (Ed.), ''Directions and prospects for educational linguistics'' (pp. 19-32). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, transdisciplinarity is a consolidated academic field that is giving rise to new applied researches, especially in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean. In this sense, the [[transdisciplinary]] and [[biomimetics]] research of Javier Collado &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Coevolution in the Big History - a transdisciplinary and biomimetic introduction to the Sustainable Development Goals |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |url=http://www.globaleducationmagazine.com/tesis-doctoral-Javier-Collado-Ruano-Coevoluci%C3%B3n-en-la-Gran-Historia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Big History]] represents an ecology of knowledge between scientific knowledge and the ancestral wisdom of [[native peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador]]. According to Collado,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bioethics as a transdisciplinary science of complexity: a coevolutive introduction from the Big History |first=Javier |last=Collado-Ruano |page=56 |url=http://www.redalyc.org/html/1892/189246655004/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the transdisciplinary methodology applied in the field of [[Big History]] seeks to understand the interconnections of the human race with the different levels of reality that co-exist in nature and in the cosmos, and this includes mystical and spiritual experiences, very present in the rituals of [[shamanism]] with [[ayahuasca]] and other sacred plants. In abstract, the teaching of [[Big History]] in universities of [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Argentina]] implies a transdisciplinary vision that integrates and unifies diverse epistemes that are in, between, and beyond the scientific disciplines, that is, including ancestral wisdom, [[spirituality]], [[art]], emotions, mystical experiences and other dimensions forgotten in the [[history of science]], specially by the positivist approach.

==Arts and humanities==
Transdisciplinarity can be found in the arts and humanities. For example, the [[Planetary Collegium]] seeks "the development of transdisciplinary discourse in the convergence of art, science, technology and consciousness research." The [http://www.plasticites-sciences-arts.org/plasticities-sciences-arts/ Plasticities Sciences Arts] (PSA) research group also develops transdisiciplinary approaches regarding humanities and fundamental sciences relationships as well as the Art &amp; Science field.

==Global education==
Transdisciplinarity can be also found in Global Education. For example, [[Global Education Magazine]], an international journal supported by [[UNESCO]] and [[UNHCR]]:
"transdisciplinarity represents the capable germ to promote an endogenous development of the evolutionary spirit of internal critical consciousness, where religion and science are complementary. Respect, solidarity and cooperation should be global standards for the entire human development with no boundaries. This requires a radical change in the ontological models of sustainable development, global education and world-society. We must rely on the recognition of a plurality of models, cultures and socio-economical diversification. As well as biodiversity is the way for the emergence of new species, cultural diversity represents the creative potential of world-society." &lt;ref&gt;Transdisciplinary Education as Ethic of the Diversity Reform in the World-Society of the 21st Century, article published by Javier Collado on June 20th: World Refugee Day in Global Education Magazine, {{ISSN|2255-033X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human sciences==
The range of transdisciplinarity becomes clear when the four central questions of biological research ((1) ''[[Causality|causation]]'', (2) ''[[ontogeny]],'' (3) [[adaptation]], (4) [[phylogeny]] [after [[Niko Tinbergen]] 1963, see also [[Tinbergen's four questions]], cf. [[Aristotle]]: Causality / Four Major Causes]) are graphed against distinct levels of analysis (e.g. [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], ''[[individual]], [[Group (sociology)|group]]''; [cf. "Laws about the Levels of Complexity" of [[Nicolai Hartmann]] 1940/1964, see also [[Rupert Riedl]] 1984]):&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from Medicus 2005, with the authors permission&lt;/ref&gt;

In this "scheme of transdisciplinarity", all anthropological disciplines (paragraph C in the table of the pdf-file below), their questions (paragraph A: see pdf-file) and results (paragraph B: see pdf-file) can be intertwined and allocated with each other for examples how these aspects go into those little boxes in the matrix, see e.g. the table {{cite web|title=The Framework of Anthropological Research|url=http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/4BQ_E.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707071403/http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/4BQ_E.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-07|df=}} This chart includes all realms of anthropological research (no one is excluded). It is the starting point for a systematical order for all human sciences, and also a source for a consistent networking and structuring of their results. This "bio-psycho-social" orientation framework is the basis for the development of the "Fundamental Theory of Human Sciences" and for a transdisciplinary consensus. (In this tabulated orientation matrix the questions and reference levels in ''italics'' are also the subject of the humanities.). Niko Tinbergen was familiar with both conceptual categories (i.e. the four central questions of biological research and the levels of analysis), the tabulation was made by [[Gerhard Medicus]]. Certainly, a humanist perspective always involves a transdisciplinary focus. A good and classic example of mixing very different sciences was the work developed by Leibniz in seventeenth-eighteenth centuries in order to create a universal system of justice.&lt;ref&gt;See José Andrés-Gallego, 42. "Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related? Leibniz's Universal (Chinese) Dream": Journal of Mixed Methods Research, 29(2) (2015): 118-132: http://mmr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/118.abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>I only changed the way the vector \mathbf{r} was written in terms of the unit radial vector. That is, I only made the text clearer, following the standard convention. Before, it was written (r,0,0) leading to a possible misunderstanding, since it leads someone to think about cartesian components of a vector.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12924">In [[mathematics]], '''vector spherical harmonics (VSH)''' are an extension of the scalar [[spherical harmonics]] for use with [[vector field]]s. The components of the VSH are [[complex-valued]] functions expressed in the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinate basis vectors]].

==Definition==
Several conventions have been used to define the VSH.&lt;ref&gt;
R.G. Barrera, G.A. Estévez and J. Giraldo, ''Vector spherical harmonics and their application to magnetostatics'', Eur. J. Phys. '''6''' 287-294 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Carrascal, G.A. Estevez, P. Lee and V. Lorenzo '' Vector spherical harmonics and their application to classical electrodynamics'', Eur. J. Phys., '''12''', 184-191 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
E. L. Hill, ''The theory of Vector Spherical Harmonics'', Am. J. Phys. '''22''', 211-214 (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
E. J. Weinberg, ''Monopole vector spherical harmonics'', Phys. Rev. D. '''49''', 1086-1092 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Morse and H. Feshbach, ''Methods of Theoretical Physics, Part II'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1898-1901 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt; 
We follow that of Barrera ''et al.''. Given a scalar [[spherical harmonic]] {{math|''Y&lt;sub&gt;ℓm&lt;/sub&gt;''(''θ'', ''φ'')}}, we define three VSH:

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm} = Y_{lm}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm} = r\nabla Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm} = \mathbf{r}\times\nabla Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt; being the [[unit vector]] along the radial direction in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; the vector along the radial direction with the same norm as the radius, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = r\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;. The radial factors are included to guarantee that the dimensions of the VSH are the same as those of the ordinary spherical harmonics and that the VSH do not depend on the radial spherical coordinate.

The interest of these new vector fields is to separate the radial dependence from the angular one when using spherical coordinates, so that a vector field admits a [[multipole expansion]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}=\sum_{l=0}^\infty\sum_{m=-l}^l\left(E^r_{lm}(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}+E^{(1)}_{lm}(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}+E^{(2)}_{lm}(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The labels on the components reflect that &lt;math&gt;E^r_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; is the radial component of the vector field, while &lt;math&gt;E^{(1)}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^{(2)}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; are transverse components (w.r.to the radius vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;).

==Main Properties==

===Symmetry===
Like the scalar spherical harmonics, the VSH satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{Y}^*_{lm}\qquad\mathbf{\Psi}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{lm}\qquad\mathbf{\Phi}_{l,-m} = (-1)^m \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

which cuts the number of independent functions roughly in half. The star * indicates [[complex conjugate]].

===Orthogonality===

The VSH are [[orthogonal functions|orthogonal]] in the usual three-dimensional way at a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}=0\qquad\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}=0\qquad\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}=0&lt;/math&gt;

They are also orthogonal in the Hilbert space

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{Y}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = \delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = l(l+1)\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = l(l+1)\delta_{ll'}\delta_{mm'}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\cdot  \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{l'm'}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega  = 0&lt;/math&gt;

An additional result at a single point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; (not reported in Barrera et al, 1985) is (for all &lt;math&gt;l,m,l',m'&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Psi}_{l'm'}=0\qquad\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}_{l'm'}=0&lt;/math&gt;

===Vector multipole moments===
The orthogonality relations allow one to compute the spherical multipole moments of a vector field as

:&lt;math&gt;E^r_{lm} = \int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{Y}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^{(1)}_{lm} = \frac{1}{l(l+1)}\int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{\Psi}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E^{(2)}_{lm} = \frac{1}{l(l+1)}\int \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{\Phi}^*_{lm}\,\mathrm{d}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

===The gradient of a scalar field===
Given the [[multipole expansion]] of a scalar field

: &lt;math&gt;\phi = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \phi_{lm}(r) Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

we can express its gradient in terms of the VSH as

: &lt;math&gt;\nabla\phi = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r} \mathbf{Y}_{lm}+
\frac{\phi_{lm}}{r}\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Divergence===
For any multipole field we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}f\right)Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right) = -\frac{l(l+1)}{r}fY_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

By superposition we obtain the [[divergence]] of any vector field

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E^r_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}E^r_{lm}-\frac{l(l+1)}{r}E^{(1)}_{lm}\right)Y_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

we see that the component on {{math|'''Φ'''&lt;sub&gt;''ℓm''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is always [[solenoidal]].

===Curl===
For any multipole field we have

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}\right) =-\frac{1}{r}f\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}f\right)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\left(f(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right) = -\frac{l(l+1)}{r}f\mathbf{Y}_{lm}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}f\right)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

By superposition we obtain the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of any vector field

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\mathbf{E} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-l}^l
\left(-\frac{l(l+1)}{r}E^{(2)}_{lm}\mathbf{Y}_{lm}-\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}E^{(2)}_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+
\frac{1}{r}E^{(2)}_{lm}\right)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}+
\left(-\frac{1}{r}E^r_{lm}+\frac{\mathrm{d}E^{(1)}_{lm}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{1}{r}E^{(1)}_{lm}\right)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Laplacian===
Action of the [[Laplace operator]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta = \nabla\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt; separates as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\left(f(r)\mathbf{Z}_{lm}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} r^2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \right)\mathbf{Z}_{lm}
+ f(r)\Delta \mathbf{Z}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_{lm} = \mathbf{Y}_{lm}, \mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}, \mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{Y}_{lm} = -\frac{1}{r^2}(2+l(l+1))\mathbf{Y}_{lm} +\frac{2}{r^2}\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm} = \frac{2}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{Y}_{lm} -\frac{1}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm} = -\frac{1}{r^2}l(l+1)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also note that this action becomes [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]], i.e. the off-diagonal coefficients are equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{r^2}\sqrt{l(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;, for the properly [[Unit vector|normalized]] VSH.

==Examples==

===First vector spherical harmonics===

* &lt;math&gt;l=0&lt;/math&gt;

:* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{00}= \sqrt{\frac{1}{4\pi}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

:* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{00}= \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;

:* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{00}= \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;l=1&lt;/math&gt;

:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{10}= \sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{11}= -\sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}}\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\varphi}\sin\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{11}= -\sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}}\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\varphi}\left(\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}+\mathrm{i}\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{10}= -\sqrt{\frac{3}{4\pi}}\sin\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{11}= \sqrt{\frac{3}{8\pi}}\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\varphi}\left(\mathrm{i}\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}-\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;l=2&lt;/math&gt;

:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{20}= \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\frac{5}{\pi}}\,(3\cos^{2}\theta-1)\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{21}= -\sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}}\,\sin\theta\,\cos\theta\,e^{i\varphi}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}_{22}= \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\frac{15}{2\pi}}\,\sin^{2}\theta\,e^{2i\varphi}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{20}= -\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{\frac{5}{\pi}}\,\sin\theta\,\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{21}= -\sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}}\,e^{i\varphi}\,\left(\cos 2\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}+\mathrm{i}\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Psi}_{22}= \sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}}\,\sin\theta\,e^{2i\varphi}\,\left(\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}+\mathrm{i}\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{20}= -\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{\frac{5}{\pi}}\sin\theta\,\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{21}= \sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}}\,e^{i\varphi}\,\left(\mathrm{i}\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}-\cos 2\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Phi}_{22}= \sqrt{\frac{15}{8\pi}}\,\sin\theta\,e^{2i\varphi}\,\left(-\mathrm{i}\,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}+\cos\theta\,\hat{\mathbf{\varphi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for negative values of m are obtained applying the symmetry relations.

==Applications==

===Electrodynamics===
The VSH are especially useful in the study of [[Electromagnetic wave equation#Multipole expansion|multipole radiation fields]]. For instance, a magnetic multipole is due to an oscillating current with angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and complex amplitude

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{J}}= J(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding electric and magnetic fields can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{E}}= E(r)\mathbf{\Phi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{B}}= B^r(r)\mathbf{Y}_{lm}+B^{(1)}(r)\mathbf{\Psi}_{lm}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into Maxwell equations, Gauss' law is automatically satisfied

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\hat{\mathbf{E}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

while Faraday's law decouples in

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\hat{\mathbf{E}}=-\mathrm{i}\omega\hat{\mathbf{B}}\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad
\left\{\begin{array}{l}\displaystyle \frac{l(l+1)}{r}E = \mathrm{i}\omega B^r \\ \ \\ 
\displaystyle\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}r} +\frac{E}{r}= \mathrm{i}\omega B^{(1)}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Gauss' law for the magnetic field implies

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\hat{\mathbf{B}} = 0\quad\Rightarrow \quad\frac{\mathrm{d}B^r}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{2}{r}B^r - \frac{l(l+1)}{r}B^{(1)}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and Ampère-Maxwell's equation gives

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times\hat{\mathbf{B}} = \mu_0 \hat{\mathbf{J}} + \mathrm{i}\mu_0\varepsilon_0\omega \hat{\mathbf{E}} \quad\Rightarrow\quad -\frac{B^r}{r}+\frac{\mathrm{d}B^{(1)}}{\mathrm{d}r}+\frac{B^{(1)}}{r} = \mu_0J+\mathrm{i}\omega\mu_0\varepsilon_0E&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, the partial differential equations have been transformed into a set of ordinary differential equations.

===Fluid dynamics===

In the calculation of the [[Stokes' law]] for the drag that a viscous fluid exerts on a small spherical particle, the velocity distribution obeys [[Navier-Stokes equations]] neglecting inertia, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot \mathbf{v} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0} = -\nabla p + \eta \nabla^2\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

with the boundary conditions

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\quad (r=a)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = -\mathbf{U}_0\quad (r\to\infty)&lt;/math&gt;

being '''U''' the relative velocity of the particle to the fluid far from the particle. In spherical coordinates this velocity at infinity can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}_0 = U_0\left(\cos\theta\, \hat{\mathbf{r}} - \sin\theta \,\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right) = U_0 \left(\mathbf{Y}_{10} + \mathbf{\Psi}_{10}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

The last expression suggest an expansion on spherical harmonics for the liquid velocity and the pressure

:&lt;math&gt;p=p(r)Y_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = v^r(r) \mathbf{Y}_{10} + v^{(1)}(r) \mathbf{\Psi}_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution in the Navier-Stokes equations produces a set of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients.
