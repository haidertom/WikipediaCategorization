This article presents lists of the literary events and publications in '''1593'''.

==Events==
*Ongoing – The London theatres remain closed for almost the entire year, due to the outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] that began the previous year.

Part of the [[AFI 100 Years... series]], '''AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars''' is a list of the top 25 male and 25 female greatest screen legends of [[Cinema of the United States|American film history]]. The list was unveiled by the [[American Film Institute]] on June 15, 1999, in a [[CBS]] special hosted by [[Shirley Temple]], with 50 current actors making the presentations.

The American Film Institute defined an "American screen legend" as an actor or a team of actors during the [[Classical Hollywood cinema]] era with a significant screen presence in American feature-length (40 min or more) films whose screen debut occurred in or before 1950, or whose screen debut occurred after 1950, but whose death has marked a completed body of work.

The top stars of their respective gender are [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]]. They starred together in the classic adventure 1951 film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'', for which Bogart won his only [[Academy Award]].

[[File:Klee, paul, angelus novus, 1920.jpg|''Angelus Novus''|thumb|right|240px]]

'''''Angelus Novus''''' (New Angel) is a 1920 [[monoprint]] by the Swiss-German artist [[Paul Klee]], using the oil transfer method he invented. It is now in the collection of the [[Israel Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]].

In the ninth thesis of his 1940 essay “[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]”, the German critic and philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]], who purchased the print in 1921, interprets it this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Klee painting named ''Angelus Novus'' shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, "[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]", Illuminations, trans.

Otto Karl Werckmeister notes that Benjamin's reading of Klee's New Angel image has led to it becoming "an icon of the [[political left|left]]."&lt;ref&gt;Werkmeister, ''Icons of the Left: Benjamin and Einstein, Picasso and Kafka After the Fall.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name and concept of the angel has inspired works by other artists, filmmakers, writers and musicians, including [[John Akomfrah]], [[Ariella Azoulay]], [[Carolyn Forché]], and [[Rabih Alameddine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lux.org.uk/collection/works/last-angel-history|title= ''Last Angel of History''|year=2013|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zingmagazine.com/zing6/reviews/angelus.html|title= zing6 - reviews - angelus nova|publisher=''Zing Magazine''|year=1997|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/sandh/2000/june00/munchener.htm|title= Seventh Munchener Biennale|date=4–19 May 2000|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1940 Walter Benjamin committed suicide during an attempt to flee the Nazi regime. After World War II Walter Benjamin’s lifelong friend, [[Gershom Scholem]] (1897–1982), the distinguished scholar of Jewish mysticism, inherited the drawing. According to Scholem, Benjamin felt a mystical identification with the ''Angelus Novus'' and incorporated it in his theory of the “angel of history,” a melancholy view of historical process as an unceasing cycle of despair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/collections/item.asp?itemNum=199799 Angelus Novus] at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Animal Wall''' ({{lang-cy|Mur Anifeiliaid}}) is a sculptured wall depicting 15 animals in the [[Castle Quarter]] of the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]] of [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].  It is a Grade I [[Listed building|listed]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-21696-animal-wall-and-gates-near-clock-tower-ca|title=Animal Wall, and Gates near Clock Tower, Castle|work=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Animal Wall Cardiff.jpg|left|thumb|The Animal Wall in front of [[Cardiff Castle]] (''c.'' 1890)]] 
The Animal Wall was designed by [[William Burges]] in 1866, but it was not built until 1890, after  Burges's death in 1881. The work of the restoration of [[Cardiff Castle]] and the building of the Animal Wall for the [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute|Marquess of Bute]], was continued by his former assistant [[William Frame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cardiffcastle.com/past/timeline.htm Cardiff Castle timeline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222202520/http://www.cardiffcastle.com/past/timeline.htm |date=December 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original nine animal figures were sculptured by [[Thomas Nicholls (sculptor)|Thomas Nicholls]], they were the hyena, wolf, baboons, seal, bear, lioness, lynx, and 2 different lions. They were painted in naturalistic colours, although since then the paint work on the sculptures has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8789000/8789652.stm Cardiff Castle's animal wall under repair]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Date"&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/06/24/do-you-nose-how-castle-sculpture-used-to-look-91466-23959625/ Do you nose how castle sculpture used to look?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011034406/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/06/24/do-you-nose-how-castle-sculpture-used-to-look-91466-23959625/ |date=October 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wall was moved about {{convert|50|m|ft}} from outside Cardiff Castle to its present location outside [[Bute Park]] in 1922, due to road widening in front of the castle in Duke Street and Castle Street (now the [[A4161 road|A4161]]). 

In 1931 a further six animals were added; the pelican, ant-eater, raccoons, leopard, beaver and vulture.&lt;ref name="Date"/&gt; They were all sculptured by Alexander Carrick.&lt;ref name="Date"/&gt; 

The original nine, sculpted by Thomas Nicholls, had glass eyes and were painted in naturalistic colours to make them seem even more lifelike. But the paint peeled after a couple of years and was never replaced, leaving the bare stone seen today.

The animals reached the peak of their popularity in the 1930s when the South Wales Echo ran a children’s cartoon strip – the Keepers of the Wall – that depicted them involved in adventures around the city.

Penned by Dorothy Howard Rowlands characters included William the seal, Priscilla the pelican, Martha and Oscar the monkeys; however, the statues are actually baboons. Larry the lynx and Romulus and Remus the two lions.

The inside of the castle also features animals carved in stone, including many lions, as these were a symbol of Lord Bute’s family.

In the 1970s Council planners had wanted to demolish the Animal Wall to widen the Castle Street again, but this idea was later abandoned.&lt;ref name="Date"/&gt;

As part of a £5.6 million refurbishment of [[Bute Park]], restoration of the animals began in July 2010. During the repair, the anteater's nose, which has been missing since the late 90s, was replaced as well as the missing glass eyes in the nine original animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/cardiffonline/cardiff-news/2010/07/07/animals-watching-from-the-wall-get-a-makeover-91466-26800631/ WalesOnline | Work starts on Bute Park 'Animal Wall']&lt;/ref&gt; This work was completed in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav%3D2868%2C4407%2C4413%2C5511%2C5625%26parent_directory_id%3D2865 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926154756/http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2868%2C4407%2C4413%2C5511%2C5625&amp;parent_directory_id=2865 |archivedate=2012-09-26 |df= }}[[Cardiff Council]] | HLF (Heritage Lottery Fund) Bute Park Restoration Project{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Art Workers Guild logo (3934115889).jpg|thumb|Art Workers' Guild logo]]
The '''Art Workers' Guild''' is an organisation established in 1884 by a group of British architects associated with the ideas of [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. The guild promoted the 'unity of all the arts', denying the distinction between fine and applied art. It opposed the professionalisation of architecture &amp;ndash; which was promoted by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] at this time &amp;ndash; in the belief that this would inhibit design.

The founders of the guild were five young architects from [[Norman Shaw]]'s office: [[W. R. Lethaby]], [[Edward Schroeder Prior|Edward Prior]], [[Ernest Newton]], [[Mervyn Macartney]] and [[Gerald C. Horsley]]. Its first master was the sculptor, [[George Blackall Simonds]]; its second master was [[John Dando Sedding]]. Among its members was [[Henry Bird (artist)|Henry Bird]].

Much of the impulse that had fed into religion was transferred to art, retaining a moral seriousness and sense of mission that has characterised the guild.

The architects Dunbar Smith and Cecil Brewer had an office in the front of the early Georgian house at 6 Queen Square, Bloomsbury, and when they heard that the freehold was for sale, encouraged the guild to buy it. The back part of the building was reconstructed as a meeting hall, designed by F. W. Troup and inaugurated on 22 April 1914. It is furnished with rush-seated chairs to a pattern made in Herefordshire in the 1880s by Philip Clisset, and afterwards copied by Ernest Gimson and his successors. The names of all members up to the year 2000 are painted on a frieze around the walls of the Hall. The list of names now continues in the front room known as the ‘Master’s Room’.

The Art Workers Guild gave rise to the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]].

The guild began as a male-only organisation, leading [[May Morris]] to start the [[Women’s Guild of Arts]] in 1907 as an alternative for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Zoe|title='At Home with the Women's Guild of Arts: gender and professional identity in London studios, c. 1880-1925'|journal=[[Women's History Review]]|date=June 2015|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/tHneiAkTFHfwD6JSskRp/full#.VXHpaUJzy_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1960s that women were admitted, starting with the wood engraver [[Joan Hassall]] who became the first female Master in 1972.

The guild is today a society of artists, craftsmen and designers with a common interest in the interaction, development and distribution of creative skills. They represent a variety of views on design and stand for authenticity (irrespective of political and stylistic ideology).

{{italic title}}
'''''Colloquies''''' (Latin title ''Colloquia familiaria'') is one of the many works of the "Prince of Christian [[Humanists]]", [[Desiderius Erasmus]]. Published in 1518, the pages "...held up contemporary religious practices for examination in a more serious but still pervasively ironic tone".&lt;ref&gt;Coffin G. Judith, Stacey C. Robert. Western Civilizations, Ed16 Vol2. W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2008. pp.463&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Humanists viewed Erasmus as their leader in the early 16th century. Erasmus' works had greater meaning to those learned few who had a larger knowledge of Latin and Greek.
Colloquies in Latin means a formal written dialogue, thus in his book Erasmus explores man's reaction to others in conversations.

The ''Colloquies'' is a collection of dialogues on a wide variety of subjects. They began in the late 1490s as informal Latin exercises for Erasmus' own pupils. In about 1522 he began to perceive the possibilities this form might hold for continuing his campaign for the gradual enlightenment and reform of all [[Christendom]]. Between that date and 1533 twelve new editions appeared, each larger and more serious than the last, until eventually some fifty individual colloquies were included ranging over such varied subjects as war, travel, religion, sleep, beggars, funerals, and literature. All of these works were in the same graceful, easy style and gentle humor that made them continually sought as schoolboy exercises and light reading for generations.

In [[photography]] and [[image processing]], '''color balance''' is the global adjustment of the intensities of the colors (typically red, green, and blue [[primary colors]]).  An important goal of this adjustment is to render specific colors – particularly neutral colors – correctly. Hence, the general method is sometimes called '''gray balance''', '''neutral balance''', or '''white balance'''.  Color balance changes the overall mixture of colors in an image and is used for [[color correction]]. Generalized versions of color balance are used to correct colors other than neutrals or to deliberately change them for effect.

Image data acquired by sensors – either [[photographic film|film]] or electronic [[image sensor]]s – must be transformed from the acquired values to new values that are appropriate for color reproduction or display.  Several aspects of the acquisition and display process make such color correction essential – including the fact that the acquisition sensors do not match the sensors in the human eye, that the properties of the display medium must be accounted for, and that the ambient viewing conditions of the acquisition differ from the display viewing conditions.

The color balance operations in popular [[image editing]] applications usually operate directly on the red, green, and blue channel [[pixel]] values,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Gimp for Linux and Unix | author = Phyllis Davis | publisher = Peachpit Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-70253-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0sEnoWrMw-gC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22color+balance%22+channels | page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Adobe Photoshop 6.0 | author = Adobe Creative Team | publisher = Adobe Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-71016-1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MRtx2-0GZc4C&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=%22color+balance%22+channels | page = 278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; without respect to any color sensing or reproduction model.  In film photography, color balance is typically achieved by using [[color correction filter]]s over the lights or on the camera lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Cinematography: Theory and Practice : Imagemaking for Cinematographers, Directors, and Videographers | author = Blain Brown | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-240-80500-3| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1JL2jFbNPNAC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=%22color+balance%22 | page=170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalized color balance==
[[File:Color balancing girl.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Example of color balancing]]
Sometimes the adjustment to keep neutrals neutral is called ''white balance'', and the phrase ''color balance'' refers to the adjustment that in addition makes other colors in a displayed image appear to have the same general appearance as the colors in an original scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Introduction to Color Imaging Science | author = Hsien-Che Lee | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-521-84388-X | page=450 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly important that neutral (gray, neutral, white) colors in a scene appear neutral in the reproduction. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nikondigital.org/articles/white_balance.htm White Balance].

===Psychological color balance===
Humans relate to [[Human skin color|flesh tones]] more critically than other colors. Trees, grass and sky can all be off without concern, but if human flesh tones are 'off' then the human subject can look sick or dead. To address this critical color balance issue, the tri-color primaries themselves are formulated to ''not'' balance as a true neutral color. The purpose of this color primary imbalance is to more faithfully reproduce the flesh tones through the entire brightness range. 

US Patent 2,850,563 states "...effecting a non-distorted transfer of a flesh tone through the system over its entire brightness range, notwithstanding the inherent non-linear transfer characteristic of said system...".&lt;ref&gt;[https://patents.google.com/patent/US2850563A/en?oq=2850563 US Patent 2,850,563] Edgar A. Gretener 1958 &lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing of the flesh altered primaries is available with a [https://coins.nd.edu/ColCoin/ColCoinIcons/ColorGuide100dpi.jpg /''Color Separation Guide''] or ''Color Control Patch'' (same thing). There are 18 color swatches on the guide; 9 at 100% density, and the same 9 at 50% density. The 3-color swatch at 50% density thereon shows the result of the flesh tone primaries, at a 1:1:1 ratio, directly.

Most digital cameras have means to select color correction based on the type of scene lighting, using either manual lighting selection, automatic white balance, or custom white balance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The algorithms for these processes perform generalized [[chromatic adaptation]].

Many methods exist for color balancing.  Setting a button on a camera is a way for the user to indicate to the processor the nature of the scene lighting. Another option on some cameras is a button which one may press when the camera is pointed at a [[gray card]] or other neutral colored object. This captures an image of the ambient light, which enables a digital camera to set the correct color balance for that light.

There is a large literature on how one might estimate the ambient lighting from the camera data and then use this information to transform the image data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed, and the quality of these has been debated. A few examples and examination of the references therein will lead the reader to many others. Examples are [[Retinex]], an [[artificial neural network]]&lt;ref name="Funt1996"&gt;Brian Funt, Vlad Cardei, and Kobus Barnard, "[http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~colour/publications/ARIZONA/arizona_abs.html Learning color constancy]," in ''Proceedings of the Fourth IS&amp;T/SID Color Imaging Conference,'' pp. 58–60 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Bayesian method]].&lt;ref name=Finlayson2001&gt;{{Cite journal

==Chromatic colors==

Color balancing an image affects not only the neutrals, but other colors as well. An image that is not color balanced is said to have a color cast, as everything in the image appears to have been shifted towards one color.&lt;ref name="Yule1967"&gt;John A C Yule, ''Principles of Color Reproduction.'' New York: Wiley, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} Color balancing may be thought in terms of removing this color cast.

Color balance is also related to [[color constancy]]. Algorithms and techniques used to attain color constancy are frequently used for color balancing, as well. Color constancy is, in turn, related to [[chromatic adaptation]]. Conceptually, color balancing consists of two steps: first, determining the [[standard illuminant|illuminant]] under which an image was captured; and second, scaling the components (e.g., R, G, and B) of the image or otherwise transforming the components so they conform to the viewing illuminant.

Viggiano found that white balancing in the camera's native [[RGB color model]] tended to produce less color inconstancy (i.e., less distortion of the colors) than in monitor RGB for over 4000 hypothetical sets of camera sensitivities.&lt;ref name="Viggiano2004"/&gt; This difference typically amounted to a factor of more than two in favor of camera RGB. This means that it is advantageous to get color balance right at the time an image is captured, rather than edit later on a monitor. If one must color balance later, balancing the [[Raw image format|raw image data]] will tend to produce less distortion of chromatic colors than balancing in monitor RGB.

==Mathematics of color balance==
Color balancing is sometimes performed on a three-component image (e.g., [[RGB color model|RGB]]) using a 3x3 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. This type of transformation is appropriate if the image was captured using the wrong white balance setting on a digital camera, or through a color filter.

===Scaling monitor R, G, and B===
In principle, one wants to scale all relative luminances in an image so that objects which are believed to be [[grey|neutral]] appear so. If, say, a surface with &lt;math&gt;R=240&lt;/math&gt; was believed to be a white object, and if 255 is the count which corresponds to white, one could multiply all [[red]] values by 255/240. Doing analogously for [[green]] and [[blue]] would result, at least in theory, in a color balanced image. In this type of transformation the 3x3 matrix is a [[diagonal matrix]].

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} R \\ G \\ B \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}255/R'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 255/G'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 255/B'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}R' \\ G' \\ B' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are the color balanced red, green, and blue components of a [[pixel]] in the image; &lt;math&gt;R'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B'&lt;/math&gt; are the red, green, and blue components of the image before color balancing, and &lt;math&gt;R'_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;G'_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B'_w&lt;/math&gt; are the red, green, and blue components of a pixel which is believed to be a white surface in the image before color balancing. This is a simple scaling of the red, green, and blue channels, and is why color balance tools in [[Photoshop]] and the [[GIMP]] have a white eyedropper tool.  It has been demonstrated that performing the white balancing in the phosphor set assumed by [[sRGB]] tends to produce large errors in chromatic colors, even though it can render the neutral surfaces perfectly neutral.&lt;ref name="Viggiano2004"&gt;J A Stephen Viggiano, "[http://www.acolyte-color.com/papers/EI_2004.pdf Comparison of the accuracy of different white balancing options as quantified by their color constancy]." ''Sensors and Camera Systems for Scientific, Industrial, and Digital Photography Applications V: Proceedings of the SPIE,'' volume 5301. Bellingham, WA: SPIE: the International Society for Optical Engineering, p 323-333 (2004), retrieved online 2008-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scaling X, Y, Z===
If the image may be transformed into [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE XYZ tristimulus values]], the color balancing may be performed there.  This has been termed a “wrong von Kries” transformation.&lt;ref name=Terstiege1972&gt;{{Cite journal

Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been demonstrated to offer usually poorer results than balancing in monitor RGB, it is mentioned here as a bridge to other things. Mathematically, one computes:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}X_w/X'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; Y_w/Y'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; Z_w/Z'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}X' \\ Y' \\ Z' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are the color-balanced tristimulus values; &lt;math&gt;X_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z_w&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of the viewing illuminant (the white point to which the image is being transformed to conform to); &lt;math&gt;X'_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y'_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z'_w&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of an object believed to be white in the un-color-balanced image, and &lt;math&gt;X'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z'&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of a pixel in the un-color-balanced image. If the tristimulus values of the monitor primaries are in a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; so that:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{array}\right]=\mathbf{P}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;L_R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;L_B&lt;/math&gt; are the un-[[gamma correction|gamma corrected]] monitor RGB, one may use:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]=\mathbf{P^{-1}}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}X_w/X'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; Y_w/Y'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; Z_w/Z'_w\end{array}\right]\mathbf{P}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_{R'} \\ L_{G'} \\ L_{B'} \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

===Von Kries's method===
[[Johannes von Kries]], whose theory of [[rod cell|rods]] and three color-sensitive [[cone cell|cone]] types in the [[retina]] has survived as the dominant explanation of color sensation for over 100 years, motivated the method of converting color to the [[LMS color space]], representing the effective stimuli for the Long-, Medium-, and Short-wavelength cone types that are modeled as adapting independently.  A 3x3 matrix converts RGB or XYZ to LMS, and then the three LMS primary values are scaled to balance the neutral; the color can then be converted back to the desired final [[color space]]:&lt;ref name=Sharma&gt;{{Cite book| title = Digital Color Imaging Handbook | author =  Gaurav Sharma| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AkByHKRGTsQC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=%22von+Kries%22 | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8493-0900-X | page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} L \\ M \\ S \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}1/L'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1/M'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1/S'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}L' \\ M' \\ S' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are the color-balanced LMS cone tristimulus values; &lt;math&gt;L'_w&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M'_w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S'_w&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of an object believed to be white in the un-color-balanced image, and &lt;math&gt;L'&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M'&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S'&lt;/math&gt; are the tristimulus values of a pixel in the un-color-balanced image.

Matrices to convert to LMS space were not specified by von Kries, but can be derived from CIE color matching functions and LMS color matching functions when the latter are specified; matrices can also be found in reference books.&lt;ref name=Sharma/&gt;

===Scaling camera RGB===
By Viggiano's measure, and using his model of gaussian camera spectral sensitivities, most camera RGB spaces performed better than either monitor RGB or XYZ.&lt;ref name="Viggiano2004"/&gt;  If the camera's raw RGB values are known, one may use the 3x3 diagonal matrix:

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} R \\ G \\ B \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}255/R'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 255/G'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 255/B'_w\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}R' \\ G' \\ B' \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

and then convert to a working RGB space such as [[sRGB]] or [[Adobe RGB]] after balancing.
&lt;!-- in progress!
However, if one has already converted to monitor RGB, one may still work in camera RGB if a 3x3 [[regular matrix]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; characterizes the camera's color mixing behavior reasonably well, so that:

: &lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} X \\ Y \\ Z \end{array}\right]\approx\mathbf{A}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

(This matrix is included in the [[ICC profile]] for some cameras.&lt;ref name="ICC01_2006"&gt;International Color Consortium, ''Specification ICC.1:2004-10 (Profile version 4.2.0.0) Image technology colour management — Architecture, profile format, and data structure'', (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;) If this matrix is known, one computes:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\begin{array}{c} L_R \\ L_G \\ L_B \end{array}\right]=\mathbf{P^{-1}A^{-1}}\left[\begin{array}{ccc}R_w/R'_w &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; G_w/G'_w &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; B_w/B'_w\end{array}\right]\mathbf{A\cdotP}\left[\begin{array}{c}L_{R'} \\ L_{G'} \\ L_{B'} \end{array}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the phosphor matrix mentioned in the previous section; &lt;math&gt;L_{Rw}&lt;/math, &lt;math&gt;G_w&lt;/math, &lt;math&gt;B_w&lt;/math are the
--&gt;

===Preferred chromatic adaptation spaces===
Comparisons of images balanced by diagonal transforms in a number of different RGB spaces have identified several such spaces that work better than others, and better than camera or monitor spaces, for chromatic adaptation, as measured by several [[color appearance model]]s; the systems that performed statistically as well as the best on the majority of the image test sets used were the "Sharp", "Bradford", "CMCCAT", and "ROMM" spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/getfile.py?recid=34049&amp;mode=best | title = Chromatic Adaptation Performance of Different RGB Sensors |author1=Sabine Süsstrunk |author2=Jack Holm |author3=Graham D. Finlayson | journal = IS&amp;T/SPIE Electronic Imaging | volume = 4300|date=January 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General illuminant adaptation===
The best color matrix for adapting to a change in illuminant is not necessarily a diagonal matrix in a fixed color space.  It has long been known that if the space of illuminants can be described as a linear model with ''N'' basis terms, the proper color transformation will be the weighted sum of ''N'' fixed linear transformations, not necessarily consistently diagonalizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Laurence T.

'''Colorfulness''', '''chroma''' and '''saturation''' are attributes of perceived color relating to chromatic intensity. As defined formally by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) they respectively describe three different aspects of chromatic intensity, but the terms are often used loosely and interchangeably in contexts where these aspects are not clearly distinguished.

'''Colorfulness''' is the "attribute of a visual perception according to which the perceived color of an area appears to be more or less chromatic".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/233|title=colourfulness {{!}} eilv|website=eilv.cie.co.at|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806140347/http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/233|archivedate=2017-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Color Appearance Models|last=Fairchild|first=Mark|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2013}}, page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; A note accompanying this definition in effect implies that the perception of colorfulness evoked by an object depends not only on its spectral [[reflectance]] but also on the strength of the illumination, and increases with the latter unless the [[brightness]] is very high.

'''Chroma''' is the "colorfulness of an area judged as a proportion of the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/139|title=CIE e-ILV 17-139|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410214923/http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/139|archive-date=2017-04-10|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A note accompanying this definition in effect implies that an object with a given spectral [[reflectance]] exhibits approximately constant chroma for all levels of illumination, unless the brightness is very high. Thus if a uniformly colored object is unevenly lit, it will generally exhibit greater colorfulness where it is most strongly lit, but will be perceived to have the same chroma over its entire surface. While colorfulness is an attribute of the color of the light reflected from different parts of the object, chroma is an attribute of the color seen as belonging to the object itself (called an object color&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/831|title=CIE e-ILV 17-831|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410215355/http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/831|archive-date=2017-04-10|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;),and describes how different from a grey of the same lightness such an object color appears to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/015.php|title=The Dimensions of Colour|website=www.huevaluechroma.com|access-date=2017-04-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330104913/http://www.huevaluechroma.com/015.php|archivedate=2017-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saturation''' is the "colorfulness of an area judged in proportion to its [[brightness]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/1136|title=CIE e-ILV 17-1136|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410214912/http://eilv.cie.co.at/term/1136|archive-date=2017-04-10|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which in effect is the perceived freedom from whitishness of the light coming from the area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huevaluechroma.com/017.php|title=The Dimensions of Colour|website=www.huevaluechroma.com|access-date=2017-04-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330104936/http://www.huevaluechroma.com/017.php|archivedate=2017-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A note accompanying this definition in effect indicates that an object with a given spectral reflectance exhibits approximately constant saturation for all levels of illumination, unless the brightness is very high. Since the chroma and lightness of an object are its colorfulness and brightness judged in proportion to the same thing ("the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting"), the saturation of the light coming from that object is in effect the chroma of the object judged in proportion to its lightness. On a [[Munsell color system|Munsell]] hue page, lines of uniform saturation thus tend to radiate from near the black point, while lines of uniform chroma are vertical.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As colorfulness, chroma and saturation are defined as attributes of perception they can not be physically measured as such, but they can be quantified in relation to psychometric scales intended to be perceptually even, for example the chroma scales of the Munsell system.

== Saturation ==
The saturation of a color is determined by a combination of light intensity and how much it is distributed across the spectrum of different wavelengths. The purest (most saturated) color is achieved by using just one wavelength at a high intensity, such as in laser light.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} If the intensity drops, then as a result the saturation drops.  To desaturate a color of given intensity in a [[subtractive color|subtractive]] system (such as [[watercolor]]), one can add white, black, [[grey|gray]], or the hue's [[complementary color|complement]].

Various correlates of saturation follow.

; CIELUV and CIELAB

In [[CIELUV]], saturation is equal to the ''chroma'' normalized by the ''lightness'':

:&lt;math&gt;s_{uv}=\frac{C^*_{uv}}{L^*}=13 \sqrt{(u'-u'_n)^2+(v'-v'_n)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nobr|(''u''′&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''′&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the chromaticity of the white point, and chroma is defined below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schanda|first=János|title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8VDAgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Colorimetry+intitle:Understanding+intitle:the+intitle:CIE+intitle:System|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117120237/https://books.google.com/books?id=g8VDAgAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Colorimetry+intitle:Understanding+intitle:the+intitle:CIE+intitle:System|archivedate=2017-01-17|df=}}, page 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

By analogy, in [[CIELAB]] this would yield:

:&lt;math&gt;s_{ab}=\frac{C^*_{ab}}{L^*}=\frac{\sqrt{{a^*}^2+{b^*}^2}}{L^*}&lt;/math&gt;

The CIE has not formally recommended this equation since CIELAB has no chromaticity diagram, and this definition therefore lacks direct connection with older concepts of saturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=%22correlate+of+saturation%22+cielab+chroma+lightness+chromaticity|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography|publisher=Focal Press|editor=Leslie D. Stroebel, Richard D. Zakia|isbn=0-240-51417-3|year=1993|page=124|first=Robert William Gainer|last=Hunt|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117125004/https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=%22correlate+of+saturation%22+cielab+chroma+lightness+chromaticity|archivedate=2017-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, this equation provides a reasonable predictor of saturation, and demonstrates that adjusting the lightness in CIELAB while holding {{nobr|(''a''*, ''b''*)}} fixed does affect the saturation.

But the following formula is in agreement with the human perception of saturation:
The formula proposed by Eva Lübbe is in agreement with the verbal definition of Manfred Richter: Saturation is the proportion of pure chromatic color in the total color sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lübbe|first=Eva|title=Colours in the Mind - Colour Systems in Reality- A formula for colour saturation|publisher=[Book on Demand]|year=2010|isbn=978-3-7881-4057-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{ab}=\frac{C^*_{ab}}{\sqrt{{C^*_{ab} }^2+{L^*}^2}} 100\%&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; is the saturation, ''L''* the  lightness and ''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; is the chroma of the color.

; CIECAM02

In [[CIECAM02]], saturation equals the square root of the ''colorfulness'' divided by the ''brightness'':

:&lt;math&gt;s=\sqrt{M/Q}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is inspired by experimental work done with the intention of remedying [[CIECAM97s]]'s poor performance.&lt;ref name=ciecam02&gt;{{cite conference|conference=The CIECAM02 Color Appearance Model|title=IS&amp;T/SID Tenth Color Imaging Conference|last=Moroney|first=Nathan|author2=Fairchild, Mark D. |author3=Hunt, Robert W.G. |author4=Li, Changjun |author5=Luo, M.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Magnitude estimation for scaling saturation|first=Lu-Yin G.|last=Juan|author2=Luo, Ming R.|conference-url=http://spiedl.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PSISDG004421000001000575000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes| work=[[Proceedings of SPIE]]|volume=4421|conference=9th Congress of the International Colour Association|editors=Robert Chung, Allan Rodrigues|date=June 2002|pages=575–578|doi=10.1117/12.464511}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M'' is proportional to the chroma ''C'' ({{nobr|1=''M'' = ''CF''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;0.25&lt;/sup&gt;}}), thus the CIECAM02 definition bears some similarity to the CIELUV definition. An important difference is that the CIECAM02 model accounts for the viewing conditions through the parameter ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=ciecam02/&gt;
; HSL and HSV

Saturation is also one of three coordinates in the [[HSL and HSV]] [[color space]]s. However, in the HSL color space saturation exists independently of lightness. I.e. both a very light color ''and'' a very dark color can be heavily saturated in HSL; whereas in the previous definitions&amp;mdash;as well as in the HSV color space&amp;mdash;colors approaching white all feature low saturation.

== Excitation purity ==

[[Image:Excitation Purity.svg|300px|thumb|right|'''Excitation purity''' is the relative distance from the white point. Contours of constant purity can be found by shrinking the spectral locus about the white point. The points along the line segment have the same hue, with p&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; increasing from 0 to 1 between the white point and position on the [[Spectral colors|spectral locus]] (position of the color on the horseshoe shape in the diagram) or (as at the saturated end of the line shown in the diagram) position on the [[line of purples]].]]

The '''excitation purity''' (purity for short) of a stimulus is the difference from the illuminant's [[white point]] to the furthest point on the chromaticity diagram with the same hue ([[dominant wavelength]] for [[monochromatic]] sources); using the [[CIE 1931 color space]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-240-51417-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22excitation+purity%22|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|first=Leslie D.|last=Stroebel|author2=Zakia, Richard D.|page=121|year=1993|edition=3E|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117050517/https://books.google.com/books?id=CU7-2ZLGFpYC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=%22excitation+purity%22|archivedate=2017-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p_e = \sqrt{\frac{(x - x_n)^2 + (y - y_n)^2}{(x_I - x_n)^2 + (y_I - y_n)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{nobr|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the chromaticity of the white point and {{nobr|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the point on the perimeter whose line segment to the white point contains the chromaticity of the stimulus. Different color spaces, such as CIELAB or CIELUV may be used, and will yield different results.

== Chroma in CIE 1976 L*a*b* and L*u*v* color spaces ==

{{See also|Psychophysics}}

The naïve definition of saturation does not specify its response function. In the CIE XYZ and RGB color spaces, the saturation is defined in terms of additive color mixing, and has the property of being proportional to any scaling centered at white or the white point illuminant. However, both color spaces are nonlinear in terms of psychovisually perceived [[color difference]]s. It is also possible—and sometimes desirable—to define a saturation-like quantity that is linearized in term of the psychovisual perception.

In the [[Lab color space|CIE 1976 L*a*b* and L*u*v* color spaces]], the unnormalized '''chroma''' is the radial component of the cylindrical coordinate [[HCL color space|CIE L*C*h]] (lightness, chroma, hue) representation of the L*a*b* and L*u*v* color spaces, also denoted as CIE L*C*h(a*b*){{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} or CIE L*C*h for short, and CIE L*C*h(u*v*). The transformation of {{nobr|(''a''*, ''b''*)}} to {{nobr|(''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{ab}^* = \sqrt{a^{*2} + b^{*2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;h_{ab} = \arctan \frac{b^{*}}{a^{*}}&lt;/math&gt;

and analogously for CIE L*C*h(u*v*).

The chroma in the CIE L*C*h(a*b*) and CIE L*C*h(u*v*) coordinates has the advantage of being more psychovisually linear, yet they are non-linear in terms of linear component color mixing. And therefore, chroma in CIE 1976 L*a*b* and L*u*v* color spaces is very much different from the traditional sense of "saturation".

===Chroma in color appearance models===

Another, psychovisually even more accurate, but also more complex method to obtain or specify the saturation is to use a [[color appearance model]]. Here, the '''chroma''' color appearance parameter might (depending on the color appearance model) be intertwined with e.g. the physical brightness of the illumination or the characteristics of the emitting/reflecting surface, which is more sensible psychovisually.

A '''comic novel''' is a [[Novel|novel-length work]] of humorous fiction.  Many well-known authors have written comic novels, including [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Henry Fielding]], [[Mark Twain]], and [[John Kennedy Toole]].

==Notable authors of comic novels==

===British===

One of the most notable of British comic novelists is [[P. G. Wodehouse]], whose work follows on from that of [[Jerome K. Jerome]], [[George Grossmith]], and [[Weedon Grossmith]] (see ''[[Diary of a Nobody]])''.

[[Saki]]'s work is also significant, although his career was cut short by [[World War I]].

[[A. G. Macdonell]] and [[G. K. Chesterton]] also produced flights of whimsy.

Henry Fielding's ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'' was a notable mid-18th century work in the genre.

More contemporary British humorists are [[George MacDonald Fraser]], [[Tom Sharpe]], [[Kingsley Amis]], [[Terry Pratchett]], [[Richard Gordon (English author)|Richard Gordon]], [[Rob Grant]], [[Douglas Adams]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Nick Hornby]], [[Helen Fielding]], [[Eric Sykes]], [[Leslie Thomas]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Richard Asplin]], [[Mike Harding]], [[Joseph Connolly (author)|Joseph Connolly]], and [[Ben Elton]].

===Irish===

[[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered by some to be a comic novel.&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, Zack. Ulysses as a comic novel. Syracuse University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American===

Notable American comic novelists include [[Mark Twain]], [[Philip Roth]], [[John Kennedy Toole]], [[James Wilcox]], [[John Swartzwelder]], [[Larry Doyle (writer)|Larry Doyle]], [[Jennifer Weiner]], [[Carl Hiaasen]], [[Joseph Heller]], [[Peter De Vries]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Terry Southern]], and [[Christopher Moore (author)|Christopher Moore]].

A '''crépinette''' is a small, flattened sausage, sometimes referred to as a sausage parcel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sausagelinks.co.uk/recipe_detail.asp?id=84 ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is similar in shape to a sausage patty, circular, and flattened.

It is made from minced or ground [[pork]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[veal]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[chicken (food)|chicken]], and can even be made from [[truffles]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/entry/?id=2159|title=Epicurious – Recipes, Menu Ideas, Videos &amp; Cooking Tips|website=Epicurious}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crépinettes are wrapped in [[caul fat]], rather than wrapped in a casing. It is usually cooked with an outer coating of bread and sautéed in butter.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

==Name==

The word ''crépine'' is French for "pig's caul".
The name originated in the second half of the 13th century as "a small ornamental crêpe", being derived from the word crêpe. 
In cookbooks, the term crépinette is sometimes used to indicate the contents of the crépinette only. This is the same as other countries where we find crépinette, sometimes spelled crepinette, to describe both the contents and the dish itself.

==Definition==

A crépinette is a mixture of minced meat stuffed in intestinal membrane.
Although it has a different casing than sausage, it is often described as a sausage dish. It is also described as a round and flat dish in a number of French dictionaries.
The crépinette distinguishes itself by being balled meat wrapped in thin slices of meat.

==Composition==

The stuffing of the crépinette can be made of ground pork, chicken fillets, finely ground game birds (partridge, woodcock, pigeon), and also lamb sweetbreads, calf kidneys, fillets of lark or rabbit, and sliced eel. Viard, however, gives recipes where the contents of the crépinette are not ground but entire pieces of meat.

==Cooking==
The crépinette is cooked in a pan or on a grill.

For Christmas, crépinettes are served with oysters by the oyster farmers of the Marennes-Oléron basin; the same happens in Bordelais where an expert alternates the tasting of a fresh oyster and a hot crépinette.

The '''Dumbarton Oaks birthing figure''' is a possibly [[Aztec]] [[scapolite]] figurine of a woman giving childbirth in a [[Childbirth positions#Squatting position|squatting position]]. Housed in the [[Dumbarton Oaks]] collection, United States, the figurine is considered by several scholars to be a [[pre-Columbian art]]work, while others believe it was made in modern times, possibly in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="jsa"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://jsa.revues.org/8623|title=The Dumbarton Oaks Tlazolteotl: looking beneath the surface|work=[[Journal de la Société des Américanistes]]|author=Jane MacLaren Walsh| date=2008| accessdate =Aug 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figurine measures 20.2&amp;nbsp;cm in height.

Birthing figures, while common in [[New Spain|Colonial Mexican]] manuscripts, are rare in Aztec three-dimensional art. Women, however, occupied a prominent position in the [[Aztec mythology]].

Early mentions of the figurine come from [[Ernest-Théodore Hamy]], who first saw it in a [[Paris]] antique store.&lt;ref name="twp"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-stone-figure-at-dumbarton-oaks-tells-an-intriguing-story/2014/01/13/495c2b98-7c85-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html|title=Local Intriguing story behind a stone figure at Dumbarton Oaks|work=[[The Washington Post]]| author=John Kelly|date=Jan 13, 2014| accessdate =Aug 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figurine was later bought by French obstetrician and collector Alban Ribemont-Dessaignes.&lt;ref name="twp"/&gt; In 1947, the figure was acquired by [[Robert Woods Bliss]], the founder of [[Dumbarton Oaks]].&lt;ref name="twp"/&gt;

==Authenticity==
The first scholarly article about the figurine was written by [[Ernest-Théodore Hamy]] in 1899 and called it "absolutely unique in the history of Mexican art".&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; In 1906, Hamy published an article in the ''[[Journal de la Société des Américanistes]]'' writing that the figurine is of [[pre-Columbian Mexican]] origin and represents the Aztec goddess Ixcuina, also known as [[Tlazolteotl]]. Scholars such as [[Pal Kelemen]], [[Miguel Covarrubias]], [[John Alden Mason]], [[Michael D. Coe]] and [[Jeffrey Quilter]] also considered the figurine to be authentic.&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; Others, such as [[Claude-François Baudez]] and [[Esther Pasztory]], question the figurine's stylistic features. The authenticity was also questioned on the basis of technical virtuosity compared to the technical limitations of pre-Columbian artisans.&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt; According to [[Jane MacLaren Walsh]], "the essential nature of the sculpture is almost completely anomalous with regard to the accepted canon of Mexica art, and does not in fact resemble any other Mesoamerican art form" and "the choice of stone, the complicated carving in the round, the birthing position, the facial expression of the mother, the somewhat grotesque realism, the lack of iconographic detail all point to a highly [[idiosyncratic]] work".&lt;ref name="jsa"/&gt;

'''''Effect of Snow on Petit-Montrouge''''' (French: '''''Effet de neige à Petit-Montrouge''''') is an 1870 [[landscape painting]] by the French painter [[Édouard Manet]]. 

==History==

The oil on canvas painting shows a winter view of [[Petit-Montrouge]], an area in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]]. Manet painted this picture while a member of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] during the 1870–71 [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. As opposed to the [[History painting|history painters]] of his time, Manet does not show a heroic view of battle, but rather the dusky ambiance of a looming battle. The image reflects Manet's loss of hope about the military situation, his profound loneliness, and the deprivation he suffered during this time. It is one of the few landscapes in Manet's oeuvre, and is one of Manet's first ''[[plein air]]'' paintings. Today it is in the collection of the [[National Museum Cardiff]]. 

==Composition==

Manet uses earthly and muted tones to illustrate an urban snow landscape; between the large peaks of white and diagonals of murky brown the Paris district of Petit-Montrouge is illustrate, overshadowed by the brown dirty snow and bleak beige sky. The buildings in the background were painted with muted colours to give an appearance of balancing precariously on a huge expanse of brown.

'''Folk etymology''' or '''reanalysis''' – sometimes called '''pseudo-etymology''', '''popular etymology''', or '''analogical reformation''' – is a change in a word or phrase resulting from the replacement of an unfamiliar form by a more familiar one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |folk-etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sihler2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew|title=Language History: An introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXlAYlCSoZQC|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-8546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trask2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=Robert Lawrence|authorlink=Larry Trask|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-218-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reanalyzed as resembling more familiar words or [[morpheme]]s. [[Rebracketing]] is a form of folk etymology in which a word is broken down or "bracketed" into a new set of supposed elements. [[Back-formation]], creating a new word by removing or changing parts of an existing word, is often based on folk etymology.

The term ''folk etymology'' is a [[loan translation]] from [[German language|German]] '''''Volksetymologie''''', coined by  [[Ernst Förstemann]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Förstemann|first=Ernst|editor=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete des Deutschen, Griechischen und Lateinischen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kMNAAAAYAAJ|year=1852|publisher=F. Dümmler.|chapter=Ueber Deutsche volksetymologie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk etymology is a [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process in [[historical linguistics]], [[language change]], and [[social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/ENGINEERING.pdf ''''Etymythological''' Othering' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] in ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'' (2006), ed. by Tope Omoniyi &amp; [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–258.&lt;/ref&gt; Reanalysis of a word's history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to [[loanword]]s or words that have become archaic or obsolete.

Examples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form [[wikt:sparrowgrass|''sparrowgrass'']], originally from Greek {{lang|el|ἀσπάραγος}} ("[[asparagus]]") remade by analogy to the more familiar words ''sparrow'' and ''grass'',&lt;ref name="Anttila1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anttila|first=Raimo|title=Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2C25_9m7U-AC|year=1989|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-3556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the word ''[[hamburger|burger]]'', originally from ''[[Hamburg]]'' + ''-er'' ("thing connected with"), but understood as ''ham'' + ''burger''.&lt;ref name="Shukla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shukla|first1=Shaligram|last2=Connor-Linton|first2=Jeff|editor=R. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton|title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlzthEZGkmsC|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84768-1|chapter=Language change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productive force ==
The technical term "folk etymology" refers to a change in the form of a word caused by erroneous popular beliefs about its etymology. The English word is a translation of the [[German language|German]] term ''Volksetymologie'', coined by [[Ernst Förstemann]]. Förstemann noted that in addition to scientific etymology based on careful study in [[philology]], there exist scholarly but often unsystematic accounts, as well as popular accounts for the history of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"/&gt; Until academic linguists developed comparative philology and described the laws underlying [[sound changes]], the derivation of words was a matter mostly of guess-work. Speculation about the original form of words in turn feeds back into the development of the word and thus becomes a part of a new etymology.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Etymology|volume=9|pages=864-865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing a word to have a certain origin, people begin to pronounce, spell, or otherwise use the word in a manner appropriate to that perceived origin.  This popular etymologizing has had a powerful influence on the forms which words take. Examples in English include ''[[crayfish]]'' or ''crawfish'', which are not historically related to ''fish'' but come from [[Middle English]] ''crevis'', [[cognate]] with French ''écrevisse''. Likewise ''chaise lounge'', from the original French ''chaise longue'' ("long chair"), has come to be associated with the word ''lounge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pyles |first1=Thomas |last2=Algeo |first2=John |title=The Origins and Development of the English Language |edition=4th |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=0030970547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
{{further|Rebracketing|Back-formation}}
[[Rebracketing]] is a process of [[language change]] in which parts of a word that appear to be meaningful (such as *''ham'' in ''hamburger'') are mistaken as elements of the word's etymology (in this case, the word ''[[ham]]''). Rebracketing functions by reanalyzing the constituent parts of a word. For example, the [[Old French]] word ''orenge'' ("orange tree") comes from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|النرنج }} ''an nāranj'' ("the orange tree"), with the initial ''n'' of ''nāranj'' understood as part of the [[Article (grammar)|article]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2013 | title = orange ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''adj''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary online | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | url =http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132163 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[back-formation]] a new word is created, often by removing elements thought to be [[affix]]es. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pronuncia'' ("pronunciation; accent") is derived from the verb ''pronunciare'' ("to pronounce; to utter") and English ''edit'' derives from ''editor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5675-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.&lt;ref name="Shukla" /&gt;

== Examples in English ==
In linguistic change caused by folk etymology, the form of a word changes so that it better matches its popular rationalisation.  Typically this happens either to unanalyzable foreign words or to compounds where the word underlying one part of the compound becomes obsolete.

=== Loanwords ===
There are many examples of words borrowed from foreign languages, and subsequently changed by folk etymology.

The spelling of many borrowed words reflects folk etymology. For example, ''[[Wikt:andiron|andiron]]'' borrowed from Old French was variously spelled ''aundyre'' or ''aundiren'' in Middle English, but was altered by association with ''iron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|andiron, n.|year=1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Old French loans altered in a similar manner include ''[[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]'' (from ''berfrei'') by association with ''bell'', ''female'' (from ''femelle'') by ''male'', and ''penthouse'' (from ''apentis'') by ''house''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The variant spelling of ''licorice'' as ''[[wikt:liquorice|liquorice]]'' comes from the supposition that it has something to do with liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology |last=Barnhart |first=Robert K. |editor-link=[[Robert Barnhart]] |year=1988 |publisher=H.W. Wilson |isbn=978-0-8242-0745-8|page=593|quote=The development of Late Latin ''liquiritia'' was in part influenced by Latin ''liquēre'' 'to flow', in reference to the process of treating the root to obtain its extract.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Norman ''licoris'' (influenced by ''licor'' "liquor") and [[Late Latin]] ''liquirītia'' were respelled for similar reasons, though the ultimate origin of all three is Greek ''{{lang|he|γλυκύρριζα}}'' (glycyrrhiza) "sweet root".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1|liquorice licorice, n.|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of loan words can affect their spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. The word ''cockroach'', for example, was borrowed from Spanish ''cucaracha'' but was assimilated to the existing English words ''cock'' and ''[[Common Roach|roach]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|cockroach, n.|year=1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jerusalem artichoke]]'', from Italian ''girasole'', is a kind of sunflower; it is not related to [[artichoke]]s and does not come from Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Artichoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''forlorn hope'' originally meant "storming party, body of skirmishers"&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, Lesley (ed.). 2002. ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', vol. 1, A–M. 5th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 1600.&lt;/ref&gt; from Dutch ''verloren hoop'' "lost troop". But confusion with English ''hope'' has given the term an additional meaning of "hopeless venture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|forlorn hope, n.|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes imaginative stories are created to account for the link between a borrowed word and its popularly assumed sources. The names of the ''[[serviceberry]]'', ''service tree'', and related plants, for instance, come from the Latin name ''[[sorbus]]''. The plants were called ''syrfe'' in Old English, which eventually became ''service''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|serve, n1|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanciful stories suggest that the name comes from the fact that the trees bloom in spring, a time when circuit-riding preachers resume church services or when funeral services are carried out for people who died during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Small|first=Ernest|title=North American Cornucopia: Top 100 Indigenous Food Plants|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-8594-2|page=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seemingly plausible but no less speculative etymology accounts for the form of ''[[Welsh rarebit]]'', a dish made of cheese and toasted bread. The earliest known reference to the dish in 1725 called it ''Welsh rabbit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrom|first=John|title=The Private Journal and Literary Remains of John Byrom|year=1854|publisher=Chetham society|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of that name is unknown, but presumably humorous, since the dish contains no rabbit. In 1785 [[Francis Grose]] suggested in ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' that the dish is "a Welch rare bit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grose|first=Francis|title=A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|year=1785|publisher=S. Hooper|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyVKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the word ''rarebit'' was not common prior to Grose's dictionary. Both versions of the name are in current use; individuals sometimes express strong opinions concerning which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Welsh rabbit, Welsh rarebit|encyclopedia=Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|page=952|year=1994|isbn=978-0-87779-132-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obsolete forms ===
When a word or other form becomes obsolete, words or phrases containing the obsolete portion may be reanalyzed and changed.

Some [[compound word]]s from [[Old English]] were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English when one of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include ''[[wikt:bridegroom|bridegroom]]'' from Old English ''[[wikt:brydguma|brydguma]]'' "bride-man". The word ''[[wikt:gome|gome]]'' "man" from Old English ''[[wikt:guma|guma]]'' fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word ''[[wikt:groom|groom]]'' "male servant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Groom}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar reanalysis caused ''[[wikt:sandblind|sandblind]]'', from Old English ''sāmblind'' "half-blind" with a once-common prefix ''sām-'' "semi-", to be respelled as though it is related to ''sand''. The word ''island'' derives from Old English ''igland''. The modern spelling with the letter ''s'' is the result of comparison with the synonym ''[[wikt:isle|isle]]'' from Old French and ultimately Latin ''insula'', though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|title=A Dictionary of English Etymology: E - P|year=1862|publisher=Trübner|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the spelling of ''[[wikt:wormwood|wormwood]]'' was likely affected by comparison with ''wood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|wormwood|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smythe Palmer|first=Abram|title=Folk-etymology: A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy|year=1882|publisher=Johnson Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|449}}

The phrase ''[[wikt:curry favor|curry favour]]'', meaning to flatter, comes from Middle English ''curry favel'', "[[horse grooming|groom]] a [[chestnut horse]]". This was an [[allusion]] to a fourteenth century French morality poem, ''Roman de Fauvel'', about a chestnut-colored horse who corrupts men through duplicity. The phrase was reanalyzed in early Modern English by comparison to ''favour'' as early as 1510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|year=2017|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: 'Curry favour'|work=Phrase Finder|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/curry-favour.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words need not completely disappear before their compounds are reanalyzed. The word ''[[wikt:shamefaced|shamefaced]]'' was originally ''[[wikt:shamefast|shamefast]]''. The original meaning of ''fast'' "fixed in place" still exists but mainly in frozen expressions such as ''stuck fast'', ''hold fast'', and ''[[wikt:play fast and loose|play fast and loose]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The songbird ''[[wheatear]]'' or ''white-ear'' is a back-formation from Middle English ''whit-ers'' "white arse", referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=White-ear|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white%E2%80%93ear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both ''white'' and ''arse'' are common in Modern English, the folk etymology may be [[euphemism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Wheatear |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wheatear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of archaic or obsolete forms can lead to changes in meaning as well. The original meaning of ''[[hangnail]]'' referred to a [[Corn (medicine)|corn]] on the foot.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=hangnail|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangnail |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from Old English ''[[wikt:ang-|ang-]]'' + ''[[wikt:nægel|nægel]]'' ("anguished nail" or "compressed spike"), but the spelling and pronunciation were affected by folk etymology in the seventeenth century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hangnail|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the word came to be used for a tag of skin or torn [[cuticle]] near a [[fingernail]] or toenail.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail" /&gt;

== Other languages ==

Several words in [[Medieval Latin]] were subject to folk etymology. For example, the word ''widerdonum'' meaning "reward" was borrowed from [[Old High German]] ''widarlōn'' "repayment of a loan". The ''l{{nbsp}}→{{nbsp}}d'' alteration is due to confusion with Latin ''donum'' "gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |guerdon|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Similarly, the word ''baceler'' or ''bacheler'' (related to modern English [[Bachelor#Etymology and historical meanings|''bachelor'']]) referred to a junior knight. It is attested from the eleventh century, though its ultimate origin is uncertain. By the late Middle Ages its meaning was extended to the holder of a university degree inferior to master or doctor.  This was later re-spelled ''baccalaureus'', probably reflecting a false derivation from ''bacca laurea'' "laurel berry", alluding to the possible laurel crown of a poet or conqueror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brachet|first=Auguste|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the French Language: Crowned by the French Academy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA354|year=1882|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

In the fourteenth or fifteenth century French scholars began to spell the verb ''savoir'' ("to know") as ''sçavoir'' on the false belief it was derived from Latin ''scire'' "to know".  In fact it comes from ''sapere'' "to be wise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singleton|first=David|title=Language and the Lexicon: An Introduction|year=2016|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-83594-3|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian word ''liocorno'' "unicorn" derives from 13th century ''lunicorno'' (''lo'' "the" + ''unicorno'' "unicorn"). Folk etymology based on ''lione'' "lion" altered the spelling and pronunciation. Dialectal ''liofante'' "elephant" was likewise altered from ''elefante'' by association with ''lione''.&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|486}}

The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "[[hammock]]" is ''hangmat''. It was borrowed from Spanish ''hamaca'' (ultimately from [[Arawak language|Arawak]] ''amàca'') and altered by comparison with ''hangen'' and ''mat'', "hanging mat". German ''Hängematte'' shares this folk etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hängematte|work=Wörterbuch Deutsch|url=http://en.worterbuchdeutsch.com/de/hangematte |date=October 2016|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] compound word for "jealous" ''mustasukkainen'' literally means "black-socked" (''musta'' "black" and ''sukka'' "sock"). However, the word is a case of a misunderstood loan translation from Swedish ''svartsjuk'' "black-sick". The Finnish word ''sukka'' fit with a close phonological equivalent to the Swedish ''sjuk''

''[[Names of Istanbul#Islambol|Islambol]]'', a folk etymology meaning "full of Islam", is one of the names of [[Istanbul]] used after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Necdet Sakaoğlu|title=Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t51PAQAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Kültür Bakanlığı|language=tr|isbn=978-975-7306-04-7|pages=253–255|chapter=İstanbul'un adları}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|type=Turkish-language|date=February 2017}}

An example from [[Persian language|Persian]] is the word [[shatranj]] (chess), which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] [[chaturanga]] (2nd century BCE), and after losing the "u" to [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], becomes ''chatrang'' in [[Middle Persian]] (6th century CE). Today it is sometimes factorized as ''shat'' (hundred) + ''ranj'' (worry / mood), or "a hundred worries".{{citation needed|reason=is this analysis the reason for the segmental change, or is that just passage through Arabic?|date=October 2015}}

[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|right|The manipulations of this [[Rubik's Cube]] form the [[Rubik's Cube group]].]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''group''' is an [[algebraic structure]] consisting of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[element (mathematics)|elements]] equipped with a [[binary operation]] which combines any two elements to form a third element. To be a group, this operation must satisfy four conditions called the group [[axiom]]s, namely [[Closure (mathematics)|closure]], [[associativity]], [[identity element|identity]] and [[Inverse elements|invertibility]]. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of [[integer]]s together with the [[addition]] operation, but the abstract formalization of the group axioms, detached as it is from the concrete nature of any particular group and its operation, applies much more widely.  It allows entities with highly diverse mathematical origins in [[abstract algebra]] and beyond to be handled in a flexible way while retaining their essential structural aspects. The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas within and outside mathematics makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2, p. 26|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Hall|year = 1967|loc = §1.1, p. 1|nb = yes}}: "The idea of a group is one which pervades the whole of mathematics both pure and applied."&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups share a fundamental kinship with the notion of [[symmetry]]. For example, a [[symmetry group]] encodes symmetry features of a [[geometry|geometrical]] object: the group consists of the set of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. [[Lie group]]s are the symmetry groups used in the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]; [[Poincaré group]]s, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying [[special relativity]]; and [[point group]]s are used to help understand [[Molecular symmetry|symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry]].

The concept of a group arose from the study of [[polynomial equations]], starting with [[Évariste Galois]] in the 1830s.  After contributions from other fields such as [[number theory]] and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870.  Modern [[group theory]]—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.{{cref|a}} To explore groups, mathematicians have devised [[Glossary of group theory|various notions]] to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as [[subgroup]]s, [[quotient group]]s and [[simple group]]s. In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of [[representation theory]] (that is, through the [[group representation|representations of the group]]) and of [[computational group theory]].  A theory has been developed for [[finite group]]s, which culminated with the [[classification of finite simple groups]], completed in 2004.{{cref|aa}} Since the mid-1980s, [[geometric group theory]], which studies [[finitely generated group]]s as geometric objects, has become a particularly active area in group theory.

== Definition and illustration==

===First example: the integers===
One of the most familiar groups is the set of [[integers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; which consists of the numbers
:..., −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,&amp;nbsp;...,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = App. 2, p. 360|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[addition]].
The following properties of integer addition serve as a model for the group axioms given in the definition below.

*For any two integers ''a'' and ''b'', the [[Summation|sum]] ''a'' + ''b'' is also an integer. That is, addition of integers always yields an integer. This property is known as ''[[Closure (mathematics)|closure]]'' under addition.
*For all integers ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'', (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'').   Expressed in words, adding ''a'' to ''b'' first, and then adding the result to ''c'' gives the same final result as adding ''a'' to the sum of ''b'' and ''c'', a property known as ''[[associativity]]''.
*If ''a'' is any integer, then 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' + 0 = ''a''. [[Zero]] is called the ''[[identity element]]'' of addition because adding it to any integer returns the same integer.
*For every integer ''a'', there is an integer ''b'' such that ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' = 0. The integer ''b''  is called the ''[[inverse element]]'' of the integer ''a'' and is denoted −''a''.

The integers, together with the operation +, form a mathematical object belonging to a broad class sharing similar structural aspects. To appropriately understand these structures as a collective, the following [[definition]] is developed.

A group is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], ''G'', together with an [[Binary operation|operation]] • (called the ''group law'' of ''G'') that combines any two [[element (mathematics)|elements]] ''a'' and ''b'' to form another element, denoted {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} or ''ab''. To qualify as a group, the set and operation, {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}, must satisfy four requirements known as the ''group axioms'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2.1, p. 27|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Closure: For all ''a'', ''b'' in ''G'', the result of the operation, ''a'' • ''b'', is also in ''G''.{{cref|b}}
;Associativity: For all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''G'', (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'').
;Identity element: There exists an element ''e'' in ''G'' such that, for every element ''a'' in ''G'', the equation {{nowrap|1=''e'' • ''a'' = ''a'' • ''e'' = ''a''}} holds. Such an element is unique ([[#Uniqueness of identity element and inverses|see below]]), and thus one speaks of ''the'' identity element. 
;Inverse element: For each ''a'' in ''G'', there exists an element ''b'' in ''G'', commonly denoted ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (or −''a'', if the operation is denoted "+"), such that ''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e'', where ''e'' is the identity element.

The result of an operation may depend on the order of the operands. In other words, the result of combining element ''a'' with element ''b'' need not yield the same result as combining element ''b'' with element ''a''; the equation
:{{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''}}
may not always be true. This equation always holds in the group of integers under addition, because {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}} for any two integers  ([[commutativity]] of addition). Groups for which the commutativity equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''b'' = ''b'' • ''a''}} always holds are called ''[[abelian group]]s'' (in honor of [[Niels Henrik Abel]]). The symmetry group described in the following section is an example of a group that is not abelian.

The identity element of a group ''G'' is often written as 1 or 1&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Identity Element |urlname=IdentityElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notation inherited from the [[multiplicative identity]]. If a group is abelian, then one may choose to denote the group operation by + and the identity element by 0; in that case, the group is called an additive group. The identity element can also be written as ''id''.

The set ''G'' is called the ''underlying set'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}. Often the group's underlying set ''G'' is used as a short name for the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}. Along the same lines, shorthand expressions such as "a subset of the group ''G''" or "an element of group ''G''" are used when what is actually meant is "a subset of the underlying set ''G'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}" or "an element of the underlying set ''G'' of the group {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}}".  Usually, it is clear from the context whether a symbol like ''G'' refers to a group or to an underlying set.

An alternate (but equivalent) definition is to expand the structure of a group to define a group as a set equipped with three operations satisfying the same axioms as above, with the "there exists" part removed in the two last axioms, these operations being
the group law, as above, which is a [[binary operation]],
the ''inverse operation'', which is a [[unary operation]] and maps {{mvar|a}} to &lt;math&gt;a^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;
and the identity element, which is viewed as a [[0-ary function|0-ary operation]].

As this formulation of the definition avoids [[existential quantifier]]s, it is generally preferred for [[computational group theory|computing with groups]] and for [[computer-aided proof]]s. This formulation exhibits groups as a variety of [[universal algebra]]. It is also useful for talking of properties of the inverse operation, as needed for defining [[topological group]]s and [[group object]]s.

=== Second example: a symmetry group ===
Two figures in the plane are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] if one can be changed into the other using a combination of [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s, [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s, and [[translation (geometry)|translation]]s.  Any figure is congruent to itself.  However, some figures are congruent to themselves in more than one way, and these extra congruences are called [[symmetry|symmetries]]. A square has eight symmetries. These are:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|+ The elements of the symmetry group of the square (D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Vertices are identified by color or number.
|-
| [[Image:group D8 id.svg|140px]] &lt;br /&gt; id (keeping it as it is) || [[Image:group D8 90.svg|140px]] &lt;br /&gt; r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (rotation by 90° clockwise) || [[Image:group D8 180.svg|140px]] &lt;br /&gt; r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (rotation by 180° clockwise) || [[Image:group D8 270.svg|140px]] &lt;br /&gt; r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (rotation by 270° clockwise)

|}
* the [[identity operation]] leaving everything unchanged, denoted id;
* rotations of the square around its center by 90° clockwise, 180° clockwise, and 270° clockwise, denoted by r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively;
* reflections about the vertical and horizontal middle line (f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;), or through the two [[diagonal]]s (f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;).
{{clear}}

These symmetries are represented by functions. Each of these functions sends a point in the square to the corresponding point under the symmetry. For example, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; sends a point to its rotation 90° clockwise around the square's center, and f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; sends a point to its reflection across the square's vertical middle line. Composing two of these symmetry functions gives another symmetry function.  These symmetries determine a group called the [[dihedral group]] of degree 4 and denoted D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  The underlying set of the group is the above set of symmetry functions, and the group operation is [[function composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Herstein|year = 1975|loc = §2.6, p. 54|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two symmetries are combined by composing them as functions, that is, applying the first one to the square, and the second one to the result of the first application.  The result of performing first ''a'' and then ''b'' is written symbolically ''from right to left'' as
:{{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''}} ("apply the symmetry ''b'' after performing the symmetry ''a''").
The right-to-left notation is the same notation that is used for composition of functions.

The [[group table]] on the right lists the results of all such compositions possible. For example, rotating by 270° clockwise (r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and then reflecting horizontally (f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) is the same as performing a reflection along the diagonal (f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;). Using the above symbols, highlighted in blue in the group table:
:{{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Given this set of symmetries and the described operation, the group axioms can be understood as follows:
{{ordered list
|1= The closure axiom demands that the composition {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''}} of any two symmetries ''a'' and ''b'' is also a symmetry. Another example for the group operation is
:{{nowrap|r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;,}}
i.e., rotating 270° clockwise after reflecting horizontally equals reflecting along the counter-diagonal (f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;). Indeed every other combination of two symmetries still gives a symmetry, as can be checked using the group table.

|2= The associativity constraint deals with composing more than two symmetries: Starting with three elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, there are two possible ways of using these three symmetries in this order to determine a symmetry of the square.  One of these ways is to first compose ''a'' and ''b'' into a single symmetry, then to compose that symmetry with ''c''.  The other way is to first compose ''b'' and ''c'', then to compose the resulting symmetry with ''a''.  The associativity condition
:{{nowrap|1=(''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')}}
means that these two ways are the same, i.e., a product of many group elements can be simplified in any grouping.
For example, {{nowrap|1=(f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • (f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} can be checked using the group table at the right
{{aligned table|cols=5|style=margin-left:1.2em
|(f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;) • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;|r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;|r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which equals
|f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • (f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)|{{=}}|f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;|{{=}}|r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
}}
While associativity is true for the symmetries of the square and addition of numbers, it is not true for all operations.  For instance, subtraction of numbers is not associative: {{nowrap|(7 − 3) − 2 {{=}} 2}} is not the same as {{nowrap|7 − (3 − 2) {{=}} 6.}}

|3= The identity element is the symmetry id leaving everything unchanged: for any symmetry ''a'', performing id after ''a'' (or ''a'' after id) equals ''a'', in symbolic form,
: {{nowrap|1=id • ''a'' = ''a'',}}
: {{nowrap|1=''a'' • id = ''a''.}}

|4= An inverse element undoes the transformation of some other element. Every symmetry can be undone: each of the following transformations—identity id, the reflections f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and the 180° rotation r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;—is its own inverse, because performing it twice brings the square back to its original orientation. The rotations r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are each other's inverses, because rotating 90° and then rotation 270° (or vice versa) yields a rotation over 360° which leaves the square unchanged. In symbols,
:{{nowrap|f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} id,}}
:{{nowrap|r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} id.}}
}}

In contrast to the group of integers above, where the order of the operation is irrelevant, it does matter in D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: {{nowrap|f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} but {{nowrap|r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.}} In other words, D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is not abelian, which makes the group structure more difficult than the integers introduced first.

== History ==
{{Main|History of group theory}}
The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Wussing|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Smith|year = 1906|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of [[polynomial equation]]s of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician [[Évariste Galois]], extending prior work of [[Paolo Ruffini]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the [[symmetry group]] of its [[root of a function|roots]] (solutions).  The elements of such a [[Galois group]] correspond to certain [[permutation]]s of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Galois|year = 1908|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 202|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; More general [[permutation group]]s were investigated in particular by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]]. [[Arthur Cayley]]'s ''On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = 1'' (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a [[finite group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Cayley|year=1889|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometry was a second field in which groups were used systematically, especially symmetry groups as part of [[Felix Klein]]'s 1872 [[Erlangen program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = §III.2|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After novel geometries such as [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] and [[projective geometry]] had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, [[Sophus Lie]] founded the study of [[Lie group]]s in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Lie|year=1973|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third field contributing to group theory was [[number theory]]. Certain [[abelian group]] structures had been used implicitly in [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]' number-theoretical work ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1798), and more explicitly by [[Leopold Kronecker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 204|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, [[Ernst Kummer]] made early attempts to prove [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]  by developing [[class group|groups describing factorization]] into [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = §I.3.4|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convergence of these various sources into a uniform theory of groups started with [[Camille Jordan]]'s ''Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques'' (1870).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Jordan|year=1870|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walther von Dyck]] (1882) introduced the idea of specifying a group by means of generators and relations, and was also the first to give an axiomatic definition of an "abstract group", in the terminology of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=von Dyck|year=1882|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 20th century, groups gained wide recognition by the pioneering work of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]] and [[William Burnside]], who worked on [[representation theory]] of finite groups, [[Richard Brauer]]'s [[modular representation theory]] and [[Issai Schur]]'s papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Curtis |year = 2003|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of Lie groups, and more generally [[locally compact group]]s was studied by [[Hermann Weyl]], [[Élie Cartan]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Mackey|year=1976|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its algebraic counterpart, the theory of [[algebraic group]]s, was first shaped by [[Claude Chevalley]] (from the late 1930s) and later by the work of [[Armand Borel]] and [[Jacques Tits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Borel|year=2001|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Chicago]]'s 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought together group theorists such as [[Daniel Gorenstein]], [[John G. Thompson]] and [[Walter Feit]], laying the foundation of a collaboration that, with input from numerous other mathematicians, led to the [[classification of finite simple groups]], with the final step taken by [[Michael Aschbacher|Aschbacher]] and Smith in 2004. This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research is ongoing to simplify the proof of this classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Aschbacher|year = 2004|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These days, group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields.{{cref|a}}

==Elementary consequences of the group axioms ==
Basic facts about all groups that can be obtained directly from the group axioms are commonly subsumed under ''elementary group theory''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Ledermann|year = 1953|loc = §1.2, pp. 4–5|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mathematical induction|repeated]] applications of the associativity axiom show that the unambiguity of
:''a'' • ''b'' • ''c'' = (''a'' • ''b'') • ''c'' = ''a'' • (''b'' • ''c'')
generalizes to more than three factors. Because this implies that parentheses can be inserted anywhere within such a series of terms, parentheses are usually omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ledermann|year = 1973|loc = §I.1, p. 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The axioms may be weakened to assert only the existence of a [[left identity]] and [[left inverse element|left inverse]]s. Both can be shown to be actually two-sided, so the resulting definition is equivalent to the one given above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniqueness of identity element and inverses===
Two important consequences of the group axioms are the uniqueness of the identity element and the uniqueness of inverse elements. There can be only one identity element in a group, and each element in a group has exactly one inverse element. Thus, it is customary to speak of ''the'' identity, and ''the'' inverse of an element.&lt;ref name="lang2005"&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prove the uniqueness of an inverse element of ''a'', suppose that ''a'' has two inverses, denoted ''b'' and ''c'', in a group (''G'', •). Then

:{|
|''b'' ||=||''b'' • ''e'' ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||as ''e'' is the identity element
|-
| ||=||''b'' • (''a'' • ''c'') ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||because ''c'' is an inverse of ''a'', so ''e'' = ''a'' • ''c''
|-
| ||=||(''b'' • ''a'') • ''c'' ||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||by associativity, which allows rearranging the parentheses
|-
| ||=||''e'' • ''c''||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||since ''b'' is an inverse of ''a'', i.e., ''b'' • ''a'' = ''e''
|-
| ||=||''c''||&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|| for ''e'' is the identity element
|}

The term ''b'' on the first line above and the ''c'' on the last are equal, since they are connected by a chain of equalities. In other words, there is only one inverse element of ''a''.  Similarly, to prove that the identity element of a group is unique, assume ''G'' is a group with two identity elements ''e'' and ''f''. Then ''e'' = ''e'' • ''f'' = ''f'', hence ''e'' and ''f'' are equal.

===&lt;span id="translation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Division===
In groups, the existence of inverse elements implies that [[division (mathematics)|division]] is possible: given elements ''a'' and ''b'' of the group ''G'', there is exactly one solution ''x'' in ''G'' to the [[equation]] {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''a'' = ''b''}}, namely {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="lang2005"/&gt; In fact, we have 
:{{nowrap|1= (''b'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) • ''a'' =  ''b'' • (''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a'') = ''b'' • ''e'' = ''b''.}}
Uniqueness results by multiplying the two sides of the equation {{nowrap|1=''x'' • ''a'' = ''b''}} by {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The element {{nowrap|''b'' • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, often denoted {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}, is called the ''right quotient'' of ''b'' by ''a'', or the result of the ''right division'' of ''b'' by ''a''.

Similarly there is exactly one solution ''y'' in ''G'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' • ''y'' = ''b''}}, namely {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''b''}}. This solution is the ''left quotient'' of ''b'' by ''a'', and is sometimes denoted {{nowrap|''a'' \ ''b''}}.

In general {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' \ ''b''}} may be different, but, if the group operation is [[commutative]] (that is, if the group is [[abelian group|abelian]]), they are equal. In this case, the group operation is often denoted as an [[addition]], and one talks of ''subtraction'' and ''difference'' instead of division and quotient.

A consequence of this is that multiplication by a group element ''g'' is a [[bijection]]. Specifically, if ''g'' is an element of the group ''G'', the [[function (mathematics)]] from ''G'' to itself that maps {{nowrap|''h'' ∈ ''G''}} to {{nowrap|''g'' • ''h''}} is a bijection. This function is called the ''left translation'' by ''g'' . Similarly, the ''right translation'' by ''g'' is the bijection from ''G'' to itself, that maps ''h'' to {{nowrap|''h'' • ''g''}}. If ''G'' is abelian, the left and the right translation by a group element are the same.

== Basic concepts ==
:&lt;div class="dablink"&gt;''The following sections use [[table of mathematical symbols|mathematical symbols]] such as'' {{nowrap|1=''X'' = {''x'', ''y'', ''z''} }} ''to denote a [[set (mathematics)|set]]'' ''X'' ''containing [[element (mathematics)|elements]]'' ''x'', ''y'', ''and'' ''z'', ''or alternatively'' {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} ''to restate that'' ''x'' ''is an element of'' ''X''. ''The notation'' {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} ''means'' ''f'' ''is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] assigning to every element of'' ''X'' ''an element of'' ''Y''.&lt;/div&gt;

To understand groups beyond the level of mere symbolic manipulations as above, more structural concepts have to be employed.{{cref|c}} There is a conceptual principle underlying all of the following notions: to take advantage of the structure offered by groups (which sets, being "structureless", do not have), constructions related to groups have to be ''compatible'' with the group operation. This compatibility manifests itself in the following notions in various ways. For example, groups can be related to each other via functions called group homomorphisms. By the mentioned principle, they are required to respect the group structures in a precise sense. The structure of groups can also be understood by breaking them into pieces called subgroups and quotient groups. The principle of "preserving structures"—a recurring topic in mathematics throughout—is an instance of working in a [[category (mathematics)|category]], in this case the [[category of groups]].&lt;ref name="MacLane"/&gt;

===Group homomorphisms===
{{Main|Group homomorphism}}
''Group homomorphisms''{{cref|g}} are functions that preserve group structure.  A function {{nowrap|''a'': ''G'' → ''H''}} between two groups {{nowrap|(''G'', •)}} and {{nowrap|(''H'', ∗)}} is called a ''homomorphism'' if the equation
:{{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'' • ''k'') = ''a''(''g'') ∗ ''a''(''k'')}}
holds for all elements ''g'', ''k'' in ''G''. In other words, the result is the same when performing the group operation after or before applying the map ''a''. This requirement ensures that {{nowrap|1=''a''(1&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and also {{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for all ''g'' in ''G''. Thus a group homomorphism respects all the structure of ''G'' provided by the group axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.3, p. 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two groups ''G'' and ''H'' are called ''[[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]]'' if there exist group homomorphisms {{nowrap|''a'': ''G'' → ''H''}} and {{nowrap|''b'': ''H'' → ''G''}}, such that applying the two functions [[function composition|one after another]] in each of the two possible orders gives the [[identity function]]s of ''G'' and ''H''. That is, {{nowrap|1=''a''(''b''(''h'')) = ''h''}} and {{nowrap|1=''b''(''a''(''g'')) = ''g''}} for any ''g'' in ''G'' and ''h'' in ''H''. From an abstract point of view, isomorphic groups carry the same information. For example, proving that {{nowrap|1=''g'' • ''g'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for some element ''g'' of ''G'' is [[Logical equivalence|equivalent]] to proving that {{nowrap|1=''a''(''g'') ∗ ''a''(''g'') = 1&lt;sub&gt;''H''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, because applying ''a'' to the first equality yields the second, and applying ''b'' to the second gives back the first.

===Subgroups===
{{Main|Subgroup}}
Informally, a ''subgroup'' is a group ''H'' contained within a bigger one, ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concretely, the identity element of ''G'' is  contained in ''H'', and whenever ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are in ''H'', then so are {{nowrap|''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; •  ''h''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, so the elements of ''H'', equipped with the group operation on ''G'' restricted to ''H'', indeed form a group.

In the example above, the identity and the rotations constitute a subgroup {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {id, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;},}} highlighted in red in the group table above: any two rotations composed are still a rotation, and a rotation can be undone by (i.e., is inverse to) the complementary rotations  270° for 90°, 180° for 180°, and 90° for 270° (note that rotation in the opposite direction is not defined). The [[subgroup test]] is a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary and sufficient condition]] for a nonempty subset ''H'' of a group ''G'' to be a subgroup: it is sufficient to check that {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''h'' ∈ ''H''}} for all elements {{nowrap|''g'', ''h'' ∈ ''H''}}. Knowing [[lattice of subgroups|the subgroups]] is important in understanding the group as a whole.{{cref|d}}

Given any subset ''S'' of a group ''G'', the subgroup generated by ''S'' consists of products of elements of ''S'' and their inverses. It is the smallest subgroup of ''G'' containing ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ledermann|year = 1973|loc = §II.12, p. 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the introductory example above, the subgroup generated by r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; consists of these two elements, the identity element id and {{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Again, this is a subgroup, because combining any two of these four elements or their inverses (which are, in this particular case, these same elements) yields an element of this subgroup.

===Cosets===
{{Main|Coset}}
In many situations it is desirable to consider two group elements the same if they differ by an element of a given subgroup. For example, in D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; above, once a reflection is performed, the square never gets back to the r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; configuration by just applying the rotation operations (and no further reflections), i.e., the rotation operations are irrelevant to the question whether a reflection has been performed. Cosets are used to formalize this insight: a subgroup ''H'' defines left and right cosets, which can be thought of as translations of ''H'' by arbitrary group elements ''g''. In symbolic terms, the ''left'' and ''right'' cosets of ''H'' containing ''g'' are

:{{nowrap|1=''gH'' = {''g'' • ''h'' : ''h'' ∈ ''H''} }} and {{nowrap|1=''Hg'' = {''h'' • ''g'' : ''h'' ∈ ''H''},}} respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.4, p. 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left cosets of any subgroup ''H'' form a [[Partition of a set|partition]] of ''G''; that is, the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of all left cosets is equal to ''G'' and two left cosets are either equal or have an [[empty set|empty]] [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first case {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''H'' = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''H''}} happens [[if and only if|precisely when]] {{nowrap|''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''H''}}, i.e., if the two elements differ by an element of ''H''. Similar considerations apply to the right cosets of ''H''. The left and right cosets of ''H'' may or may not be equal. If they are, i.e., for all ''g'' in ''G'', {{nowrap|1=''gH'' = ''Hg''}}, then ''H'' is said to be a ''[[normal subgroup]]''.

In D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the introductory symmetry group, the left cosets ''gR'' of the subgroup ''R'' consisting of the rotations are either equal to ''R'', if ''g'' is an element of ''R'' itself, or otherwise equal to {{nowrap|1=''U'' = f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = {f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;} }} (highlighted in green). The subgroup ''R'' is also normal, because {{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = ''U'' = ''R''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} and similarly for any element other than f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. (In fact, in the case of D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, observe that all such cosets are equal, such that {{nowrap|1=f&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''R''}}.)

===Quotient groups===
{{Main|Quotient group}}
In some situations the set of cosets of a subgroup can be endowed with a group law, giving a ''quotient group'' or ''factor group''. For this to be possible, the subgroup has to be [[normal subgroup|normal]]. Given any normal subgroup ''N'', the quotient group is defined by
:''G'' / ''N'' = {''gN'', ''g'' ∈ ''G''}, "''G'' modulo ''N''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.4, p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This set inherits a group operation (sometimes called coset multiplication, or coset addition) from the original group ''G'': {{nowrap|1=(''gN'') • (''hN'') = (''gh'')''N''}} for all ''g'' and ''h'' in ''G''. This definition is motivated by the idea (itself an instance of general structural considerations outlined above) that the map {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G'' / ''N''}} that associates to any element ''g'' its coset ''gN'' be a group homomorphism, or by general abstract considerations called [[universal property|universal properties]]. The coset {{nowrap|1=''eN '' = ''N''}} serves as the identity in this group, and the inverse of ''gN'' in the quotient group is {{nowrap|1=(''gN'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)''N''}}.{{cref|e}}

The elements of the quotient group {{nowrap|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; / ''R''}} are ''R'' itself, which represents the identity, and {{nowrap|1=''U'' = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R''}}. The group operation on the quotient is shown at the right. For example, {{nowrap|1=''U'' • ''U'' = f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''R'' = (f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; • f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;)''R'' = ''R''}}. Both the subgroup {{nowrap|1=''R'' = {id, r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;},}} as well as the corresponding quotient are abelian, whereas D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is not abelian. Building bigger groups by smaller ones, such as D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from its subgroup ''R'' and the quotient {{nowrap|D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; / ''R''}} is abstracted by a notion called [[semidirect product]].

Quotient groups and subgroups together form a way of describing every group by its ''[[presentation of a group|presentation]]'': any group is the quotient of the [[free group]] over the ''[[Generating set of a group|generators]]'' of the group, quotiented by the subgroup of ''relations''. The dihedral group D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, for example, can be generated by two elements ''r'' and ''f'' (for example, ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the right rotation and ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; the vertical (or any other) reflection), which means that every symmetry of the square is a finite composition of these two symmetries or their inverses. Together with the relations
:''r ''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''r'' • ''f'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.2, p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the group is completely described. A presentation of a group can also be used to construct the [[Cayley graph]], a device used to graphically capture [[discrete group]]s.

Sub- and quotient groups are related in the following way: a subset ''H'' of ''G'' can be seen as an [[injective]] map {{nowrap|''H'' → ''G''}}, i.e., any element of the target has at most one [[preimage|element that maps to it]]. The counterpart to injective maps are [[surjective]] maps (every element of the target is mapped onto), such as the canonical map {{nowrap|''G'' → ''G'' / ''N''}}.{{cref|y}} Interpreting subgroup and quotients in light of these homomorphisms emphasizes the structural concept inherent to these definitions alluded to in the introduction. In general, homomorphisms are neither injective nor surjective. [[Kernel (algebra)|Kernel]] and [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of group homomorphisms and the [[first isomorphism theorem]] address this phenomenon.

Examples and applications of groups abound. A starting point is the group '''Z''' of integers with addition as group operation, introduced above. If instead of addition [[multiplication]] is considered, one obtains [[multiplicative group]]s. These groups are predecessors of important constructions in [[abstract algebra]].

Groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by [[functor|associating]] groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, [[Henri Poincaré]] founded what is now called [[algebraic topology]] by introducing the [[fundamental group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Hatcher|year = 2002|loc = Chapter I, p. 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By means of this connection, [[Glossary of topology|topological properties]] such as [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|proximity]] and [[continuous function|continuity]] translate into properties of groups.{{cref|i}} For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered [[null-homotopic]] (and thus irrelevant), because it can be [[homotopy|continuously shrunk]] to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop [[winding number|winding once]] around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.

In more recent applications, the influence has also been reversed to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background.{{cref|j}} In a similar vein, [[geometric group theory]] employs geometric concepts, for example in the study of [[hyperbolic group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Coornaert|last2 = Delzant|last3=Papadopoulos|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further branches crucially applying groups include [[algebraic geometry]] and [[number theory]].&lt;ref&gt;for example, [[class group]]s and [[Picard group]]s; see {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Neukirch|year = 1999}}, in particular §§I.12 and I.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. [[Cryptography]] relies on the combination of the abstract group theory approach together with [[algorithm]]ical knowledge obtained in [[computational group theory]], in particular when implemented for finite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Seress|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of group theory are not restricted to mathematics; sciences such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[computer science]] benefit from the concept.

=== Numbers ===
Many number systems, such as the integers and the rationals enjoy a naturally given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number systems are predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. Further [[abstract algebra]]ic concepts such as [[module (mathematics)|module]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[algebra over a field|algebras]] also form groups.

==== Integers ====
The group of integers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; under addition, denoted &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z},+\right)&lt;/math&gt;, has been described above. The integers, with the operation of [[multiplication]] instead of addition, &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Z},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; do ''not'' form a group. The closure, associativity and identity axioms are satisfied, but inverses do not exist: for example, {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 2}} is an integer, but the only solution to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a · b'' = 1}} in this case is {{nowrap|1=''b'' = 1/2}}, which is a rational number, but not an integer. Hence not every element of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; has a (multiplicative) inverse.{{cref|k}}

==== Rationals ====
The desire for the existence of multiplicative inverses suggests considering [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]
:&lt;math alt="a/b"&gt;\frac{a}{b}.&lt;/math&gt;
Fractions of integers (with ''b'' nonzero) are known as [[rational number]]s.{{cref|l}} The set of all such irreducible fractions is commonly denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. There is still a minor obstacle for &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt;, the rationals with multiplication, being a group: because the rational number [[0 (number)|0]] does not have a multiplicative inverse (i.e., there is no ''x'' such that {{nowrap|1=''x'' · 0 = 1}}), &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; is still not a group.

However, the set of all ''nonzero'' rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}\setminus\left\{0\right\}=\left\{q\in\mathbb{Q}\mid q\neq 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt; does form an abelian group under multiplication, generally denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}^*&lt;/math&gt;.{{cref|m}} Associativity and identity element axioms follow from the properties of integers. The closure requirement still holds true after removing zero, because the product of two nonzero rationals is never zero. Finally, the inverse of ''a''/''b'' is ''b''/''a'', therefore the axiom of the inverse element is satisfied.

The rational numbers (including 0) also form a group under addition. Intertwining addition and multiplication operations yields more complicated structures called [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and—if division is possible, such as in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;—[[field (mathematics)|fields]], which occupy a central position in [[abstract algebra]]. Group theoretic arguments therefore underlie parts of the theory of those entities.{{cref|n}}

===Modular arithmetic===

[[File:Clock group.svg|thumb|right|The hours on a clock form a group that uses [[Modular arithmetic|addition modulo]] 12. Here 9 + 4 = 1.]]
In [[modular arithmetic]], two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the ''modulus.'' The result of modular addition is the [[remainder]] of that division. For any modulus, ''n'', the set of integers from 0 to {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} forms a group under modular addition: the inverse of any element ''a'' is {{nowrap|''n'' − ''a''}}, and 0 is the identity element. This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a [[12-hour clock|clock]]: if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours, it ends up on 1, as shown at the right. This is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 "modulo 12" or, in symbols,
:9 + 4 ≡ 1 modulo 12.
The group of integers modulo ''n'' is written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{n}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.

For any [[prime number]] ''p'', there is also the [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo ''p'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = Chapter VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its elements are the integers 1 to {{nowrap|''p'' − 1}}. The group operation is multiplication modulo ''p''. That is, the usual product is divided by ''p'' and the remainder of this division is the result of modular multiplication. For example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}, there are four group elements 1, 2, 3, 4. In this group, {{nowrap|1=4 · 4 = 1}}, because the usual product 16 is equivalent to 1, which divided by 5 yields a remainder of 1.  for 5 divides {{nowrap|1=16 − 1 = 15}}, denoted
:16 ≡ 1 (mod 5).
The primality of ''p'' ensures that the product of two integers neither of which is divisible by ''p'' is not divisible by ''p'' either, hence the indicated set of classes is closed under multiplication.{{cref|o}} The identity element is 1, as usual for a multiplicative group, and the associativity follows from the corresponding property of integers. Finally, the inverse element axiom requires that given an integer ''a'' not divisible by ''p'', there exists an integer ''b'' such that
:''a''&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1 (mod ''p''), i.e., ''p'' divides the difference {{nowrap|''a'' · ''b'' − 1}}.
The inverse ''b'' can be found by using [[Bézout's identity]] and the fact that the [[greatest common divisor]] {{nowrap|gcd(''a'', ''p'')}} equals 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Rosen|year = 2000|loc = p. 54 (Theorem 2.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}} above, the inverse of 4 is 4, and the inverse of 3 is 2, as {{nowrap|1=3 · 2 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 5)}}. Hence all group axioms are fulfilled. Actually, this example is similar to &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbb{Q}\setminus\left\{0\right\},\cdot\right)&lt;/math&gt; above: it consists of exactly those elements in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; that have a multiplicative inverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §VIII.1, p. 292}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are denoted '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;. They are crucial to [[public-key cryptography]].{{cref|p}}

===Cyclic groups===
{{Main|Cyclic group}}
[[Image:Cyclic group.svg|right|thumb|upright|The 6th complex roots of unity form a cyclic group. ''z'' is a primitive element, but ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not, because the odd powers of ''z'' are not a power of ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.]]
A ''cyclic group'' is a group all of whose elements are [[power (mathematics)|powers]] of a particular element ''a''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In multiplicative notation, the elements of the group are:
:..., ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e'', ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ...,
where ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; means ''a'' • ''a'', and ''a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;'' stands for ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; • ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''a'' • ''a'' • ''a'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; etc.{{cref|h}} Such an element ''a'' is called a generator or a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive element]] of the group. In additive notation, the requirement for an element to be primitive is that each element of the group can be written as
: ..., −''a''−''a'', −''a'', 0, ''a'', ''a''+''a'', ...

In the groups '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' introduced above, the element 1 is primitive, so these groups are cyclic. Indeed, each element is expressible as a sum all of whose terms are 1.  Any cyclic group with ''n'' elements is isomorphic to this group. A second example for cyclic groups is the group of [[root of unity|''n''-th complex roots of unity]], given by [[complex number]]s ''z'' satisfying {{nowrap|1=''z''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1}}. These numbers can be visualized as the vertices on a regular ''n''-gon, as shown in blue at the right for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}. The group operation is multiplication of complex numbers. In the picture, multiplying with ''z'' corresponds to a [[clockwise|counter-clockwise]] rotation by 60°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.2, p. 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using some [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], the group '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; can be shown to be cyclic: for example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}, 3 is a generator since {{nowrap|1=3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 3}}, {{nowrap|1=3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9 ≡ 4}}, {{nowrap|3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 2}}, and {{nowrap|3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1}}.

Some cyclic groups have an infinite number of elements.  In these groups, for every non-zero element ''a'', all the powers of ''a'' are distinct; despite the name "cyclic group", the powers of the elements do not cycle. An infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to {{nowrap|('''Z''', +)}}, the group of integers under addition introduced above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2005|loc = §II.1, p. 22 (example 11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these two prototypes are both abelian, so is any cyclic group.

The study of finitely generated abelian groups is quite mature, including the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]]; and reflecting this state of affairs, many group-related notions, such as [[Center (group theory)|center]] and [[commutator]], describe the extent to which a given group is not abelian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I.5, p. 26, 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symmetry groups===
{{Main|Symmetry group}}
{{see also|Molecular symmetry|Space group|Symmetry in physics}}
''Symmetry groups'' are groups consisting of [[symmetry|symmetries]] of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, such as the introductory symmetry group of the square, or of algebraic nature, such as [[polynomial equation]]s and their solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Weyl|year = 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptually, group theory can be thought of as the study of symmetry.{{cref|t}} [[Symmetry in mathematics|Symmetries in mathematics]] greatly simplify the study of [[geometry|geometrical]] or [[analysis|analytical objects]]. A group is said to [[group action|act]] on another mathematical object ''X'' if every group element performs some operation on ''X'' compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the [[(2,3,7) triangle group]] acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.

[[Image:Sixteenth stellation of icosahedron.png|right|thumb|200px|Rotations and reflections form the symmetry group of a [[great icosahedron]].]]
In chemical fields, such as [[crystallography]], [[space group]]s and [[point group]]s describe [[molecular symmetry|molecular symmetries]] and crystal symmetries. These symmetries underlie the chemical and physical behavior of these systems, and group theory enables simplification of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] analysis of these properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Conway|last2= Delgado Friedrichs|last3 = Huson|last4 = Thurston|year = 2001}}. See also {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Bishop|year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, group theory is used to show that optical transitions between certain quantum levels cannot occur simply because of the symmetry of the states involved.

Not only are groups useful to assess the implications of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The [[Jahn-Teller effect]] is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states that are related to each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.&lt;ref name=Bersuker&gt;{{citation |title=The Jahn-Teller Effect |first= Isaac |last= Bersuker |page=2 |isbn=0-521-82212-2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Jahn|last2=Teller|year = 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, group theory helps predict the changes in physical properties that occur when a material undergoes a [[phase transition]], for example, from a cubic to a tetrahedral crystalline form. An example is [[ferroelectric]] materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the [[Curie temperature]] and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft [[phonon]] mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.&lt;ref name=Dove&gt;{{citation |title=Structure and Dynamics: an atomic view of materials |first=Martin T|last= Dove |page=265 |isbn=0-19-850678-3 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] has found further application in elementary particle physics, where its occurrence is related to the appearance of [[Goldstone boson]]s.

Finite symmetry groups such as the [[Mathieu group]]s are used in [[coding theory]], which is in turn applied in [[forward error correction|error correction]] of transmitted data, and in [[CD player]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Welsh|year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another application is [[differential Galois theory]], which characterizes functions having [[antiderivative]]s of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain [[differential equation]]s are well-behaved.{{cref|u}} Geometric properties that remain stable under group actions are investigated in [[geometric invariant theory|(geometric)]] [[invariant theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Mumford|last2 = Fogarty|last3 = Kirwan|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General linear group and representation theory===
{{Main|General linear group|Representation theory}}
[[Image:Matrix multiplication.svg|right|thumb|250px|Two [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]] (the left illustration) multiplied by matrices (the middle and right illustrations). The middle illustration represents a clockwise rotation by 90°, while the right-most one stretches the ''x''-coordinate by factor 2.]]
[[Matrix group]]s consist of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] together with [[matrix multiplication]]. The ''general linear group'' {{nowrap|GL(''n'', '''R''')}} consists of all [[invertible matrix|invertible]] ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with [[real number|real]] entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lay|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its subgroups are referred to as ''matrix groups'' or ''[[linear group]]s''. The dihedral group example mentioned above can be viewed as a (very small) matrix group. Another important matrix group is the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(''n''). It describes all possible rotations in ''n'' dimensions. Via [[Euler angles]], [[Rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] are used in [[computer graphics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Kuipers|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Representation theory'' is both an application of the group concept and important for a deeper understanding of groups.&lt;ref name=FultonHarris&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Fulton|last2 = Harris|year = 1991|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Serre|year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; It studies the group by its [[group action]]s on other spaces. A broad class of [[group representation]]s are linear representations, i.e., the group is acting on a [[vector space]], such as the three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. A representation of ''G'' on an ''n''-[[dimension]]al real vector space is simply a group homomorphism
:''ρ'': ''G'' → GL(''n'', '''R''')
from the group to the general linear group. This way, the group operation, which may be abstractly given, translates to the multiplication of matrices making it accessible to explicit computations.{{cref|w}}

Given a group action, this gives further means to study the object being acted on.{{cref|x}} On the other hand, it also yields information about the group. Group representations are an organizing principle in the theory of finite groups, Lie groups, [[algebraic group]]s and [[topological group]]s, especially (locally) [[compact group]]s.&lt;ref name="FultonHarris"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Rudin|year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Galois groups ===
{{Main|Galois group}}
''Galois groups'' were developed to help solve [[polynomial equation]]s by capturing their symmetry features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Robinson|year = 1996|loc = p. viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Artin|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solutions of the [[quadratic equation]] {{nowrap|1=''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx'' + ''c'' = 0}} are given by
:&lt;math alt="x = (negative b plus or minus the squareroot of (b squared minus 4 a c)) over 2a"&gt;x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;
Exchanging "+" and "−" in the expression, i.e., permuting the two solutions of the equation can be viewed as a (very simple) group operation. Similar formulae are known for [[cubic equation|cubic]] and [[quartic equation]]s, but do ''not'' exist in general for [[quintic equation|degree 5]] and higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = Chapter VI}} (see in particular p. 273 for concrete examples)&lt;/ref&gt; Abstract properties of Galois groups associated with polynomials (in particular their [[solvable group|solvability]]) give a criterion for polynomials that have all their solutions expressible by radicals, i.e., solutions expressible using solely addition, multiplication, and [[Nth root|roots]] similar to the formula above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = p. 292 (Theorem VI.7.2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem can be dealt with by shifting to [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] and considering the [[splitting field]] of a polynomial.  Modern [[Galois theory]] generalizes the above type of Galois groups to [[field extension]]s and establishes—via the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]—a precise relationship between fields and groups, underlining once again the ubiquity of groups in mathematics.

== Finite groups ==
{{Main|Finite group}}
A group is called ''finite'' if it has a [[finite set|finite number of elements]]. The number of elements is called the [[order (group theory)|order]] of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Kurzweil|last2= Stellmacher|year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An important class is the ''[[symmetric group]]s'' S&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, the groups of [[permutation]]s of ''N'' letters. For example, the symmetric group on 3 letters [[dihedral group of order 6|S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the group consisting of all possible orderings of the three letters ''ABC'', i.e., contains the elements ''ABC'', ''ACB'', ''BAC'', ''BCA'', ''CAB'', ''CBA'', in total 6 ([[factorial]] of 3) elements. This class is fundamental insofar as any finite group can be expressed as a subgroup of a symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; for a suitable integer ''N'', according to [[Cayley's theorem]]. Parallel to the group of symmetries of the square above, S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can also be interpreted as the group of symmetries of an [[equilateral triangle]].

The order of an element ''a'' in a group ''G'' is the least positive integer ''n'' such that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e'', where ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; represents

: &lt;math&gt;\underbrace{a \cdots a}_{n \text{ factors}},&lt;/math&gt;

i.e., application of the operation • to ''n'' copies of ''a''. (If • represents multiplication, then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; corresponds to the ''n''th power of ''a''.) In infinite groups, such an ''n'' may not exist, in which case the order of ''a'' is said to be infinity. The order of an element equals the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by this element.

More sophisticated counting techniques, for example counting cosets, yield more precise statements about finite groups: [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's Theorem]] states that for a finite group ''G'' the order of any finite subgroup ''H'' [[divisor|divides]] the order of ''G''. The [[Sylow theorems]] give a partial converse.

The [[dihedral group]] (discussed above) is a finite group of order 8. The order of r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is 4, as is the order of the subgroup ''R'' it generates (see above). The order of the reflection elements f&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; etc. is 2. Both orders divide 8, as predicted by Lagrange's theorem. The groups '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt; above have order {{nowrap|''p'' − 1}}.

=== Classification of finite simple groups ===
{{Main|Classification of finite simple groups}}
Mathematicians often strive for a complete [[classification theorems|classification]] (or list) of a mathematical notion. In the context of finite groups, this aim leads to difficult mathematics. According to Lagrange's theorem, finite groups of order ''p'', a prime number, are necessarily cyclic (abelian) groups '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;. Groups of order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can also be shown to be abelian, a statement which does not generalize to order ''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, as the non-abelian group D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of order 8 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; above shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Artin|year = 1991|loc = Theorem 6.1.14}}. See also {{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = p. 77}} for similar results.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer algebra system]]s can be used to [[List of small groups|list small groups]], but there is no classification of all finite groups.{{cref|q}} An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups.{{cref|r}} A nontrivial group is called ''[[simple group|simple]]'' if its only normal subgroups are the [[trivial group]] and the group itself.{{cref|s}} The [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = §I. 3, p. 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of finite simple groups|Listing all finite simple groups]] was a major achievement in contemporary group theory. 1998 [[Fields Medal]] winner [[Richard Borcherds]] succeeded in proving the [[monstrous moonshine]] conjectures, a surprising and deep relation between the largest finite simple [[sporadic group]]—the "[[monster group]]"—and certain [[modular function]]s, a piece of classical [[complex analysis]], and [[string theory]], a theory supposed to unify the description of many physical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Ronan|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groups with additional structure==
Many groups are simultaneously groups and examples of other mathematical structures. In the language of [[category theory]], they are [[group object]]s in a [[category (mathematics)|category]], meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called [[morphism]]s) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object in the [[category of sets]].

===Topological groups===
[[Image:Circle as Lie group2.svg|right|thumb|The [[unit circle]] in the [[complex plane]] under complex multiplication is a Lie group and, therefore, a topological group. It is topological since complex multiplication and division are continuous. It is a manifold and thus a Lie group, because every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|small piece]], such as the red arc in the figure, looks like a part of the [[real line]] (shown at the bottom). ]]
{{Main|Topological group}}
Some [[topological space]]s may be endowed with a group law. In order for the group law and the topology to interweave well, the group operations must be [[continuous function]]s, that is, {{nowrap|''g'' • ''h''}}, and ''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; must not vary wildly if ''g'' and ''h'' vary only little. Such groups are called ''topological groups,'' and they are the group objects in the [[category of topological spaces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Husain|year = 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most basic examples are the [[real number|reals]] '''R''' under addition, {{nowrap|('''R''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, and similarly with any other [[topological field]] such as the [[complex number]]s or [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. All of these groups are [[locally compact topological group|locally compact]], so they have [[Haar measure]]s and can be studied via [[harmonic analysis]]. The former offer an abstract formalism of invariant [[integral]]s. [[Invariant (mathematics)|Invariance]] means, in the case of real numbers for example:
: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x)\,dx = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f(x+c)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
for any constant ''c''. Matrix groups over these fields fall under this regime, as do [[adele ring]]s and [[adelic algebraic group]]s, which are basic to number theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Neukirch|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galois groups of infinite field extensions such as the [[absolute Galois group]] can also be equipped with a topology, the so-called [[Krull topology]], which in turn is central to generalize the above sketched connection of fields and groups to infinite field extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Shatz|year = 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advanced generalization of this idea, adapted to the needs of [[algebraic geometry]], is the [[étale fundamental group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Milne|year = 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lie groups===
{{Main|Lie group}}
''Lie groups'' (in honor of [[Sophus Lie]]) are groups which also have a [[manifold]] structure, i.e., they are spaces [[diffeomorphism|looking locally like]] some [[Euclidean space]] of the appropriate [[dimension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Warner|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the additional structure, here the manifold structure, has to be compatible, i.e., the maps corresponding to multiplication and the inverse have to be [[smooth map|smooth]].

A standard example is the general linear group introduced above: it is an [[open subset]] of the space of all ''n''-by-''n'' matrices, because it is given by the inequality
:det (''A'') ≠ 0,
where ''A'' denotes an ''n''-by-''n'' matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Borel|year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lie groups are of fundamental importance in modern physics: [[Noether's theorem]] links continuous symmetries to [[conserved quantities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Goldstein|year = 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotation]], as well as [[translation (geometry)|translations]] in [[space]] and [[time]] are basic symmetries of the laws of [[mechanics]]. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description.{{cref|v}} Another example are the [[Lorentz transformation]]s, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of [[Minkowski space]]. The latter serves—in the absence of significant [[gravitation]]—as a model of [[space time]] in [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citations|nb=yes|last=Weinberg|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the [[Poincaré group]]. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for [[quantum field theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Naber|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Local symmetry|Symmetries that vary with location]] are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of [[gauge theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes| last = Becchi|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
{{Group-like structures}}
In [[abstract algebra]], more general structures are defined by relaxing some of the axioms defining a group.&lt;ref name="MacLane"&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Mac Lane|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Denecke|last2 = Wismath|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last1 = Romanowska|last2 = Smith|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the requirement that every element has an inverse is eliminated, the resulting algebraic structure is called a [[monoid]]. The [[natural number]]s '''N''' (including 0) under addition form a monoid, as do the nonzero integers under multiplication {{nowrap|('''Z''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, see above. There is a general method to formally add inverses to elements to any (abelian) monoid, much the same way as {{nowrap|('''Q''' ∖ {0}, ·)}} is derived from {{nowrap|('''Z''' ∖ {0}, ·)}}, known as the [[Grothendieck group]].
[[Groupoid]]s are similar to groups except that the composition {{nowrap|''a'' • ''b''}} need not be defined for all ''a'' and ''b''. They arise in the study of more complicated forms of symmetry, often in [[topology|topological]] and [[mathematical analysis|analytical]] structures, such as the [[fundamental groupoid]] or [[stack (mathematics)|stacks]]. Finally, it is possible to generalize any of these concepts by replacing the binary operation with an arbitrary [[arity|''n''-ary]] one (i.e., an operation taking ''n'' arguments). With the proper generalization of the group axioms this gives rise to an [[n-ary group|''n''-ary group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Dudek|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table gives a list of several structures generalizing groups.

'''Herbert William Weekes''' (8 May 1841 – 21 November 1914) was a well-known English [[Genre works#Genre painting|genre]] and [[animal painter]] of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] period who specialized in portraying animals in humorous, human-like situations.

==Later life and career==
Weekes appears to have used his middle name, William, for all but formal purposes. He lived and worked for most of his life in London, at 21 Oppidans Road, [[Primrose Hill]].&lt;ref name="Burlington"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invaluable"/&gt; In 1865, he married artist Caroline Anne Henshaw (born ca. 1844), of [[Hammersmith]].&lt;ref name="British Census"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGI record"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = FamilySearch International Genealogical Index | work = | publisher = FamilySearch.org | year = 1881 | url = http://www.familysearch.org/eng/search/IGI/individual_record.asp?recid=500137223138&amp;lds=1&amp;region=2&amp;frompage=99

Known as an animal and genre painter of the Victorian Neoclassical style, Weekes' work was popular, and helped expand 19th century animal painting from its traditional role of simply recording beasts into a way of reflecting human life.&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Herbert William Weekes Biography | work = | publisher = Haynes Fine Art of Broadway | date = | url = http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/william-weekes.htm | doi = | accessdate = 28 Jan 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216063958/http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/william-weekes.htm | archivedate = 2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Artnet"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =  Herbert William Weekes | work = | publisher = Artnet | date = | url = http://www.artnet.com/artist/654188/herbert-william-weekes.html | doi =

His work shows a sensitive understanding of his subject matter, and part of his success in capturing the peaceful country atmosphere depicted in so many of his paintings lay in his affection for it.&lt;ref name="Millington Adams"&gt;{{cite web| title =  Suspicion| publisher = Cinoa| url = http://www.cinoa.org/exhibits/55323|doi =| accessdate = 13 Jul 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was greatly influenced by one of the foremost animal painters of the nineteenth century, Sir [[Edwin Henry Landseer]].&lt;ref name="Invaluable"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink =

Weekes contributed illustrations for ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' in 1883, and exhibited extensively in various London and provincial galleries. His works were well received - although not by everyone: a contemporary wit described his paintings as “Weekes' Weak Squeaks”.&lt;ref name="Collins-Quiet"/&gt;

His works were alternatively signed with the initials 'WW' (sometimes overlaid), 'W. Weekes', 'William Weekes', 'Herbert William Weekes', 'H.W. Weekes', 'H. Weekes', and simply 'Weekes'. They were exhibited in a variety of venues from 1864 to 1904, with frequencies as follows:&lt;ref name="Collins-Quiet"/&gt;

'''Kustom Kulture''' is a [[neologism]] used to describe the [[art]]works, [[vehicle]]s, [[hairstyle]]s, and [[fashion]]s of those who drove and built [[custom car]]s and [[Custom (motorcycle)|motorcycles]] in the [[United States of America]] from the 1950s through today. 
It was born out of the hot rod culture of Southern California of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="DutchTurner1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Von Dutch|author2=Ron Turner|author3=Ed Roth|author4=Robert Williams|title=Custom Culture: Von Dutch, Ed "Big Daddy" Roth,Robert (Bob) Bond, Robert Williams and Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10di738DvjoC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=1 November 1993|publisher=Last Gasp|isbn=978-0-86719-405-0|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of [[hot rod]]ding, many fashions and styles developed. Over time, each of these distinct styles of customizing have blended and reshaped our everyday life. Artists such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch (Kenny Howard)]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and  custom car builder [[Ed Roth|Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]]; along with Lyle Fisk, [[Dean Jeffries]]; hot rod and [[lowrider]] customizers such as the [[Barris Brothers]] (Sam and [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2265319/Batmobile-Man-paid-1-original-sells-auction-4-6M.html|title=George Barris with Batmobile: Photos|publisher=Daily Mail | location=London|date=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with numerous [[tattoo]] artists, automobile painters, and movies and television shows such as ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[The Munsters]]'' ([[The Munster Koach]], [[DRAG-U-LA]]) have all helped to form what is known as Custom Culture.

Custom Culture is usually identified with the [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]]s of the 1950s, the [[drag racing|drag racers]] of the 1960s, and the [[lowrider]]s of the 1970s. Other subcultures that have had an influence on Custom Culture are the [[Skinhead]]s, [[mods and rockers]] of the 1960s, the [[punk rock|punk]] rockers of the 1970s, the metal and [[rockabilly]] music, along with the [[scooterboy]]s of the 1980s, and [[psychobilly]] of the 1990s. Each separate culture has added their own customizations to the cars, their own fashions, influenced the music, and added their own ideas of what is cool, what is acceptable, and what is not. Everything from wild pinstriped paintjobs, to choptop [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]s, to custom [[Harley-Davidson]] and [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycles, to [[metallic paint|metal-flake]] and black [[Primer (paint)|primer]] paint jobs, along with music, cartoons, and monster movies have influenced what defines anyone and anything who is part of this automobile subculture.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Kustom Kulture had taken on a rebirth of American subcultures from the 1950s and 1960s with  [[DIY]] activities. Each style is distinct, and has its roots in American automobile history. Many styles that would not have tolerated each other in the past now come together in large car shows.

==Kustom Graphics==
The rebirth of Kustom Kulture has seen the  use of the term “Kustom Graphics” to describe the style of artwork associated with the subculture when applied to posters, flyers, T-shirts and logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kustom Graphics|date=2008|publisher=Korero Books|isbn=9780955339868|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locals in these countries, influenced by American culture, have created a local hot rod culture which is vibrant in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]  where enthusiasts gather at meetings such as [[Power Big Meet]] and clubs like Wheels and Wings in [[Varberg]], Sweden have established themselves in Hot Rod culture. Since there is very little "vintage tin" the hot rods in Sweden are generally made with a home made chassis (usually a Model T or A replica), with a Jaguar (or [[Volvo 240]]) rear axle, a [[Small-block#Small block|small block]] [[V8 engine|V8]], and [[fiberglass]] tub, but some have been built using for instance a [[Volvo Duett]] chassis. Because the Swedish regulations required a crash test even for custom-built passenger cars between 1969 and 1982, the Duett option was preferred, since it was considered a rebodied Duett rather than a new vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070228060401/http://hem.passagen.se/stur/pages/artiklar/duettrod/Duettrodden.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070129040558/http://hem.passagen.se/stur/pages/galleri/duetter/Duettrods.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930003248/http://amazon.forum.bilia.se/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=25500&amp;sid=e89d2d537977372aa45c4d0c5b7b9598]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garaget.org/?car=19319][http://www.garaget.org/?car=16701][http://www.garaget.org/?car=19319]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some 1950s and 1960s cars are also hot rodded, like [[Morris Minor]], [[Ford Anglia]], [[Volvo Amazon]], [[Ford Cortina]], [['57 Chevy]], to name but a few. These are known as [[custom cars]] (sometimes spelled Kustom).

'''Lief Java''' (literally "Sweet Java") was an orchestra in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia). It was one of the first ''[[keroncong]]'' groups in the colony.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=14}}

==Members==
Various musicians are recorded as having been part of the Lief Java orchestra. This includes [[Ismail Marzuki]], a singer-cum-songwriter known for his nationalist works;{{sfn|JCG, Ismail Marzuki}} the blind singer [[Annie Landouw]];{{sfn|Apa Siapa|1999|p=240}} and the theatrically-trained husband and wife team [[Kartolo]] and [[Roekiah]].{{sfn|Imong 1941, Riwajat Roekiah–Kartolo|p=26}} Other members included Hugo Dumas, Atjep, and Miss Netty.{{sfn|JCG, Lief Java}}

==History==
Lief Java was established in 1918 by Soewardi as the Rukun Anggawe Santoso Orchestra before changing its name to Lief Java in 1923. The orchestra used a variety of instruments, including [[cello]]s, [[flute]]s, [[guitar]]s, and [[violins]]. Most of the artists were amateurs, with little previous experience. The orchestra practiced in Kampung Kepuh, Kemayoran, Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]), in the home of musician S. Abdullah, and played a variety of songs, both originals and arrangements or adaptations.{{sfn|JCG, Lief Java}} The company had two musical divisions, ''[[keroncong]]'' and jazz.{{sfn|Yampolsky|2013|p=206}}

Sometime after 1925, after Dutch entrepreneurs established [[NIROM]], Lief Java began playing music over the radio as part of the station's Eastern Programme.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=20}} This helped the orchestra to grow in popularity and reach new audiences outside of Batavia. Ultimately, however, the orchestra left NIROM owing to concerns over the use of their intellectual property; NIROM appropriated a song they had composed for use in opening all of their broadcasts. Thus, sometime after 1937 the orchestra quit NIROM{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=21}} and joined the rival station VORO (Vereeniging voor Oostersche Radio Omroep), playing live every Saturday.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=28}} By the mid 1930s Hugo Dumas was the orchestra's leader.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=13}}

In 1938 Lief Java completed its first [[film score]], working for [[Tan's Film]] on its production ''[[Fatima (1938 film)|Fatima]]''.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Fatima}} As Roekiah was the main star of Tan's, the orchestra was retained to score the company's later releases. This included ''[[Gagak Item]]'' (1939){{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1939, Gagak Item}} and ''[[Siti Akbari]]'' (1940).{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Siti Akbari}} Some of the orchestra's singers, such as Kartolo and Landouw, joined the company as actors.{{sfn|Imong 1941, Riwajat Roekiah–Kartolo|p=26}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Annie Landouw}} The orchestra also toured; one trip, to Borneo in 1939, is known to have been a commercial success.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=35}}

During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], the troupe abandoned changed their name from the Dutch Lief Java to the Japanese Kireina Djawa. During this period the orchestra performed live on several occasions, and their songs became increasingly pro-East Asian.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=59}} The orchestra was still in existence in 1949.{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=14}}

==Legacy==
An article in ''Pedoman Radio'' described the orchestra as "the 'mother' of the vocal and musical arts of Indonesia" ("'Ibu' seni-suara dan seni-musik Indonesia").{{sfn|Esha|Alhaziri|Fauzi|Donald W.|2005|p=14}}

The '''Liverpool Academy of Arts'''  was founded in [[Liverpool]] in April 1810 as a regional equivalent of the [[Royal Academy]], London. It followed the Liverpool Society of Artists, first founded in 1769, which had a fitful existence until 1794.&lt;ref&gt;James Stonehouse, Handbook for the Stranger in Liverpool,Liverpool, 2nd. ed., 174-6&lt;/ref&gt; Two local art collectors, [[Henry Blundell (art collector)|Henry Blundell]] and [[William Roscoe]] were its first Patron and Secretary, the [[Prince Regent]]  [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George]] gave his patronage for the next three years, and it was actively promoted by presidents of the Royal Academy.

Its membership included local artists such as the landscapists [[John Rathbone (artist)|John Rathbone]], [[Richard Ansdell]], [[Thomas Chubbard]], [[Alfred William Hunt]] and [[Charles Barber (artist)|Charles Barber]], and the sculptor [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]].

Leading artists of the day competed for its prize of £50 for non-local contributors to its annual exhibition, including [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Henry Fuseli]], [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[Joseph Wright of Derby]].

In the late 1850s, however, it split due to major disagreements following annual prizes being awarded to the then controversial [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painters, particularly to [[William Holman Hunt]] in 1852 for ''Valentine Rescuing Sylvia from Proteus'' and to [[John Everett Millais|Millais]] in 1857 for ''The Blind Girl''.

The Academy remained nominally in existence, continuing to hold annual exhibitions, but never regaining its national importance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6249">[[File:Ma’oz Hayyim.JPG|250px|thumbnail|Ma’oz Hayyim Synagogue]]
The '''Maoz Haim Synagogue''' was originally constructed in the 3rd century as a simple [[Byzantine]]-era type [[basilica]] building, later apsidical, in the [[Beit She'an]] region in northern [[Israel]]. Discovered in February 1974 by Mr. A. Ya’aqobi during some unrelated digging near [[Maoz Haim]], it stands out as an unusual archeological find that contains a record of synagogue development from a time of otherwise sparse historiography. It was even developing right through times of anti-Judaic legislation and sermonizing.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 211&lt;/ref&gt; The [[synagogue]] was located amongst a large settlement in which it served as a center of worship for [[Jews]] there from its beginning up through its final destruction by fire sometime in the early 7th century.&lt;ref name=Levine89&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The initial layout began as a fourteen by twelve and a half meter square room with two rows of five columns with benches lining the walls, although none remained standing.&lt;ref&gt;אפרים שטרן. אנציקלופדיה החדשה לחפירות ארכיאולוגית בארץ ישראל&lt;/ref&gt; There was a single entrance eastward which is considered to be unusual. Most synagogues, aside from others which were located in the same northern Galil region, did not share this feature. However, it is mentioned in rabbinic sources as part of the synagogue layout in order to emulate the eastward entrance utilized by the [[Tabernacle]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The focal point of the synagogue was located southward, towards [[Jerusalem]]. Such an orientation had not previously been a feature of synagogues of the era, but was a new custom which was just beginning to take hold.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 195&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially noticeable with remodeling which was done in the 4th century, altering the synagogue to feature an apse in the southern wall. While the synagogue did not originally have a narthex, one was added during the later phases of building to the north, although it was totally destroyed. The later phases also added an additional entrance to the north, presumably to allow for easier access to the sanctuary.

==Apse==
The apse, where the Torah Shrine had previously stood in the first phase of the synagogue, was further modified in the 6th century to include a raised platform enclosed by a [[chancel screen]] which may have been used to emphasize the sanctity of the Torah shrine area as compared to the rest of the synagogue or the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Steven. This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of the Synagogue During the Greco-Roman Period, 222&lt;/ref&gt; Such separations were very common in ancient synagogues and the raised [[bima]] area is what shows that this was no exception.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 87&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the screen depicted a menorah as well as [[Hebrew]] letters. The only Hebrew word in the entire building was [[Shalom]]; the remainder of the inscriptions were in [[Greek language|Greek]].

Behind the bima there was an area, possibly a geniza, in which several coins, pottery, and glass were found, which were amongst the few artifacts that were found at all at the site. The coins themselves were from the Byzantine era and helped identify the stages of building and development. More coins, fifty in all, were found outside the southern wall which were most likely hidden there amongst broken roof tiles in order to serve as a possible emergency funds, although the original owner never had the chance to claim them.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mosaic Floor==
There were many interesting [[mosaic]]s which were found at the dig site. The only figures found were birds, but there were also many Jewish symbols portrayed in mosaic form, including a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], an [[etrog]], a [[shofar]] and grapes. However, the symbols and birds were covered up in the 7th century, transforming the synagogue into one which was aniconic, likely as an act of piety.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to this, the majority of the remaining floor was primarily composed of [[geometric patterns]]. Geometric patterns were popular before as in the earliest layer to an extent, but likely were especially valued in an aniconic society. However, it was not well preserved in the upper layers due to the aforementioned destruction of uncertain cause and additional construction that occurred by the local populace afterwards.&lt;ref name=Levine89/&gt; Despite this, the mosaic floor from the initial stage of construction was better preserved as it had been filled in with approximately 30 centimeters of dirt to lay the new aniconic floor, although not many artifacts were found within it.

In [[mathematics]], a '''non-Euclidean crystallographic group''', '''NEC group''' or '''N.E.C. group''' is a [[discrete group]] of [[isometries]] of the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] plane. These [[symmetry group]]s correspond to the [[wallpaper group]]s in [[euclidean geometry]]. A NEC group which contains only [[Orientability|orientation-preserving]] elements is called a [[Fuchsian group]], and any non-Fuchsian NEC group has an index 2 Fuchsian subgroup of orientation-preserving elements.

The hyperbolic [[triangle group]]s are notable NEC groups. Others are listed in [[Orbifold_notation#Hyperbolic_plane|Orbifold notation]].

'''Norrköping Exhibition of Art and Industry''' ({{lang-sv|Konst- och industriutställningen i Norrköping}}) was an [[exhibition]] in [[Norrköping]], Sweden in 1906.

At the initiative of the local industrial association ''Norrköpings Fabriksförening och Handtverksförening'' it was decided an art and industrial exhibition should be held in Norrköping between June{{nbsp}}1{{snd}}September{{nbsp}}15, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Hulting, Johan (Norrköping 1906), ''Norrköping och dess omgifningar. Officiell handbok utgifven af Förvaltningsutskottet för 1906 års Konst- och Industriutställning, s V-XX''.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was opened by the [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf]] and was mostly held at the area south of the Sylten neighbourhood.  The architect [[Carl Bergsten]] designed the exhibition's two main buildings the ''Industrihallen'' (industrial hall) that was {{convert|7500|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} with places for 630 exhibitiors, and the ''Konsthallen'' (art exhibition hall). He also designed the ''Jaktpaviljongen'' (hunting pavilion). [[Werner Northun]] designed the ''Maskinhallen'' (engines hall) at a total of {{convert|3600|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}, as well as the main restaurant seating 400 people and the ''Thaliatemplet'' theatre (500 folding chairs).

== Art exhibition ==
The cultural parts of the 1906 exhibition attracted huge attention when over 900 pieces of art were shown in 15 different rooms. Artists included [[Anna Ancher]], [[Michael Ancher]], [[Ivar Arosenius]], [[Oscar Björk]], [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]], [[Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke|Prince Eugen]], [[Peder Severin Krøyer]], [[Carl Larsson]], [[Birger Palme]], [[Georg Pauli]], [[Hanna Pauli]], [[Georg von Rosen]], [[David Wallin]], [[Nabot Törnros]] and [[Anders Zorn]].&lt;ref&gt;Gunnar Hagberg och Magnus Höjer, ''Från Pelle till Pillan'', 2000.

'''Padraic Colum''' (8 December 1881 – 11 January 1972) was an Irish poet, novelist, dramatist, biographer, playwright, children's author and [[folklore|collector of folklore]]. He was one of the leading figures of the [[Irish Literary Revival]].

==Early life==
[[File:Padraic Colum in the 1900s.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait drawing of Colum by [[John Butler Yeats|John B. Yeats]], 1900s]]

Colum was born '''Patrick Columb''' in a [[County Longford]] workhouse, where his father worked. He was the first of eight children born to Patrick and Susan Columb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 April 2012 4:17:03 AM #.26# |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/padraic-colum |title=Biodata |publisher=Poemhunter.com |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the father lost his job in 1889, he moved to the United States to participate in the [[Colorado gold rush]]. Padraic and his mother and siblings remained in Ireland. When the father returned in 1892, the family moved to [[Glasthule]], near [[Dublin]], where his father was employed as Assistant Manager at [[Sandycove and Glasthule railway station]]. His son attended the local [[National school (Ireland)|national school]].

When Susan Columb died in 1897, the family was temporarily split up. Padraic (as he would be known) and one brother remained in Dublin, while their father and remaining children moved back to Longford. Colum finished school the following year and at the age of seventeen, he passed an exam for and was awarded a clerkship in the [[Irish Railway Clearing House]]. He stayed in this job until 1903.

During this period, Colum started to write and met a number of the leading Irish writers of the time, including [[W. B. Yeats]], [[Lady Gregory]] and [[George William Russell|Æ]]. He also joined the [[Gaelic League]] and was a member of the first board of the [[Abbey Theatre]]. He became a regular user of the [[National Library of Ireland]], where he met [[James Joyce]] and the two became lifelong friends. During the riots caused by the Abbey Theatre's production of ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'', Padraic Colum's father, Patrick Columb, was one of the protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/synge-s-opening-night-to-remember-1.1291816|title=Synge's opening night to remember|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padraic himself was not engaged in the protests, although he did pay his father's fine afterwards.

He collected Irish folk songs, and sometimes rewrote them almost in their entirety, including the famous ''[[She Moved Through the Fair]]''. Colum based his poem on one surviving line, while his collaborator, the musicologist [[Herbert Hughes (musicologist)|Herbert Hughes]] noted the tune.&lt;ref&gt;"SHE MOVED THROUGH THE FAIR". (9 April 1970). ''The Irish Times''&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a five-year scholarship by a wealthy American benefactor, Thomas Hughes Kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/libraries/newsletter/2014spring/colum.html|title=Boston College Libraries Newsletter - Spring 2014|last=chrishp|website=www.bc.edu|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it to read, study and write. He did not attend University College Dublin, or any other University as a student.

==Early poetry and plays==
He was awarded a prize by [[Cumann na nGaedheal (1900)|Cumann na nGaedheal]] for his anti-enlistment play, ''The Saxon Shillin'''. Through his plays he became involved with the National Theatre Society and became involved in the founding of the [[Abbey Theatre]], writing several of its early productions. His first play, ''Broken Soil'' (revised as The Fiddler's House) (1903) was performed by [[W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Fay: The Fays of the Abbey Theatre. 1935. p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Land'' (1905), was one of that theatre's first great public successes. He wrote another important play for the Abbey named ''Thomas Muskerry'' (1910).

His earliest published poems appeared in ''The United Irishman'', a paper edited by [[Arthur Griffith]]. His first book, ''Wild Earth'' (1907) collected many of these poems and was dedicated to Æ. He published several poems in [[Arthur Griffith]]'s paper, ''[[The United Irishman]]'' this time, with ''The Poor Scholar'' bringing him to the attention of [[William Butler Yeats|WB Yeats]]. He became a friend of Yeats and [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]].  In 1908, he wrote an introduction to the [[Everyman's Library]] edition of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[Tales of Mystery and Imagination]]''.

In 1911, with [[Mary Colum|Mary Gunning Maguire]], a student from UCD, and David Houston and [[Thomas MacDonagh]], he founded the short-lived literary journal ''The Irish Review'', which published work by Yeats, [[George A. Moore|George Moore]], [[Oliver St John Gogarty]], and many other leading Revival figures.

In 1912 he married Maguire. Padraic taught at [[Pádraig Pearse]]'s experimental school, [[St. Enda's School|Scoil Éanna]] in Rathfarnham, County Dublin and Mary Maguire taught at the girls' school, Scoil Íde or St. Ita's, which was set up in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, Dublin, once Scoil Éanna had moved to Rathfarnham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://limerick100.wordpress.com/2014/10/16/i-care-not-if-my-life-has-only-the-span-of-a-night-and-a-day-if-my-deeds-be-spoken-of-by-the-men-of-ireland-padraic-colums-thoughts-on-pearse-and-macdonagh-1916/|title=Spotlight: Padraic Colum’s thoughts on Pearse and MacDonagh (1916)|last=@Limerick1914 in Art, Education, Politics, Religion, Spotlight|first=|date=16 October 2014|website=History is what we choose to remember Researching Limerick 100 years ago, Slavery, Memory, Power|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the couple lived in the Dublin suburb of [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]], where they held a regular Tuesday literary salon. They then moved to [[Howth]], a small fishing village just to the north of the capital. In 1914, they travelled to the US for what was intended to be a visit of a few months but lasted most the rest of their lives.

==Later life and work==
In America, Colum took up children's writing and published a number of collections of stories for children, beginning with ''[[The King of Ireland's Son]]'' (1916). This book came about when Colum started translating an Irish folk tale from [[Irish language|Gaelic]] because he did not want to forget the language. After it was published in the [[New York Tribune]], Hungarian Illustrator [[Willy Pogany]] suggested the possibility of a book collaboration, so Colum wove the folktale into a long, epic story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Critical History of Children's Literature |last=Viguers |first=Ruth Hill |authorlink= |author2=Cornelia Meigs (ed.) |year=1969 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing co. |location= |isbn=0-02-583900-4 |page=426 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of his books for children were awarded retrospective citations for the [[Newbery Honor]]. A contract for children's literature with [[Macmillan Publishers]] made him financially secure for the rest of his life. Some other books he wrote are ''The Adventure of Odysseus'' (1918) and ''The Children of Odin'' (1920). These works are important for bringing classical literature to children.

In 1922 he was commissioned to write versions of Hawaiian folklore for young people. This resulted in the publication of three volumes of his versions of tales from the islands. At the suggestion of Dr Pádraic Whyte (School of English, Trinity College Dublin) a first edition of the first volume (''At the Gateways of the Day'') was presented to US president Barack Obama by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on the occasion of his visit to Dublin, Ireland on 23 May 2011.&lt;ref name="IT28May2011"&gt;{{cite web

The Colums spent the years from 1930 to 1933 living in Paris and [[Nice]], where Padraic renewed his friendship with [[James Joyce]] and became involved in the transcription of ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.

After their time in France, the couple moved to New York City, where they did some teaching at [[Columbia University]] and [[CCNY]]. Colum was a prolific author and published a total of 61 books, not counting his plays. He adopted the form of [[Noh]] drama in his later plays.

While in New York, he wrote the screenplay for the 1954 stop-motion animated film [[Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy|Hansel and Gretel]].  It was his only screenplay. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0173365/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary died in 1957 and Padraic finished ''Our Friend James Joyce'', which they had worked on together. It was published in 1958. Colum divided his later years between the United States and Ireland. In 1961 the Catholic Library Association awarded him the [[Regina Medal]]. He died in [[Enfield, Connecticut]], age 90, and was buried in [[St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton]].

In 1965, Colum sold the notebooks, manuscripts, galley proofs, and letters that were in his apartments in New York and Dublin to the [[Binghamton University|Binghamton University Libraries]].  He wished to make whatever resources he could available to scholars of Irish literature and history.&lt;ref&gt;http://slipknot.binghamton.edu/?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=5746&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=38960&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked how to say his name, he told ''The [[Literary Digest]]'' the last name was the same as the word ''column''. "In my first name, the first ''a'' has the sound of ''au''.  The ordinary pronunciation in Irish is ''pau'drig''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Earle Funk]], ''What's the Name, Please?'', Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hermann Paradisus Batavus.jpg|thumb|''Paradisus batavus'' by Paul Hermann, Leyden, 2nd Edn. 1705]]

'''Paul Hermann''' (30 June 1646, [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] – 29 January 1695, [[Leiden]]) was a German-born physician and botanist who for 15 years as director of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]].

Born in Halle, [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Germany, Paul Hermann was the son of Johann Hermann, a well-known organist, and Maria Magdalena Röber, a clergyman's daughter. Hermann studied theology and medicine in Wittenberg and botany in Leipzig.
After graduating from Europe's finest medical school, [[Padua]] in 1670, he was then engaged by the [[Dutch East India Company]] and went to Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) as a Ship's Medical Officer. He was in their employ from 1672 to 1677. During his stay there, he made a scientific collection of this island's plants and other organisms. He was then offered the job at Leiden and took up the Chair of Botany at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]] in 1679 and took up his residence in 1680 at Leiden where he spent the rest of his professional life.  He immediately set to making it the finest botanical garden in Europe.

[[File:Hermann Lilium africanum polyanthos.jpg|thumb|''[[Cybistetes|Lilium Africanum Polyanthos]]'' in ''Paradisus batavus'', 1698]]
Hermann's ''Paradisus batavus'', a description of the plants of the Leyden university botanical garden, was published three years after his death in 1698 and edited by [[William Sherard]].  There was a second edition published in 1705. Sherard edited his notes and solicited patronage for the publication of this important book. They were students together of [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort |Tournefort]] in Paris in 1688. This is where Hermann perfected his botanical draughtsmanship. Later Sherard collected more of his notes and produced a catalog published as ''Musaeum Zeylanicum'' (1717, 2nd edn.: 1727). Hermann's original Ceylon collection was used by [[Carl Linnaeus]] when he wrote his ''Flora Zeylanica'' (1747) and [[Species Plantarum|''Species plantarum'']] (1753), using the abbreviation "Hermann herb." in those publications. After Hermann's collections had passed through many hands, they were eventually purchased by Sir [[Joseph Banks]]. Now they are kept at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London.  Hermann was a very good [[botanical illustrator]] and had an excellent botanical grasp as declared by Linnaeus himself.

&lt;/ref&gt;
Numerous comparable burials have been found in neighboring western Mongolia.

The tombs are [[Scythian]]-type [[kurgans]], [[tumulus|barrow]]-like tomb mounds containing wooden chambers covered over by large [[cairn]]s of boulders and stones, dated to the 4th - 3rd centuries BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''A Special Issue on the Dating of Pazyryk.'' ''Source: Notes in the History of Art'' 10, no. 4, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The spectacular burials at Pazyryk are responsible for the introduction of the term ''kurgan'', a Russian word of Turkic origin, into general usage to describe these tombs. The region of the Pazyryk kurgans is considered the [[type site]] of the wider [[Pazyryk culture]]. The site is included in the [[Golden Mountains of Altai]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

The bearers of the Pazyryk culture were horse-riding pastoral [[nomad]]s of the [[steppe]], and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in [[Persia]], [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;{{cite book

These finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation.

Because of a freak climatic freeze, some of the Altai-Sayan burials, notably those of the 5th century BCE at Pazyryk and neighbouring sites, such as [[Katanda]], [[Shibe, Siberia|Shibe]], and [[Tuekt]], were isolated from external climatic variations by a protective layer of ice that conserved the organic substances buried in them.
Certain geometric designs and [[sun symbols]], such as the circle and [[Rosette (design)|rosette]], recur at Pazyryk but are completely outnumbered by animal motifs. Such specifically Scythian features as zoomorphic junctures, i.e. the addition of a part of one animal to the body of another, are rarer in the Altaic region than in southern Russia. The stag and its relatives, however, figure as prominently in Altai-Sayan as in [[Scythian art]]. &lt;ref name="Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://global.britannica.com/art/Central-Asian-arts/Visual-arts |title=Altaic Tribes|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"At Pazyryk too are found bearded mascarons ([[funerary mask|masks]]) of well-defined Greco-Roman origin, which were doubtless inspired by the [[Hellenistic kingdoms]] of the [[Cimmerian]] [[Bosporus]]."&lt;ref name=Rene&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pazyryk deer.jpg|thumb|upright|A gilded wooden figurine of a deer from the Pazyryk burials, fifth century BC]]
The first tomb at Pazyryk, barrow 1, was excavated by the [[archaeologist]] M. P. Gryaznov in 1929; barrows 2-5 were excavated by [[Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko]] in 1947-1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudenko|1970|pp=18, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the tombs had already been looted in earlier times, the excavators unearthed buried horses, and with them immaculately preserved cloth saddles, felt and woven rugs including the world's oldest pile [[carpet]],&lt;ref name="EB_Carpet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512386/rug-and-carpet/73762/Symbolism-of-overall-design#toc73765 |title=Rug and carpet: Oriental carpets |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EB_Central_Asian_Arts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/102325/Central-Asian-arts/13969/Altaic-tribes |title=Central Asian Arts: Altaic tribes |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [https://web.archive.org/web/20000106182748/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7e.html 3-metre-high four-wheel funeral chariot] from the 5th century BC and other splendid objects that had escaped the ravages of time.&lt;ref name="EB_Stone_Age"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/567232/Stone-Age/52383/European-cultures |title=Stone Age: European cultures |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica (company)|Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These finds are now exhibited at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].

Craniological studies of samples from the Pazyryk burials determined that skulls were generally of [[Europoid]] type, with some showing [[Mongoloid]] features.&lt;ref name="Rudenko45"&gt;{{harvnb|Rudenko|1970|p=45}} "Although in general the skulls in the series are of europeoid type, there are some among them with markedly mongoloid features."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pazyryk chief===
Rudenko's most striking discovery was the body of a tattooed Pazyryk chief: a thick-set, powerfully built man who had died when he was about 50. Parts of the body had deteriorated, but much of the tattooing was still clearly visible (see [[:Image:Scythian tatoo.jpg|image]]). Subsequent investigation using reflected [[infrared photography]] revealed that all five bodies discovered in the Pazyryk kurgans were tattooed.&lt;ref&gt;Findings published in ''Archaeology, Ethnology and Anthropology of Eurasia'', Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; No instruments specifically designed for tattooing were found, but the Pazyryks had extremely fine needles with which they did miniature [[embroidery]], and these were probably used for tattooing.

The chief was elaborately decorated with an interlocking series of striking designs representing a variety of fantastic beasts. The best preserved [[tattoo]]s were images of a [[donkey]], a [[argali|mountain ram]], two highly stylized [[deer]] with long antlers and an imaginary [[carnivore]] on the right arm. Two monsters resembling [[griffin]]s decorate the chest, and on the left arm are three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a [[mountain goat]]. On the front of the right leg a [[fish]] extends from the foot to the knee. A monster crawls over the right foot, and on the inside of the shin is a series of four running rams which touch each other to form a single design. The left leg also bears tattoos, but these designs could not be clearly distinguished. In addition, the chief's back is tattooed with a series of small circles in line with the vertebral column.  This tattooing was probably done for therapeutic reasons. Contemporary Siberian tribesmen still practice tattooing of this kind to relieve back pain.

===Ice Maiden===
{{main|Siberian Ice Maiden}}
[[Image:Mummy of the Ukok Princess.jpg|thumb|The Ice Maiden - fifth century BC]]
The most famous undisturbed Pazyryk burial so far recovered is the [[Siberian Ice Maiden|Ice Maiden]] or "Altai Lady" found by archaeologist [[Natalia Polosmak]] in 1993 at Ukok, near the Chinese border. The find was a rare example of a single woman given a full ceremonial burial in a wooden chamber tomb in the fifth century BC, accompanied by six horses.&lt;ref name="nova" /&gt;
She had been buried over 2,400 years ago in a casket fashioned from the hollowed-out trunk of a Siberian [[Larch|larch tree]]. On the outside of the casket were stylized images of deer and [[snow leopard]]s carved in leather. Shortly after burial the grave had apparently been flooded by freezing rain, and the entire contents of the burial chamber had remained frozen in [[permafrost]]. Six horses wearing elaborate harnesses had been sacrificed and lay to the north of the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Polosmak, Natalia (1994). "A Mummy Unearthed from the Pastures of Heaven." ''National Geographic'' 186:4, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The maiden's well-preserved body, carefully embalmed with peat and bark, was arranged to lie on her side as if asleep. She was young, and her hair was shaven off but wearing a wig and tall hat; she had been 167 cm (5 feet 6&amp;nbsp;inches) tall. Even the [[animal style]] [[tattoo]]s were preserved on her pale skin: creatures with horns that develop into flowered forms. Her coffin was made large enough to accommodate the high felt headdress she was wearing, which was decorated with swans and gold-covered carved cats.&lt;ref&gt;Polosmak (1994), pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; She was clad in a long crimson and white striped woolen skirt and white felt stockings. Her yellow blouse was originally thought to be made of wild "[[tussah]]" silk but closer examination of the fibers indicate the material is not Chinese but was a [[wild silk]] which came from somewhere else, perhaps [[India]].&lt;ref name="atlas"/&gt; Near her coffin was a vessel made of [[yak]] horn, and dishes containing gifts of [[coriander]] seeds:  all of which suggest that the Pazyryk trade routes stretched across vast areas of Iran{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}. Similar dishes in other tombs were thought to have held ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'',  confirming a practice described by [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref name="nova"/&gt; but after tests the mixture was found to be coriander seeds, probably used to disguise the smell of the body.

Two years after the discovery of the "Ice Maiden" Dr. Polosmak's husband, Vyacheslav Molodin, found a frozen man, elaborately tattooed with an elk, with two long braids that reached to his waist, buried with his weapons.

Doctor Anicua also noted that her blouse was a bit stained, indicating that the material was not a new garment, made for the burial.

===Pazyryk carpet===
[[Image:Scythiancarpet.jpg|thumb|upright|The Pazyryk carpet]]

One of the most famous finds at Pazyryk is the '''Pazyryk carpet''', which is probably the oldest surviving [[pile carpet]] in the world. It measures 183×200&amp;nbsp;cm and has a knot density of approximately 360,000 [[knot density|knots per]] square meter, which is higher than most modern carpets. The middle of the carpet consists of a ribbon motif, while in the border there is a procession with elk or deer, and in another border warriors on horses. The Pazyryk carpet was manufactured in Ancient Armenia (one of hypotheses)around 400 BC. When it was found it had been deeply frozen in a block of ice, which is why it is so well-preserved. The carpet can be seen at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.&lt;ref name="Carpet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carpetencyclopedia.com/pages/History-184.html |title=History of handknotted carpets |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=CarpetEncyclopedia.com |publisher= |access-date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other findings===
In a corner of one grave chamber of the Pazyryk cemetery was a fur bag containing cannabis seed, a censer filled with stones, and the hexapod frame of an inhalation tent - these are believed to have been utilized at the end of the funerary ritual for purification.

Other undisturbed kurgans have been found to contain remarkably well-preserved remains, comparable to the earlier [[Tarim mummies]] of [[Xinjiang]]. Bodies were preserved using [[mummy|mummification]] techniques and were also naturally frozen in solid ice from water seeping into the tombs.  They were encased in coffins made from hollowed trunks of [[larch]] (which may have had sacral significance) and sometimes accompanied by sacrificed concubines and horses.  The clustering of tombs in a single area implies that it had particular ritual significance for these people, who were likely to have been willing to transport their deceased leaders great distances for burial.

As recently as the summer of 2012,  tombs have been discovered at various locations.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  In January 2007 a timber tomb of a blond chieftain warrior was unearthed in the permafrost of the [[Altai Republic|Altai mountains region]] close to the Mongolian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Russian Archaeologists Discover Remains of Ancient Chieftain in Altai Permafrost | url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2007/01/10/ancienttomb.shtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302010403/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2007/01/10/ancienttomb.shtml | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-03-02 | date=2007-01-10 | accessdate=2007-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of the presumed Pazyryk chieftain is tattooed; his sable coat is well preserved, as are some other objects, including what looks like [[scissors]]. A local archaeologist, Aleksei Tishkin, complained that the indigenous population of the region strongly disapproves of archaeological digs, prompting the scientists to move their activities across the border to [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Daria Radovskaya | url=http://www.rg.ru/2007/01/10/kochevnik.html | title=Кочевник был блондином | publisher=[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]] | date=2007-01-10 | accessdate=2007-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pazyryk culture==
{{main|Pazyryk culture}}
Rudenko initially assigned the neutral label [[Pazyryk culture]] for these nomads and dated them to the 5th century BC; the dating has been revised for barrows 1-5 at Pazyryk, which are now considered to date to the 4th-3rd centuries B.C.&lt;ref&gt;See above, n. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pazyryk culture has since been connected to the [[Scythians]] whose similar tombs have been found across the steppes.  The Siberian [[animal style]] tattooing is characteristic of the Scythians. Trading routes between [[Central Asia]], [[China]] and the [[Near East]] passed through the oases on the plateau and these ancient Altai nomads profited from the rich trade and culture passing through.&lt;ref name="nomads"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_2_7.html
|title=Early Nomads of the Altaic Region
|publisher=The Hermitage
|accessdate=2007-07-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that Pazyryk trade routes were vast and connected with large areas of [[Asia]] including [[India]], perhaps Pazyryk merchants largely trading in high quality horses.&lt;ref name="nova"/&gt;

There is also the possibility that the current inhabitants of the [[Altay Mountains|Altai]] region are descendants of the Pazyryk culture, a continuity that would accord with current ethnic politics: [[Archaeogenetics]] is now being used to study the Pazyryk mummies.

[[File:Poliptico de pissa Masaccio reconstruccion.jpg|thumb|Conjectural arrangement of the surviving panels. [[:File:Reconstruction of fragmrnts of Masaccio's Pisan altarpiece (after C. Gardner von Teuffel).jpg|Another idea]]]]

The '''Pisa Altarpiece''' (Italian - ''Polittico di Pisa'') was a large multi-paneled [[altarpiece]] produced by [[Masaccio]] for the chapel of [[Julian the Hospitaller|Saint Julian]] in the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine, Pisa|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in [[Pisa]]. The chapel was owned by the [[notary]] Giuliano di Colino, who commissioned the work on February 19, 1426 for the sum of 80 florins. Payment for the work was recorded on December 26 of that year. The altarpiece was dismantled and dispersed to various collections and museums in the 18th century, but an attempted reconstruction was made possible due to a detailed description of the work by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] in 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori,'' ed. Gaetano Milanesi, Florence, 1906, II, 292.; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T0DPSdOVX2UC&amp;pg=PA25 online translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a [[tempera]] painting on a gold ground and wood panel. It originally had at least five compartments organised in two registers, making ten main panels, of which only four are known to have survived. Another four side panels and three [[predella]] panels (two of which had a double scene) are now in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. The altarpiece's central panel was '''''Madonna and Child with Angels''''', produced in collaboration with Masaccio's brother Giovanni and with [[Andrea di Giusto]], now in the [[National Gallery, London]].

Eleven panels are known as of 2010, and they are insufficient to reconstruct the whole work with certainty. In particular four standing figures of saints flanking the central panel are missing. Vasari says these were the saints shown in the [[predella]] narrative scenes: Peter, John the Baptist, Julian and Nicholas. In particular it is unclear if these larger saints occupied the more traditional individual framed compartments, as proposed by C. Gardner von Teuffel and others, or stood in a unified field with the central Virgin and Child, as proposed by [[John Shearman]], which was to be become the usual style in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Reconstruction of fragmrnts of Masaccio's Pisan altarpiece by John Shearman..jpg|Central area, per John Shearman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving panels==
The eleven surviving panels are:
*Upper Register: ''Crucifixion'' (Naples); Saint Paul (Pisa); Saint Andrew (Malibu)
*Central Register: ''Madonna and Child with Angels'' (London); Augustine, Jerome, two Carmelite saints (all Berlin) 
*Predella (all Berlin): ''Adoration of the Magi''; two scenes of the ''Crucifixion of St Peter'' and ''Martyrdom of St John the Baptist''; two scenes from the legends of St Julian and St Nicholas

===Upper Register===
====Crucifixion====
The ''Crucifixion'' was placed above the central panel of the altarpiece, underlining the sacrificial (Eucharistic) nature of the central panel.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Dunkerton et al., ''Giotto to Dürer: Early Renaissance Painting in the National Gallery,'' New Haven, 1991, 248–251.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the panel unnaturalistically represents the narrative against a gold background (a medieval formula for representing sacred scenes), Masaccio creates an effect of reality by depicting the event from below, as the viewer standing before the altar truly saw it. In this way, he attempts to tie the viewer to the scene, to make the sacred accessible to the ordinary Christian.

====Saints====
Now in the [[Museo Nazionale di Pisa]], the panel of [[Paul of Tarsus]] is the only portion of the commissioned work which remains in [[Pisa]]. It is usually reconstructed as being one of two flanking panels to the left of the ''Crucifixion''. St Andrew was one of two flanking panels to the right of the ''Crucifixion'' and is now in the [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty Museum, Los Angeles]].

===Lower Register===
====Madonna and Child with Angels====
[[File:Masaccio. Madonna and Child. 1426. National Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|''Madonna and Child with Angels'', 135.5 cm x 75 cm, National Gallery, London]]
The altarpiece's central panel was ''Madonna and Child with Angels'', produced in collaboration with Masaccio's brother Giovanni and with [[Andrea di Giusto]]. The panel is in a very damaged state and smaller than its original size; it has lost perhaps as much as 8&amp;nbsp;cm. at the bottom and 2-2.5&amp;nbsp;cm. at each side.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Dunkerton and Dillian Gordon, "The Pisa Altarpiece," in Carl Brandon Strehlke, ed.''The Panel Paintings of Masolino and Masaccio: The Role of Technique,'' Milan, 2002, 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven surviving panels of the altarpiece, which is the only documented work by Masaccio, are in various museums.&lt;ref&gt;Documents published in James Beck, ''Masaccio: The Documents,'' Locust Valley, NY, 1978, Appendix, 31–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars hypothesize the reconstruction of the altarpiece based on a very complete description by [[Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori,'' ed. Gaetano Milanesi, Florence, 1906, II, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting contains six figures: the Madonna and Child and four angels. The Madonna is the centre figure and is larger than any of the others to signify her importance. Christ sits on her knees, eating grapes offered to him by his mother. Although he is an exceedingly babyish baby (in comparison to the babies of Masaccio's immediate predecessors, like [[Lorenzo Monaco]] or [[Gentile da Fabriano]]), the grapes are a symbol of his blood – like the red wine of Communion – which indicates Christ's awareness of his eventual death. The Madonna looks sorrowfully at her child, as she also realises his fate.  
 
In many ways the style of the painting is traditional; the expensive gold background and ultramarine draperies of the Virgin, her enlarged scale, and her hierarchical presentation (ceremoniously enthroned) all fit within the late-medieval formulas for the representation of Mary and Jesus in glory. In other ways, however, the painting is a step away from International Gothic in the sense that Masaccio has created a more realistic approach to the subject: 
*The faces are more realistic and not idealised.
*The baby Jesus is less of a small man and more childlike.
*An attempt at creating depth has been attempted by Massacio's placement of the two background angels and through the use of linear perspective in the throne.
*Modeling is clearly visible as the light source is coming from the left of the painting.
*The Madonna is a bulky figure, deriving from classical models, and her drapery has larger and more naturalistic folds that shape her body.

Masaccio has used linear perspective to create pictorial space; it can be seen on the orthogonal on the cornice of her throne. The vanishing point is at the child's foot. The reason for this is that the work was originally located above a representation of the Adoration of the Magi, in which one of the magi kisses Jesus' foot.  
[[File:Masaccio 001.jpg|thumb|400px|''Adoration of the Magi'', Berlin]]
[[File:Masaccio. Stories of St Julian and St. Nicholas. 1426. Berlin-Dahlem.jpg|thumb|400px|''Scenes from the legends of St Julian and St Nicholas'']]
Although the paintings are noticeably different (the subjects are clothed differently and on different chairs) the Madonna is more or less in the same position in both works. This parallelism is designed to make viewers have the same attitude as the magus when looking at the Madonna and Child. They are imagined to be kneeling in front of Mary, and could easily lean forward to kiss the foot of Jesus.

Masaccio has also used the overlapping of figures and objects to create pictorial space, like the two angels in the foreground overlapping the throne and the throne overlapping the two angels in the background.

===Predella===
This was placed below the central panel or panels; probably there were only the three surviving panels, according to most reconstructions. They are about {{convert|21|x|61|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} and now in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. They show the ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'', especially praised by Vasari and presumed to have been the central panel, two scenes of the ''Crucifixion of St Peter'' and ''Martyrdom of St John the Baptist'', and two scenes from the legends of St Julian and St Nicholas in the third panel. These stories come from compilations such as the ''[[Golden Legend]]''. In the last, at left [[Julian the Hospitaller]] kills his parents, after having been misinformed by the devil, shown in the centre. At right [[Saint Nicholas]] is secretly pushing gold through the bedroom window of two poor girls, to provide a [[dowry]] for them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">'''''Postminimalism''''' is an art term coined (as '''''post-minimalism''''') by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in 1971&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 569. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used in various artistic fields for work which is influenced by, or attempts to develop and go beyond, the aesthetic of [[minimalism]]. The expression is used specifically in relation to music and the visual arts, but can refer to any field using minimalism as a critical reference point.  
In music, ''postminimalism'' refers to music following [[minimal music]].

==Visual art==
{{See also|List of postminimalist artists}}
In visual art, postminimalist art uses minimalism either as an aesthetic or conceptual reference point. Postminimalism is more an artistic tendency than a particular movement.  Postminimalist artworks are usually everyday objects, use simple materials, and sometimes take on a "pure", [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] aesthetic. However, since postminimalism includes such a diverse and disparate group of artists, it is impossible to enumerate all the continuities and similarities between them.

The work of [[Eva Hesse]] is also postminimalist: it uses "grids" and "seriality", themes often found in minimalism, but is also usually hand-made, introducing a human element into her art, in contrast to the machine or custom-made works of minimalism. [[Richard Serra]] is a prominent post-minimalist.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta (April 14, 2011). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/arts/design/richard-serras-drawings-at-metropolitan-museum-of-art.html?pagewanted=all Richard Serra's Drawings at Metropolitan Museum of Art]", ''NYTimes.com''. Accessed 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of postminimalist composers}} 
In its general musical usage, ''postminimalism'' refers to works influenced by [[minimal music]], and it is generally categorized within the meta-genre [[art music]]. Writer [[Kyle Gann]]&lt;ref name="Gann2001"&gt;Kyle Gann. 2001. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040811/http://www.newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=1536 Minimal Music, Maximal Impact: Minimalism's Immediate Legacy: Postminimalism]". ''New Music Box: The Web Magazine from the American Music Center'' (November 1) (Accessed 4 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; has employed the term more strictly to denote the style that flourished in the 1980s and 1990s and characterized by: 
#a steady [[pulse (music)|pulse]], usually continuing throughout a work or movement; 
#a [[diatonic scale|diatonic]] pitch language, [[tonality|tonal]] in effect but avoiding traditional [[diatonic function|functional tonality]]; 
#general evenness of [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], without strong climaxes or nuanced emotionalism; and 
#unlike [[minimalism]], an avoidance of obvious or linear formal design.

Minimalist procedures such as [[additive rhythm and divisive rhythm|additive]] and subtractive [[process music|process]] are common in postminimalism, though usually in disguised form, and the style has also shown a capacity for absorbing influences from world and popular music ([[Balinese gamelan]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], Jewish [[cantillation]], and so on). 

For a musical style derived from minimalism, see [[Totalism (music)]].

[[File:Nikolai Zykov with hand puppets, Russia.jpg|thumb|Puppeteer with hand puppets.]]
A '''puppeteer''' is a person who manipulates an inanimate object that might be shaped like a human, animal or mythical creature, or another object to create the illusion that the [[puppet]] is "alive". The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience. A puppeteer can operate a puppet indirectly by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by his or her own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally or any other part of the body- such as the legs. Some puppet styles require two or more puppeteers to work together to create a single puppet character.

The puppeteer's role is to manipulate the physical object in such a manner that the audience believes the object is imbued with life. In some instances, the persona of the puppeteer is also an important feature, as with [[ventriloquist's dummy]] performers, in which the puppeteer and the human figure-styled puppet appear onstage together, and in theatre shows like ''[[Avenue Q]]''.

The puppeteer might speak in the role of the puppet's character, synchronising the movements of the puppet's "mouth". However, there is much puppetry which does not use the moving mouth (which is a lip-sync innovation created originally for television where close-up "headshots" are popular). Often, in theatre, a moveable mouth is used only for gestural expression, or speech might be produced by a non-moving mouth. In traditional glove puppetry often one puppeteer will operate two puppets at a time out of a cast of several.
Much work is produced without any speech at all with all the emphasis on movement

The relationship between the puppeteer and the puppet-maker is similar to that between an [[actor]] and a [[playwright]], in cases where a puppet-maker designs a puppet for a puppeteer. Very often, though, the puppeteer assumes the joint roles of puppet-maker, [[Theatre director|director]], [[designer]], writer and [[performer]]. In this case a puppeteer is a more complete theatre practitioner than is the case with other theatre forms, in which one person writes a play, another person directs it, and then [[actor]]s perform the lines and gestures.

Puppetry is a complex medium sometimes consisting of live performance, sometimes contributing to stop frame puppet animation, and film where performances might be technically processed as motion capture, CGI or as virtual puppetry.

Ellis lectured at the Yeovil School of Art in [[Somerset]] from 1953 to 1957.&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt; After he moved to [[Auckland]] in 1957 he began teaching at [[Elam School of Fine Arts]]. In 1992 he was awarded a personal chair in 1992, and retired as a Professor Emeritus in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/the-collection/browse-artists/1933/robert-ellis|title = Robert Ellis|date = |accessdate = 1 September 2015|website = Auckland Art Gallery|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1982 he was a visiting professor at [[Ohio State University]].&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt;

Ellis served as a council member of the Auckland Society of Arts, and was the foundation president of the New Zealand Society of Industrial Designers. He was also a council member, secretary, and president of the New Zealand Society of Sculptors, Painters and Associates, and was a New Zealand delegate to the [[FIDEM|International Art Medal Federation]].&lt;ref name="Whos who"/&gt; In the [[2001 New Year Honours]] Ellis was appointed an [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit]] for services to fine arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dpmc.govt.nz/node/388 | title=New Year honours list 2001 |date=30 December 2000 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis has been described as one of "New Zealand's pre-eminent artists" and he has held more than 60 solo exhibitions in New Zealand and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.milfordgalleries.co.nz/dunedin/artist/112-Robert-Ellis|title = Robert Ellis|date = |accessdate = 1 September 2015|website = Milford Galleries Dunedin|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His landscape paintings address themes of urbanisation, subdivision and colonisation. [[Auckland Art Gallery]] senior curator Ron Brownson describes Ellis's place in modern New Zealand art: "As a major figure, Ellis' art addresses many cultural issues. His subjects range over tensions between transport and urbanism, contrast ecology with spirituality and look at the on-going nature of Māori–Pākehā relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/about/media-releases/friends-of-gallery-gift-important-artwork-in-first-time-exhibition-of-paintings-by-senior-auckland-artist|title = Friends of Gallery gift important artwork in first-time exhibition of paintings by senior Auckland artist|date = 2014|accessdate = 1 September 2015|website = |publisher = Auckland Art Gallery|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work was the focus of a major book published by Ron Sang in 2015, entitled ''Robert Ellis'' [see review below]. He continues to produce small works on paper in his studio at home.

== Work ==
Throughout his career Ellis has produced a diverse range of works. They include not only paintings and works on paper, but also stained glass (design of the east wall of the nave in Holy Trinity Cathedral, Parnell), tapestry (the largest in the world at the time, and now in the Aotea Centre, Auckland), and medallions.

== History ==
The Royal Scottish National Orchestra (RSNO) Chorus evolved from a choir formed in 1843 (then the Glasgow Choral Union) to sing the first full performance of [[Handel’s Messiah]] in Scotland.  Today, the Chorus' main role is to perform alongside the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]], which it does in around six different programmes each year, including an annual performance (usually on 2 January) of Handel's Messiah.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
The RSNO Chorus has around 120 members, from across the central belt of Scotland.  The Chorus rehearses on a Wednesday evening in Glasgow, at the RSNO's new purpose-built home, at 19 Killermont Street.  This purpose-built flexible 600-seat venue is used as a performance space, a rehearsal space for the Orchestra and Chorus, and as a recording facility (primarily for the RSNO, but also available for external use).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = RSNO launch new purpose-built home in Glasgow
| website = www.scotsman.com
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The venue has been described as 'state of the art' and 'world-class'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/music/rsno-launch-new-purpose-built-home-in-glasgow-1-3949266|title=RSNO launch new purpose-built home in Glasgow|website=www.scotsman.com|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chorus regularly holds open rehearsals to allow potential new members to join for an evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Artistic Team ==
'''Gregory Batsleer - Chorus Director'''

The Chorus is directed by [[Gregory Batsleer]].  In 2015, Gregory was announced that year's winner of the Arts Foundation Choral Conducting award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.artsfoundation.co.uk/Artist-Name/all/564/Batsleer-Gregory
| title = Artist Gregory Batsleer Profile {{!}} 2015 {{!}} Arts Foundation
| website = www.artsfoundation.co.uk
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory splits his time between Scotland and London.  In Scotland he is also Chorus Director of the [[Scottish Chamber Orchestra]] Chorus, a post he has held since 2009, and in London he is the Artistic Director of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]’s Choir in Residence Programme and Principal Conductor of the Portrait Choir. 

'''Edward Cohen - Accompanist'''

The RSNO Chorus is accompanied in its weekly rehearsals by Edward Cohen.  Edward trained at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], [[Indiana University]], and the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]], where he currently holds a position as keyboard lecturer and staff accompanist. Edward also enjoys a busy freelance performing career, and works with a number of choirs and ensembles throughout Scotland and further afield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polly Beck - Vocal Coach'''

Polly studied at the RSAMD (now the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]]), and later the Postgraduate Opera Course at the RNCM, for which she won an entrance scholarship. Polly returned to Scotland to work with [[Scottish Opera]], and has performed as a soloist with several UK orchestras, and in many festivals.

Polly currently teaches, as a Vocal Instructor focusing on voice and performance skills, for Inverclyde Music Service. She is also Vocal Coach for Inverclyde Senior Choir, and teaches at the [[University of Glasgow]], the Junior Conservatoire of the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland|RCS]] and the [[National Youth Choir of Scotland]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== RSNO Chorus Tours ==
In addition to concerts throughout the year in Scotland, both with the RSNO and independently, the RSNO Chorus has been fortunate to be invited to perform with orchestras in many different parts of the world, often at the request of world-class conductors. The RSNO Chorus has most recently toured to Prague, where they performed [[Mozart's Requiem]] with the [[Czech National Symphony Orchestra]], under the baton of [[Libor Pešek]], as part of the Prague Proms.  The Chorus has also toured to Copenhagen, Hong Kong, Israel, and Australia, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Synopsis==
Jin Yu ([[Cecilia Liu]]), an orphan girl of [[Xiongnu]] ethnicity, was raised by wolves in the desert, until a [[Han Chinese]] decided to adopt her. Two years later, following the death of her adoptive father due to political changes, she decides to follow the man's wish and flees to [[Jian'an]], the capital of Western [[Han Dynasty]], changing her name to Xin Yue. Along her journey, she meets Mo Xun ([[Hu Ge]]), a calm and kind disabled man, and later the handsome, cold general Wei Wu Ji ([[Eddie Peng]]). In Jian'an, thanks to her determination, Xin Yue becomes the head of a dance house and helps a quiet girl named Qin Xiang ([[Fala Chen]]) to meet the Emperor. Qin Xiang then turns into the Emperor's most powerful concubine and schemes against Xin Yue. In the meantime, Xin Yue's past with the Xiongnu catches up with her when she meets her childhood friend, Hu Wei Li (Qin Hao), who is now the Ruler of the Damo plains.

While battling against the onslaught of her painful childhood memories and the political intrigue of the royal family, Xin Yue must also choose between Mo Xun and Wei Wu Ji.

==Production==
Filming for the series started on 8 March 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Chinese|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/p/2012-03-02/16593571148.shtml|script-title=zh:图文：《大漠谣》开机-合影|date=March 2, 2012|work=Sina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended on 2 July 2012. Subsequent review by [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television|SARFT]] however, claimed the series of falsifying historical accounts. Extensive changes were thus required, resetting the entire premise to take place in a fictional era in a fictional country. Character names from the novel which were based on Chinese historical figures were changed, and dialogues and subtitling were revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Chinese|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2014-09-16/02304209210.shtml|script-title=zh: 《大漠谣》三易名 盘点命途坎坷的剧|date=September 16, 2014|work=Sina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early titles of the series were ''Ballad of the Desert'' (大漠谣, ''Dàmò yáo'', also known as ''A Story of the Wolf Girl''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Chinese|url=http://www.hunantv.com/c/20120830/1121572659_31.html|script-title=zh:《大漠谣》新一版剧照 绝色佳人刘诗诗貌美倾城|date=August 30, 2012|work=Hunan TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Romance of the Desert'' (大漠奇缘, ''Dàmò qí yuán'') and ''The Legend of Moon and Star'' (星月传奇, ''Xīng yuè chuánqí'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9526">'''Strategy guides''' are instruction books that contain hints or complete solutions to specific [[video game]]s.  The line between strategy guides and walkthroughs is somewhat blurred, with the former often containing or being written around the latter. Strategy guides are often published in print, both in book form and also as articles within [[video game journalism|video game magazine]]s. In cases of exceptionally popular game titles, guides may be sold through more mainstream publication channels, such as bookstores or even newsstands. Some publishers also sell [[E-Book]] versions on their websites.

Strategy guides marketed as "official" are written by game distributors themselves or licensed to a specialty publishing house; [[Prima Games]] (a division of [[Random House]]) and Piggyback Interactive (a division of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]) specialise in writing official guides for various companies. There are also a number of publishers who make unlicensed, "unofficial" strategy guides, and many of today's mainstream publishers began by making such guides.

==Typical contents==
The contents of a strategy guide varies between game genres. Typically, the guides contain:
* Detailed [[gameplay]] information, for example, maneuvers that are not detailed in the manual.
* Complete maps of the game, which show the placement of all items (including hidden and hard-to-find ones).
* Detailed instructions for specific locations on how to proceed from there.
* Explanations of puzzles.
* Details of enemies, including techniques on defeating individual enemies (especially [[boss (video games)|bosses]]), the segment for minor enemies is commonly referred to as a [[bestiary]].
* Checklist of collectible items.
* Cheats and game editing, although this has been less common in official guides.
* Walkthroughs to help the player complete levels.
* Advice on tactics and strategies for use in multi-player (games with multi-player only)

==Publishing before game release==
In order to be released at the same time as the game, commercial strategy guides are often based on a pre-release version of the game, rather than the final retail version; BradyGames' guide for ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', for instance, included some misplaced item locations and a slightly different map, which made some directions impossible to follow. BradyGames rectifies such mistakes by offering free [[errata]] pages for download from their [[website]].

Strategy guides are sometimes published before the game itself is published.  This can be risky because there is always the chance that a game will end up not being released.  In January [[2001 in video gaming|2001]], Prima published a guide ({{ISBN|0-7615-3125-4}}) for the [[Dreamcast]] version of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', which was canceled late in development when [[Sega]] discontinued the [[video game console|console]].

==Online guides==
{{Video games}}
{{Main|Video game walkthrough}}
Online strategy guides and FAQs are hosted at sites such as [[GameFAQs]] and [[IGN|IGN FAQs]], though much of this content is user generated and not published by the company.  A number of other sites contain strategy guides, and videos in a number of niche areas, such as Role Playing Games or First Person Shooters. These sites may attract a more limited set of viewers, but can include more depth of content. Video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] have given rise to [[Video game walkthrough|video walkthroughs]] using programs such as [[Fraps]], which allows players to more easily mirror the strategies being described. These videos are re-posted to a number of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiddenarea.com/search/label/Video%20Post|title=Example of YouTube Video Re-posts|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109051251/http://www.hiddenarea.com/search/label/Video%20Post|archivedate=2016-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game wikis are used as both strategy guides and documentation. Content is generated and edited completely by users. Wikis allow for information to updated if a developer introduced a new patch to the game. Wiki farms such as [[Fandom (website)|Fandom]] and [[Gamepedia]] host a large number of unofficial video game wikis while wikis can be integrated into the overall site such as [[IGN|IGN Wikis]]. While most wikis are considered unofficial and not supported by the developer, some developers may choose to do so for various reasons. These reasons may include resolving copyright issues and [[real world trading]] that may be found on unofficial wikis. For example, [[ArenaNet]] hosts an official wiki for ''[[Guild Wars]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'', citing that "it's often more complete and useful than the documentation that ArenaNet generates internally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Wiki:About|title=About Guild Wars Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information on the wiki is integrated into the game, allowing players to access information from in game. Although the wiki is hosted by ArenaNet, the site is run and moderated by the community and contributions are released under GNU Free Document License (GDFL) similar to sites such as Wikipedia.

Aside from the quality of the content, the community aspect of fan walkthroughs is significant. One perspective argues that walkthroughs are shared stories for gamers and game fans.  In creating walkthroughs, gamers actively create meaning for the games.  This is similar to activities of traditional media such as books, films and television (e.g., [[Fan Fiction]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|title=Zelda 64 and Video Game Fans: A Walkthrough of Games, Intertextuality, and Narrative|journal=[[Television &amp; New Media]]|year=2003|volume=4|issue=3|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing availability of free online FAQs and walkthroughs has taken away some of the demand for commercial strategy guides, although there is still a large market for them. Print guides often feature extensive picture-by-picture walkthroughs, maps, and game art, none of which is possible in the [[plain-text]] works hosted by prominent sites such as [[GameFAQs]]. Some newer sites allow strategy guides to be hosted in formats that allow pictures and videos, which further undercuts the advantages of print strategy guides.

Some publishers have tried combining their printed books with the [[Internet]]. In [[2000 in video gaming|2000]], the ''[[Final Fantasy IX|Final Fantasy IX Official Strategy Guide]]'' was published by BradyGames, but much of the information was contained on Square's [[PlayOnline]] website. This seemed like a good way to promote PlayOnline, while creating a guide that would have updatable content, but it was widely panned. Players saw no need of buying a book if a significant part of the content was online; and there was no point paying for online content from one site, if it was available for free on another site. As a result, Square abandoned the online strategy guide concept and released complete printed guides for future games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/ |title=Square's Innovative Strategy Guide Strategy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617055414/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/ |archivedate=June 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source mistakes==
Some companies  will, at times, make mistakes in the book about the game itself, such as stating that "Character A" has a relationship with "Character B", despite there being no relationship. In a strategy guide for ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]'' they referred to characters with terms such as "The Dinosaur" and "The Octopus" instead of their names.

Games journalist and guide writer [[Alan Emrich]] has severely criticized recent strategy guides for:
*Containing only facts which should have been in the game manual, e.g. about the [[user interface]].
*Failing to teach users how to improve their play.
*Failing to provide information which helps them to make decisions, e.g. about the capabilities and costs of units and buildings.
*Being inaccurate, often because the developers have tweaked the game during the publication [[lead time]].

The faults, he says, are mainly caused by the game publishers' and guide publishers' haste to get their products on to the market;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[previously] strategy guides were published after a game was released so that they could be accurate, even to the point of including information changes from late game 'patch' releases. The ''[[Master of Orion]]'' official strategy guide that Tom Hughes and I wrote is just that kind of book."&lt;ref name="emrich"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://moo3.quicksilver.com/game/history.html | title=Master of Orion: The History of a Game Series — One Man's Telling of a Cosmic Tale | publisher=Master of Orion III - The Official Web Site | date=2001 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | author=Emrich, Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Street Light''''' (sometimes called '''''The Street Light: Study of Light''''') ([[Italian language|Italian]]: '''''{{lang|it|Lampada ad arco}}''''') is a painting by Italian [[Futurism|Futurist]] painter [[Giacomo Balla]], dated 1909, depicting an electric [[street light|street lamp]] casting a glow which outshines the crescent moon.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Giacomo Bala|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Giacomo-Balla#ref752456|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="okelley"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Kelley|first1=Chris|title=Futurism: Illuminating New Perspectives in the Visual Arts|url=&lt;!--http://hubpages.com/education/Futurism-Illuminating-New-Perspectives-in-the-Visual-Arts--&gt;|website=HubPages|accessdate=19 July 2016|date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was inspired by streetlights at the [[Piazza Termini]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=Thomas B.|title=The Cover|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=October 2011|volume=306|issue=16|page=1739|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/66866886/cover|accessdate=19 July 2016|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.1450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lamp posts were a subject of Balla's work as early as 1900–1901. The iconography of a stylized street lamp appeared in a commercial poster in 1910, though it is not known if this work influenced Balla or vice versa.&lt;ref name="D'Elia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Elia|first1=Anna|title=L'Universo Futurisa: Una Mappa: Dal Quadro alla Cravatta|date=1988|publisher=Edizioni Dedalo|isbn=9788822060808|pages=24–25|accessdate=20 July 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uXA6LCY2S8C|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though dated 1909, ''Street Light'' was most likely painted in the latter half of 1911, following Balla's rejection from an art exhibition in Milan. Fellow Futurist [[Umberto Boccioni]] encouraged Balla to continue his efforts in Futurism, with an eye to the 1912 Futurist exhibition at the [[Bernheim-Jeune]] Gallery in Paris. Though the work is mentioned in the catalog for that exhibition, it was not actually displayed there. The painting was later exhibited by Balla in 1928.&lt;ref name="benzi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benzi|first1=Fabio|title=Balla: futurismo tra arte e moda: opere della Fondazione Biagiotti Cigna|date=1998|page=17|isbn=9788809019652|accessdate=19 July 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3Hb7eMNM5UC&amp;|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acquisition of the painting by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York was publicly announced on October 17, 1954.&lt;ref name="moma-press"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Paintings from the Museum Collection | publisher = Museum of Modern Art | date = October 17, 1954 | url = https://www.moma.org/.../MOMA_1954_0094_88.pdf | access-date = 19 July 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is catalogued as object number 7.1954.&lt;ref name="moma"/&gt; {{As of|2013}}, it was not on permanent display.&lt;ref name="bogard"/&gt; The museum also houses a pencil-and-ink study that Balla made for the painting.&lt;ref name="moma-study"&gt;{{cite web|title=Giacomo Balla: Study for Street Light|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/works/38832?locale=en|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Painted around the time of the organization of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] artists, the work may be seen as a response to [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]'s 1909 manifesto ''{{lang|it|Uccidiamo il Chiaro di Luna!}}'' (''Let's Kill the Moonlight!''), in which Marinetti writes, "''{{lang|it|trecento lune elettriche cancellarono coi loro raggi di gesso abbagliante l'antica regina verde degli amori.}}''" ("three hundred electric moons wiped out with their dazzling rays of plaster the ancient green queen of love.")&lt;ref name="D'Elia"/&gt; Balla's painting is an analytical study of the patterns and colors of a beam of [[light]];&lt;ref name="babele"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lampada ad arco|url=http://www.babelearte.it/tipomuseo.asp?arid=&amp;quadroid=1581|website=Babele Arte|accessdate=19 July 2016|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; it typifies his exploration of light, [[sky|atmosphere]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] as a member of the Italian [[Divisionism]] movement, in which he was inspired by the [[Neo-Impressionism]] of [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Paul Signac]].&lt;ref name="EVA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Giacomo Balla (1871-1958)|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-artists/balla.htm|website=Encyclopedia of Visual Artists|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moma-press"/&gt; Bella stated of his painting, decades later, that it "demonstrated how romantic moonlight had been surpassed by the light of the modern electric street light. This was the end of Romanticism in art. From my picture came the phrase (beloved by the Futurists): 'We shall kill the light of the moon'."&lt;ref name="moma-press"/&gt;

==Critical responses==
The work is described in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' as a "dynamic depiction of light", conveying "a sense of speed and urgency that puts [Balla's] paintings in line with Futurism’s fascination with the energy of modern life."&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; It is said to reflect Balla's fascination with [[artificial light]],&lt;ref name="pollack"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Maika|title=‘Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe’ at the Guggenheim Museum|url=http://observer.com/2014/02/italian-futurism-1909-1944-reconstructing-the-universe-at-the-guggenheim-museum/|website=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=19 July 2016|date=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to encapsulate Balla's and the Futurists' conviction of the capacity of human endeavors to surpass nature. [[wikt:Chevron|Chevron]]s of color radiate from the lamp "like flood waves crashing on a parched beach", overwhelming the light cast by the moon.&lt;ref name="okelley"/&gt; Art critic [[Donald Kuspit]] describes the painting as a "crypto-scientific" study of the emotionally neutral sensation of light and color.&lt;ref name="kuspit"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuspit|first1=Donald|title=The Matrix of Sensations|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/kuspit/kuspit8-5-05.asp|website=artnet|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light]]'', author Paul Bogard contrasts the painting with Van Gogh's 1889 ''[[The Starry Night]]'', also at the MoMA; while the latter depicts a deep and dynamic [[night sky]], the sky in Balla's ''Street Light'' is submerged into the background by his celebrated artificial light.&lt;ref name="bogard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogard|first1=Paul|title=The End of Night: Searching for Natural Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light|date=July 9, 2013|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|isbn=978-0316182911|pages=36–39 |chapter=From a Starry Night to a Streetlight}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHAPTER 1.1-3&lt;br&gt;
How doth the city sit solitary,&lt;br&gt;
That was full of people!&lt;br&gt;
How is she become as a widow?&lt;br&gt;
She that was great among the nations.&lt;br&gt;
And princess among the provinces.&lt;br&gt;
How is she become tributary!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

She weepeth sore in the night,&lt;br&gt;
And her tears are on her cheeks;&lt;br&gt;
She hath none to comfort her&lt;br&gt;
Among all her lovers;&lt;br&gt;
All her friends have dealt treacherously with her,&lt;br&gt;
They are become her enemies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Judah is gone into exile because of affliction.&lt;br&gt;
And because of great servitude;&lt;br&gt;
she dwelleth among the nations,&lt;br&gt;
she findeth no rest.&lt;br&gt;
all her pursuers overtook her&lt;br&gt;
Within the narrow passes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CHAPTER 1.8&lt;br&gt;
Jerusalem hath grievously sinned...&lt;br&gt;
How doth the city sit solitary&lt;br&gt;
...a widow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
CHAPTER 4.14-15&lt;br&gt;
They wander as blind men in the streets,&lt;br&gt;
they are polluted with blood,&lt;br&gt;
so that men cannot&lt;br&gt;
touch their garments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Depart, ye unclean! they cried unto them,&lt;br&gt;
Depart, depart! touch us not...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Wherefore dost thou forget us forever,&lt;br&gt;
and forsake us so long time?...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Turn thou us unto thee, o lord...

==Premiere==
The work was premiered on January 28, 1944, at the [[Syria Mosque]] in [[Pittsburgh]] with the composer conducting the [[Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra]]. The soloist was [[Jennie Tourel]]. It was premiered in New York City on March 29, 1944, at [[Carnegie Hall]], again with Tourel as soloist.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Bernstein, Jeremiah, Symphony No. 1 (New York and London: Boosey and Hawkes, 1992), ii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
Bernstein first recorded the symphony in February 1945 with the [[Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra]] and soloist [[Nan Merriman]] for [[RCA Victor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/bernstein-orchestral-vocal-works Bernstein Orchestral &amp; Vocal Works]&lt;/ref&gt; He re-recorded it in stereo for [[CBS Records International|CBS Records]] in 1962 with Tourel and the [[New York Philharmonic]]. A live concert with the [[Israel Philharmonic]] and soloist [[Christa Ludwig]] at the 1977 [[Berlin Festival]] formed the basis for Bernstein's third recording, released in 1978 on [[Deutsche Grammophon]].

It went unrecorded by anyone else until after the composer's death. It has since taken up by several conductors, and recordings now include those by [[Leonard Slatkin]] (twice), [[James Judd]], [[Marin Alsop]] and [[Gustavo Dudamel]]. The "Lamentation" movement has also been recorded as a standalone work. A transcription of the "Profonation" movement exists for wind band, completed by [[Frank Bencriscutto]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boosey.com/shop/prod/Bernstein-Leonard-Profanation-wind-band/643978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">'''Teichoscopy''' or teichoscopia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm Teichoscopy&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "viewing from the walls," is a recurring narrative strategy in ancient Greek literature. One famous instance of teichoscopy occurs in Homer's ''[[Iliad]],'' Book 3, lines 121-244.

The passage begins with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] approached in her chamber by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], disguised as her sister-in-law [[Laodice (mythology)|Laodice]], the daughter of [[Priam]]. Helen is then led to the walls of the Skaian gates, where she is summoned by Priam, who asks her to point out the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] heroes she sees on the Trojan plain. Below her, the two armies are preparing for the duel between [[Menelaus]] and [[Paris]].  Helen identifies [[Agamemnon]], [[Odysseus]], [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian (Greater) Ajax]], and [[Idomeneus]].  She also mentions that she does not see her brothers [[Castor and Pollux]], who unbeknownst to her are already dead back in Greece. After this scene, the duel commences, with both armies praying to [[Zeus]] and the rest of the gods on [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to open the action.&lt;ref&gt;Toohey, Peter. ''Reading Epic: An Introduction to Ancient Narratives''.  New York: Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
According to Maria C. Pantelia, Helen becomes the 'author' of a catalog when she describes for Priam the qualities of the most important Greek warriors."&lt;ref&gt;Pantelia, Maria C. ''Helen and the Last Song for Hector.'' Transactions of the American Philological Association 132.1-2 (2002) 21-27 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/transactions_of_the_american_philological_association/v132/132.1pantelia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the teichoscopy, as well as the duel between [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Menelaus]], would have more likely occurred at the beginning of the war rather than during its tenth year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/iliad3.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although [[Homer]] is not at the beginning of the [[Trojan War]], he is at the beginning of the poem and therefore uses the teichoscopia as a poetic structure that provides information and suspense important for the remainder of the play and the duel to come.

Although teichoscopy can be viewed as simply a vignette that surveys the major Greek warriors, it has been suggested that Homer is also trying to reveal something about Helen.  Helen’s open admiration of both the Greek and [[Troy|Trojan]] warriors is viewed as ironic, as it seems odd that the major cause of a war that has brought devastation to the Trojans should praise the enemy. However, by doing this, Homer is, according to Frederic Will, “insisting on the importance, and centrality, of Helen’s viewpoint.  He is integrating a traditional form artistically.”&lt;ref&gt;Remarks on Counterpoint Characterization in Euripides.  Frederic Will.  ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 55, No. 8. (May, 1960), pp. 338-344.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3294564].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main object of teichoscopy is the synchronous discussion of events, as opposed to events being reported later by messengers or other eyewitnesses. It is a well-established technique in [[dramaturgy]].

Natural phenomena, too, may be conveyed by this device. Far-off drama such as the sun rising, or a description of stars across the firmament lend themselves to this treatment.

'''''Die Stadt ohne Juden''''' (''The City Without Jews'') is a 1924 Austrian [[Expressionist]] film by [[H. K. Breslauer]], based on the book of the same title by [[Hugo Bettauer]]. The film is one of the few surviving Expressionist films from Austria and has therefore been well researched.&lt;ref name="medienimpulse"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thomas |last=Ballhausen |first2=Günter |last2=Krenn |title=(Alb)Traumhaft: Die Stadt ohne Juden |journal=Medienimpulse |volume=57 |date=September 2006 |pages=35–39 |url=http://www.mediamanual.at/mediamanual/themen/pdf/sicherheit/57_Ballhausen-Krenn-Die_unheimliche_Leinwand.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was first shown on 25 July 1924 in [[Vienna]].

In his novel, published in 1922, Hugo Bettauer succeeded in creating a relatively accurate allegorical vision of the near future, although the book was intended as entertainment and as a satirical response to the primitive [[antisemitism]] of the 1920s. It immediately became Bettauer's most popular work: it was translated into several languages, and sold over a quarter of a million copies. Shortly after the premiere of the film Hugo Bettauer was murdered by [[Otto Rothstock]], a former member of the [[Nazi Party]], who was lionized by the antisemitic Austrian masses and was released less than two years after having been committed to a psychiatric institution.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexander P.

== Plot ==
In Austria the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] comes to power, and the new Chancellor Dr.&amp;nbsp;Schwerdtfeger, a fanatical antisemite, sees his people as being ruled by the Jews. He therefore has a law passed by the National Assembly forcing all Jews to emigrate by the end of the year. The law is enthusiastically received by the non-Jewish population, and the Jews leave the country. But after a short time a sober reality makes itself felt. Cultural life becomes impoverished: in the theatres only plays by [[Ludwig Ganghofer]] and [[Ludwig Anzengruber]] are still performed. Many cafes are empty, or are converted into beer halls selling sausages. After an initial upturn, the economy declines, as business has greatly diminished, and has moved to other cities, such as [[Prague]] and [[Budapest]]. Inflation and unemployment run wild.

The political characters of the book (although not of the film, to avoid difficulties with censorship) are delineated in such a way as to be identifiable with real politicians of the period: Bundeskanzler Schwerdtfeger, for example, is based on [[Ignaz Seipel]]. Besides the political action, the film also dwells on the love relationship between Lotte ([[Anny Milety]]), a typical Viennese girl (''Wiener Mädel'') and the daughter of a member of the National Assembly who voted for the banishment of the Jews, and the Jewish artist Leo Strakosch ([[Johannes Riemann]]).

Towards the end of the film, the National Assembly resolves to bring the Jews back again. However, to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority, Lotte and Leo, who has already illegally returned to Austria with forged papers identifying him as a French painter, have to remove the antisemitic parliamentary representative Bernard (played by [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]]), which they do by getting him drunk. The drama reaches a peak as he is committed to a psychiatric institution represented in Expressionist scenery, where in a claustrophobic and asymmetrically painted cell, he sees himself threatened by [[Star of David|Stars of David]].

This sequence also represents the divergence of the film from the book, as the action of the film is revealed as a dream of the antisemitic Councillor Bernard. This surprising turn of events was described in the original film program as:
"In this moment of the highest distress Councillor Bernard awakes from his dream, finds himself in the tavern at a very late hour and says to the baffled Volbert: 'Thank God that stupid dream is over—we are all just people and we don't want hate—we want life—we want to live together in peace.'"&lt;ref&gt;''"Gottlob, daß der dumme Traum vorbei ist – wir sind ja alle nur Menschen und wollen keinen Haß – Leben wollen wir – ruhig nebeneinander leben"''. Kivur, Nr. 1346, o.J., o.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The film was made in 1924, about two years after the publication of Bettauer's novel. It differs from the book in several ways: for example, the city in the film is called "Utopia", instead of "Vienna". The film also has conciliatory happy ending, which is not only the exact opposite of the message of the book, but also represents a surprising and abrupt change of direction within the film itself, the whole of which is thus revealed as the dream of an antisemite who at last comes to the realisation that the Jews are a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;''Die Filmwelt'', 1924, n. 14–15, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for these fundamental deviations from the original was to reduce the controversial political impact of the content.

The film was Hans Moser's second cinematic role. The female lead was played, as so often in Breslauer's films, by Anny (or Anna) Milety, whom he later married (in 1925). The well-known Jewish actors [[Gisela Werbisek]] (billed as "Werbezirk") and [[Armin Berg]] appeared only in minor roles, as Kathi the cook and Isidor the commissionaire. The Expressionist backdrops and decor which characterise some scenes were the work of [[Julius von Borsody]].

Other cast members were [[Eugen Neufeld]] (Bundeskanzler Dr. Schwerdtfeger), [[Karl Thema]] (Cllr. Linder), [[Ferdinand Mayerhofer]] (Cllr. Volbert), [[Mizi Griebl]] (Volbert's wife) and [[Hans Effenberger]] (Alois Carroni).

== Performance history ==
The premiere took place on 25 July 1924 in Vienna, although there were still technical problems with the film. Bettauer and Breslauer, the director, fell out entirely, and Bettauer later refused to acknowledge any connection between the film and his book. The technically inferior prints of the film were often manually cut and shortened by the cinema owners themselves. Nevertheless, the cinema auditoriums were often full, although not only in Austria but also in [[Berlin]] (premiere 1926) and [[New York City|New York]] (premiere 1928, where it was shown as ''The City Without Jews''), it was very clear that the success of the film was not as great as that of the book. There were sometimes disturbances at performances: [[Nazism|National Socialists]] often threw stinkbombs into the cinemas; in [[Linz]] the showing of the film was banned.&lt;ref name="korso"&gt;Heimo Halbrainer on [http://www.korso.at/korso/DStmk/bett.htm www.korso.at – Informationsmagazin für die Steiermark], July 2001 (page viewed on 19 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

A campaign of vilification against Bettauer was instigated, partly because of this film and partly because of his other activities. In the spring of 1925 he was murdered by a [[Nazi Party]] member, [[Otto Rothstock]], who was hailed as a hero and despite being found guilty of murder, was soon set free.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 1933, the film was shown commercially for the last time, again causing a stir, when it was screened in the [[Amsterdam]] theatre ''Carré'' as a protest against Hitler's Germany. This copy of the film is presumably the same as the one discovered in 1991 in the [[Nederlands Filmmuseum]]. It was on a [[cellulose nitrate]] base and on the point of disintegration, as well as being incomplete. The German [[Bundesarchiv]] in [[Coblenz]] therefore made an "emergency copy", which was then reconstructed on behalf of the [[Filmarchiv Austria]] (Austrian Film Archive) by the company HS-ART Digital Service of [[Graz]] using the "DIAMANT" software developed by [[Joanneum Research]]; faded parts were then re-coloured.&lt;ref name="korso"/&gt; In October 2008, the film was made available on a portable medium for the first time as part of the DVD series  ''Der österreichische Film''.

In 2015, a copy of the whole film in excellent condition was found in a flea-market in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Noack |first=Rick |date=March 30, 2018 |title=Long-lost film that predicted rise of anti-Semitism has ominous message for today's world |publisher=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/03/30/long-lost-film-that-warned-of-rise-of-anti-semitism-has-ominous-message-for-todays-world |quote=The film — which sparked furious reactions in the mid-1920s — was believed to have been lost until a copy was discovered in a Paris flea market in 2015.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian Film Archive organised a crowd-funding campaign to save the film to which more than 700 people contributed more than €86,000 (£72,000; $107,000). This full version of the film was digitally restored and re-released in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;(29 March 2018). ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43569919 'Lost' film predicting rise of Nazism returns to screen]''. [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reaction ==
"In many places the film follows the original book almost word for word, which makes the Utopian ending even more obviously an expression of appeasement. At the end the surprised audience learns that the entire dramatic action only took place in a dream, and thus never really happened. The on-screen happy ending, dictated by compromise, not only negates the meaning of Bettauer's book but also the very real antisemitism that it reflects. Instead it documents a by no means unthinkable and in no way dreamlike reality [...] This surprising turn of the plot, deviating totally from the literary original, which simplifies the action as the content of a dream, cannot merely be regarded as a simple dramatic exigency, but as a prime example of the Austrian soul's ability to repress. This naïve and perhaps crude experiment from 1924 can be taken as a forerunner of what was generally practised after [[World War II]] in the country ''ohne Eigenschaften''"&lt;ref&gt;An allusion to [[Robert Musil]]'s novel ''[[Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften]]'' (English translations as ''The Man Without Qualities''.&lt;/ref&gt;(Thomas Ballhausen, Günter Krenn, 2006).&lt;ref name="medienimpulse"/&gt;

[[File:Jan Brueghel (I), Hendrick van Balen (I) and Gerard Seghers - Allegory of Sight and Smell.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Senses of Sight and Smell'', 1618; copy c.&amp;nbsp;1620]]
[[File:File-Bruegel d. Ä., Jan -The Senses of Hearing, Touch and Taste - 1618.jpg|thumb|350px|''The Senses of Hearing, Touch and Taste'', 1618; copy c.&amp;nbsp;1620]]
'''''The Five Senses''''' are a pair of [[oil paintings]] made by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and others in 1617&amp;ndash;18, at the same time as he was working with [[Peter Paul Rubens]] on a [[The Five Senses (series)|series of five paintings]] on the same topic. The originals were lost in a fire in 1731; faithful copies dated to c.&amp;nbsp;1620 were preserved and are in the [[Prado Museum]] in [[Madrid]].

==Background==
Brueghel, like Rubens, was at this time working in [[Antwerp]] at the court of [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], and his wife [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]], governors of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. [[Allegory|Allegorical]] paintings representing the [[five senses]] as female nudes had become fashionable in the previous century, but Brueghel introduced the illustration of the theme by means of assemblages of works of art, musical instruments, scientific instruments and military equipment, accompanied by flowers, [[hunting|game]] and fish,&lt;ref name=Suchtelen90&gt;Ariane van Suchtelen, "8. Jan Brueghel the Elder and Peter Paul Rubens, ''Allegory of Taste'', in: Anne T. Woollett, Ariane van Suchtelen, ''et al.'', ''Rubens &amp; Brueghel: A Working Friendship'', Exhibition catalogue, Los Angeles: [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], 2006, {{ISBN|9780892368471}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;90&amp;ndash;99, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=series%20depicting%20the%20Five%20Senses%20in%20the%20Museo%20Nacional%20del%20Prado&amp;f=false p.&amp;nbsp;90].&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely adopted by Flemish artists.

==History==
The two paintings were commissioned by the City of Antwerp to be presented to the archducal couple, and were executed by "twelve of the best masters of [the] city". They were paid for in October 1618.&lt;ref name=Suchtelen94&gt;Van Suchtelen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=1636%2C%20when%20the%20paintings%20were%20listed%20in%20an%20inventory&amp;f=false p. 94].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1619 they were in the audience chamber at [[Tervuren]] Castle. In 1731 they were destroyed in the fire at [[Coudenberg]] Palace. The surviving pair are close copies by Brueghel, [[Gerard Seghers]], [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Joost de Momper]];&lt;ref name=Prado1403&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/sight-and-smell/ ''Sight and Smell''], online gallery, [[Prado Museum]], retrieved 9 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Prado1404&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/taste-hearing-and-touch/ ''Taste, Hearing and Touch''], online gallery, Prado Museum, retrieved 9 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Klaus Ertz]], "La dinastia dei Brueghel / The Brueghel Dynasty", in: Sergio Gaddi and Doron J.

==Description==
The pair of paintings are unique in including copies of their own works by a group of masters of the Antwerp school.&lt;ref&gt;Van Suchtelen, pp. 94, [https://books.google.com/books?id=c1cGWlxdP64C&amp;q=Senses#v=onepage&amp;q=entire%20Antwerp%20school%20&amp;f=false 96].&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sight and Smell'', the paintings in the background include ''The Healing of the Blind'', representing spiritual sight, in contrast with physical sight, represented by a magnifying glass. A telescope in the foreground and a hallway in the rear, lined with art works, leading to an open door into nature and lit from above by shafts of sunlight, also refer to aspects of this sense. The female figure epitomising sight is looking at her reflection in a mirror which is held up for her by a [[putto]], while the other female figure, representing smell, receives a bouquet of flowers from another putto. The dog represents an acute sense of smell, and the [[civet]], stenches.&lt;ref name=Prado1403/&gt;

In ''Taste, Hearing and Touch'', the central scene is a meal; a [[lute]]nist is playing and children singing, epitomising hearing, while one young woman strokes a [[mink]] in her arms, representing touch, and another is about to eat [[oyster]]s, representing taste. Details such as the [[clavichord]] and other musical instruments on the left relate to hearing, and a monkey is pulling the hair of a [[Cupid]], a form of touch. The room and the hall visible in the right rear display pictures which are also related to the three senses: ''The Annunciation'' and ''Minerva's Visit to Parnassus'' (hearing), ''The Dentist'' (touch), and ''The Punishment of Rich Epulon'' and ''The Wedding at Cana'' (taste).&lt;ref name=Prado1404/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10249">[[File:The last Jew in Vinnitsa, 1941.jpg|thumb|''The last Jew in Vinnitsa'']]'''''The last Jew in Vinnitsa''''' is a photograph taken during [[the Holocaust in Ukraine]] showing a Jewish man near the town of Vinnitsa ([[Vinnytsia]]) about to be shot dead by a member of ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]]'', a mobile [[death squad]] of the Nazi [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. The victim is kneeling beside a mass grave already containing many bodies; behind a crowd of SS and [[Reich Labour Service]] men watch.&lt;ref name="pa5355"/&gt;

==History==
The photograph dates from some time between mid-1941, when [[Operation Barbarossa#Ukraine and Moldavia|the Germans occupied]] the [[Vinnytsia Oblast|oblast (region) of Vinnytsia]], and 1943.&lt;ref name="pa5355"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/pa5355|title=Photograph Number 64407: German soldiers of the Waffen-SS and the Reich Labor Service look on as a member of an Einsatzgruppe prepares to shoot a Ukrainian Jew kneeling on the edge of a mass grave filled with corpses.|work=Collections Search|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period there were numerous massacres of Jews in the oblast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/about/institute/killing_sites_catalog_details_full.asp?region=Vinnitsa|title=Vinnitsa|work=Online Guide of Murder Sites of Jews in the Former USSR|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in the town itself on 16 and 22 September 1941 and April 1942, after which those spared were sent to labour camps and the [[Yerusalimka]] quarter largely razed.&lt;ref name="pa5355"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=686 |title=Vinnitsa, Vinnitsa County, Vinnitsa District, Ukraine |work=The Untold Stories |publisher=Yad Vashem |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.rtrfoundation.org/webart/UK-arch-d2.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Holocaust in Vinnitsa Oblast |last=Vinokurova |first=Faina A. |date=2002 |work=Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova |publisher=Routes to Roots Foundation |pages=332–335 |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photograph was circulated in 1961 by [[United Press]] (UP) during the [[trial of Adolf Eichmann]].&lt;ref name="bulmash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.kenyon.edu/bulmash/1085/|title=2012.1.397 : "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa"|year=2016|work=Bulmash Family Holocaust Collection|publisher=[[Kenyon College]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; UP had received it from Al Moss (b.1910) a Polish Jew who acquired it in May 1945 shortly after he was liberated from [[Allach (concentration camp)|Allach concentration camp]] by the [[American 3rd Army]].&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/vha3081|title=USC Shoah Foundation Institute testimony of Al Moss|publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moss, living in Chicago in 1961, wanted people "to know what went on in Eichmann's time".&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt; The UP copy was published over a full page of ''[[The Forward]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouzan|first1=Francoise S.|last2=Mikhman|first2=Dan|title=De la mémoire de la Shoah dans le monde juif|year=2008|publisher=CNRS éditions|language=French|isbn=9782271067630|page=306|chapter=La mémoire de la Shoah dans le vécu des Juifs aux Etats-Unis jusqu'au procès Eichmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some later sources say that the original physical image was in an ''Einsatzgruppe'' member's photograph album,&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt; or removed from the pocket of a dead soldier;&lt;ref name="Knopp2014"/&gt; and that written on its reverse side was "Last Jew in Vinnitsa",&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson2016"/&gt; now sometimes used as the image's name.&lt;ref name="bulmash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knopp2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanneh2015"/&gt;

==Significance==
The photograph has become iconic.  Some features are unusual among well-known Holocaust pictures: it was taken during the Holocaust rather than after its end, and presumably by someone complicit in the killing; it depicts ''Einsatzgruppen'' rather than [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration]] or [[extermination camp]]s; the focus is on a solitary victim rather than a multitude.&lt;ref name="Patterson2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gee2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rakitova2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Staines2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wollaston2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SollbergerBöning2016"&gt;{{cite book |last=Boehlke |first=Erik |editor-last1=Sollberger|editor-first1=Daniel |editor-last2=Böning|editor-first2=Jobst |editor-last3=Boehlke|editor-first3=Erik |editor-first4=Gerhard |editor-last4=Schindler |title=Das Geheimnis: Psychologische, psychopathologische und künstlerische Ausdrucksformen im Spektrum zwischen Verheimlichen und Geheimnisvollem |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WgA-DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate=5 April 2018 |date=2016-10-10 |publisher=Frank &amp; Timme  |language=German |isbn=9783732903016 |pages=238–239 |chapter=Geheime Botschaften in Bildern; 5 Entdeckungen bei genauem Hinsehen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tip sheet''' is a publication containing the latest information, [[tipster|tips]] or predictions for a particular industry. Tip sheets are commonly published to impart business or stock market information, music industry songwriter leads, and tips on [[horse racing]] results.

==Types of tip sheet==
In the financial sector tip sheet newsletters offer investors' advice on [[stock and flow|stocks]]. In the UK, tip sheets are regulated by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) since 2010 to prevent malpractice. In prior to 2010, Financial Service Authority (FSA) also regulated.

Media tip sheets are typically lists of tips on how to do something, or solve a particular problem, that are printed in newspapers and magazines and appear on television. An example tip sheet might be titled "8 Tax Tips the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] Wishes You Didn't Know". They offer their creators free publicity and provide media outlets with free ready-made content, which they can reprint verbatim.

==Music tip sheets==
A music tip sheet, or song tip sheet, is a research service that regularly publishes information about which [[musician|recording artists]] and film and TV projects are looking for music, along with the appropriate contact information. They are used by songwriters, publishers and record producers, but most commonly by new songwriters looking to gain a foothold in the industry.&lt;ref name="emusician"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emusician.com/tutorials/columns/pitching_songs_how/ |title=How to pitch your songs to industry insiders. |publisher=EMusician |date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=25 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724185818/http://emusician.com/tutorials/columns/pitching_songs_how/ |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Songwriter, publisher and "respected music industry veteran" Eric Beall&lt;ref name="berkleemusic.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berkleemusic.com/school/faculty-member?person_id=1176543 |title=Eric Beall – Music Business |publisher=berkleemusic.com |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that "If I were going to spend money on anything when I started out as a songwriter, other than the actual demos, I would put it into tip sheets."&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Eric_Beall_Interview.html |title=Interview with Eric Beall |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=7 April 2008 |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established music tip sheets include "RowFax", the [[MusicRow]] publication, and [[SongQuarters]].

'''''World Builder''''' is a 2007 [[short film|short]] [[sci-fi film]] by [[Bruce Branit]]. The entire film (except for two characters) is [[computer graphics|computer generated]].

==Plot==
The film begins with the words "Program Start." In a [[green room]], a young man is lying on his back and looking at [[holographic]] pictures of himself and a young woman, presumably his wife (as we see a wedding ring on his hand). All of a sudden, a holographic timer appears on his arm, letting him know that something will happen in one hour. Closing the pictures, he stands up and gets to work.

Using a [[computer program]], he begins to make a row of tall [[box]]es. Once the first row is made, he makes a copy and puts the copy of the row of boxes across from the first. He then gets to work on adding details to each box. He adds columns, doors, and windows. Once done, he works on the appearances of the boxes to make them look like [[building]]s. He adds color and then some [[nature]]. He pays particular attention to a yellow [[flower]]. Soon, with time running out, he hastily finishes the details and hide in a doorway when the timer stops.

With time up, the boxes no longer look like [[computer model]]s but actual buildings. A door opens and the young woman from the pictures, dressed in a [[hospital gown]], emerges. She is astonished by what she sees. She walks down the [[street]], looking at the buildings and their details. Watching from his doorway, the man realizes that he forgot to do one building and it looks like a model from a computer program. He prays that she doesn't see the building. She comes his way and he hides, watching her look at the yellow flower and smile lovingly. She leaves the street with a final look back. Once she is gone, he emerges and watches his world that he created dematerialize into a new picture. It shows the woman smiling at the flower. Choking back tears, he kisses her picture. The screen goes dark, showing the words "Program Ends".

In a holographic recovery room, the young man enters. The young woman is lying on the bed, in a [[coma]] and hooked up to machines to monitor her progress. He kisses her forehead and drops into a glass of water the very flower she admired in the computer program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
