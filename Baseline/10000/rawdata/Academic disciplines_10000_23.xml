      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2787">The '''Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science''' is a cross-disciplinary organization founded in 2009 within [[Stony Brook University]]'s School of Journalism, in [[Stony Brook, New York]].

Its current director is Laura Lindenfield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/?cat=6 Staff and Leadership Archive], Center for Communicating Science&lt;/ref&gt;  Its goal is to help scientists learn to communicate more effectively with the public, including policymakers, students, funders and the media. It was inspired by [[Alan Alda]], the actor, writer and science advocate, in whose honor it was renamed in 2013, and is supported by [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=sbpress&gt;{{cite web|title=It was a SM*A*S*H of Science|url=http://sbpress.com/2010/10/it-was-a-s-mash-of-science/|work=October 1, 2010|publisher=[[Stony Brook Press]]|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center offers courses in communication that have been taken by more than 200 graduate students in the sciences and health professions at Stony Brook. It also conducts workshops at universities, laboratories and science meetings around the country. Many of its workshops use improvisational theater exercises to help scientists connect more directly with listeners and respond more spontaneously to their needs.&lt;ref name="Actor Is Honored for Using Improv to Help Scientists Communicate"&gt;{{cite news |last=Basken |first=Paul |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Alan-Alda-the-Actor-Is/138673/ |title=Actor Is Honored for Using Improv to Help Scientists Communicate |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2015-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-monumentalism''' (or '''Counter-monumentalism''') is a philosophy in art that denies the presence of any imposing, authoritative social force in public spaces. It developed as an opposition to monumentalism whereby authorities (usually the state or dictator) establish monuments in public spaces to symbolize themselves or their ideology, and influence the historical narrative of the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=counter-monuments |url=http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |publisher=Facing History and Ourselves |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415170228/http://www2.facinghistory.org/campus/memorials.nsf/0/0E862768014D1FE985256E3E004F50E6 |archivedate=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to artist [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]],  anti-monument "refers to an action, a performance, which clearly rejects the notion of a monument developed from an elitist point of view as an emblem of power."&lt;ref name="ISBN 90-5662-236-6"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lozano-Hemmer|first=Rafael|title=Alien Relationships with Public Space|journal=TransUrbanism|year=2002|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]]'s ''Bunker Hill Monument Projections''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leigh Mahan |first=Nicole |title=Krzysztof Wodiczko;s "If You See Something...": counter-memory and the role of the artist in Post-9/11 America |url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |accessdate=8 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414231038/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122010-150159/unrestricted/Mahan_N_Thesis_2010s.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Do-Ho Suh]]'s ''Public Figures'' can be considered examples of anti-monumentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shu|first=Do-Ho|title=The Anti-Monument|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2004.10-detail-korean-artist/|publisher=The Walrus|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Germany (1944) (Art.IWM ART LD 4526).jpg|thumb|''Battle of Germany'' by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], 1944 ]]
During World War II, the relations between art and war can be articulated around two main issues. First, art (and, more generally, culture) found itself at the centre of an ideological war. Second, during World War II, many artists found themselves in the most difficult conditions (in an occupied country, in [[Nazi concentration camp|internment camps]], in [[death camps]]) and their works are a testimony to a powerful "urge to create." Such creative impulse can be interpreted as the expression of self-preservation, a survival instinct in critical times.

==Historical context==
[[File:Battle of Britain (Paul Nash).png|thumb|''Battle of Britain'' by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], 1941]]
War is a common theme in art and has inspired many great works. Throughout history, most representations of war depict military achievements and often show significant battle scenes. However, in the [[19th century]] a “turn” in the visual representation of war became noticeable. Artists started to show the disastrous aspects of war, instead of its glorified events and protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Bertrand-Dorléac (ed.), ''Les désastres de la guerre, 1800-2014'', exh. cat., Lens, Musée du Louvre-Lens, Somogy, 2014 ; Laura Brandon, ''Art and War'', London: IB Tauris, 2007, p. 26-35&lt;/ref&gt; Such a perspective is best exemplified by [[Francisco Goya]]’s series, [[The Disasters of War]] (1810-1820, first published in 1863), and [[Otto Dix]]’s portfolio, ''Der Krieg'' (published in 1924). 

During [[World War II]], both traditions are present. For instance, [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]]’s ''Battle of Britain'' ([[1941 in art|1941]]) represents a scene of aerial combat between British and [[Wehrmacht|German fighters]] over the [[English Channel]]. On the other hand, André Fougeron’s ''Street of Paris'' ([[1943 in art|1943]]) focuses on the impact of war and occupation on civilians.

==Art in Nazi Germany==

===Nazi art===
{{Main article|Art of the Third Reich}}
{{See also|Paintings by Adolf Hitler}}
[[File:The Worker and Kolkhoz Woman.jpg|thumb|''The Worker and Kolkhoz Woman'' by [[Vera Mukhina]], 1937]

In [[totalitarian]] regimes (especially in [[Hitler]]’s Germany), the control of art and other cultural expressions was an integral part of the establishment of power. It reflects totalitarianism’s aim to control every single aspect of society and the individuals’ lives. However, art and culture had a special importance because they have the power to influence people, and they embody the identity of a nation, a community, a group of people.]]

In [[Nazi Germany]], Hitler's cultural politic was twofold. The first step was a “[[cultural cleansing]]”. German culture and society were said to be in decline because forces of decadence had taken over and corrupted it (it is the idea of the “enemy within”).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The cultural cleansing was to be accompanied by a “rebirth” of German culture and society (Hitler had grand plans for several [[Führermuseum|museums]]), which involved an exaltation of the “true spirit” of the German people in art.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} This officially sanctioned art was conservative and figurative, heavily inspired by [[Greco-Roman]] art. It was often grandiose and sentimental. In terms of contents, this art should represent and convey the regime's ideals.

In 1937 in Munich, two simultaneous events demonstrated the [[Nazis]]’ views about art. One exhibition displayed art that should be eliminated (“The [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]”), while the other promoted, by contrast, the official aesthetic (“The Great German Art Exhibition”).

In Europe, other [[totalitarian]] regimes adopted a similar stance on art and encouraged or imposed an official aesthetic, which was a form of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]. Here Realism refers to a representational, mimetic style, and not to an art deprived of idealization. Such style was anchored in a prestigious tradition – popular, easy to understand, and thus practical for [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]] aims.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

It was clear in [[Stalin]]’s [[Soviet Union]], where diversity in the arts was proscribed and “[[Socialist Realism]]” was instituted as the official style. [[Modern art]] was banned as being decadent, [[bourgeois]] and elitist.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The comparison of sculptures placed by national pavilions during the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 International Exhibition]] in Paris is revealing. The exhibition was dominated by the confrontation between Germany and the Soviet Union, with their imposing pavilions facing each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dawn Adès]] (et al.), ''Art and Power: Europe under the Dictators, 1930-1945'', London: The South Bank Centre, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; On one side, Josef Thorak’s sculptures were displayed by the German pavilion’s entrance. And on the other, [[Vera Mukhina]]’s sculpture, ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'', was placed on top of the Soviet pavilion.

===Degenerate art===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-729-0001-23, Italien, Überführung von Kunstschätzen.jpg|thumb|German soldiers of the [[Hermann Göring Division]] posing near the main entrance of [[Palazzo Venezia]] showing a painting taken from the National Museum of Naples Picture Gallery]]
[[File:Ausstellung entartete kunst 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Goebbels]] at the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]]]
{{Main article|Degenerate Art}}
{{See also|Nazi Plunder}}
The term “degenerate” was used in connection with the idea that modern artists and their art were compromising the purity of the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|German race]]. They were presented as elements of “racial impurity,” “parasites,” causing a deterioration of German society.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} These decadent and “degenerate” forces had to be eradicated. Cultural actors who were labelled “un-German” by the regime were persecuted: they were fired from their teaching positions, artworks were removed from museums, books were burnt.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} All artists who did not fall in line with the party's ideology (above all [[Jewish]] and [[Communist]] artists) were “un-German.”
 
The [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]] (Munich, 19 July-30 Nov. 1937) was made out of works confiscated in German museums. The works were placed in unflattering ways, with derogatory comments and slogans painted around them (“Nature as seen by sick minds”, “Deliberate sabotage of national defense”...). The aim was to convince visitors that modern art was an attack on the German people. Mostly, these works of art were [[Expressionist]], abstract or made by Jewish and [[Leftist]] artists. The exhibition was displayed in several German and Austrian cities. Subsequently, most of the artworks were either [[art destruction|destroyed]] or sold.]]

Modern art could not fall in line with the Nazi values and taste for several reasons:
* its constant innovation and change
* its independency and freedom
* its cosmopolitanism and reticence to profess any type of nationalist allegiance
* its ambiguity and its lack of easily understandable and definitive meaning 
* its rejection and deconstruction of the mimetic tradition of representation{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

France was occupied by Nazi Germany from 22 June 1940 until early May 1945. An occupying power endeavours to normalise life as far as is possible since this optimises the maintenance of order and minimises the costs of occupation. The Germans decreed that life, including artistic life should resume as before (the war).}} There were exceptions. Jews were targeted, and their art collections confiscated. Some of this consisted of modern, [[degenerate art]] which was partly destroyed, although some was sold on the international art market. Masterpieces of European art were taken from these collectors and French museums and were sent to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale, Paris, Flammarion, 1995, chapter 5, « Butins de guerre » ; Laurence Bertand-Dorléac, ''Art of the Defeat. France 1940-1944'', transl. from French by Jane Mary Todd, Getty Research Institute, 2008, p. 12 and following&lt;/ref&gt; Known political opponents were also excluded and overtly political art was forbidden.

==Persecuted artists==
{{See also|Degenerate Art#Fate of the artists and their work}}
During the rise of Nazism, some artists had expressed their opposition. Following the establishment of the [[Third Reich]], modern artists and those of Jewish ancestry were classed as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]]. Any Jewish artists, or artists who were known opponents to the regime, were liable to imprisonment unless they conformed with the authorities’ view of what was "acceptable" in art. These artists were all in danger. Among those who chose to stay in Germany, some retreated into an “inner exile”, or “inner emigration"&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, ''Le nazisme et la culture'', éditions Complexe, 2006, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; (“Innere Emigration”).

Artists had the choice of collaborating or resisting. But most people in such a predicament will normally find a middle way. Resistance was dangerous and unlikely to escape fierce punishment and while collaboration offered an easier path principled objection to it was a strong deterrent to many if not most. The other options were withdrawal, finding refuge abroad or, for many, to take the pragmatic course by simply continuing to work within the new restrictions. Hence artistic life and expression appeared light, carefree and frivolous, but was also lively.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Alan Riding, ''And the Show Went On: Cultural Life in Nazi-Occupied Paris'', Alfred A. Knopf, 2010; Laurence Bertand-Dorléac, ''Art of the Defeat. France 1940-1944'', transl. from French by Jane Mary Todd, Getty Research Institute, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exiled artists===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05929, Berlin, KPD-Plakat zu den Reichstagswahlen.jpg|thumb|''5 Fingers Has The Hand'' by John Heartfield, 1928]]
The German artist [[John Heartfield]] (who had been part of [[Dada]] Berlin) is an example of an artist who expressed opposition. While Hitler's popularity was growing in Germany, he consistently produced photomontages that denounced the future dictator and his party. Most of them were published in ''[[Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung]]'' [''AIZ'', Workers' Illustrated Newspaper], and a lot of them appeared on the cover. His artworks were like visual weapons against Nazism, a counter-power. In them, he subverted Hitler's figure and [[Nazi symbols]]. Through powerful visual juxtapositions, he revealed Nazism manipulations and contradictions, and showed the truth about them. As soon as Hitler [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|came to power]] in 1933, Heartfield had to flee, finding refuge first in Prague and then in the UK.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[Otto Dix]] had been labelled as a “degenerate” artist. His works were removed from museums, he was fired from his teaching position, and he was forbidden to create anything political as well as to exhibit. He moved to the countryside and painted landscapes for the duration of the war.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Many artists chose to leave Germany. But their exile did not secure their position in the art world abroad. Their personal and artistic security depended on the laws and attitude of the country of exile. Some sought collaboration with others in exile, forming groups to exhibit, such as the Free German League of Culture founded in 1938 in London.&lt;ref&gt;“Arts in Exile”, virtual exhibition, the German Exile Archive 1933-1945 of the German National Library, 2012: http://kuenste-im-exil.de/KIE/Content/EN/Topics/freier-deutscher-kulturbund-gro%C3%9Fbritannien-en.html (last retrieved: 04-04-2015)&lt;/ref&gt; One of their goals was to show that German culture and art were not to be equated with the cultural expressions sanctioned and produced by the Nazi regime.

Other artists went their own way, independently, often choosing apolitical subjects and sometimes refusing to participate in political events.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphanie Barron (ed.), ''Exiles + Emigrés, The Flight of European Artists from Hitler'', exh. cat.,  Los Angeles County Museum of Art; New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; They considered art as a completely autonomous activity that should not be submitted to a political cause. On the contrary, someone like [[Oskar Kokoschka]], who had until then rejected the idea that art should be useful and serve a cause, got involved in these groups when he emigrated to London in 1938. He created a series of political allegories, i.e. paintings in which he made comments on war politics.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Stéphanie Barron (ed.), ''Exiles + Emigrés, The Flight of European Artists from Hitler'', exh. cat., Los Angeles County Museum of Art, New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1997; Melody A. Maxted, “Envisioning Kokoschka: Considering the Artist’s Political Allegories, 1939-1954”, in ''Montage'', 2 (2008): 87-97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists in internment camps===
Once the war had commenced, everyone of Austro-German extraction was considered to be a security risk in Britain and became an [[enemy alien]]. They were interned in 1940, in camps on the Isle of Man. In Britain, however, there was considerable concern that many who had opposed the Nazi regime and escaped with their lives were now in detention in poor conditions. This led to a form of re-classification that led to many early releases in 1940, and by 1942 most of the internees had been released.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Inside the camps, some of the inmates were artists, musicians, and other intelligentsia, and they rebuilt as much cultural life as they could within the constraints of their imprisonment: the giving of lectures and concerts and the creation of artworks from materials like charcoal from burnt twigs, dyes from plants and the use of lino and newspaper. They also received materials from the artistic community in Britain.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

[[Heinz Kiwitz]] went into exile in 1937 after his release from imprisonment in [[Kemna concentration camp|Kemna]] and [[Emslandlager|Börgermoor concentration camps]]. [[Max Ernst]] exiled to the United States in 1941.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In France, Austro-German citizens also became “enemy aliens” at the outbreak of war and were sent in internment camps. The [[Camp des Milles]], near Aix-en-Provence, where German artists such as Max Ernst and [[Hans Bellmer]] were imprisoned, was famous for its artistic life.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} As France was invaded, the situation of exiled German artists got more complicated and dangerous. They risked deportation, forced labour and extermination in the case of Jewish artists, both in occupied France and in the Vichy Republic. Most chose to emigrate further while others went into hiding.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the US, citizens of Japanese extraction also faced [[Internment of Japanese Americans|internment]] in very poor living conditions and with little sympathy for their plight throughout the period of hostilities and beyond.

==World War II art==

===Protest art===

Those who wished to overtly oppose the Nazis in their art either worked abroad (for example, [[André Masson]]) or clandestinely, as part of the resistance movement (such as André Fougeron). In the public space, resistance took on more symbolic forms. A group known as 'Jeunes peintres de tradition française' exhibited in Paris for the first time in 1941. The works they produced during the period were characterised by semi-abstract art and bright colours, which they considered as a form of resistance to the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, ''L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale'', Paris, Flammarion, 1995, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Other supposedly non-political works were ambiguous – they observed the hardships of life in France without apportioning blame. [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], who had stayed in Paris, painted but refused to exhibit. He did not paint the war or anything openly political, but he said that the war was in his pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Picasso, in Peter D. Whitney, “Picasso is Safe”, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 3 Sept. 1944, quoted by M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern art became the bearer of liberal values, as opposed to the reactionary artistic preferences of the totalitarian regimes. Artistic choices embodied different positions in the ongoing ideological battle. Placing Alberto Sánchez Pérez's abstract sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;See Dawn Ades (et al.), ''Art and Power: Europe under the Dictators, 1930-1945'', London: The South Bank Centre, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Spanish people have a path that leads to a star'' (1937), at the entrance of the pavilion of the Spanish Republic was a political statement. So was commissioning modern artists to create works of art for this pavilion. [[Pablo Picasso]] showed two works: a pair of etchings entitled ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'', 1937, and his monumental painting, [[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]], 1937. [[Joan Miró]] painted a huge mural entitled ''Catalan Peasant in Revolt'' (aka [[The Reaper (Miró painting)|The Reaper]], destroyed), and he did a poster entitled “Aidez l’Espagne” (Help Spain), meant to support the Republicans’ cause. The American artist [[Alexander Calder]] created the abstract sculpture ''[[Mercury Fountain]]'' (1937). The involvement of a non-Spanish artist was also an important statement in an era dominated by the rise of nationalism, both in democratic and totalitarian regimes.

Even in democracies, voices called for a return to a more representational style. For instance, some criticized the central place given to Picasso's [[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]] because it was not explicit enough in its denunciation and was too complex.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 25. Robin A. Greeley, S''urrealism and the Spanish Civil War'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; They would have preferred that the focus be placed on paintings such as [[Horacio Ferrer]]’s ''Madrid 1937 (Black Planes)'', from 1937. Its “message” was much clearer and – as a consequence – it functioned better as a political statement.

When they wanted to support the democratic cause and protest against [[Fascism]] and [[dictators]], artists were often encouraged to put aside their modernist style and express themselves in a more realist (i.e. representational) style. For instance, [[Josep Renau]], the Republican Government's director general of Fine Arts, said in 1937: “The poster maker, as an artist, knows a disciplined freedom, a freedom conditioned by objective demands, external to his individual will. Thus for the poster artist the simple question of expressing his own sensibility and emotion is neither legitimate nor practically realizable, if not in the service of an objective goal.&lt;ref&gt;Josep Renau, quoted by M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;” And the French author, [[Louis Aragon]], declared in 1936: “For artists as for every person who feels like a spokesperson for a new humanity, the Spanish flames and blood put [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Aragon, in ''La Commune'', 1936, quoted by [[Lionel Richard]], ''L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale'', Paris, Flammarion, 1995 (transl. from French)&lt;/ref&gt;” In other words, the artist's political engagement required a submission of the work's artistic aspects to the expression of the political content.

The series ''The Year of Peril'', created in [[1942 in art|1942]] by the American artist [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], illustrates how the boundary between art and propaganda can be blurred by such a stance. Produced as a reaction to the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] in 1941, the series portrayed the threat posed to the U.S. by Nazism and Fascism in an expressive but representational style. The message is clearly and powerfully delivered. These images were massively reproduced and disseminated in order to contribute to raise support for the U.S. involvement in World War II.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Thus, there can be troubling affinities between Allied politically-engaged art and fascist and totalitarian art when in both cases art and artists are used to create “persuasive images”, i.e. visual propaganda. Such a conception of political art was problematic for many modern artists as modernism was precisely defined by its autonomy from anything non-artistic. For some, absolute artistic freedom – and thus freedom from the requirement of having a clear, stable, and easily decipherable meaning – should have been what symbolised the liberal and progressive values and spirit of democracies.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political art===
[[File:Shelter Experiments, near Woburn, Bedfordshire (Art. IWM ART LD 3859).jpg|thumb|''Shelter Experiments, near Woburn, Bedfordshire'' by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], 1943]]
[[File:The City A fallen lift shaft (1941) (Art.IWM ART LD 893).jpg|thumb|''The City A fallen lift shaft'' by [[Graham Sutherland]], 1941]]
Britain was also subject to political differences during the 1930s but did not suffer repression nor civil war as elsewhere, and could enter World War II with a justifiable sense of defending freedom and democracy. Art had similarly followed the free expression at the heart of modernism, but political appropriation was already sought [as in the left-wing [[Artists’ International Association]] founded in 1933]. With the outbreak of war came official recognition of art's use as propaganda. However, in Britain, political promotion did not include the persecution of artistic freedom in general.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1939, the [[War Artists Advisory Committee]] (WAAC) was founded under the aegis of the British Ministry of Information, with the remit to list and select artists qualified to record the war and pursue other war purposes. Artists were thought to have special skills useful to a country at war:  they could interpret and express the essence of wartime experiences and create images that promoted the country's culture and values. Not the least of these was artists’ freedom to choose the subjects and style of their art.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} A significant influence was the choice of Sir [[Kenneth Clark]] as instigator and director of WAAC, as he believed that the first duty of an artist was to produce good works of art that would bring international renown. And he believed the second duty was to produce images through which a country presents itself to the world, and a record of war more expressive than a camera may give.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Important to this was the exhibition of Britain at War at [[New York Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art]] in New York in 1941 (22 May to 2 September).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

This initiative also provided support for British artists when the world seemed to be sinking into barbarism. But it was not without intentions and constraints, and some works were rejected or censored. Accurate representations were required and abstract art, as it did not deliver a clear message, was avoided. Some depictions could be too realistic and were censored because they revealed sensitive information or would have scared people – and maintaining the nation's morale was vital. No foreign artists were admitted to the programme, a great sorrow to many who had fled to Britain from persecution elsewhere.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Despite these restrictions, the work commissioned was illustrative, non-bombastic, and often of great distinction thanks to established artists such as [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Graham Sutherland]] and [[Stanley Spencer]].

===Holocaust art===
{{Main article|The Holocaust in popular culture}}
Many works of art and images were created by detainees in ghettos and in concentration and extermination camps. They form a large body of images. Most of them were small and fragile, many were destroyed and lost. The large majority of these images were created clandestinely because such a creative activity was forbidden and could have resulted in a death sentence. Yet, many inmates found materials and transgressed the rules in order to create.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Their motives for doing so were multiple but they all seem to have been linked to a survival instinct and self-preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Richard, ''L’art et la guerre: Les artistes confrontés à la Seconde guerre mondiale'', Paris, Flammarion, 1995, p. 216: for some internees, art had a « live-saving function » (transl. from French)&lt;/ref&gt; Art could be a distraction and an escape from the horrors of the present. Distancing oneself (by depicting imaginary scenes or by taking on the role of the observer) was a way to keep some sanity. Doing drawings could also be a way to barter and thus to increase one's chances of survival in the camp or ghetto. Moreover, by creating visual artefacts there was the hope of creating something that would survive to one's death and would live on to testify to one's existence. Some seemed to have been animated by a documentary spirit: recording what was happening to them for people beyond the fence. Finally, such a creative urge was a form of cultural resistance. When their persecutors were trying to eradicate every bit of their humanity, artistic creation and testimony were ways to reclaim it, to preserve and cultivate it.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In terms of subject matters, the images created in concentration and extermination camps are characterised by their determination to enhance the detainees’ dignity and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably the most visible in the numerous portraits that were done. Whereas the Nazi extermination machine aimed at dehumanising the internees, creating “faceless” beings, clandestine artists would give them back their individuality. In this body of works, depictions of atrocities are not so frequent, which suggests that they might have been intentionally avoided. Rather, it is after the liberation, in the art of survivors that the most brutal and abominable aspects of concentration and extermination camps found a visual expression.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the face of such horrors, some artists were confronted with ethical problems and felt that representation had reached a limit. Thus, since the liberation of the camps, artists who have wanted to express the [[Holocaust]] in their art have often chosen abstraction or symbolism, thus avoided any explicit representations. A few went as far as to suggest that art itself – and not simply representational art – had reached a limit because creating an aesthetic object about the Holocaust would be, in itself, unethical, morally reprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bohm-Duchen, ''Art and the Second World War'', Farnham: Lund Humphries, 2013, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''authoritarian leadership style''' is exemplified when a [[leader]] dictates policies and procedures, decides what [[goal]]s are to be achieved, and directs and controls all activities without any meaningful participation by the subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;
Business Dictionary. (n.d). authoritarian leadership. Retrieved 2017-04-01, from  http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/authoritarian-leadership.html - "A leadership style in which the leader dictates policies and procedures, decides what goals are to be achieved, and directs and controls all activities without any meaningful participation by the subordinates."
&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a leader has full control of the [[team]], leaving low autonomy within the [[groups of people | group]].
The leader has a [[Foresight (psychology) | vision]] in mind and must be able to effectively motivate their group to finish the task.{{cn|date=April 2017}} The group is expected to complete the tasks under [[micromanagement | very close supervision]], while unlimited authority is self-bestowed by the leader. Subordinates' responses to the orders given are either punished or rewarded.

==Background==
Authoritarian leaders are commonly referred to as autocratic leaders. They sometimes, but not always, provide clear expectations for what needs to be done, when it should be done, and how it should be done. There is also a clear divide between the leader and the followers.&lt;ref name=Cherry&gt;Cherry, Kendra. "Lewin's Leadership Styles." About.com Psychology. Web. 14 Mar. 2012. &lt;http://psychology.about.com/od/leadership/a/leadstyles.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Altemeyer]] conducted research on what he labeled ''right-wing authoritarianism'' (RWA), and presented an analysis of the personality types of both the authoritarian leaders and the authoritarian followers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260108603822 The Other “Authoritarian Personality”] by Bob Altemeyer Advances in Experimental Social PsychologyVolume 30, 1998, Pages 47-92&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarian leaders make decisions independently with little or no input from the rest of the group. Authoritarian leaders uphold stringent control over their followers by directly regulating rules, methodologies, and actions.  Authoritarian leaders construct gaps and build distance between themselves and their followers with the intention of stressing role distinctions.&lt;ref name=Hackman&gt;Hackman, M. Z., &amp; Johnson, C. E. (2009). Leadership: A Communication Perspective (5th ed.). Long Grove, IL, Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of leadership dates back to the earliest tribes and empires. It is often used in present-day when there is little room for error, such as construction jobs or manufacturing jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Leadership-Toolbox. (2008). Leadership Styles: Authoritarian Leadership. Retrieved November 15, 2013, from http://www.leadership-toolbox.com/autocratic-leadership.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarian leadership  typically fosters little creativity in decision-making. Lewin also found that it is more difficult to move from an authoritarian style to a democratic style than from a democratic form to an authoritarian form of leadership. Abuse of this style is usually viewed as controlling, bossy  and dictatorial. Authoritarian leadership is best applied to situations where there is little time for group discussion.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt;

==Views of authoritarian leaders==
A common belief of many authoritarian leaders is that followers require direct supervision at all times, or else they would not operate effectively.&lt;ref name="Hackman" /&gt; This belief is in accordance with one of [[Douglas McGregor]]'s philosophical views of humankind, [[Theory X]].  This theory proposes that it is a leaders role to coerce and control followers, because people have an inherent aversion for work and will abstain from it whenever possible. Theory X also postulates that people must be compelled through force, intimidation or authority, and controlled, directed, or threatened with punishment in order to get them to accomplish the organizational needs.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, D. (2010). Theory x and theory y. Big Dog &amp; Little Dog’s Performance Juxtapostion. Retrieved March 26, 2012, from http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/history/xy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the minds of authoritarian leaders, people who are left to work autonomously will ultimately be unproductive.  “Examples of authoritarian communicative behavior include a police officer directing traffic, a teacher ordering a student to do his or her assignment, and a supervisor instructing a subordinate to clean a workstation.” &lt;ref name="Hackman" /&gt;

Communication Patterns of Authoritarian Leadership:&lt;ref name="Hackman" /&gt;

*Downward, one-way communication (i.e. leaders to followers, or supervisors to subordinates)
*Controls discussion with followers
*Dominates interaction
*Independently/unilaterally sets policy and procedures
*Individually directs the completion of tasks
*Does not offer constant feedback
*Rewards acquiescent obedient behavior and punishes erroneous actions
*Poor listener
*Uses conflict for individual gain

Ways to Properly Incorporate Authoritarian Leadership:

*Always explain rules- it allows your subordinates to complete the task you want done efficiently.
*Be consistent- if you are to enforce rules and regulations, make sure to do so regularly so your subordinates take you seriously. This will form a stronger level of trust.
*Respect your subordinates - always recognize your subordinates' efforts and achievements.
*Educate your subordinates before enforcing rules - do not present them with any surprises. This can lead to problems in the future due to false communication.
*Listen to suggestions from your subordinates, even if you do not incorporate them.

Downfalls of Authoritarian Leadership:
*Long term use can cause resentment from subordinates. Use this form of leadership sparingly and when absolutely necessary
*It has been found by researchers that these type of leaders lack creative problem solving skills
*Without proper instruction and understanding from subordinates, confusion may arise

==Examples of Authoritarian Leaders==

[[Engelbert Dollfuss]], chancellor of Austria from 1932 to 1934, destroyed the [[Austrian Republic]] and established an authoritarian regime based on conservative Roman Catholic and Italian Fascist principles. In May 1932 when he became chancellor, Dollfuss headed a conservative coalition led by the Christian Social Party. When faced with a severe economic crisis caused by the Great Depression, Dollfuss decided against joining Germany in a customs union, a course advocated by many Austrians. Severely criticized by Social Democrats, Pan-German nationalists, and Austrian Nazis, he countered by drifting toward an increasingly authoritarian regime.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;Britannica. (n.d). Engelbert Dollfuss. Retrieved March 21, 2012 from, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/168274/Engelbert-Dollfuss&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]] became Dollfuss' principal foreign ally. Italy guaranteed Austrian independence at Riccione (August 1933), but in return Austria had to abolish all political parties and reform its constitution on the Fascist model. In March 1933, Dollfuss’ attacks on Parliament culminated that September in the permanent abolition of the legislature and the formation of a corporate state based on his Vaterländische Front (“Fatherland Front”); with which he expected to replace Austria’s political parties. In foreign affairs he steered a course that converted Austria virtually into an Italian satellite state. Hoping therewith to prevent Austria’s incorporation into Nazi Germany, he fought his domestic political opponents along fascist-authoritarian lines.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

In February 1934 paramilitary formations loyal to the chancellor crushed Austria’s Social Democrats. With a new constitution of May 1934, his regime became completely dictatorial. In June, however, Germany incited the Austrian Nazis to civil war. Dollfuss was assassinated by the Nazis in a raid on the chancellery.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

One must be careful drawing similarities between political dictators and the authoritarian styles of non-politicians.  For example, one might argue--controversially--that [[Martha Stewart]] had an authoritarian style.  She constructed her empire through her own special attention to every detail.  She was meticulous, demanding, thorough and scrupulous. She flourished in her ventures and in using her authoritarian leadership style.&lt;ref&gt;Autocratic Leadership. (2010). Money-Zine.com. Retrieved March 23, 2012, from http://www.money-zine.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autocratic leadership style works well if the leader is competent and knowledgeable enough to decide about each and everything. Authoritative is considered one of the most effective leadership styles in case there is some emergency and quick decisions need to be taken. [[Bill Gates]] adopted this style and has steered Microsoft toward great success. According to Bill Gates, he had a vision when he took reins of the company and then used all the resources available to make that vision a reality.In the personal computer workplace, many operating conditions call for urgent action, making this style of leadership effective. While Gates does not exhibit this style consistently, his success can be judged by his decision making process and the growth of the computer industry in the world.&lt;ref name=Gates&gt;{{cite web|last=Dogra|first=Aastha|title=Leadership Styles and Examples|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/leadership-styles-and-examples.html|publisher=Buzzle.com|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Backpage''' was a [[classified advertising]] website launched in 2004. Until its seizure by U.S. authorities in April 2018, it offered classified listings for a wide variety of products and services including automotive, jobs listings, and [[real estate]]. In 2011, Backpage was the second largest classified ad listing service on the Internet in the United States after [[Craigslist]].&lt;ref name="dorish"&gt;{{cite web |title=Backpage Vs. Craigslist |first=Joe |last=Dorish |url=http://furniture-care.knoji.com/backpage-vs-craigslist/ |publisher=Knoji |date=February 2011 |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's offering of adult services sections had been highly controversial, due to allegations that Backpage knowingly allowed and encouraged users to post ads related to [[prostitution]] and [[human trafficking]], particularly involving minors, and took steps to intentionally obfuscate the activities. After a series of court cases and the arrest of the company's CEO and other officials, Backpage removed the adult services subsection in the United States in 2017.

On April 6, 2018 backpage.com and affiliated websites were seized as part of an enforcement action by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]], the [[United States Department of Justice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/ap-backpagecom-ceo-pleads-guilty-to-california-money-charges-2018-4|title=Backpage.com CEO pleads guilty to California money charges|work=Business Insider|access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigator Division]], with analytical assistance from the [[Joint Regional Intelligence Center]]. 

Its CEO, Carl Ferrer, pleaded guilty to charges of facilitating prostitution and money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Montgomery Advertiser]]|page=3B|title=Backpage CEO pleads guilty, could spend 5 years in prison|first1=Megan|last1=Cassidy|first2=Ricgard|last2=Ruelas|date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Near the turn of the 21st century, [[Internet]]-based classified advertising, particularly the website [[Craigslist]], was having a significant impact on the classified advertising business in newspapers nationwide.{{fact|date=May 2018}} Classified advertising in daily newspapers as well as weekly alternatives, suburban papers and community papers was moving to the free advertising model of Craigslist and other smaller websites.{{fact|date=May 2018}  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex Workers on What It Means to Lose Backpage |url=https://mowamba.com/2018/10/29/7-sex-workers-on-what-to-lose-backpage/ |website=mowamba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, in response to this phenomenon, [[New Times Media]] (later to be known as [[Village Voice Media]]), a publisher of 11 alternative newsweeklies, launched a free classified website called backpage.com.&lt;ref name="kiefer"&gt;{{citation |last=Kiefer |first=Michael |date=September 23, 2012 |title=Phoenix New Times founders selling company |publisher=The Arizona Republic |location=Phoenix |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/20120922phoenix-new-times-founders-selling.html |accessdate=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The foundation and traditions of free classified advertising and free circulation were part of the fundamentals of the alternative newsweeklies dating back to 1971.  The ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' and the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' were pioneers in these operating philosophies.&lt;ref name="valeo"&gt;{{citation|last=Valeo|first=Tom|title=The Chicago Reader: A '70s Success Story|date=November 4, 1979|url=http://sites.google.com/site/chireaderhistory/documents/Herald791104.pdf|location=Chicago, IL|publisher=Daily Herald|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="am-midewst"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia|last=|first=|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=|quote=|access-date=|via=|editor1-first=Richard|editor1-last=Sisson|editor2-first=Christian|editor2-last=Zacher|editor3-first=Andrew|editor3-last=Cayton}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Backpage soon became the second largest online classified site in the United States.&lt;ref name=kiefer /&gt; The site included the various categories found in newspaper classified sections including those that were unique to and part of the [[First Amendment]]-driven traditions of most alternative weeklies. These included personals (including adult-oriented personal ads), adult services, musicians and "[[New Age]]" services.

== Adult section ==
Until January 9, 2017, Backpage contained an adult section containing different subcategories of various sex work professions (escorts, erotic masseuses, strippers, phone sex operators, etc). 
After accusations from the United States Senate of being directly involved with sex-trafficking and the sexual exploitation of minors, the company suspended its adult listings, describing the move as "the direct result of unconstitutional government censorship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Backpage pulls adult ads and accuses government of 'censorship'|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/backpage-pulls-adult-ads-blames-censorship-after-report-sex-trafficking-n705056|accessdate=March 1, 2017|work=NBC News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many escorts and erotic masseuses admit to moving their ads to the "massage" and "women seeking men" listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salinger|first1=Alexa|title=The Ultimate Guide to Backpage Ads|date=2017|publisher=Amazon Digital Services|location=New York|pages=38|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Backpage-Ads-ebook/dp/B075HDY2YB/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505605372&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+ultimate+guide+to+backpage+ads|accessdate=September 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is illegal throughout the United States, except for some counties in Nevada.

Kristen DiAngelo, executive director of the [[Sex Workers Outreach Project]] of Sacramento, criticized the shutdown, questioning how many sex workers across the United States no longer had a way to support themselves. Backpage allowed for sex workers using the site to post bad date lists, screen clients and communicate with other sex workers to ensure a safer experience.&lt;ref&gt;
https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/health/sex-workers-craigslist-personals-trafficking-bill/index.html
&lt;/ref&gt; Activists argued that the move would force some of the site's users to work on the street instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/10/backpage-adult-classifieds-sex-workers-danger-trafficking|title=Backpage's halt of adult classifieds will endanger sex workers, advocates warn|last=Levin|first=Sam|date=January 10, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=March 1, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the deletion of Backpage, a duplicate site called yesbackpage.de has been brought to the surface. Yesbackpage is almost identical to what Backpage use to be, including sex trafficking and prostitution ads. &lt;ref&gt;https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/10/02/cook-county-sheriff-working-to-shut-down-sex-trafficking-websites/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.yesbackpage.de&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
{{too long|section|date=April 2018}}
There has been significant public controversy and discourse regarding the adult section of Backpage.com. Most of the criticism has centered on the charge that Backpage is used to market minors (i.e. underage sex trafficking), and that they contribute to a surge of prostitution in areas that they operate.&lt;ref name="surge"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alabama2017-01-25/&gt; Media, law enforcement, politicians and parents of trafficked children have weighed in on this matter.&lt;ref name=NCMEC_brief /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN-lurid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/10/a-lurid-journey-through-backpage-com/|title=A lurid journey through Backpage.com|last2=Steffen|first2=Sheila|date=May 10, 2012|website=CNN.com|publisher=cnn.com|access-date=January 21, 2016|last1=Feyerick|first1=Deborah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irvine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/backpage-ad-site-aider-of-traffickers-or-way-to-stop-them/|title=Backpage ad site: Aider of traffickers, or way to stop them?|last=Irvine|first=Martha|date=August 16, 2015|newspaper=Seattle Times|location=Seattle, Washington|access-date=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/01/26/backpages-takes-heat-for-prostitution-ads-that-are-everywhere/|title=Backpage Takes Heat, But Prostitution Ads Are Everywhere|last=Fisher|first=Daniel|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] (NCMEC), the majority of child sex trafficking cases referred to NCMEC involve ads on Backpage.&lt;sup&gt;[[Backpage#cite note-NCMEC brief-10|[10]]]&lt;/sup&gt;  Backpage says that it blocks about a million ads per month, mostly suspected of child sex trafficking or prostitution.&lt;sup&gt;[[Backpage#cite note-surge-11|[11]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Of those, they report around 400 ads a month to NCMEC which in turn notify law enforcement.&lt;sup&gt;[[Backpage#cite note-CNN-lurid-12|[12]]][[Backpage#cite note-irvine-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Content submitted to Backpage is surveyed by an automated scan for terms related to prostitution. At least one member of a team of over 100 people also oversees each entry before it is posted.&lt;sup&gt;[[Backpage#cite note-forbes1-14|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Backpage has had continued issues with [[credit card]] processors, who were under pressure from law enforcement to cease working with companies that allegedly allow or encourage illegal prostitution. In 2015 Backpage lost all credit card processing agreements, leaving [[Bitcoin]] as the remaining option for paid ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Luke|title=Backpage Goes Bitcoin-Only|url=http://bravenewcoin.com/news/backpage-goes-bitcoin-only/|website=bravenewcoin|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[amicus curiae brief]], the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children says the efforts of Backpage are inadequate and their reporting lacked in several areas. They say Backpage does not report all ads that have been flagged as being underage, does not report when someone tries to advertise children under 18 years of age, and does not respond to requests of parents to have ads of their trafficked children removed. They also say Backpage "encourage[s] dissemination of child sex trafficking content on its website". They say Backpage is much slower in removing ads that advertise children than ads placed by authorities aimed at trapping traffickers, guides traffickers in creating false pages for underage children, instructs traffickers and buyers on how to pay anonymously, and makes it easier to make adult posts than other posts. They said "To all intents and purposes, Backpage has instituted no effective procedures to prevent child sex trafficking ads from being created on its site." They say that they do not use obvious techniques to identify traffickers, such as using the same phone number, email address or credit card of a known trafficker, or reusing the same picture of known victim of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=NCMEC_brief/&gt;

Advocates for Backpage point out that by carefully scrutinizing each posting in the Adult section before it is posted, removing questionable posts and reporting potential cases of the trafficking of minors to the authorities and NGOs such as NCMEC, Backpage is aiding in the fight against this activity. In addition, they argue that by providing prompt and detailed information about postings to law enforcement when asked to do so (including phone numbers, credit card numbers and IP addresses), Backpage aids law enforcement in protecting minors from such activity. They also contend that the prompt and complete production of this information results in more convictions for illegal activities and that shutting down the adult section of Backpage will simply drive the traffickers to other places on the internet that will be less forthcoming about crucial information for law enforcement.&lt;ref name=irvine /&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/julieruvolo/2012/06/26/sex-lies-and-suicide-whats-wrong-with-the-war-on-sex-trafficking/#1f828246b392205ffdc86b39 |title=Sex, Lies and Suicide: What's Wrong with the War on Sex Trafficking |last=Ruvolo |first=Julie |date=June 26, 2012 |website=Forbes |publisher=Forbes |access-date=January 21, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://origin-nyi.thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/crime/306533-americas-top-online-brothel-is-critical-tool-for-law-enforcement|title=America's top online brothel a critical tool for law enforcement|last=Charles|first=J.B.|date=November 17, 2016|newspaper=TheHill|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liz McDougall, an attorney serving as general counsel for Backpage.com, said that Backpage is an "ally in the fight against [[human trafficking]]." She said that the adult section of Backpage is closely monitored, and that shutting it down "would simply drive the trafficking underground." She said that websites like Backpage, that are able to monitor trafficking activity and report it to law enforcement, are key in the fight against human trafficking.&lt;ref name="mcdougall"&gt;{{cite news |last=McDougall |first= Liz |date= May 6, 2012 |title=Backpage.com is an ally in the fight against human trafficking |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2018143440_guest07mcdougall.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |location=Seattle, Washington |access-date=May 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDougall said that shutting down the service on a cooperative United States–based website would only drive trafficking to underground and international websites that are more difficult to monitor, and are often outside the jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement.&lt;ref name=mcdougall /&gt;

Writers for ''Forbes'', the ''Huffington Post'', and ''Fast Company'' have suggested that Backpage is a useful tool for law enforcement and the public in exposing the perpetrators of human trafficking.&lt;ref name=forbes1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3038284/the-backpagecom-conundrum |title=The Backpage.com Paradox |last=Anderson |first=Lessley |date=November 19, 2014 |website=Fast Company |publisher=Fast Company |access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost2"&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/backpage-credit-cards-sex_55b96ed3e4b0af35367a4530 |title=Sex Workers Say Credit Card Bans On Online Ads Do More Harm Than Good |last=Hanson |first=Hilary |date=July 30, 2015 |journal=Huffington Post |access-date=January 21, 2016 |quote=It's the more marginalized and poorer workers who are hit hardest by this. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous NGOs and others contend that the potential harm done by a website that features a section for adult posting is far greater than any actions the site may take to aid law enforcement. In many cases, the critics of Backpage say that these efforts are less than is necessary or possible. Some say that no efforts to police the site and report bad actors outweigh the negative impact the site may have in this area. The general counsel for National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said, "Backpage’s reporting is not conducted in good faith."&lt;ref name="CNN-lurid" /&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' writer [[Glenn Kessler (journalist)|Glenn Kessler]], in a number of his Fact Checker columns, debunked many of the inflated sex trafficking statistics and claims cited by politicians, NGOs, lawmakers and the media.&lt;ref name="Kessler1"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Glenn Kessler (journalist) | last=Kessler |first=Glenn |date=June 11, 2015 |title=The Four-Pinocchio claim that ‘on average, girls first become victims of sex trafficking at 13 years old’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/06/11/the-dubious-claim-that-on-average-girls-first-become-victims-of-sex-trafficking-at-13-years-old/ | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]] |access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kessler2"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Glenn Kessler (journalist) | last=Kessler |first=Glenn |date=May 28, 2015 |title=The bogus claim that 300,000 U.S. children are ‘at risk’ of sexual exploitation |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/05/28/the-bogus-claim-that-300000-u-s-children-are-at-risk-of-sexual-exploitation/ | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]]  |access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kessler3"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Glenn Kessler (journalist) | last=Kessler |first=Glenn |date=June 2, 2015 |title=The false claim that human trafficking is a ‘$9.5 billion business’ in the United States |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/06/02/the-false-claim-that-child-sex-trafficking-is-a-9-5-billion-business-in-the-united-states/ | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]]  | access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kessler4"&gt;{{cite news | authorlink = Glenn Kessler (journalist) | last=Kessler |first=Glenn |date=April 24, 2015 |title=Why you should be wary of statistics on ‘modern slavery’ and ‘trafficking’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/04/24/why-you-should-be-wary-of-statistics-on-modern-slavery-and-trafficking/ | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]] | access-date=January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, at the behest of a number of NGO's including Fair Girls and NCMEC, Fitzgibbon Media (a well-known progressive/liberal [[public relations]] agency) created a multimedia campaign to garner support for the anti-Backpage position. They enlisted support from musicians, politicians, journalists, media companies and retailers. The campaign created a greater public dialogue, both pro and con, regarding Backpage.&lt;ref name="fitzgibbon"&gt;{{cite web |dead-url=yes |archive-url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:8Uc1JYP1NkIJ:adam.curry.com/art/1372261745_TxT8pkDD.html+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |url=http://www.fitzgibbonmedia.com/casestudies/exposing-backpage/ |archive-date=January 16, 2016 |title=Exposing Backpage.com |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=www.fitzgibbonmedia.com |publisher=Fitzgibbon Media |access-date= January 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Fitzgibbon Media was closed due to multiple allegations of sexual harassment and abuse by Fitzgibbon owner Tervor Fitzgibbon.&lt;ref name="huffpost1"&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fitzgibbon-media_us_567330fce4b014efe0d4cb4e |title=The Disturbing Story Of Widespread Sexual Assault Allegations At A Major Progressive PR Firm |last1=Terkel |first1=Amanda |last2=Grim |first2=Ryan |last3=Stein |first3=Sam |date=December 19, 2015 |journal=Huffington Post |access-date=January 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies including [[H&amp;M]], [[IKEA]], and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] canceled ads for publications owned by Village Voice Media.

In 2012, Village Voice Media separated their newspaper company, which then consisted of eleven weekly alternative newspapers and their affiliated web properties, from Backpage, leaving Backpage in control of shareholders Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin. Executives for the spinoff holding company, called [[Voice Media Group]] (VMG) and based in Denver, raised "some money from private investors" in order to purchase the newspapers.&lt;ref name="Reuters-9-24-2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/24/us-usa-villagevoice-backpage-idINBRE88N04020120924 |title=Village Voice newspaper chain to split from controversial ad site |last1=Francescani |first1=Chris |author2=Nadia Damouni  |date=September 24, 2012 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=December 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CEO of VMG, said "Backpage has been a distraction—there's no question about it—to the core (editorial) properties."&lt;ref name="Reuters-9-24-2012" /&gt; In December 2014, [[Village Voice Media]] sold Backpage to a Dutch holding company.

=== Legal decisions ===
Beginning in 2011 a number of legal challenges were initiated by foes of Backpage in attempts to eliminate the adult section of the website and or shut down the website entirely. These actions included legislative initiatives as well as lawsuits brought by individuals; all of these lawsuits, which were mostly brought by politicians and NGOs, were successfully challenged by Backpage, which argued that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protections of [[free speech]] were being compromised by any restriction on postings by individuals on the Backpage website. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] amendments to the Constitution as well as the Commerce Clause were also cited as reasons that these efforts were illegal under U.S. law. 

[[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]] of 1996 (CDA) served as an additional cornerstone in the defense. Section 230 says that "No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."

The court held that Backpage could not be liable for the "existence of an escorts section" ("whatever its social merits, [the section] is not illegal").

=== Alleged victims ===
On April 9, 2018, the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]]'s indictment against Backpage was unsealed. It contains details about 17 alleged victims who range from minors as young as 14 years old to adults, who were allegedly trafficked on the site while Backpage was knowingly facilitating [[prostitution]]. One 15-year-old is alleged to have been forced to do in-calls at hotels. A second teenager was allegedly told to "perform sexual acts at gunpoint and choked" until she had seizures, before being [[Gang rape|gang-raped]]. A third victim, advertised under the [[pseudonym]] "Nadia" was [[Stabbing|stabbed]] to death, while a fourth victim was [[Murder|murdered]] in 2015, and her corpse deliberately burned. The lawyer for Backpage operations manager Andrew Padilla stated that his client was "not legally responsible for any actions of third parties under U.S. law. He is no more responsible than the owner of a community billboard when someone places an ad on it,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/backpage-indictment-trafficking_us_5acbcaeae4b0337ad1eadf6a|title=Backpage.com Founders Indicted For Facilitating Prostitution On Site|last=Amatulli|first=Jenna|date=April 9, 2018|work=HuffPost Canada|access-date=April 13, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Reilly|first2=Ryan J.|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The California arrest warrant alleged that 99% of Backpage’s revenue was directly attributable to [[prostitution]]-related ads, and many of the ads involved victims of [[sex trafficking]], including children under the age of 18.  The State of Texas was also considering a [[money laundering]] charge pending its investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Authorities-arrest-Backpage-CEO-in-human-9884677.php|title=Backpage CEO to appear in Houston court on prostitution bust|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-announces-criminal-charges-against-senior|title=Attorney General Kamala D.

Backpage general counsel Liz McDougall dismissed the raid as an "election year stunt" which wasn't "a good-faith action by law enforcement", and stated that the company would "take all steps necessary to end this frivolous prosecution and will pursue its full remedies under federal law against the state actors who chose to ignore the law, as it has done successfully in other cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-backpage-ceo-arrested-charged-20161006-snap-story.html|title=Backpage says criminal charges by Kamala Harris are 'election year stunt'|last=Hamilton|first=Matt|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backpage also accused California attorney general [[Kamala Harris]] of an illegal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/10/07/backpage-com-ceo-will-fight-sex-trafficking-charges-lawyer-says/|title=Backpage.com CEO Will Fight Sex Trafficking Charges, Lawyer Says|work=CBS Los Angeles|access-date=November 21, 2016|date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of observers immediately criticized the arrests, including writers such as Mike Masnick at Techdirt, Noah Feldman at Bloomberg and Elizabeth Nolan Brown at Reason.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reason.com/blog/2016/10/07/charges-against-backpage-ceo-listed|title=Here's How Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer Supposedly Profited From Child Sex Trafficking|date=October 7, 2016|newspaper=Reason.com|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Masnick points out that the arrests are in contradiction to section 230 of the CDA and the First Amendment rights of Backpage as has been upheld in numerous court decisions over the five previous years. He posited that AG Harris was more interested in the publicity from the arrests for political gain than in enforcing a law she had previously admitted was unenforceable by individual states as specified in section 230.  In addition he points out that the details in the complaint appear to support Backpage’s assertion that it responds appropriately when advised of illegal ads on its site and removes them promptly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161006/23395935732/details-charges-against-backpage-execs-pimping-look-totally-bogus.shtml|title=Details Of Charges Against Backpage Execs For 'Pimping' Look Totally Bogus|newspaper=Techdirt.|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161020/00271735843/arrested-backpage-execs-ask-kamala-harris-to-drop-bogus-case-she-herself-has-admitted-she-has-no-authority-to-bring.shtml|title=Arrested Backpage Execs Ask Kamala Harris To Drop Bogus Case She Herself Has Admitted She Has No Authority To Bring|newspaper=Techdirt.|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feldman said: "It takes a lot to turn a publisher of sex ads into a First Amendment hero. But the attorney general of California has managed the feat. By charging Carl Ferrer, the chief executive of Backpage.com, with pimping and sex trafficking in minors, Kamala Harris has seriously breached the constitutional wall meant to protect the free press."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-10/publisher-of-sex-trafficking-ads-isn-t-the-criminal|title=Publisher of Sex-Trafficking Ads Isn't the Criminal|last=Feldman|first=Noah|date=October 10, 2016|newspaper=Bloomberg View|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, attorneys for Ferrer, Larkin and Lacey, sent a letter to the California AG Kamala Harris asking that all charges against their clients be dropped.&lt;ref name=AttorneyGeneralHarris/&gt; The AG’s office did not agree to the request for dismissal.

On October 19, 2016, attorneys for Backpage filed a Demurrer to the Criminal Complaint against CEO Carl Ferrer and former Backpage owners Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin.  In it they argued that all charges against their clients should be dismissed based upon, among other things,  that the Attorney General’s prosecution "tramples First Amendment Rights and is flatly barred by Section 230 as she has admitted". Numerous previous court ruling and decisions were cited in the Demurrer supporting this position.&lt;ref name=PeopleVFerrer/&gt;

The AG filed its response to the Demurrer on November 4, 2016. Backpage Attorneys filed their reply in support of the Demurrer on November 10, 2016.  On November 16, 2016 Judge Michael Bowman of the Superior Court of the State of California issued a tentative ruling in this case supporting the position of Backpage and granting its request for dismissal of the case.&lt;ref name=PeopleVFerrerA/&gt;  He then heard oral arguments in his courtroom from both parties and indicated he would issue a final ruling by December 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-16/backpage-com-online-brothel-pimping-charges-may-be-thrown-out|title=Backpage.com ‘Online Brothel’ Pimping Charges May Be Tossed|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2016, Judge Bowman issued a Final Ruling 62 on this matter.  Bowman dismissed all the charges in the complaint, stating that:

"...Congress has precluded liability for online publishers for the action of publishing third party speech and thus provided for both a foreclosure from prosecution and an affirmative defense at trial. Congress has spoken on this matter and it is for Congress, not this Court, to revisit.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=California vs Ferrar, et al|court=Cal.

On December 23, 2016, the state of California then filed new charges against Backpage CEO Carl Ferrer and former Backpage owners Mike Lacey and Jim Larkin.  They were charged with pimping and money laundering.&lt;ref name=CaliforniaVFerrerViaPhoenixTimes/&gt;

Lawyers for Backpage responded that the charges rehashed the earlier case that had been dismissed on December 9, 2016.  Jim Grant, an attorney for Backpage said: “She (CA AG Kamala Harris) cannot avoid First Amendment protections, federal law or her obligations to follow the law, although her new complaint is a transparent effort to do exactly that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/calif-files-new-charges-against-backpage-com-ceo-after-case-n699706|title=Calif. files new charges against Backpage.com CEO after case dismissed|newspaper=NBC News|access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arraignment was set for January 11, 2017.

Since April 2015, the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations ("PSI") has been investigating Backpage.com as part of a stated overall investigation of human trafficking.  After a voluntary, day-long briefing and interview provided by the company’s General Counsel, PSI followed up with a subpoena to Backpage.com demanding over 40 categories of documents, covering 120 subjects, regarding Backpage’s business practices.  Much of the subpoena targeted Backpage’s editorial functions as an online intermediary.  Over the ensuing months, Backpage raised and PSI rejected numerous objections to the subpoena, including that the subpoena was impermissibly burdensome both in the volume of documents PSI demanded and in its intrusion into constitutionally-protected editorial discretion.  PSI subsequently issued a shorter document subpoena with only eight requests but broader in scope and also targeting Backpage.com's editorial functions.  Backpage.com continued to object on First Amendment and other grounds.

PSI applied in March 2016 for a federal court order to enforce three of the eight categories of documents in the subpoena.  In August 2016, the U.S. District Court in D.C. granted PSI’s application and ordered Backpage to produce documents responsive to the three requests.&lt;ref&gt;''Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations v. Ferrer'', __ F.Supp.3d ___, 2016 WL 4179289, Misc. Action No. 16-mc-621 (RMC) (D.D.C. August 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Backpage immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay, which the district court denied, then filed emergency stay petitions with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and Supreme Court.  Each appellate court issued temporary stays to consider whether to grant a stay pending appeal,&lt;ref&gt;''Ferrer v. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations'', 137 S. Ct. 1 (Mem.), 195 L.E.2d 900, 85 USLW 3075 (Sep 6, 2016),&lt;/ref&gt;  but eventually denied the emergency stay requests,&lt;ref&gt;''Ferrer v. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations'', 137 S. Ct. 28 (Mem.), 195 L.E.2d 901, 85 USLW 3084 (Sep 13, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the D.C. Circuit agreed to expedite the appeal, and one of its judges who considered the emergency stay said he would have granted it.  Backpage has continued to pursue its appeal despite producing thousands of documents to PSI pursuant to the District Court order.  PSI scheduled a Subcommittee hearing regarding Backpage.com for January 10, 2017.

On January 9, 2017, the United States Supreme Court refused to re-consider a ruling by the U.S 1st Circuit Court of Appeals that a suit filed in Boston federal court in 2014 against Backpage by three women who claimed that Backpage was responsible for them being forced into illegal sex transactions.  The Court of Appeals held that Backpage could not be held liable as the "publisher or speaker" for postings on its site by third parties in accordance with the protections provided to website operators under section 230 of the CDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-backpage-idUSKBN14T1OR|title=U.S. Supreme Court will not examine tech industry legal shield|date=January 9, 2017|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on January 9, 2017, prior to its scheduled hearings on Backpage the next day, the PSI released a report that accused Backpage of knowingly facilitating child sex trafficking.&lt;ref name=Mccaskill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/313545-senators-blast-backpage-executives-after-site-closes-adult-section|title=Senators blast Backpage executives as site closes adult section|last=Neidig|first=Harper|date=January 10, 2017|newspaper=TheHill|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, Backpage announced that it would remove its adult sections from all of its sites in the United States. Backpage said it was taking this action due to many years of continuing acts by the government to unconstitutionally censor the site’s content via harassment and extra-legal tactics and to make it too costly to continue its publishing activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/10/backpage-com-shuts-down-adult-services-ads-after-relentless-pressure-from-authorities/|title=Backpage.com shuts down adult services ads after relentless pressure from authorities| newspaper = [[Washington Post]]  | location = [[Washington, DC]] |access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170109/17502636445/backpage-kills-adult-ads-same-day-supreme-court-backed-legal-protections-due-to-grandstanding-senators.shtml|title=Backpage Kills Adult Ads On The Same Day Supreme Court Backed Its Legal Protections, Due To Grandstanding Senators|newspaper=Techdirt|access-date=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late-March 2018 and early-April 2018, courts in Massachusetts and Florida affirmed that Backpage's facilitation of sex trafficking fell outside of the immunity granted by Section 230 safe harbors. The latter ruling argued that because Backpage "materially contributed to the content of the advertisement" by censoring specific keywords, it became a publisher of content and thus no longer protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180329/23024539528/court-shows-sesta-is-not-needed-says-backpage-can-lose-cda-230-protections-if-it-helped-create-illegal-content.shtml|title=Court Shows SESTA Is Not Needed: Says Backpage Can Lose Its CDA 230 Protections If It Helped Create Illegal Content|work=Techdirt.|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180404/11214139563/yet-another-court-says-victims-dont-need-sesta-fosta-to-go-after-backpage.shtml|title=Yet Another Court Says Victims Don't Need SESTA/FOSTA To Go After Backpage|work=Techdirt|access-date=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Starch-based plastics ===
[[Thermoplastic]] starch currently represents the most widely used bioplastic, constituting about 50 percent of the bioplastics market{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}. Simple starch bioplastic can be made at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-Potato-Plastic!/ Make Potato Plastic!]. Instructables.com (2007-07-26). Retrieved on 2011-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pure starch is able to absorb [[humidity]], and is thus a suitable material for the production of drug capsules by the pharmaceutical sector. Flexibiliser and [[plasticiser]] such as [[sorbitol]] and [[glycerine]] can also be added so the starch can also be processed thermo-plastically. The characteristics of the resulting bioplastic (also called "thermo-plastical starch") can be tailored to specific needs by adjusting the amounts of these additives.

Starch-based bioplastics are often blended with biodegradable polyesters to produce starch/polylactic acid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khalid|first1=Saud|last2=Yu|first2=Long|last3=Meng|first3=Linghan|last4=Liu|first4=Hongsheng|last5=Ali|first5=Amjad|last6=Chen|first6=Ling|title=Poly(lactic acid)/starch composites: Effect of microstructure and morphology of starch granules on performance|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/app.45504/abstract|website=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|accessdate=25 July 2017|pages=n/a–n/a|language=en|doi=10.1002/app.45504|volume=134|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; starch/[[polycaprolactone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bioplasticsonline.net/2010/06/starch-based-bioplastic-manufacturers-and-suppliers/ | title=Starch based Bioplastic Manufacturers and Suppliers | work=bioplasticsonline.net | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814061041/http://bioplasticsonline.net/2010/06/starch-based-bioplastic-manufacturers-and-suppliers/ | archivedate=August 14, 2011 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; or starch/Ecoflex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archive-date=2012-07-13 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713125533/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8106328/Enhancing-biopolymers-additives-are-needed.html | url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8106328/Enhancing-biopolymers-additives-are-needed.html | title=Enhancing biopolymers: additives are needed for toughness, heat resistance &amp; processability.(biopolymers)(Cover story) | work=goliath.ecnext.com | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate produced by BASF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BASF announces major bioplastics production expansion|url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2008/04/22/basf-announces-major-bioplastics-production-expansion/}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  blends. These blends are used for industrial applications and are also compostable. Other producers, such as Roquette, have
developed other starch/[[polyolefin]] blends. These blends are not biodegradable, but have a lower carbon footprint than petroleum-based plastics used for the same applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roquette, nouvel acteur sur le marché des plastiques, lance GAÏALENE® : une gamme innovante de plastique végétal|url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2010/10/16/roquette-nouvel-acteur-sur-le-marche-des-plastiques-lance-gaialene%C2%AE-une-gamme-innovante-de-plastique-vegetal/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the origin of its raw material, starch is cheap, abundant, and renewable.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Citation|last=Avérous|first=Luc|title=Nanobiocomposites Based on Plasticized Starch|date=2014|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-444-53730-0.00028-2|work=Starch Polymers|pages=211–239|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780444537300|access-date=2018-09-26|last2=Pollet|first2=Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starch based plastics are complex blends of starch with compostable plastics such as Polylactic acid, Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate, Polybutylene Succinate, Polycaprolactone, and Polyhydroxyalkanoates. These complex blends improve water resistance as well as processing and mechanical properties.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Starch-based films (mostly used for packaging purposes) are made mainly from starch blended with thermoplastic polyesters to form biodegradable and compostable products. These films are seen specifically in consumer goods packaging of magazine wrappings and bubble films. In food packaging, these films are seen as bakery or fruit and vegetable bags. Composting bags with this films are used in selective collecting of organic waste.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Further, a new starch-based film was developed by Agricultural Research Service scientists can even be used as a paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repl.2016.09.002 | title=Collaboration delivers better results | date=January 2017 | last=Cate | first=Peter | journal=Reinforced Plastics | volume=61 | issue=1 | pages=51–54 | issn=0034-3617 | doi=10.1016/j.repl.2016.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellulose-based plastics ===
[[File:Bio-K Blister CG.jpg|thumb|A packaging blister made from [[cellulose acetate]], a bioplastic]]

[[Cellulose]] bioplastics are mainly the [[cellulose ester]]s, (including [[cellulose acetate]] and [[nitrocellulose]]) and their derivatives, including [[celluloid]].

Cellulose can become thermoplastic when extensively modified. An example of this is cellulose acetate, which is expensive and therefore rarely used for packaging. However, cellulosic fibers added to starches can improve mechanical properties, permeability to gas, and water resistance due to being less hydrophilic than starch.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A group at Shanghai University was able to construct a novel green plastic based on cellulose through a method called hot pressing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Na|last2=Hou|first2=Xingshuang|last3=Chen|first3=Li|last4=Cui|first4=Siqi|last5=Shi|first5=Liyi|last6=Ding|first6=Peng|date=2017-05-16|title=A Green Plastic Constructed from Cellulose and Functionalized Graphene with High Thermal Conductivity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.7b02675|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=9|issue=21|pages=17914–17922|doi=10.1021/acsami.7b02675|issn=1944-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protein-based plastics ===
Bioplastics can be made from proteins from different sources. For example, wheat gluten and casein show promising properties as a raw material for different biodegradable polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=J. H.|last2=Murphy|first2=R. J.|last3=Narayan|first3=R.|last4=Davies|first4=G. B. H.|date=2009-07-27|title=Biodegradable and compostable alternatives to conventional plastics|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1526/2127|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=364|issue=1526|pages=2127–2139|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0289|issn=0962-8436|pmc=2873018|pmid=19528060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, soy protein is being considered as another source of bioplastic. Soy proteins have been used in plastic production for over one hundred years. For example, body panels of an original Ford automobile were made of soy-based plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1941-9635.2008.tb00292.x | title=The History of Tomorrow's Materials: Protein-Based Biopolymers | date=February 2008 | last=Ralston | first=Brian E. | last2=Osswald | first2=Tim A. | journal=Plastics Engineering | volume=64 | issue=2 | pages=36–40 | issn=0091-9578 | doi=10.1002/j.1941-9635.2008.tb00292.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are difficulties with using soy protein-based plastics due to their water sensitivity and relatively high cost. Therefore, producing blends of soy protein with some already-available biodegradable polyesters improves the water sensitivity and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bm050888p | title=Morphology and Properties of Soy Protein and Polylactide Blends | date=May 2006 | last=Zhang | first=Jinwen | last2=Jiang | first2=Long | last3=Zhu | first3=Linyong | last4=Jane | first4=Jay-lin | last5=Mungara | first5=Perminus | journal=Biomacromolecules | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=1551–1561 | issn=1525-7797 | doi=10.1021/bm050888p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Some aliphatic polyesters ===
The aliphatic bio[[polyester]]s are mainly [[polyhydroxyalkanoate]]s (PHAs) like the [[poly-3-hydroxybutyrate]] (PHB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) and polyhydroxyhexanoate (PHH).

==== Polylactic acid (PLA) ====
[[File:Mulch Film made of PLA-Blend Bio-Flex.jpg|thumb|left|Mulch film made of [[polylactic acid]] (PLA)-blend bio-flex]]

[[Polylactic acid]] (PLA) is a [[transparent plastic]] produced from [[corn]]&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/plastic.html|title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places - Smithsonian|work=smithsonianmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[dextrose]]. Superficially, it is similar to conventional petrochemical-based mass plastics like [[Polystyrene|PS]].  It has the distinct advantage of degrading to nontoxic products.   Unfortunately it exhibits inferior impact strength, thermal robustness, and barrier properties (blocking air transport across the membrane).&lt;ref name=Ullmanns/&gt;  PLA and PLA blends generally come in the form of granulates with various properties, and are used in the plastic processing industry for the production of films, fibers, plastic containers, cups and bottles.
PLA is also the most common type of plastic [[Fiber|filament]] used for home [[fused deposition modeling]].

==== Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate ====
The [[biopolymer]] poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a [[polyester]] produced by certain bacteria processing glucose, corn starch&lt;ref name="bioplastic-innovation.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mirel: PHAs grades for Rigid Sheet and Thermoforming|url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2011/06/08/mirel-phas-grades-for-rigid-sheet-and-thermoforming/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or wastewater.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Micromidas is using carefully constructed populations of bacteria to convert organic waste into bio-degradable plastics. |url=http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2011/07/29/micromidas-is-using-carefully-constructed-populations-of-bacteria-to-convert-organic-waste-into-bio-degradable-plastics/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023230713/http://bioplastic-innovation.com/2011/07/29/micromidas-is-using-carefully-constructed-populations-of-bacteria-to-convert-organic-waste-into-bio-degradable-plastics/ |archivedate=October 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its characteristics are similar to those of the petroplastic [[polypropylene]]. PHB production is increasing. The [[South America]]n [[sugar]] industry, for example, has decided to expand PHB production to an industrial scale. PHB is distinguished primarily by its physical characteristics. It can be processed into a transparent film with a melting point higher than 130 degrees Celsius, and is biodegradable without residue.

=== Polyhydroxyalkanoates  ===
[[Polyhydroxyalkanoates]] are linear [[polyester]]s produced in nature by [[bacteria]]l [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[sugar]] or [[lipid]]s. They are produced by the bacteria to store carbon and energy. In industrial production, the polyester is extracted and purified from the bacteria by optimizing the conditions for the fermentation of sugar. More than 150 different [[monomer]]s can be combined within this family to give materials with extremely different properties. PHA is more ductile and less elastic than other plastics, and it is also biodegradable. These plastics are being widely used in the medical industry.

=== Polyamide 11 ===
[[Polyamide 11|PA 11]] is a [[biopolymer]] derived from natural oil. It is also known under the tradename Rilsan B, commercialized by [[Arkema]]. PA 11 belongs to the technical polymers family and is not biodegradable. Its properties are similar to those of [[Polyamide 12|PA 12]], although emissions of greenhouse gases and consumption of nonrenewable resources are reduced during its production. Its thermal resistance is also superior to that of PA 12. It is used in high-performance applications like automotive fuel lines, pneumatic airbrake tubing, electrical cable antitermite sheathing, flexible oil and gas pipes, control fluid umbilicals, sports shoes, electronic device components, and catheters.

A similar plastic is Polyamide 410 (PA 410), derived 70% from castor oil, under the trade name EcoPaXX, commercialized by DSM.&lt;ref name="EcoPaXX"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm.com/en_US/cworld/public/media/pages/press-releases/19_10_dsm_launches_bio_based_performance_materials_for_automotive_industry.jsp|title=Home|work=dsm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
PA 410 is a high-performance polyamide that combines the benefits of a high melting point (approx. 250&amp;nbsp;°C), low moisture absorption and excellent resistance to various chemical substances.

=== Bio-derived polyethylene ===
{{Main|Renewable Polyethylene}}

The basic building block ([[monomer]]) of [[polyethylene]] is ethylene. Ethylene is chemically similar to, and can be derived from ethanol, which can be produced by fermentation of agricultural feedstocks such as sugar cane or corn. Bio-derived polyethylene is chemically and physically identical to traditional polyethylene&amp;nbsp;– it does not biodegrade but can be recycled. The Brazilian chemicals group [[Braskem]] claims that using its method of producing polyethylene from sugar cane ethanol captures (removes from the environment) 2.15 tonnes of {{CO2}} per tonne of Green Polyethylene produced.

=== Genetically modified bioplastics ===
[[Genetic modification]] (GM) is also a challenge for the bioplastics industry. None of the currently available bioplastics&amp;nbsp;– which can be considered first generation products&amp;nbsp;– require the use of GM crops, although GM corn is the standard feedstock.

Looking further ahead, some of the second generation bioplastics manufacturing technologies under development employ the "plant factory" model, using [[genetically modified crops]] or [[genetically modified bacterium|genetically modified bacteria]] to optimise efficiency.

===Polyhydroxyurethanes ===

Recently, there have been a large emphasis on producing biobased and isocyanate-free polyurethanes. One such example utilizes a spontaneous reaction between polyamines and cyclic carbonates to produce polyhydroxurethanes.&lt;ref name="From Petrochemical Polyurethanes to Biobased Polyhydroxyurethanes"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Nohra  | first = Bassam  |author2=Laure Candy |author3=Jean-Francois Blanco |author4=Celine Guerin |author5=Yann Raoul |author6=Zephirin Mouloungui  | year = 2013 | title = From Petrochemical Polyurethanes to Biobased Polyhydroxyurethanes | journal = Macromolecules | volume =  46| issue =  | doi =10.1021/ma400197c | pages=3771–3792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional cross-linked polyurethanes, cross-linked polyhydroxyurethanes have been shown to be capable of recycling and reprocessing through dynamic transcarbamoylation reactions.&lt;ref name="Mechanically Activated, Catalyst-Free Polyhydroxyurethane Vitrimers"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Fortman  | first = David J.  |author2=Jacob P.

Materials such as starch, cellulose, wood, sugar and biomass are used as a substitute for fossil fuel resources to produce bioplastics; this makes the production of bioplastics a more sustainable activity compared to conventional plastic production.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"&gt;Gironi, F., and Vincenzo Piemonte. “Bioplastics and Petroleum-Based Plastics: Strengths and Weaknesses.” Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization and Environmental Effects, vol. 33, no. 21, 2011, pp. 1949–59, doi:10.1080/15567030903436830.&lt;/ref&gt; The environmental impact of bioplastics is often debated, as there are many different metrics for "greenness" (e.g., water use, energy use, deforestation, biodegradation, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Madeleine R., and Claire Y. Barlow. “Life Cycle Assessments of Biodegradable, Commercial Biopolymers - A Critical Review.” Resources, Conservation and Recycling, vol. 78, Elsevier B.V., 2013, pp. 54–66, doi:10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.06.010.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence bioplastic environmental impacts are categorized into nonrenewable energy use, climate change, eutrophication and acidification.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"&gt;Weiss, Martin, et al. “A Review of the Environmental Impacts of Biobased Materials.” Journal of Industrial Ecology, vol. 16, no. SUPPL.1, 2012, doi:10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00468.x.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioplastic production significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions and decreases non-renewable energy consumption.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt; Firms worldwide would also be able to increase the environmental sustainability of their products by using bioplastics &lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus, Sebastian, et al. “A Crossroads for Bioplastics: Exploring Product Developers’ Challenges to Move beyond Petroleum-Based Plastics.” Journal of Cleaner Production, vol. 127, Elsevier Ltd, 2016, pp. 84–95, doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.003.
&lt;/ref&gt; Although bioplastics save more nonrenewable energy than conventional plastics and emit less GHG compared to conventional plastics, bioplastics also have negative environmental impacts such as eutrophication and acidification.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Bioplastics induce higher eutrophication potentials than conventional plastics.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Biomass production during industrial farming practices causes nitrate and phosphate to filtrate into water bodies; this causes eutrophication which is the richness of the nutrients in body waters.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Eutrophication is a threat to water resources around the world since it kills aquatic organisms, creates dead zones and causes harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, E., et al. “Eutrophication Will Increase during the 21st Century as a Result of Precipitation Changes.” Science, vol. 357, no.

Other environmental impacts of bioplastics include exerting lower human and terrestrial ecotoxicity and carcinogenic potentials compared to conventional plastics.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; However, bioplastics exert higher aquatic ecotoxicity than conventional materials.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Bioplastics and other bio-based materials increase stratospheric ozone depletion compared to conventional plastics; this is a result of nitrous oxide emissions during fertilizer application during industrial farming for biomass production.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Artificial fertilizer increase nitrous oxide emissions especially when the crop does not need all the nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;Rosas, Francisco, et al. “Nitrous Oxide Emission Reductions from Cutting Excessive Nitrogen Fertilizer Applications.” Climatic Change, vol. 132, no. 2, 2015, pp. 353–67, doi:10.1007/s10584-015-1426-y.&lt;/ref&gt; Minor environmental impacts of bioplastics include toxicity through using pesticides on the crops used to make bioplastics.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt; Bioplastics also cause carbon dioxide emissions from harvesting vehicles.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt; Other minor environmental impacts include high water consumption for biomass cultivation, soil erosion, soil carbon losses and loss of biodiversity, and they are mainly are a result of land use associated with bioplastics.&lt;ref name= "Weis et al"/&gt; Land use for bioplastics production leads to lost carbon sequestration and increases the carbon costs while diverting land from its existing uses &lt;ref&gt;Gironi, F., and Vincenzo Piemonte. “Land-Use Change Emissions: How Green Are the Bioplastics?” Environmental Progress &amp; Sustainable Energy, vol. 30, no. 4, 2010, pp. 685–691, doi:10.1002/ep.10518.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bioplastics are extremely advantageous because they reduce non-renewable consumption and GHG emissions, they also negatively affect the environment through land and water consumption, using pesticide and fertilizer, eutrophication and acidification; hence one’s preference for either bioplastics or conventional plastics depends on what one considers the most important environmental impact.&lt;ref name= "Gironi and Piemonte"/&gt;

=== Biodegradation of Bioplastics ===

Biodegradation of any plastic is a process that happens at solid/liquid interface whereby the enzymes in the liquid phase depolymerize the solid phase &lt;ref&gt;Degli-Innocenti, Francesco. “Biodegradation of Plastics and Ecotoxicity Testing: When Should It Be Done.” Frontiers in Microbiology, vol. 5, no. SEP, 2014, pp. 1–3, doi:10.3389/fmicb.2014.00475.&lt;/ref&gt; Both bioplastics and conventional plastics containing additives are able to biodegrade.&lt;ref&gt;Gómez, Eddie F., and Frederick C. Michel. “Biodegradability of Conventional and Bio-Based Plastics and Natural Fiber Composites during Composting, Anaerobic Digestion and Long-Term Soil Incubation.” Polymer Degradation and Stability, vol. 98, no. 12, 2013, pp. 2583–2591., doi:10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2013.09.018.&lt;/ref&gt; Bioplastics are able to biodegrade in different environments hence they are more acceptable than conventional plastics.&lt;ref name= "Emadian et al"&gt;Emadian, S.

The expense and time requirements of researching and testing new bio-based and biodegradable polymers have placed bioplastics at a commercial disadvantage compared to petrochemical-based plastics.

As most bioplastics are produced from plant sugars, starches, or oils, it is estimated that replacing 250 million tons of the plastic manufactured each year with bio-based plastics would require 100 million hectares of land, or 7 percent of the arable land on Earth. And when bioplastics reach the end of their life cycle, those designed to be compostable and marketed as biodegradable are often sent to landfills due to the lack of proper composting facilities or waste sorting, where they then release methane as they break down anaerobically.&lt;ref&gt;Dolfen, Julia. “Bioplastics- Opportunities and Challenges.” US Composting Council. 2012 Compostable Plastics Symposium, Jan. 2012, Austin, Texas, https://compostingcouncil.org/admin/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Dolfen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrial compostability – EN 13432, ASTM D6400 ===
The [[European Norm|EN]] 13432 industrial standard is arguably the most international in scope. This standard must be met in order to claim that a plastic product is compostable in the European marketplace. In summary, it requires biodegradation of 90% of the materials in a lab within 90 days. The [[ASTM]] 6400 standard is the regulatory framework for the United States and sets a less stringent threshold of 60% biodegradation within 180 days for non-homopolymers, and 90% biodegradation of homopolymers within industrial composting conditions (temperatures at or above 140F). Municipal compost facilities do not see above 130F.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Many [[starch]]-based plastics, PLA-based plastics and certain [[aliphatic]]-[[aromatic]] co-[[polyester]] compounds, such as [[succinates]] and [[adipates]], have obtained these certificates. Additive-based bioplastics sold as photodegradable or [[Oxo Biodegradable]] do not comply with these standards in their current form.

=== Compostability – ASTM D6002 ===
The ASTM D 6002 method for determining the compostability of a plastic defined the word ''[[compost]]able'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;that which is capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compostable.info/compostable.htm|title=Compostable.info|work=compostable.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Original research|section|date=September 2015}}
This definition drew much criticism because, contrary to the way the word is traditionally defined, it completely divorces the process of "composting" from the necessity of it leading to [[humus]]/compost as the end product. The only criterion this standard ''does'' describe is that a compostable plastic must '''look''' to be going away as fast as something else one has already established to be compostable under the ''traditional'' definition.

==== Withdrawal of ASTM D 6002 ====
In January 2011, the ASTM withdrew standard ASTM D 6002, which had provided plastic manufacturers with the legal credibility to label a plastic as [[compostable]]. Its description is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This guide covered suggested criteria, procedures, and a general approach to establish the compostability of environmentally degradable plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6002.htm|title=ASTM D6002 - 96(2002)e1 Standard Guide for Assessing the Compostability of Environmentally Degradable Plastics (Withdrawn 2011)|work=astm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ASTM has yet to replace this standard.

=== Biobased – ASTM D6866 ===
The ASTM D6866 method has been developed to certify the biologically derived content of bioplastics. Cosmic rays colliding with the atmosphere mean that some of the carbon is the radioactive isotope [[carbon-14]]. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere is used by plants in [[photosynthesis]], so new plant material will contain both carbon-14 and [[carbon-12]]. Under the right conditions, and over geological timescales, the remains of living organisms can be transformed into [[fossil fuels]]. After ~100,000 years all the carbon-14 present in the original organic material will have undergone radioactive decay leaving only carbon-12. A product made from [[biomass]] will have a relatively high level of carbon-14, while a product made from petrochemicals will have no carbon-14. The percentage of renewable carbon in a material (solid or liquid) can be measured with an accelerator [[mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D6866.htm |title=ASTM D6866 - 11 Standard Test Methods for Determining the Biobased Content of Solid, Liquid, and Gaseous Samples Using Radiocarbon Analysis |publisher=Astm.org |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-newsletter-issue-16-understanding-bio-based-content |title=NNFCC Newsletter&amp;nbsp;– Issue 16. Understanding Bio-based Content&amp;nbsp;— NNFCC |publisher=Nnfcc.co.uk |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an important difference between biodegradability and biobased content. A bioplastic such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.braskem.com.br/site/portal_braskem/en/sala_de_imprensa/sala_de_imprensa_detalhes_6062.aspx |title=Braskem |publisher=Braskem |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be 100% biobased (i.e. contain 100% renewable carbon), yet be non-biodegradable. These bioplastics such as HDPE nonetheless play an important role in greenhouse gas abatement, particularly when they are combusted for energy production. The biobased component of these bioplastics is considered carbon-neutral since their origin is from biomass.

=== Anaerobic biodegradability – ASTM D5511-02 and ASTM D5526 ===
The ASTM D5511-12 and ASTM D5526-12 are testing methods that comply with international standards such as the ISO DIS 15985 for the biodegradability of plastic.

[[Physics]] deals with the combination of matter and energy. It also deals with a wide variety of systems, about which theories have been developed that are used by physicists. In general, theories are experimentally tested numerous times before they are accepted as correct as a description of Nature (within a certain domain of validity). For instance, the theory of [[classical mechanics]] accurately describes the motion of objects, provided they are much larger than [[atom]]s and moving at much less than the [[speed of light]]. These theories continue to be areas of active research: for instance, a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics known as [[chaos theory|chaos]] was discovered in the 20th century, three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727). These "central theories" are important tools for research in more specialized topics, and any physicist, regardless of his or her specialization, is expected to be literate in them.

==Classical mechanics==
{{main|Classical mechanics|Mechanics}}&lt;!-- where is this text to go? Jan2018: String Theory=This is a theory which combines the theory of general relativity and the quantum mechanics. This theory can predict any particle, small or large. Currently, it is under developmental phase and a lot has to be done.--&gt;

Classical mechanics is a model of the [[physics]] of [[force]]s acting upon bodies; includes sub-fields to describe the behaviors of [[solids]], [[gases]], and [[fluids]]. It is often referred to as "Newtonian mechanics" after [[Isaac Newton]] and his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. It also includes the classical approach as given by [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] and [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange]] methods. It deals with the motion of particles and general system of particles.

There are many branches of classical mechanics, such as: [[statics]], [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], [[kinematics]], [[continuum mechanics]] (which includes [[fluid mechanics]]), [[statistical mechanics]], etc.
*Mechanics: A branch of physics in which we study about the object and properties of an object in form of motion under the action of force.

==Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics==
{{main|Thermodynamics|Statistical mechanics}}

The first chapter of ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' is about the [[Atomic theory#Modern atomic theory|existence of atoms]], which Feynman considered to be the most compact statement of physics, from which science could easily result even if all other knowledge was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Richard Phillips |last1=Feynman|authorlink1=Richard Feynman|first2= Robert Benjamin |last2=Leighton|authorlink2=Robert B. Leighton|first3=Matthew Linzee |last3=Sands |authorlink3=Matthew Sands|year= 1963|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics| isbn= 978-0-201-02116-5 |page=1|title-link=The Feynman Lectures on Physics}}. Feynman begins with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" vol. '''I''' p. I–2&lt;/ref&gt; By modeling matter as collections of hard spheres, it is possible to describe the [[kinetic theory of gases]], upon which classical thermodynamics is based.

Thermodynamics studies the effects of changes in [[temperature]], [[pressure]], and [[volume]] on [[physical system]]s on the [[macroscopic]] scale, and the transfer of energy as [[heat]].&lt;ref name="Perot"&gt;{{cite book |author=Perot, Pierre |title=A to Z of Thermodynamics |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-19-856552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, John O.E. |title=The Essential Dictionary of Science |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, thermodynamics developed out of the desire to increase the [[thermodynamic efficiency|efficiency]] of early [[steam engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clausius |first=Rudolf |title=On the Motive Power of Heat, and on the Laws which can be deduced from it for the Theory of Heat |work=Poggendorff's ''Annalee dere Physic'' | chapter=LXXIX | publisher=Dover Reprint |year=1850 |isbn=978-0-486-59065-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point for most thermodynamic considerations is the [[laws of thermodynamics]], which postulate that [[energy]] can be exchanged between physical systems as heat or [[Mechanical work|work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Van Ness, H.C. |title=Understanding Thermodynamics |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc. |year=1969 |isbn=978-0-486-63277-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also postulate the existence of a quantity named [[entropy]], which can be defined for any system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dugdale, J. S. |title=Entropy and its Physical Meaning |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7484-0569-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In thermodynamics, interactions between large ensembles of objects are studied and categorized. Central to this are the concepts of [[System (thermodynamics)|system]] and [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|surroundings]]. A system is composed of particles, whose average motions define its properties, which in turn are related to one another through [[Equation of state|equations of state]]. Properties can be combined to express [[internal energy]] and [[thermodynamic potential]]s, which are useful for determining conditions for [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] and [[spontaneous process]]es.

==Relativity==
{{main|Special relativity|General relativity}}
The special theory of relativity enjoys a relationship with electromagnetism and mechanics; that is, the [[principle of relativity]] and the [[principle of stationary action]] in mechanics can be used to derive [[Maxwell's equations]],&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Lifshitz (1951, 1962), ''The Classical Theory of Fields'', Library of Congress Card Number 62-9181, Chapters 1–4 (3rd edition is {{ISBN|0-08-016019-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corson and Lorrain, ''Electromagnetic Fields and Waves'' {{ISBN|0-7167-1823-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''vice versa''.

The theory of special relativity was proposed in 1905 by [[Albert Einstein]] in his article "[[Annus Mirabilis papers#Special relativity|On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]". The title of the article refers to the fact that special relativity resolves an inconsistency between [[Maxwell's equations]] and classical mechanics. The theory is based on [[postulates of special relativity|two postulates]]: (1) that the mathematical forms of the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] are invariant in all [[inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]]; and (2) that the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is constant and independent of the source or observer. Reconciling the two postulates requires a unification of [[space]] and [[time in physics|time]] into the frame-dependent concept of [[spacetime]].

General relativity is the [[geometrical]] theory of [[gravitation]] published by Albert Einstein in 1915/16.&lt;ref name=Ein1915&gt;{{cite journal |last=Einstein |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Einstein |date=November 25, 1915 |title=Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |journal=Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin |pages=844–847 |url=http://nausikaa2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/toc/toc.x.cgi?dir=6E3MAXK4&amp;step=thumb |accessdate=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ein1916&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein |first=Albert |title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume= 354|issue= 7|pages= 769-822|year=1916 |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |format=PDF |id= |accessdate=2006-09-03 |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It unifies special relativity, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], and the insight that gravitation can be described by the [[curvature]] of space and time. In general relativity, the curvature of spacetime is produced by the [[energy]] of matter and radiation.

==Quantum mechanics==
{{main|Quantum mechanics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|right|225px|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Electron configuration|electron orbital]]s shown as cross-sections with color-coded [[probability amplitude|probability density]]]]
[[File:SchrodingerEquation.svg|thumb|right|225px|[[Schrödinger equation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]]]
[[Quantum mechanics]] is the branch of physics treating [[atom]]ic and [[subatomic particle|subatomic]] systems and their interaction with [[radiation]]. It is based on the observation that all forms of energy are released in discrete units or bundles called "[[quantum|quanta]]". Remarkably, quantum theory typically permits only [[probability|probable]] or [[statistics|statistical]] calculation of the observed features of subatomic particles, understood in terms of [[wave function]]s. The [[Schrödinger equation]] plays the role in quantum mechanics that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's laws]] and [[conservation of energy]] serve in classical mechanics—i.e., it predicts the future behavior of a [[dynamical system|dynamic system]]—and is a [[wave equation]] that is used to solve for wavefunctions.

For example, the light, or electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by an atom has only certain [[frequencies]] (or [[wavelength]]s), as can be seen from the [[Emission spectrum|line spectrum]] associated with the chemical element represented by that atom. The quantum theory shows that those frequencies correspond to definite energies of the light quanta, or [[photon]]s, and result from the fact that the [[electron]]s of the atom can have only certain allowed energy values, or levels; when an electron changes from one allowed level to another, a quantum of energy is emitted or absorbed whose frequency is directly proportional to the energy difference between the two levels. The [[photoelectric effect]] further confirmed the quantization of light.

In 1924, [[Louis de Broglie]] proposed that not only do light waves sometimes exhibit particle-like properties, but particles may also exhibit wave-like properties. Two different formulations of quantum mechanics were presented following de Broglie's suggestion. The [[wave|wave mechanics]] of [[Erwin Schrödinger]] (1926) involves the use of a mathematical entity, the wave function, which is related to the probability of finding a particle at a given point in space. The [[matrix mechanics]] of [[Werner Heisenberg]] (1925) makes no mention of wave functions or similar concepts but was shown to be mathematically equivalent to Schrödinger's theory. A particularly important discovery of the quantum theory is the [[uncertainty principle]], enunciated by Heisenberg in 1927, which places an absolute theoretical limit on the accuracy of certain measurements; as a result, the assumption by earlier scientists that the physical state of a system could be measured exactly and used to predict future states had to be abandoned. Quantum mechanics was combined with the theory of relativity in the formulation of [[Paul Dirac]]. Other developments include [[quantum statistics]], [[quantum electrodynamics]], concerned with interactions between charged particles and electromagnetic fields; and its generalization, [[quantum field theory]].

'''The Centre for Advanced Structural Ceramics''' is a multidisciplinary research centre focusing on materials science and engineering involving ceramic materials for applications such as aerospace, energy and tissue engineering. It is located within [[Imperial College London]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

It was intended from conception to facilitate research between CASC-associated academics and the UK’s industrial structural ceramics community. Its stated goal is to provide a "critical mass of UK expertise in the fundamental understanding of structural ceramics that is highly relevant to key areas of the economy including, energy generation, aerospace and defence, transport and healthcare". Funding initially came through the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] but it is now funded through an industrial consortium including members such as [[Rolls-Royce Holdings]], [[Morgan Advanced Materials]] and [[Reaction Engines]].&lt;ref name = CASCsite&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/structuralceramics|title= Imperial College CASC Page|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= Imperial College London|access-date= 27 August 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CASC's work draws from skills of multiple fields, including chemistry, physics, materials and earth sciences and business. It supports the dissemination of knowledge of ceramic materials through annual summer schools, industry days, workshops and lectures.&lt;ref name = ACS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/uks-imperial-college-builds-global-advanced-ceramics-industry-university-consortium|title= UK’s Imperial College builds global advanced ceramics industry–university consortium|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= ceramics.org|publisher= The American Ceramic Society|access-date= 27 August 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">'''Christian interpolation''' is a subsidiary category of [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|scribal interpolation in manuscript transmission]]. In [[textual criticism]] the term generally refers to the specific phenomena of textual insertion and textual damage to Jewish sources text during Christian scribal transmission, but may also refer to possible interpolation in secular Roman texts, such as the case of [[Tacitus on Christ]].

==Josephus==
{{main|Josephus on Jesus}}
Notable disputed examples in the works of [[Josephus]] include Josephus' sections on [[John the Baptist]], which is widely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;John the Baptizer and Prophet: A Sociohistorical Study - Page 39 1597529869 Robert L. Webb - 2006 "2.3 The Authenticity of Ant. 18.116-19 The authenticity of Josephus' narrative concerning John the Baptist has often been critically examined. While a few have rejected it as a Christian interpolation, most schoLars have accepted it."&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Jesus of Nazareth]], which is widely regarded as at best damaged.&lt;ref&gt; Josephus: The Essential Writings - Page 265  Paul L. Maier - 1990 "scholars have long suspected a Christian interpolation, since Josephus would not have believed Jesus to be the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Testament pseudepigrapha==
Notable examples among the body of texts known as [[List of Old Testament pseudepigrapha|Old Testament pseudepigrapha]] include the disputed authenticity of [[Similitudes of Enoch]] and [[4 Ezra]] which in the form transmitted by Christian scribal traditions contain arguably later Christian understanding of terms such as [[Son of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Nickelsburg, “Son of Man.“ in [[Anchor Bible Dictionary]] 6.138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Enoch-Metatron Tradition - Page 82 3161485440 Andrei A. Orlov - 2005 "The same interchangeability is observable in the titles “son of man“ and “chosen one.” Here ... 88 Some scholars believe that these chapters might represent later interpolation(s) and do not '83 G. Nickelsburg, “Son of Man.“ ABD 6.138."&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts suffering significant Christian interpolation include the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]],&lt;ref&gt; The Lamb Christology of the Apocalypse of John Page 87 316148164X Loren L. Johns - 2003 " 2.2 Testament of Benjamin 3:8 The same sort of Christian interpolation is evident in Testament of Benjamin 3:8, where, according to Howard Clark Kee, "the major text traditions include a Christian interpolation."53"&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sibylline Oracles]] and so on.

{{Conservation status}}
 
The '''conservation status''' of a [[taxon|group of organisms]] (for instance, a [[species]]) indicates whether the group still exists and how likely the group is to become [[Extinction|extinct]] in the near future. Many factors are taken into account when assessing conservation status: not simply the number of individuals remaining, but the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, and known threats.  Various systems of conservation status exist and are in use at international, multi-country, national and local levels as well as for consumer use.

==International systems==
===IUCN Red List of Threatened Species===
The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Species are classified by the IUCN Red List into nine groups set through criteria such as rate of decline, population size, area of geographic distribution, and degree of population and distribution fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria Categories and Criteria] The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 18 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IUCN. (2012) [http://jr.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_en.pdf ''IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria: Version 3.1''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128190606/http://jr.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_en.pdf |date=2016-01-28 }} Second edition. Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK. {{ISBN|9782831714356}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also included are species that have gone extinct since 500 AD.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} When discussing the IUCN Red List, the official term "[[Threatened species|threatened]]" is a grouping of three categories: critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable.

* [[Extinction|Extinct]] (EX) – No known living individuals
* [[Extinct in the wild]] (EW) – Known only to survive in captivity, or as a naturalized population outside its historic range
* [[Critically endangered]] (CR) – Extremely high risk of extinction in the wild
* [[Endangered species|Endangered]] (EN) – High risk of extinction in the wild
* [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] (VU) – High risk of endangerment in the wild
* [[Near threatened]] (NT) – Likely to become endangered in the near future
* [[Least concern]] (LC) – Lowest risk; does not qualify for a higher risk category. Widespread and abundant [[taxa]] are included in this category.
* [[Data deficient]] (DD) – Not enough data to make an assessment of its risk of extinction
* [[Not evaluated]] (NE) – Has not yet been evaluated against the criteria.

===The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora===
[[CITES|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)]] aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival. Many countries require CITES permits when importing plants and animals listed on CITES.

==Multi-country systems==
In the [[European Union]] (EU), the Birds and Habitats Directives are the legal instruments that evaluate the conservation status within the EU of species and habitats.

[[NatureServe conservation status]] focuses on [[Latin America]], United States, Canada, and the [[Caribbean]]. It has been developed by scientists from [[NatureServe]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], and the network of natural heritage programs and data centers. It is increasingly integrated with the IUCN Red List system. Its categories for species include: ''presumed extinct'' (GX), ''possibly extinct'' (GH), ''critically imperiled'' (G1), ''imperiled'' (G2), ''vulnerable'' (G3), ''apparently secure'' (G4), and ''secure'' (G5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/Lnsstatus.htm |title=InfoNatura: About the Data: Conservation Status |website=NatureServe.org |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system also allows ambiguous or uncertain ranks including ''inexact numeric ranks'' (e.g. G2?), and ''range ranks'' (e.g. G2G3) for when the exact rank is uncertain. NatureServe adds a qualifier for ''captive or cultivated only'' (C), which has a similar meaning to the IUCN Red List ''extinct in the wild'' (EW) status.

The [[Red Data Book of the Russian Federation]] is used within the Russian Federation, and also accepted in parts of Africa.

==National systems==
In Australia, the ''[[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]]'' (EPBC Act) describes lists of threatened species, ecological communities and threatening processes. The categories resemble those of the 1994 [[IUCN Red List]] Categories &amp; Criteria (version 2.3). Prior to the EPBC Act, a simpler classification system was used by the ''Endangered Species Protection Act 1992''. Some state and territory governments also have their own systems for conservation status.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In Belgium, the Flemish [[Research Institute for Nature and Forest]] publishes an online set of more than 150 nature indicators in Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inbo.be/content/homepage_en.asp |title=Research Institute for Nature and Forest |website=Inbo.be |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] (COSEWIC) is a group of experts that assesses and designates which wild species are in some danger of disappearing from Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosepac.gc.ca/eng/sct5/index_e.cfm |title=Cosewic |publisher=Government of Canada, Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada |accessdate=2013-07-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA), it is up to the federal government, which is politically accountable, to legally protect species assessed by COSEWIC.

In China, the State, provinces and some counties have determined their key protected wildlife species. There is the China red data book.

In [[Finland]], a large number of species are protected under the Nature Conservation Act, and through the [[EU Habitats Directive]] and EU Birds Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ymparisto.fi/default.asp?node=6053&amp;lan=en |title=Protecting species |website=Ymparisto.fi |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the [[Federal Agency for Nature Conservation]] publishes "red lists of endangered species".

India has the [[Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, Amended 2003]] and the [[Biological Diversity Act, 2002]].

In Japan, the [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of Environment]] publishes a Threatened Wildlife of Japan Red Data Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodic.go.jp/english/rdb/rdb_e.html |title=Threatened Species |website=Biodic.go.jp |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]], the Dutch [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality]] publishes a list of threatened species, and conservation is enforced by the Nature Conservation Act 1998. Species are also protected through the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives.

In New Zealand, the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] publishes the [[New Zealand Threat Classification System]] lists.  {{As of|2008|January}} threatened species or subspecies are assigned one of seven categories: Nationally Critical, Nationally Endangered, Nationally Vulnerable, Declining, Recovering, Relict, or Naturally Uncommon.&lt;ref name="NZTCS08"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Townsend|first1=Andrew J.|last2=de Lange|first2=Peter J.|last3=Duffy|first3=Clinton A.J.|last4=Miskelly|first4=Colin M.|last5=Molloy|first5=Janice|last6=Norton|first6=David A.|title=New Zealand Threat Classification System manual|date=January 2008|publisher=Science &amp; Technical Publishing Department of Conservation|location=Wellington, New Zealand|isbn=9780478143645|url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/sap244.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2018|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the classification looks only at a national level, many species are unique to New Zealand, and species which are secure overseas are noted as such.

In Russia, the Red Book of Russian Federation came out in 2001, it contains categories defining preservation status for different species. In it there are 8 taxa of amphibians, 21 taxa of reptiles, 128 taxa of birds, and 74 taxa of mammals, in total 231. There are also more than 30 regional red books, for example the red book of the Altaic region which came out in 1994.

In [[South Africa]], The South African National Biodiversity Institute, established under the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/gazette/acts/2004/a10-04.pdf|title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! - South African Government|website=Info.gov.za|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is responsible for drawing up lists of affected species, and monitoring compliance with CITES decisions. It is envisaged that previously diverse Red lists would be more easily kept current, both technically and financially.

In [[Thailand]], the Wild Animal Reservation and Protection Act of BE 2535 defines fifteen [[Reserved animals of Thailand|reserved animal]] species and two classes of protected species, of which hunting, breeding, possession, and trade are prohibited or restricted by law. The National Park, Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (Thailand)|Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment]] is responsible for the regulation of these activities.

In [[Ukraine]], the Ministry of Environment Protection maintains list of endangered species (divided into seven categories from "0" - extinct to "VI" - rehabilitated) and publishes it in the Red Book of Ukraine.

In the [[United States of America]], the [[Endangered Species Act]] created the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|Endangered Species List]].

==Consumer guides==
{{Main article|Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification}}

Some consumer guides for [[seafood]], such as [[Seafood Watch]], divide fish and other sea creatures into three categories, analogous to conservation status categories:
* Red ("''say no''" or "''avoid''")
* Yellow or orange ("''think twice''", "''good alternatives''" or "''some concerns''")
* Green ("''best seafood choices''")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_recommendations.aspx | title=Seafood Recommendations: Our Seafood Ratings|website=Seafoodwatch.org | accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The categories do not simply reflect the imperilment of individual species, but also consider the environmental impacts of how and where they are fished, such as through [[bycatch]] or [[ocean bottom trawlers]]. Often groups of species are assessed rather than individual species (e.g. [[squid]], [[prawn]]s).

The [[Marine Conservation Society]] has five levels of ratings for seafood species, as displayed on their ''FishOnline'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fishonline.org/ratings | title=Fish ratings | work=FishOnline | publisher=Marine Conservation Society | accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''determinatio''''' is an authoritative determination by the legislator concerning the application of practical principles, that is not necessitated by deduction from natural&lt;ref name=Finnis&gt;Finnis, John. ''Aquinas'', 266-271.&lt;/ref&gt;  or divine law&lt;ref name=Hervada33&gt;Hervada, ''Introduction'', pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; but is based on the contingencies of practical judgement within the possibilities allowed by reason.&lt;ref name="Finnis"/&gt;

In [[natural law]] jurisprudence, ''determinatio'' is the process of making natural law into positive law&lt;ref name=Waldron&gt;Waldron, Jeremy. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1722308 ''Torture, Suicide, and Determinatio'' main page], Social Science Research Network. Accessed 22 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic canon law]], ''determinatio'' is the act by which natural law or divine positive law is made determinate in the canonical legal system as specific norms of law,&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; although the content of such law is still essentially that of divine law, which, together with canon law, forms "a single juridical system of law".&lt;ref name=Hervada34&gt;Hervada, ''Introduction'', pg. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept derives from the [[legal philosophy]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-law-theories/#PurPosLawDetTheLegMorAutForCitJudFacMadReaForAct Natural Law Theories], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, accessed 23 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be a part of discussions in natural law theory.&lt;ref name=Waldron/&gt;

''Determinatio'' is a legal doctrine in the jurisprudence of the canon law of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; It was imported from the legal philosophy of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Hervada, ''Introduction'', pg. 34 (citing ''[[Summa Theologiæ]]'' [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2095.htm#article3 Ia-IIæ q.95 a.3])&lt;/ref&gt;

The general norms of divine or natural law serve as "shaping factors"&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; and "a necessary basis"&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; for the human-made canon law, but such general norms in themselves cannot have a greater legal effect until they are made into specific human laws, since the norms of divine law are "general and non-specific".&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt;

But in the movement from the general to the concrete, there are sometimes many possibilities;&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; that is, divine or natural law can be made concrete in may different ways,&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; and all the legitimate alternatives are in line with the requirements of divine law.&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt; Wherefore the legislator must make a ''determinatio'' and "opt or choose among them".&lt;ref name=Hervada33/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3693">'''Environmental virtue ethics''' (EVE) is, as the name suggests, a way of approaching [[environmental ethics]] through the lens of [[virtue ethics]]. It is paradoxically both a very new and a relatively old or established approach. It is old or established because, as Louke Van Wensveen points out, almost all environmental literature employs virtue language.&lt;ref name="Wensveen, 2000"&gt;Louke van Wensveen, ''Dirty Virtues: The Emergence of Ecological Virtue Ethics'' (Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; It is new because it is only recently that this tendency to use virtue-laden language has been taken up explicitly and addressed through the lens of philosophical virtue ethics.

Early interest in applying virtue theory to environmental problems can be found in disparate articles in academic and environmental journals, such as Thomas Hill's "Ideals of Human Excellence and Preserving Natural Environments."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Hill, "Ideals of Human Excellence and Preserving Natural Environments," ''Environmental Ethics'' 5 (fall 1983):211-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major analysis of this approach is Louke Van Wensveen’s influential book ''Dirty Virtues: The Emergence of Ecological Virtue Ethics''.&lt;ref name="Wensveen, 2000"/&gt;

Environmental virtue ethicists take inspiration for a variety of schools of virtue ethics and from diverse backgrounds in environmental ethics. Nevertheless, there are three general approaches to identifying virtues and vices within EVE. First, the "virtue theory approach," which attempts to build an environmental virtue ethics from the ground up. Second, the "environmental exemplar approach," which looks to people who are generally considered to be environmentally virtuous as models. And, finally, the "extensionist approach," which takes traditional virtues and extends them to operate in an environmentally meaningful way.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Sandler, ''Character and Environment: A Virtue-Oriented Approach to Environmental Ethics'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007), 10-11).&lt;/ref&gt; While some authors take one of these approaches, others combine elements from two or more. 

Typical EVE topics include: the explication of specific virtues or vices; the analysis of specific exemplars who embody one or more of the virtues; the attempt to weigh in on specific environmental problems from the perspective of virtue ethics, including offering rules (“v-rules”) for conduct or making actual policy recommendations; and, of course, arguing for the theoretical foundation and legitimacy of the virtue-theory approach to environmental ethics.

Epidemic dropsy is a clinical state resulting from use of edible oils adulterated with ''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' seed oil.

[[Sanguinarine]] and [[dihydrosanguinarine]] are two major toxic alkaloids of argemone oil, which cause widespread capillary dilatation, proliferation and increased capillary permeability. When mustard oil is adulterated deliberately (as in most cases) or accidentally with argemone oil, [[proteinuria]] (specifically loss of [[human serum albumin|albumin]]) occurs, with a resultant edema as would occur in [[nephrotic syndrome]].

Other major symptoms are [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] [[pitting edema]] of extremities, [[headache]], [[nausea]], loose bowels, [[erythema]], [[glaucoma]] and [[dyspnea|breathlessness]].

Leakage of the protein-rich plasma component into the extracellular compartment leads to the formation of [[edema]]. The haemodynamic consequences of this vascular dilatation and permeability lead to a state of relative [[hypovolemia]] with a constant stimulus for fluid and salt conservation by the kidneys. Illness begins with gastroenteric symptoms followed by cutaneous erythema and pigmentation. Respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath and [[orthopnoea]], progressing to frank right-sided congestive cardiac failure, are seen.

Mild to moderate anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, mild to moderate renal [[azotemia]], retinal haemorrhages, and glaucoma are common manifestations. There is no specific therapy. Removal of the adulterated oil and symptomatic treatment of congestive cardiac failure and respiratory symptoms, along with administration of antioxidants and multivitamins, remain the mainstay of treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"/&gt;

'''Epidemic dropsy''' occurs as  an [[epidemic]] in places where use of [[mustard oil]], (from the seeds of Brassica ''juncea'' commonly known as [[Indian mustard]] ) as cooking medium is common.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

==Cause==
===''Argemone mexicana''===
[[File:Argemone_mexicana_flower_2.jpg|thumb|''[[Argemone mexicana]]'']]

''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' (family Papaveraceae), a native of West Indies and naturalized in India, is known as “Shailkanta” in Bengal and “Bharbhanda” in Uttar Pradesh. It is also popularly known as “Pivladhatura” or “Satyanashi”, meaning devastating. The plant grows wildly in mustard and other fields. Its seeds are black in colour and are similar to the dark coloured mustards seeds (''[[Brassica juncea]]'') in shape and size. Adulteration of argemone seeds in light yellow colored mustard seeds (''Brassica compestris'') can easily be detected, but these seeds are rather difficult to visualize when mixed with dark coloured mustard seeds.

Argemone seeds yield approximately 35% oil. Alkaloid content in argemone oil varies from 0.44% to 0.50%.  Argemone seeds find use as a substitute because of the easy availability, low cost and their complete miscibility of their oil with mustard oil.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

== Mechanism of toxicity ==

Mortality is usually due to heart failure, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome or renal failure and is around 5%. Long-term follow-up studies are scanty so the long-term effects of argemone oil toxicity have not been documented. It has been reported that 25% of cases will have oedema beyond 2 months and 10% beyond 5 months. Pigmentation of skin and excessive loss of hair, which lasted 4–5 months following the disease. The majority of patients completely recover in about 3 months.&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"/&gt;

'''[[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] and [[Oxidative stress]]''' : Studies in the blood of dropsy patients has revealed that there is extensive ROS production (singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide) in the argemone oil intoxication leading to depletion of total antioxidants in the body and especially lipid-soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E and A (tocopherol and retinol).&lt;ref name="pmid15715957"/&gt; There is an extensive damage to the anti-oxidant defense system (anti-oxidant enzymes and anti-oxidants) of blood. Prior, in vitro studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in AO induced toxicity causing peroxidative damage of lipids in various hepatic sub-cellular fractions including microsomes and mitochondria of rats. The damage in hepatic microsomal membrane causes loss of activity of cytochrome P-450 and other membrane bound enzymes responsible for xenobiotic metabolism which leads to delayed bioelimination of sanguinarine and enhances its cumulative toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reddy | first1 = N. P. | last2 = Das | first2 = M. | title = Interaction of Sanguinarine Alkaloid, Isolated from Argemone Oil, with Hepatic Cytochrome p450 in Rats | journal = Toxicology Mechanisms and Methods | volume = 18 | issue = 8 | pages = 635–643 | year = 2008 | pmid = 20020849 | doi = 10.1080/15376510701738439 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several lines of evidence have been shown to explain the mechanism of toxicity of argemone oil/alkaloid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Das | first1 = M. | last2 = Ansari | first2 = K. M. | last3 = Dhawan | first3 = A. | last4 = Shukla | first4 = Y. | last5 = Khanna | first5 = S.

'''Pulmonary Toxicity''': The decrease in glycogen levels following argemone oil intoxication  could be due to enhanced glycogenolysis leading to the formation of glucose-1-phosphate, which enters the glycoltic pathway resulting in accumulation of pyruvate in the blood of experimental animals and dropsy patients. The enhancement of glycogenolysis can further be supported by the interference of sanguinarine in the uptake of glucose through blocking of sodium pump via Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase and thereby inhibiting the active transport of glucose across intestinal barrier. It is well established that increased pyruvate concentration in blood uncouples oxidative phosphorylation,  and this may be responsible for thickening of interalveolar septa and disorganized alveolar spaces in lungs of argemone oil-fed rats and the breathlessness as has been observed in human victims.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;
      
'''Cardiac Failure''':The inhibition of [[NaKATPase|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase]] activity of heart by sanguinarine is due to interaction with the cardiac glycoside receptor site of the enzyme, which may be responsible for producing degenerative changes in [[cardiac muscle]] fibers in the auricular wall of rats fed argemone oil and could be related to tachycardia and cardiac failure in Epidemic Dropsy patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Seifen | first1 = E. | last2 = Adams | first2 = R.

K. | title = Sanguinarine: A Positive Inotropic Alkaloid which Inhibits Cardiac Na+, K+ -ATPase | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 373–377 | year = 1979 | pmid = 230984 | doi = 10.1016/0014-2999(79)90245-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delayed clearance''':Destruction of hepatic cytochrome P450 significantly affects the  metabolic clearance by liver,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1918795 | volume=11 | issue=3 | title=Biochemical toxicology of argemone oil. I. Effect on hepatic cytochrome P-450 and xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. | date=Jun 1991 | journal=J Appl Toxicol | pages=203–9 | doi=10.1002/jat.2550110309 |vauthors=Upreti KK, Das M, Khanna SK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eruvaram | first1 = N.

==Diagnosis==
Nitric acid test and paper chromatography test are used in the detection of argemone oil.Paper chromatography test is the most sensitive test.

== Treatment ==
Withdrawal of the contaminated cooking oil is the most important initial step. Bed rest with leg elevation and a protein-rich diet are useful. Supplements of calcium, antioxidants (vitamin C and E), and thiamine and other B vitamins are commonly used. Corticosteroids and antihistaminics such as promethazine have been advocated by some investigators, but demonstrated efficacy is lacking. Diuretics are used universally but caution must be exercised not to deplete the intravascular volume unless features of frank congestive cardiac failure are present, as oedema is mainly due to increased capillary permeability. Cardiac failure is managed by bed rest, salt restriction, digitalis and diuretics. Pneumonia is treated with appropriate antibiotics. Renal failure may need dialysis therapy and complete clinical recovery is seen. Glaucoma may need operative intervention, but generally responds to medical management.&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"/&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[File:Brassica juncea - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-168.jpg|thumb|''[[Brassica juncea]]'']]

Besides India, widespread epidemics have been reported from Mauritius, Fiji Islands, Northwest Cape districts of South Africa, Madagascar and also from Nepal. Apart from a South African study, where the epidemic occurred through contamination in wheat flour, all the epidemics occurred through the consumption of mustard oil contaminated with argemone oil.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

In these populations mustard oil is the prime edible oil by culture.

The earliest reference to argemone oil poisoning was made by Lyon,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Lyon, I. B. | title = Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence for India | edition = 1st | year = 1889 | page = 214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who reported four cases of poisoning in Calcutta in 1877 from the use of this oil in food.

Since then, epidemic dropsy has been reported from Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Assam, J&amp;K, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra, mainly due to consumption of food cooked in argemone oil mixed with mustard oil or occasionally by body massage with contaminated oil.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

The epidemic in [[1998 Delhi oil poisoning|1998 at New Delhi]], India is the largest so far, in which over 60 persons lost their lives and more than 3000 victims were hospitalized.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt; Few studies reported the findings in patients affected with this condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kar HK, Jain RK, Sharma PK, Gautam RK, Kumar P, Bhardwaj M | year = 2001 | title = Epidemic dropsy: A study of cutaneous manifestations with histopathological correlation | url = | journal = Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol | volume = 67 | issue = 4| pages = 178–9 | pmid = 17664732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after that the epidemics occurred at alarming frequency in Gwalior (2000), Kannauj (2002) and Lucknow (2005) cities of India.&lt;ref name=pmid15715957&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Das | first1 = M. | last2 = Babu | first2 = K. | last3 = Reddy | first3 = N.

==Definition==

[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] originated this term,&lt;ref&gt;Claude Lévi-Strauss, "Introduction à l'oeuvre de Marcel Mauss" in ''Mauss, Sociologie et Anthropologie'', Paris, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; where he identifies terms like ''[[mana]]'' (magical mystical substance of which the magic is formed), or ''oomph'' (American slang term for flavor in the figurative sense)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/oomph | title= ''Oomph'' definition | publisher= Thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "to represent an undetermined quantity of signification, in itself void of meaning and thus apt to receive any meaning".  Daniel Chandler defines the term as "a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or non-existent signified".&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/S4B/sem02a.html | last= Chandler | first= Daniel | title= Semiotics for Beginners | publisher= aber.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such a "floating signifier" may "mean different things to different people: they may stand for many or even any signifieds; they may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean". Such a floating signifier—which is said to possess "symbolic value zero"—necessarily results to "allow symbolic thought to operate despite the contradiction inherent in it".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Mehlman, ''The "Floating Signifier": From Lévi-Strauss to Lacan'', Yale French Studies, No. 48, '''French Freud: Structural Studies in Psychoanalysis'''. (1972), pp. 10–37.&lt;/ref&gt; In Emancipation(s), Ernesto Laclau frames empty signifier a context of social interactions. For Laclau, empty signifier is the hegemonic representative of a collection of various demands, constituting a chain of equivalence whose members are distinguished through a differential logic (as in elements exist only in their differences to one another) but combine through an equivalential one. This chain of unsatisfied demands create an unfulfilled totality, inside of which one signifier subordinates the rest and assumes representation of the rest via a hegemonic process.

==Uses and examples==

The notion of floating signifiers can be applied to concepts such as [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://caffeinesparks.blogspot.com/2007/08/race-floating-signifier.html | title= Race: a Floating Signifier? Stuart Hall speech | publisher= caffeine_sparks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gender]], as a way of asserting that the word is more concrete than the concept it describes, where the concept may not be stable, but the word is. It is often applied to [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|non-linguistic signs]], such as the example of the [[Rorschach inkblot test]]. [[Roland Barthes]], while not using the term "floating signifier" explicitly, referred specifically to non-linguistic signs as being so open to interpretation that they constituted a "floating chain of signifieds."&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt; For example, the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] is at once a signifier of the geographical nation it represents, of patriotism to that nation, of the nation's set of governmental policies, and/or of the ideologies associated with it, such as [[liberty]]. Depending on the context, the flag can carry either positive ''or'' negative significance.

The concept is used in some more textual forms of [[postmodernism]], which rejects the strict anchoring of particular signifiers to particular signifieds and argues against the concept that there are any ultimate determinable meanings to words or signs. For example, [[Jacques Derrida]] speaks of the "freeplay" of signifiers: arguing that they are not fixed to their signifieds but point beyond themselves to other signifiers in an "indefinite referral of signifier to signified."&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;

'''Glasgow Science Centre''' is a visitor attraction located in the [[Clyde Waterfront Regeneration]] area on the south bank of the [[River Clyde]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] opened Glasgow Science Centre on 5 June 2001. It is one of Scotland's most popular paid-for visitor attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-35690252 |title=Visitor numbers up at Scots attractions |publisher=BBC News |date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a purpose-built [[science centre]] composed of three principal buildings: Science Mall, [[Glasgow Tower]] and an [[IMAX]] [[Movie theater|cinema]]. The Scottish tourist board, [[VisitScotland]], awarded Glasgow Science Centre a five star rating in the visitor attraction category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glasgow Science Centre on Visitscotland.com | url=http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5,en,SCH1/objectId,SIG48295Svs,curr,GBP,season,at1,selectedEntry,home/home.html | accessdate=24 July 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004233/http://guide.visitscotland.com/vs/guide/5%2Cen%2CSCH1/objectId%2CSIG48295Svs%2Ccurr%2CGBP%2Cseason%2Cat1%2CselectedEntry%2Chome/home.html | archivedate=27 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as its main location, Glasgow Science Centre also manages the visitor centre at [[Whitelee Wind Farm]], which opened to the public in 2009.

==Science Mall==
[[File:Glasgow Science Centre from the west.jpg|thumb|330px|Glasgow Science Centre from the west]]
The largest of the three main, titanium-clad buildings takes a crescent shape structure and houses a Science Mall. In architectural terms it represents the canted hull of a ship, a reference to the adjacent 'canting basin', where vessels were brought to have the marine growth removed from their hulls. Internally, there are three floors of over 250 science-learning exhibits. As is usual for science centres, the exhibits aim to encourage interaction, and can be used or played with as part of the informal learning experience the centre aims to deliver. The building was designed by BDP.

On Floor 1, amongst the many interactive exhibits that demonstrate scientific principles, visitors can access a Science Show Theatre and the Glasgow Science Centre Planetarium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=MERO Construction website on the Glasgow Science Centre| url=http://www.merouk.co.uk/structures/2001gsc.htm| accessdate=26 April 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410114702/http://www.merouk.co.uk/structures/2001gsc.htm| archivedate=10 April 2008| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glasgow Science Centre webpage on the Science Mall | url=http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/sciencemall_4.aspx | accessdate=26 April 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509093046/http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/sciencemall_4.aspx | archivedate=9 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[planetarium]] contains a [[zeiss projector|Zeiss]] [[Planetarium#Traditional electromechanical.2Foptical projectors|optical-mechanical projector]] that projects images of the night sky onto a 15m diameter dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeiss Press release| url=http://www.zeiss.com/c12567b00038cd75/Contents-Frame/ee1fd0d05bbcc39bc1256b6f003c7d01 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130210003926/http://www.zeiss.com/c12567b00038cd75/Contents-Frame/ee1fd0d05bbcc39bc1256b6f003c7d01 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=10 February 2013 |accessdate= 26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Zeiss installation list| url=http://www.zeiss.com/c12567b00038cd75/Contents-Frame/cd498b133073712741256a76004e9e4b |accessdate= 26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an area specifically aimed at young children, called The Big Explorer.

On Floor 2, visitors can explore opportunities in STEM careers in the My World of Work Live interactive exhibition space. There is also The Lab, primarily used as an educational workshop space.

Floor 3 was refurbished in 2012 and reopened to the public on 28 March 2013. It now houses an interactive exhibition about human health and wellbeing in the 21st century, called BodyWorks. Visitors are invited to consider their bodies, health and lifestyle from a new perspective through 115 interactive exhibits, research capsules and live laboratory experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=What is BodyWorks?| url=http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/bodyworks-newsroom/what-is-bodyworks.html| accessdate=8 April 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022532/http://www.glasgowsciencecentre.org/bodyworks-newsroom/what-is-bodyworks.html| archivedate=24 September 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ground Floor of the Science Mall contains the ticket desk, cafes, gift shop, and a cloakroom. There are a number of flexible room spaces on the Ground Floor that are used for a variety of educational and corporate purposes: an education space called The Egg; a lecture-theatre space called The Auditorium; and the Clyde Suite, a multi-purpose function space. Access to Glasgow Tower for the public is also via the Ground Floor.

==Glasgow Tower==

{{main|Glasgow Tower}}
The Glasgow Tower was designed to be the tallest freely-rotating tower in the world. It missed its opening date in 2001 and was plagued by problems since then. It has been closed for over 80% of its life,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and was closed from August 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22509056|title=BBC News - Faulty tower: Glasgow's £10m white elephant|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=3 June 2013|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; until July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-28366052|title=BBC News - Glasgow Science Centre tower reopens|date=19 July 2014|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IMAX Cinema==

The IMAX cinema was the first IMAX cinema to be built in Scotland. The single auditorium seats 370 in front of a rectangular screen measuring {{convert|80|ft|m}} by {{convert|60|ft|m}} and has the capability to show [[3-D film|3D films]] as well as standard 2D films in IMAX format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Big Movie Zone | url=http://www.bigmoviezone.com/txshows/theaters/index.html?uniq=695 | accessdate=17 September 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604041706/http://www.bigmoviezone.com/txshows/theaters/index.html?uniq=695 | archivedate=4 June 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened to the public in October 2000, and premiered the first film, entitled "Dolphins", several months prior to the opening of the two other buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Millennium Commission News October 2000 | url=http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=1184&amp;d=11&amp;h=24&amp;f=46&amp;dateformat=%25o-%25B-%25Y | accessdate=24 July 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010424/http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?id=1184&amp;d=11&amp;h=24&amp;f=46&amp;dateformat=%25o-%25B-%25Y | archivedate=28 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September 2013, [[Cineworld]] agreed a 10-year lease to operate the IMAX cinema and opened a [[Starbucks]] on site.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Glasgow garden festival overhead.jpg|thumb|270px|right|View of the [[Glasgow Garden Festival]] site]]
Opened to the public in June 2001, Glasgow Science Centre is part of the ongoing redevelopment of [[Pacific Quay]], an area which was once a cargo port known as Prince's Dock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science on the Clyde |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1394637.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=26 April 2008 |date=19 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Glasgow Architecture website on Pacific Quay | url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/pacific_quay.htm |accessdate= 26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The redevelopment started with the [[Glasgow Garden Festival]] in 1988. As with the other [[National Garden Festival]]s, the {{convert|100|acre|km2}} Glasgow site was intended to be sold off for housing development, but due to a housing slump in 1987, the developers were unable to develop the land as they intended, and the majority of the site remained derelict for years. Parts were finally redeveloped for the Science Centre and also [[Pacific Quay]], including new headquarters for [[BBC Scotland]] and [[Scottish Television]], opened in 2007. The Clydesdale Bank Tower was dismantled and re-erected in [[Rhyl]] in North [[Wales]], however its spiritual successor came in the form of the [[Glasgow Tower]] as part of Science Centre complex, which stands on approximately the same spot.

The architects of the Glasgow Science Centre were [[Building Design Partnership]], however the Glasgow Tower was originally designed by the architect Richard Horden with engineering design by [[Buro Happold]].&lt;ref name="hcla.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web | title=Horden Cherry Lee Architects | url=http://www.hcla.co.uk/projects/?prorub1=ap&amp;prorub2=5&amp;pid=67

==Funding issues==
In June 2004, it was announced that about a fifth of the workforce were to be made redundant following the creation of a funding deal with the [[Scottish Executive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Redundancies at science centre |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3851349.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 July 2008 |date=29 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, the leader of the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]], [[Nicol Stephen]], stated that Glasgow Science Centre was facing a 40% cut in government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science centre '40% funding cut' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7437912.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 July 2008 |date=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] commented on this issue during [[Prime Minister's Questions]] saying, "It's unfortunate in Glasgow that as a result of the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], funding has been cut, and they will live to regret that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Evening Times News Report | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/display.var.2376867.0.0.php|accessdate= 3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although funding for the Scottish Science Centres as a whole has actually increased, it is now being split between four centres using a formula based on visitor numbers, and Glasgow is the only centre to face a reduction in budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=SNP News Release | url=http://www.snp.org/node/14009 | accessdate=3 July 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012181805/http://www.snp.org/node/14009 | archivedate=12 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the announcement in July 2008 that 28 full-time jobs were to be cut as a direct consequence of the cuts "in order to secure Glasgow Science Centre's future", according to the Chief Executive, Kirk Ramsay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Troubled science centre cuts jobs |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7487335.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 July 2008 |date=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
Glasgow Science Centre is located in the [[Pacific Quay]] area, and as such, is surrounded by the media centres that form the Digital Media Quarter, a [[Scottish Enterprise]] development initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Digital Media Quarter webpage | url=http://www.pacificquaydmq.com/|accessdate= 10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the opening of the new [[STV (TV network)|STV]] headquarters in June 2006 and the beginning of broadcast programming from [[BBC Pacific Quay]] in the summer of 2004, it can be expected that more programming will be filmed in the area.

In the [[CBeebies]] television programme ''[[Nina and the Neurons]]'', the title character Nina is a [[neuroscientist]] who works at Glasgow Science Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CBeebies Nina and the Neurons webpage | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/ninaandtheneurons.shtml | accessdate=28 April 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514133942/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/grownups/about/programmes/ninaandtheneurons.shtml | archivedate=14 May 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Nina is played by the actress [[Katrina Bryan]] who is not a staff member at Glasgow Science Centre.

[[File:Hortus Deliciarum, Der Tanz um das goldene Kalb.JPG|thumb|''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'' – Picture from the [[Hortus deliciarum]] of [[Herrad of Landsberg]] (12th century)]]
According to the [[Bible]], the '''golden calf''' (עֵגֶּל הַזָהָב '' ‘ēggel hazāhāv'') was an [[Idolatry|idol]] (a [[cult image]]) made by the [[Israelites]] during [[Moses]]' absence, when he went up to [[biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the incident is known as ''ḥēṭ’ ha‘ēggel'' (חֵטְא הַעֵגֶּל) or "The Sin of the Calf". It is first mentioned in {{bibleref2|Exodus|32:4}}.

[[Bull worship]] was common in many cultures. In Egypt, whence according to the [[The Exodus|Exodus narrative]] the Hebrews had recently come, the [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis Bull]] was a comparable object of worship, which some believe the Hebrews were reviving in the wilderness;&lt;ref&gt;The early Christian ''[[Apostolic Constitutions]]'', [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VII/Constitutions of the Holy Apostles/Book VI/Sec. IV|vi. 4]] (c. 380), mentions that "the law is the decalogue, which the Lord promulgated to them with an audible voice, before the people made that calf which represented the Egyptian Apis."&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, some believe the God of Israel was associated with or pictured as a calf/bull deity through the process of [[religious assimilation]] and [[syncretism]]. Among the Egyptians' and Hebrews' neighbors in the [[ancient Near East]] and in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the [[aurochs]], the wild bull, was widely worshipped, often as the [[Bull (mythology)|Lunar Bull]] and as the creature of [[El (god)|El]].

==In the Book of Exodus==

[[File:The Worship of the Golden Calf (Filippino Lippi).jpg|thumb|right|''The Worship of the Golden Calf'' by [[Filippino Lippi]] (1457–1504)]]
When [[Moses]] went up into [[Biblical Mount Sinai]] to receive the [[Ten Commandments]] ({{bibleref|Exodus|24:12-18|9}}), he left the Israelites for [[forty days and forty nights]]. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that [[Aaron]] make them "gods" to go before them ({{bibleref|Exodus|32:1|9}}). Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a "molten calf" and they declared: "These ''[be]'' thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." (Exodus 32:4)

Aaron built an [[altar]] before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the {{LORD}}. So they rose up early the next day and "offered [[Korban Olah|burnt-offerings]], and brought [[Slaughter offering|peace-offerings]]; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play." (Exodus 32:6) God told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses besought and pleaded that they should be spared ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:11-14|HE}}), and God "repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people."

Moses went down from the mountain, but upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two [[Tablets of Stone]], breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted collecting the gold, and throwing it into the fire, and said it came out as a calf ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:21-24|HE}}).

===Exclusion of the Levites and mass execution===
{{main|Levite}}
The Bible records that the [[tribe of Levi]] did not worship the golden calf. When Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whosoever is on the {{LORD}}'s side, let him come unto me.' And all the [[Levite|sons of Levi]] gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the {{LORD}}, the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. ({{bibleverse||Exodus|32:26-28|HE}})

"But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands. They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt', or when they committed awful blasphemies. "Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness. By day the pillar of cloud did not fail to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take. You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen."}}

The language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1&amp;nbsp;Kings are written by [[Deuteronomist]]ic historians based in the southern kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:4 where "gods" is plural despite the construction of a single calf. When Ezra retells the story, he uses the single, capitalized God.&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, 2009, pg.&amp;nbsp;116–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a more biblically conservative view offers a tenable explanation accounting for the discrepancy between "gods" in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32 and "God" in Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9:18. In both instances, the Hebrew ''[[elohim]]'' is used.  Since ancient Hebrew failed to distinguish ''elohim'' God (known as the majestic plural) from ''elohim'' gods, Biblical translations are either determined by (a)&amp;nbsp;context or (b)&amp;nbsp;adjacent verb(s). In the original account in Exodus&amp;nbsp;32, the verb is in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;person plural. In Nehemiah&amp;nbsp;9, the verb connected to ''elohim'' is singular. For the JEDP (i.e. Deuteronomistic) theorist, this inconsistency is confirmatory since the theory maintains a roughly equivalent date for the composition of Exodus and Nehemiah. More conservative scholarship would argue that these two texts were composed about 1000&amp;nbsp;years apart: Exodus (by Moses) ''circa'' 1500&amp;nbsp;BCE, and Nehemiah ''circa'' 500&amp;nbsp;BCE. The biblically conservative framework would therefore account for the verbal inconsistency from Exodus to Nehemiah as an evolution in the use of language over the approximate millennium separating the two books.

==Jeroboam's golden calves at Bethel and Dan==
{{main|Jeroboam}}
[[Image:Worshiping the golden calf.jpg|thumb|right|Worshiping the Golden Calf]]
According to {{bibleref2|1 Kings|12:26–30|NIV}}, after [[Jeroboam]] establishes the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern Kingdom of Israel]], he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites.
{{quote|
Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David. If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the {{LORD}} in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam." After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt." One he set up in Bethel, and the other in [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. And this thing became a sin; the people came to worship the one at Bethel and went as far as Dan to worship the other.}}

His concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], would lead to a return to King [[Rehoboam]]. He makes two golden calves and places them in [[Bethel]] and [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the ''[[cherub]]im'' built by [[King Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Coogan, pg. 117, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Elliott Friedman]] says "at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people." Friedman believes that the story was turned into a [[polemic]], exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott "Who Wrote the Bible?" 1987 pp 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The declarations of Aaron and Jeroboam are almost identical: 
* 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8);
* 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt (1 Kings 12:28)
After making the golden calf or golden calves both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5–6; 1 Kings 12:32–33).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=John E.|title=Retelling the Torah: the Deuteronomistic historian's use of Tetrateuchal Narratives|date=2004|publisher=T &amp; T Clark International|location=New York; London|page=2|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/retelling-the-torah-the-deuteronomistic-historians-use-of-tetrateuchal-narratives/oclc/276852204}}: "The subsequent declarations of Aaron's people and Jeroboam are almost identical: 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8); 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish views==
[[File:Book of Exodus Chapter 33-8 (Bible Illustrations by Sweet Media).jpg|thumb|The Levites killed about 3,000 Israelites who worshipped the Golden Calf (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett)]]
In ''[[Legends of the Jews]]'', the Conservative rabbi and scholar [[Louis Ginzberg]] wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in [[The Exodus|their exodus]] from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by [[Aaron]].&lt;ref name=Ginzberg&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Golden Calf'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at [[Crossing the Red Sea|passing through the Red Sea]], when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt; After seeing [[Hur (Bible)|Hur]] son of [[Miriam]] who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, [[Aaron]] was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them.&lt;ref name=Ginzberg/&gt;

Also there would be among the Israelites no [[priestly caste]], and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the [[tribe of Levi]] as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis (1909) ''The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Revelations in the Tabernacle'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic narrative==
{{tone|section|date=April 2012}}
{{See also|Moses in Islam|Islamic view of Aaron}}
{{Musa|related}}
The incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the [[Quran]] and other Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to [[fasting|fast]] for thirty days, and upon near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a scented plant to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron (''[[Harun]]'') was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names [[Samiri (Islamic figure)|Samiri]] raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"&gt;{{cite book|title=First encyclopaedia of Islam: 1913-1936|author=M. Th Houtsma|page=136|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=sP_hVmik-QYC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=golden+calf+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u5j2T4DfD4S0-QaextDwBg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samiri fashioned the gold into a golden calf along with the dust on which the angel Gabriel had trodden, which he proclaimed to be the God of Moses and the God who had guided them out of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Prophets, Their Lives and Their Stories|author=Abdul-Sahib Al-Hasani Al-'amili|page=354|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YyYS_hjKpEC&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=the+prophets+their+lives+and+their+stories+punishment+of+the+golden+calf&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4pf2T962PMbO-gaKgPHHBg&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a sharp contrast between the Quranic and the biblical accounts of the prophet Aaron's actions. The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that he had tried the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf.

Returning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites. Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness [http://al-quran.info/#7:150 (Qur'an 7:167-174]). Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his [[soul]] had suggested it to him.&lt;ref name="M. Th Houtsma 136"/&gt; Moses informed him that he would be banished and that they would burn the golden calf and spread its dust into the sea. Moses ordered seventy delegates to repent to God and pray for forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stories of the Prophets - قصص الانبياء|author=IslamKotob, Sayyed Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi|page=113|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=mXlHIskrYXEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=prophets+stories+islam+musa+the+torah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zpv2T6LpEom8-QbZsrjcBg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegates traveled alongside Moses to Mount Sinai, where they witnessed the speech between him and God but refused to believe until they had witnessed God with their sight. As punishment, God struck the delegates with lightning and killed them with a violent earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Islam: Inception to Conclusion|author=Iftikhar Ahmed Mehar|page=123|url=https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=O0gypGNaj3kC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=golden+calf+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9p32T7_iF8j0-gb7wcTaBg&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moses prayed to God for their forgiveness. God forgave and [[Resurrection|resurrected]] them and they continued on their journey.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers' sin had been [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] ({{lang-ar|شرك}}), the sin of [[idolatry]] or [[polytheism]]. Shirk is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than [[God in Islam|Allah]], or more literally the establishment of "partners" placed beside God, a most serious and unforgivable sin, with the calf-worshipers' being ultimately forgiven being a mark of special forbearance by Allah.

==Criticism and interpretation==
{{One source|section|date=April 2015}}
Despite a seemingly simplistic façade, the golden calf narrative is complex. According to [[Michael Coogan]], it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a [[false god]].&lt;ref name=coogan115&gt;{{cite book |author=Coogan, M. |title=A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its context |year=2009 |page=115 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cites {{bibleverse||Exodus|32:4-5|HE}} as evidence:
{{quote|He [Aaron] took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!" When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, "Tomorrow shall be a festival to the {{Lord}} ([[Yahweh]])."}} Importantly, there is a single calf in this narrative. While the people refer to it as representative of the "gods", this is a possessive form of the word Elohim ({{hebrew|אֱלֹהֶיךָ}} ''elo'hecha'', from {{hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}}), which is a name of God as well as general word for "gods". While a reference to singular god does not necessarily imply Yahweh worship, the word usually translated as 'lord' is Yahweh {{Hebrew|יהוה}} in the original, so at least it can't be ruled out.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;  It should also be noted that "in the chronology of the narrative of the Ten Commandments" the commandment against the creation of graven images had not yet been given to the people when they pressed upon Aaron to help them make the calf, and that such behavior was not yet explicitly outlawed.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Another understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the [[ark of the covenant]] or the [[cherubim]] upon which Yahweh was enthroned.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The reason for this complication may be understood as
:(1) a criticism of Aaron, as the founder of one priestly house that rivaled the priestly house of Moses, and/or
:(2) as "an attack on the northern kingdom of Israel."&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;
The second explanation relies on the "sin of [[Jeroboam]]," who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom’s fall to Assyria in 722&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Jeroboam’s "sin" was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to [[Bethel]] as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1&amp;nbsp;Kings&amp;nbsp;12:26–30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]], after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt; Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the [[cherubim]] of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

The [[documentary hypothesis]] can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by [[Elohist|E]] (Israel source) and originated in the Northern kingdom. When E and [[Jahwist|J]] (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, "the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light," and the worship of the calf was depicted as "polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy" (see Exodus&amp;nbsp;32:6). When compiling the narratives, [[Priestly source|P]] (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron’s guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf.&lt;ref name=coogan115 /&gt;

Alternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the [[Ten Commandments]] by [[Moses]] when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah's central shrine, the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. "The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedman, Richard Elliott |title=Who Wrote the Bible? |year=1987 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to the likelihood that these events ever took place, on the one hand there are two versions of the ten commandments story, in E (Exodus&amp;nbsp;20) and J (Exodus&amp;nbsp;34), this gives some antiquity and there may be some original events serving as a basis to the stories. The Golden Calf story is only in the E version and a later editor added in an explanation that God made a second pair of tablets to give continuity to the J story.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;177.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual Ten Commandments as given in Exodus&amp;nbsp;20 were also inserted by the redactor who combined the various sources.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'', p&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: "The conclusion – that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible – seems irrefutable ... repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Finkelstein, Israel |author2=Silberman, Neil Asher |year=2001 |title=The Bible Unearthed |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As adoration of wealth===
A metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the "gold" part of "golden calf" to criticize the pursuit of wealth. This usage can be found in Spanish&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltObtenerHtml?LEMA=becerro&amp;SUPIND=0&amp;CAREXT=10000&amp;NEDIC=No#becerro_de_oro. |title=becerro de oro |website=[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Mammon]], the Gospel personification of idolatry of wealth, is not so current.

'''Greenhouse Sports''' aims to develop social, thinking, emotional and physical skills for young people in London’s communities through sports programmes delivered by coaches.

Greenhouse Sports (originally Greenhouse Schools Project and then later Greenhouse Charity) was founded in 2002 when Chief Executive and founder, Michael de Giorgio, set up a multisports pilot to give young people on a local housing estate something positive to do in the school holidays. In 2004 the organisation then moved their programmes full-time into schools.

'''''Hjernevask''''' ("Brainwash") is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[miniseries]] about [[science]] that aired on [[NRK1]] in 2010. The series, consisting of seven episodes, was created and presented by the comedian and sociologist [[Harald Eia]]. 

The series contrasted [[Cultural determinism|cultural determinist]] models of human behavior (also referred to as the [[Standard social science model]]) with nature-nurture interactionist perspectives. Experts interviewed for the series included [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Simon LeVay]], [[David Buss]], [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]], and [[Anne Campbell (academic)|Anne Campbell]].

'''Honglujing Stele''' ({{zh|t=鴻臚井|s= 鸿胪井|p=Hónglújǐng}}) is a tablet 3 meters wide, 1.8 meters tall, &amp; 2 meters thick. It has 29 [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] characters written on it.

It is the only [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907) stele from [[Manchuria]]. It mentions the 1st king of the [[Balhae]] around 698 - 926 CE. The king listed on the tablet is [[Go of Balhae]].

This kingdom is considered [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n, or independent, depending on the nationality of the researcher. Russian and Japanese scholars classify it as an independent [[Mohe people|Mohe]] state.

It is currently located in the [[Japanese Imperial Palace]]. It was taken from [[Liaoning]] province, [[Lüshun]] city in about 1907 after the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Chinese researchers are now studying it for the first time.

It is concerned with the understanding and application of Engineering Procedures in Manufacturing Processes and Production Methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polytech-reseau.org/en/polytech-education/industrial-engineering/|title=Industrial Engineering|website=www.polytech-reseau.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-7038-3_1|title=Handbook of Electronics Manufacturing Engineering|last=Matisoff|first=Bernard S.|date=1986|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789401170406|pages=1–4|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-7038-3_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial Engineering dates back all the way to the industrial revolution, initiated in 1700s by Sir [[Adam Smith]], [[Henry Ford]], [[Eli Whitney]], [[Frank Gilbreth]] and [[Lilian Gilbreth]], [[Henry Gantt]], [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|F.W. Taylor]], etc. After the 1970s, industrial and production engineering developed worldwide and started to widely use automation and robotics. Industrial and production Engineering includes three areas:  [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical Engineering]] (where the production engineering comes from), [[Industrial engineering|Industrial Engineering]], and [[Management science|Management Science]]. The main objective for people within this discipline is to improve efficiency, drive up effectiveness of manufacturing, quality control, and to reduce cost while making their products more attractive and marketable. Industrial engineering is concerned with the development, improvement, and implementation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials, as well as analysis and synthesis. The principles of IPE include mathematical, physical and [[social sciences]] and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from the systems or processes currently in place or being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ubt.edu.sa/CE/Industrial-Engineering-Department/Overview|title=UBT &gt; CE &gt; Industrial Engineering Department &gt; Overview|last=UBT|website=www.ubt.edu.sa|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target of production engineering is to complete the production process in the smoothest, most-judicious and most-economic way. Production engineering also overlaps substantially with [[manufacturing engineering]] and [[industrial engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyons|first=William|date=|title=Life as a Production Engineer|url=http://www.acetherapist.com/Content/Life_as_a_Production_Engineer.pdf|journal=ACE|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of production engineering is interchangeable with manufacturing engineering.

As for education, undergraduates normally start off by taking courses such as physics, mathematics (calculus, linear analysis, differential equations), computer science, and chemistry. Undergraduates will take more major specific courses like production and inventory scheduling, process management, CAD/CAM Manufacturing, ergonomics, etc., towards the later years of their undergraduate careers. In some parts of the world, universities will offer Bachelor's in Industrial and Production Engineering. However, most universities in the U.S. will offer them separately. Various career paths that may follow for industrial and production engineers include: [[Plant Engineering and Maintenance Association of Canada|Plant Engineers]], [[Manufacturing engineering|Manufacturing Engineers]], [[Quality engineering|Quality Engineers]], [[Process engineering|Process Engineers]] and Industrial Managers, [[Project management|Project Management]], [[Manufacturing]], Production and Distribution, From all the various career paths people can take as an Industrial and Production Engineer, most  average a starting salary of at least $50,000.

== History ==

=== Industrial Revolution ===
The roots of the Industrial Engineering Profession date back to the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The technologies that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry including the [[Flying shuttle]], the [[Spinning jenny]], and perhaps most importantly the [[Steam engine]] generated [[Economies of scale]] that made [[Mass production]] in centralized locations attractive for the first time.  The concept of the production system had its genesis in the factories created by these innovations.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2"&gt;Maynard &amp; Zandin. Maynard's Industrial Engineering Handbook. McGraw Hill Professional 5th Edition. June 5, 2001. p. 1.4–1.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specialization of labor ===
[[File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maquina_vapor_Watt_ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|225x225px|Watt's steam engine ([[Technical University of Madrid]])]]Adam Smith's concepts of [[Division of Labour]] and the "Invisible Hand" of capitalism introduced in his treatise "[[The Wealth of Nations]]" motivated many of the technological innovators of the Industrial revolution to establish and implement factory systems.  The efforts of James Watt and Matthew Boulton led to the first integrated machine manufacturing facility in the world, including the implementation of concepts such as cost control systems to reduce waste and increase productivity and the institution of skills training for craftsmen.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2" /&gt;

[[Charles Babbage]] became associated with Industrial engineering because of the concepts he introduced in his book "On the Economy of Machinery and Manufacturers" which he wrote as a result of his visits to factories in England and the United States in the early 1800s.  The book includes subjects such as the time required to perform a specific task, the effects of subdividing tasks into smaller and less detailed elements, and the advantages to be gained from repetitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2" /&gt;

=== Interchangeable parts ===
[[Eli Whitney]] and [[Simeon North]] proved the feasibility of the notion of [[Interchangeable parts]] in the manufacture of muskets and pistols for the US Government.  Under this system, individual parts were mass-produced to tolerances to enable their use in any finished product.  The result was a significant reduction in the need for skill from specialized workers, which eventually led to the industrial environment to be studied later.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Zandin2" /&gt;

=== Modern development ===

==== Industrial engineering ====
In 1960 to 1975, with the velopment of decision support systems in supply such as the [[Material requirements planning]] (MRP), people can emphasize the timing issue (inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc.) of industrial organization. Israeli scientist Dr. [[Jacob Rubinovitz]] installed the CMMS program developed in IAI and Control-Data (Israel) in 1976 in South Africa and worldwide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kádárová|first=Jaroslava|date=|title=Education in Industrial Engineering in Slovakia|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877042814043079/1-s2.0-S1877042814043079-main.pdf?_tid=b359991c-176e-4eb6-aee1-0b4713b51767&amp;acdnat=1524330232_40bd0bc004738e78d58cb34007541ed3|journal=Procedia|volume=143|pages=157–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventies, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as [[Kaizen]] and [[Kanban]], Japan realized very high levels of quality and productivity. These theories improved issues of quality, delivery time, and flexibility. Companies in the west realized the great impact of Kaizen and started implementing their own [[Continuous improvement]] programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the nineties, following the global industry globalization process, the emphasis was on supply chain management, and customer-oriented business process design. [[Theory of constraints]] developed by an Israeli scientist [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] (1985) is also a significant milestone in the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Manufacturing (production) engineering  ====
Modern manufacturing engineering studies include all intermediate processes required for the production and integration of a product's components.{{Main|Semiconductor manufacturing}}Some industries, such as [[semiconductor]] and [[steel]] manufacturers use the term "fabrication" for these processes.[[File:Factory_Automation_Robotics_Palettizing_Bread.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Factory_Automation_Robotics_Palettizing_Bread.jpg|right|thumb|300x300px|KUKA industrial robots being used at a bakery for food production{{Main|Automation}}]][[Automation]] is used in different processes of manufacturing such as machining and welding. Automated manufacturing refers to the application of automation to produce goods in a factory. The main advantages of automated manufacturing for the manufacturing process are realized with effective implementation of automation and include: higher consistency and quality, reduction of lead times, simplification of production, reduced handling, improved work flow, and improved worker morale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gj5QBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213&amp;dq=higher+consistency+and+quality,+reduction+of+lead+times,+simplification+of+production,+reduced+handling,+improved+work+flow,+and+improved+worker+morale&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h07o74up4M&amp;sig=lNSIq_dTOKi8sFuTm-ix5HgTtks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilyYir8svaAhWQON8KHc0fCUYQ6AEIPzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=higher%20consistency%20and%20quality,%20reduction%20of%20lead%20times,%20simplification%20of%20production,%20reduced%20handling,%20improved%20work%20flow,%20and%20improved%20worker%20morale&amp;f=false|title=Perspectives on Kurdistan's Economy and Society in Transition: Volume II|last=Heshmati|first=Almas|last2=Dilani|first2=Alan|last3=Baban|first3=Serwan M.

[[Robotics]] is the application of mechatronics and automation to create robots, which are often used in manufacturing to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot). Robots are used extensively in manufacturing engineering.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://muhendislik.sdu.edu.tr/makinemuh/en/general-informations/what-is-mechanical-engineering-3585s.html|title=What is Mechanical Engineering – MECHANICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT – Süleyman Demirel Üniversitesi|last=University|first=Süleyman Demirel|website=muhendislik.sdu.edu.tr|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robots allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Main|Robotics}}

Traditionally, a major aspect of industrial engineering was [[Plant layout study|planning the layouts of factories]] and designing assembly lines and other manufacturing paradigms. And now, in [[lean manufacturing]] systems, industrial engineers work to eliminate wastes of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ubt.edu.sa/CE/Industrial-Engineering-Department/Overview|title=UBT &gt; CE &gt; Industrial Engineering Department &gt; Overview|last=UBT|website=www.ubt.edu.sa|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as [[supply-chain management]]), and shortening lines (or [[Queueing theory|queues]]) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biethapathali.blogspot.com/2017/11/blog-post_28.html|title=Industrial Engineering|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern industrial engineers typically use [[predetermined motion time system]], [[computer simulation]] (especially [[discrete event simulation]]), along with extensive mathematical tools for modeling, such as [[mathematical optimization]] and [[queueing theory]], and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. Industrial engineers also use the tools of [[data science]] and [[machine learning]] in their work owing to the strong relatedness of these disciplines with the field and the similar technical background required of industrial engineers (including a strong foundation in [[probability theory]], [[linear algebra]], and [[statistics]], as well as having [[Computer programming|coding]] skills).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is a very broad area which includes the design and development of products. Manufacturing engineering is considered to be a sub-discipline of [[industrial engineering]]/[[systems engineering]] and has very strong overlaps with [[mechanical engineering]]. Manufacturing engineers' success or failure directly impacts the advancement of technology and the spread of innovation. This field of manufacturing engineering emerged from tool and die discipline in the early 20th century. It expanded greatly from the 1960s when industrialized countries introduced factories with:

1. [[Numerical control]] machine tools and automated systems of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Mike|title=Key CNC Concept #1—The Fundamentals Of CNC|url=https://www.mmsonline.com/articles/key-cnc-concept-1the-fundamentals-of-cnc|website=www.mmsonline.com|publisher=Gardner Business Media|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Advanced statistical methods of [[quality control]]: These factories were pioneered by the American electrical engineer [[William Edwards Deming]], who was initially ignored by his home country. The same methods of quality control later turned Japanese factories into world leaders in cost-effectiveness and production quality.

3. [[Industrial robots]] on the factory floor, introduced in the late 1970s: These computer-controlled [[welding]] arms and grippers could perform simple tasks such as attaching a car door quickly and flawlessly 24 hours a day. This cut costs and improved production speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keerthitravels.com/services/agricultural-processing/|title=Manufacturing Engineer – Keerthi Travels|website=keerthitravels.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

=== Industrial engineering ===

==== Undergraduate curriculum ====
In the United States the undergraduate degree earned is the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) or Bachelor of Science and Engineering (B.S.E.) in Industrial Engineering (IE).  Variations of the title include Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering (IOE), and Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering (ISE).  The typical curriculum includes a broad math and science foundation spanning [[chemistry]], [[physics]], mechanics (i.e., statics, kinematics, and dynamics), materials science, computer science, electronics/circuits, [[engineering design]], and the standard range of engineering mathematics (i.e. [[calculus]], [[linear algebra]], [[differential equations]], [[statistics]]). For any engineering undergraduate program to be accredited, regardless of concentration, it must cover a largely similar span of such foundational work – which also overlaps heavily with the content tested on one or more engineering licensure exams in most jurisdictions.

The coursework specific to IE entails specialized courses in areas such as [[optimization]], [[applied probability]], [[stochastic]] modeling, [[design of experiments]], [[statistical process control]], [[Computer simulation|simulation]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[ergonomics]]/[[safety engineering]], and [[engineering economics]]. Industrial engineering elective courses typically cover more specialized topics in areas such as [[manufacturing]], [[supply chains]] and [[logistics]], [[analytics]] and [[machine learning]], [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], [[human factors]] and [[industrial design]], and [[service system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/academics/bachelors/industrial-engineering/courses|title=ISyE Undergraduate Courses|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/ind_eng/|title=Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IND ENG)|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/academics/bulletin/depts/ioe/courses|title=Courses|publisher=University of Michigan, Ann Arbor|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/industrial/courses/|title=Courses|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ise.illinois.edu/undergraduate/electives.html|title=ISE Electives|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain business schools may offer programs with some overlapping relevance to IE, but the engineering programs are distinguished by a much more intensely quantitative focus, required engineering science electives, and the core math and science courses required of all engineering programs.

==== Graduate curriculum ====
The usual graduate degree earned is the Master of Science (MS) or Master of Science and Engineering (MSE) in Industrial Engineering or various alternative related concentration titles. Typical MS curricula may cover:

=== Manufacturing (production) engineering ===

==== Degree certification programs ====
Manufacturing engineers possess an associate's or bachelor's degree in engineering with a major in manufacturing engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually two to five years followed by five more years of professional practice to qualify as a professional engineer. Working as a manufacturing engineering technologist involves a more applications-oriented qualification path.

Academic degrees for manufacturing engineers are usually the Associate or Bachelor of Engineering, [BE] or [BEng], and the Associate or Bachelor of Science, [BS] or [BSc]. For manufacturing technologists the required degrees are Associate or Bachelor of Technology [B.TECH] or Associate or Bachelor of Applied Science [BASc] in Manufacturing, depending upon the university. Master's degrees in engineering manufacturing include Master of Engineering [ME] or [MEng] in Manufacturing, Master of Science [M.Sc] in Manufacturing Management, Master of Science [M.Sc] in Industrial and Production Management, and Master of Science [M.Sc] as well as Master of Engineering [ME] in Design, which is a subdiscipline of manufacturing. Doctoral [PhD] or [DEng] level courses in manufacturing are also available depending on the university.

The undergraduate degree curriculum generally includes courses in physics, mathematics, computer science, project management, and specific topics in mechanical and manufacturing engineering. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the subdisciplines of manufacturing engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more subdisciplines towards the end of their degree work.

Specific to Industrial Engineers, people will see courses covering ergonomics, scheduling, inventory management, forecasting, product development, and in general courses that focus on optimization. Most colleges breakdown the large sections of industrial engineering into Healthcare, Ergonomics, Product Development, or Consulting sectors. This allows for the student to get a good grasp on each of the varying sub-sectors so they know what area they are most interested about pursuing a career in.

==== Undergraduate curriculum ====
The Foundational Curriculum for a bachelor's degree of Manufacturing Engineering or Production Engineering includes below mentioned Syllabus. This Syllabus is closely related to Industrial Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. But it Differs by Placing more Emphasis on Manufacturing Science or Production Science. It includes following:
{| class="wikitable"
|
* Mathematics (Calculus, Differential Equations, Statistics and Linear Algebra)
* Mechanics (Statics &amp; Dynamics)
* Solid Mechanics
* Fluid Mechanics
* Materials Science
* Strength of Materials
* Fluid Dynamics
* Hydraulics
* Pneumatics
* HVAC (Heating, Ventilation &amp; Air Conditioning)
* Heat Transfer
* Applied Thermodynamics
* Energy Conversion

|}
A Degree in Manufacturing Engineering versus Mechanical Engineering will typically Differ only by a few Specialized Classes. Mechanical Engineering degree focuses more on the Product Design Process and on Complex Products which requires more Mathematics Expertise.

== Manufacturing engineering certification ==

=== Professional engineering license ===
A [[Professional Engineer]], PE,  is a licensed engineer who is permitted to offer professional services to the public. Professional Engineers may prepare, sign, seal, and submit engineering plans to the public. Before a candidate can become a professional engineer, they will need to receive a bachelor's degree from an [[ABET]] recognized university in the USA, take and pass the Fundamentals of Engineering exam to become an "engineer-in-training", and work four years under the supervision of a professional engineer. After those tasks are complete the candidate will be able to take the PE exam. Upon receiving a passing score on the test, the candidate will receive their PE License .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Get Licensed|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/licensure/how-get-licensed|website=www.nspe.org|accessdate=21 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) certifications (USA) ===
The [[SME (society)]] administers qualifications specifically for the manufacturing industry. These are not degree level qualifications and are not recognized at the professional engineering level. The SME offers two certifications for Manufacturing engineers: Certified Manufacturing Technologist Certificate (CMfgT) and Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE).

====Certified manufacturing technologist====
Qualified candidates for the Certified Manufacturing Technologist Certificate (CMfgT) must pass a three-hour, 130-question multiple-choice exam. The exam covers math, manufacturing processes, manufacturing management, automation, and related subjects. A score of 60% or higher must be achieved to pass the exam. Additionally, a candidate must have at least four years of combined education and manufacturing-related work experience. The CMfgT certification must be renewed every three years in order to stay certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SME – Certified Manufacturing Technologist (CMfgT) Certification|url=http://www.sme.org/cmfgt/|website=www.sme.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Certified manufacturing engineer ====
Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE) is an engineering qualification administered by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Dearborn, Michigan, USA.  Candidates qualifying for a Certified Manufacturing Engineer credential must pass a four-hour, 180 question multiple-choice exam which covers more in-depth topics than does the CMfgT exam. A score of 60% or higher must be achieved to pass the exam. CMfgE candidates must also have eight years of combined education and manufacturing-related work experience, with a minimum of four years of work experience. The CMfgT certification must be renewed every three years in order to stay certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SME – Certified Manufacturing Engineer (CMfgE) Certification|url=http://www.sme.org/cmfge/|website=www.sme.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

=== Industrial engineering ===

==== Human factors ====
The Human Factors area specializes in exploring how systems fit the people who must operate them, determining the roles of people with the systems, and selecting those people who can best fit particular roles within these systems. Students who focus on Human Factors will be able to work with a multidisciplinary team of faculty with strengths in understanding cognitive behavior as it relates to automation, air and ground transportation, medical studies, and space exploration.

==== Production systems ====
The Production Systems area develops new solutions in areas such as engineering design, supply chain management (e.g. supply chain system design, error recovery, large scale systems), manufacturing (e.g. system design, planning and scheduling), and medicine (e.g. disease diagnosis, discovery of medical knowledge). Students who focus on production systems will be able to work on topics related to computational intelligence theories for applications in industry, healthcare, and service organizations.

Biomanufacturing is our most recent research addition.

==== Reliability systems ====
The objective of the Reliability Systems area is to provide students with advanced data analysis and decision making techniques that will improve quality and reliability of complex systems. Students who focus on system reliability and uncertainty will be able to work on areas related to contemporary reliability systems including integration of quality and reliability, simultaneous life cycle design for manufacturing systems, decision theory in quality and reliability engineering, condition-based maintenance and degradation modeling, discrete event simulation and decision analysis.

==== Wind power management ====
The Wind Power Management Program aims at meeting the emerging needs for graduating professionals involved in design, operations, and management of wind farms deployed in massive numbers all over the country. The graduates will be able to fully understand the system and management issues of wind farms and their interactions with alternative and conventional power generation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mie.engineering.uiowa.edu/graduate-program/industrial-engineering-graduate-program/research-focus-areas-industrial-engineering|title=Research Focus Areas for Industrial Engineering {{!}} Mechanical and Industrial Engineering|website=mie.engineering.uiowa.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production (manufacturing) engineering ===

==== Flexible manufacturing systems ====
{{Main|Flexible manufacturing system}}[[File:FlexiblesFertigungssystem.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FlexiblesFertigungssystem.jpg|thumb|A typical FMS system]]A [[flexible manufacturing system]] (FMS) is a manufacturing system in which there is some amount of flexibility that allows the system to react to changes, whether predicted or unpredicted. This flexibility is generally considered to fall into two categories, both of which have numerous subcategories. The first category, machine flexibility, covers the system's ability to be changed to produce new product types and the ability to change the order of operations executed on a part. The second category, called routing flexibility, consists of the ability to use multiple machines to perform the same operation on a part, as well as the system's ability to absorb large-scale changes, such as in volume, capacity, or capability.

Most FMS systems comprise three main systems. The work machines, which are often automated CNC machines, are connected by a material handling system to optimize parts flow, and to a central control computer, which controls material movements and machine flow. The main advantages of an FMS is its high flexibility in managing manufacturing resources like time and effort in order to manufacture a new product. The best application of an FMS is found in the production of small sets of products from a mass production.

==== Computer integrated manufacturing ====
{{Main|Computer-integrated manufacturing}}

Computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) in engineering is a method of manufacturing in which the entire production process is controlled by computer. Traditionally separated process methods are joined through a computer by CIM. This integration allows the processes to exchange information and to initiate actions. Through this integration, manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone, although the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. Typically CIM relies on closed-loop control processes based on real-time input from sensors. It is also known as flexible design and manufacturing.

==== Friction stir welding ====
{{Main|Friction stir welding}}[[File:Friction_Stir_Weld.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Friction_Stir_Weld.jpg|thumb|Close-up view of a friction stir weld tack tool]]Friction stir welding was discovered in 1991 by [[The Welding Institute]] (TWI). This innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins previously un-weldable materials, including several [[aluminum alloys]]. It may play an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets. Current uses of this technology to date include: welding the seams of the aluminum main space shuttle external tank, the Orion Crew Vehicle test article, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket; armor plating for amphibious assault ships; and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation, among an increasingly growing range of uses.

=== Production (manufacturing) engineering ===
Manufacturing engineering is just one facet of the engineering industry. Manufacturing engineers enjoy improving the production process from start to finish. They have the ability to keep the whole production process in mind as they focus on a particular portion of the process. Successful students in manufacturing engineering degree programs are inspired by the notion of starting with a natural resource, such as a block of wood, and ending with a usable, valuable product, such as a desk, produced efficiently and economically.

Manufacturing engineers are closely connected with engineering and industrial design efforts. Examples of major companies that employ manufacturing engineers in the United States include General Motors Corporation, [[Ford Motor]] Company, Chrysler, [[Boeing]], Gates Corporation and Pfizer. Examples in Europe include [[Airbus]], Daimler, [[BMW]], Fiat, [[Navistar International]], and Michelin Tyre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top Mechanical Engineering Companies to Work For|url=https://engineeringmanagementinstitute.org/top-mechanical-engineering-companies-work/|website=Engineering Management Institute|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many manufacturing companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) programs, such as [[SolidWorks]] and [[AutoCAD]], into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D solid modeling [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances.

[[File:Sw03.jpg|thumb|left|Screen Shot Captured from SolidWorks.]]

===SolidWorks===

[[SolidWorks]] is an example of a CAD modeling computer program developed by [[Dassault Systèmes]]. SolidWorks is an industry standard for drafting designs and specifications for physical objects and has been used by more than 165,000 companies as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZSg7xUj5tg Opening statement by CEO Bertrand Sicot at 2013 Solidworks World] YouTube Video Link.&lt;/ref&gt;

===AutoCAD===

[[AutoCAD]] is an example of a CAD modeling computer program developed by [[Autodesk]]. AutoCad is also widely used for CAD modeling and CAE.&lt;ref name="Lendio"&gt;{{cite web|title= Autodesk, Inc |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Autodesk-Inc-company-History.html| publisher= Lendio | accessdate = 21 April 2018| work =FundingUniverse| year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other CAE programs commonly used by product manufacturers include product life cycle management (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). Using CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. There is no need to create a physical prototype until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of relatively few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or non-Newtonian flows.

Just as manufacturing engineering is linked with other disciplines, such as mechatronics, [[multidisciplinary design optimization]] (MDO) is also being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process.&lt;ref name="MDO" /&gt; MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes by automating the process of trial and error method used by classical engineers. MDO uses a computer based algorithm that will iteratively seek better alternatives from an initial guess within given constants. MDO uses this procedure to determine the best design outcome and lists various options as well.&lt;ref name="MDO"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobieszczanski‐Sobieski|first1=Jaroslaw|last2=Morris|first2=Alan|last3=J.L van Tooren|first3=Michel|last4=La Rocca|first4=Gianfranco|last5=Yao|first5=Wen|title=Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Supported by Knowledge Based Engineering|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|isbn=9781118897072|pages=1–2|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/doi/book/10.1002/9781118897072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the engineering project were to design a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the manufacture of the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle or to design the intake system for the engine.

=== Drafting ===
{{Main|Technical drawing|CNC}}
[[File:Mech_2_3D.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mech_2_3D.png|right|thumb|A CAD model of a [[Mechanical seal|mechanical double seal]]]]
Drafting or [[technical drawing]] is the means by which manufacturers create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or [[draftsman]]. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions. Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Programs such as [[SolidWorks]] and [[AutoCAD]]&lt;ref name="Lendio"/&gt;  are examples of programs used to draft new parts and products under development.

Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings, but this is becoming an increasing rarity with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing. Engineers primarily manufacture parts manually in the areas of applied spray coatings, finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every sub discipline of mechanical and manufacturing engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) and [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD).

===Metal fabrication and machine tools===
[[Metal fabrication]] is the building of metal structures by cutting, bending, and assembling processes. Technologies such as electron beam melting, laser engineered net shape, and direct metal laser sintering has allowed for the production of metal structures to become much less difficult when compared to other conventional metal fabrication methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cansizoglu|first1=Omer|last2=Harrysson|first2=Ola|last3=West|first3=Harvey|last4=Cormier|first4=Denis|last5=Mahale|first5=Tushar|title=Applications of structural optimization in direct metal fabrication|journal=Rapid Prototyping Journal|date=2008|volume=14|issue=2|pages=114–122|url=https://doi-org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/10.1108/13552540810862082|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These help to alleviate various issues when the idealized CAD structures do not align with the actual fabricated structure.

[[Machine tool]]s employ many types of tools that do the cutting or shaping of materials. Machine tools usually include many components consisting of motors, levers, arms, pulleys, and other basic simple systems to create a complex system that can build various things. All of these components must work correctly in order to stay on schedule and remain on task. Machine tools aim to efficiently and effectively produce good parts at a quick pace with a small amount of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Scott|title=Machine Tools: Design, Reliability and Safety|date=23 January 2012|publisher=Nova Science Publishers, Incorporated|isbn=9781622572045|page=vii|edition=1st|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ncsu/reader.action?ppg=9&amp;docID=3021649&amp;tm=1524351344222|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer integrated manufacturing ===
[[Computer-integrated manufacturing]] (CIM) is the manufacturing approach of using computers to control the entire production process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kalpakjian | first = Serope | last2 = Schmid | first2 = Steven | title = Manufacturing engineering and technology | page = 1192 | publisher = Prentice Hall | year = 2006 | edition = 5th | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LRK59pGvDDwC&amp;amp;pg=PA1192 | isbn = 978-7-302-12535-8 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and ship building industries.&lt;ref name=saracoglu&gt;{{cite journal

| ref    = harv
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-integrated manufacturing allows for data, through various sensing mechanisms to be observed during manufacturing. This type of manufacturing has computers controlling and observing every part of the process. This gives CIM a unique advantage over other manufacturing processes.

=== Mechatronics ===
{{Main|Mechatronics|Robotics}}
[[File:FMS1_small.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FMS1_small.JPG|thumb|Training FMS with learning robot [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]], workbench CNC mill and CNC lathe]]
Mechatronics is an engineering discipline that deals with the convergence of electrical, mechanical and manufacturing systems.&lt;ref name = mech&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Silva|first1=Clarence|title=Mechatronics: Fundamentals and Applications|date=17 November 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=Boca Raton|isbn=978-1-4822-3932-4|pages=1–2|edition=1st|url=https://www-taylorfrancis-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/books/e/9781482239324|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include automated manufacturing systems, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, and various aircraft and automobile subsystems.&lt;ref name = mech /&gt; A mechatronic system typically includes a mechanical skeleton, motors, controllers, sensors, actuators, and digital hardware.&lt;ref name = mech /&gt; Mechatronics is greatly used in various applications of industrial processes and in automation.
The term mechatronics is typically used to refer to macroscopic systems, but futurists have predicted the emergence of very small electromechanical devices. Already such small devices, known as [[Microelectromechanical systems]]  (MEMS), are used in automobiles to initiate the deployment of airbags, in digital projectors to create sharper images, and in inkjet printers to create nozzles for high-definition printing. In future it is hoped that such devices will be used in tiny implantable medical devices and to improve optical communication.

=== Textile engineering ===
Textile engineering courses deal with the application of scientific and engineering principles to the design and control of all aspects of fiber, textile, and apparel processes, products, and machinery. These include natural and man-made materials, interaction of materials with machines, safety and health, energy conservation, and waste and pollution control. Additionally, students are given experience in plant design and layout, machine and wet process design and improvement, and designing and creating textile products. Throughout the textile engineering curriculum, students take classes from other engineering and disciplines including: mechanical, chemical, materials and industrial engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Portal:Textile_engineering|title=Portal:Textile engineering – Wikiversity|website=en.wikiversity.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advanced composite materials ===
[[Advanced composite materials (engineering)]] (ACMs) are also known as advanced polymer matrix composites. These are generally characterized or determined by unusually high strength fibres with unusually high stiffness, or modulus of elasticity characteristics, compared to other materials, while bound together by weaker matrices.   Advanced composite materials have broad, proven applications, in the aircraft, aerospace, and sports equipment sectors. Even more specifically ACMs are very attractive for aircraft and aerospace structural parts.  Manufacturing ACMs is a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. Composite products range from skateboards to components of the space shuttle. The industry can be generally divided into two basic segments, industrial composites and advanced composites.

The '''Institut des hautes études scientifiques''' ('''IHÉS'''; English: Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies) is a [[France|French]] institute supporting advanced research in [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]]. It is located in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] just south of [[Paris]]. It is now part of the federal [[University of Paris-Saclay]] as an advanced studies institute.

==History==
The IHÉS, was founded in 1958 by businessman and mathematical physicist [[Léon Motchane]] with the help of [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Jean Dieudonné]] as a research centre in France, modeled on the renowned [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, United States.&lt;ref name="50th anniversary"&gt;{{cite web |title=On the occasion of receiving the Seki Takakazu Prize |url=http://mathsoc.jp/publication/tushin/1203/IHES12-3.pdf |publisher=[[Mathematical Society of Japan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
{{quotation|[[IHÉS]] explicitly draws inspiration from the model of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (IAS). ... IHÉS adopted its basic characteristics - the intellectual ones - as a high level institute dedicated to basic research - and certain practical ones - such as the tradition of tea being served daily, conducive to exchanges of views. Of equal importance was the relationship between Oppenheimer and Léon Motchane (1900-1990), the founder and first director of IHÉS. As life member of the scientific committee, advisor to the director, frequent visitor and regular correspondent, Oppenheimer played a major role in the crucial early years at IHÉS. ... Oppenheimer and Motchane ... exchanged long letters and short telegrams on all aspects of life at IHÉS. ... Visits by Oppenheimer were cleverly orchestrated by Léon Motchane and reported in the press. Oppenheimer’s presence was an event in itself and his coming to lHÉS gave the Institute important official recognition. Oppenheimer was to come to IHÉS three times: from 16 to 19 September 1959, on 17 and 18 October 1961 (in Bures, although the Institute had not moved there yet), and from 14 to 17 May 1963. His last visit, planned for 1965, was cancelled for health reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihes.fr/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?document_id=3810&amp;portlet_id=1026 IHES – Oppenheimer and IHÉS (1958-1967)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The strong personality of [[Alexandre Grothendieck]] and the broad sweep of his revolutionizing theories were a dominating feature of the first ten years at the IHÉS.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[René Thom]] received an invitation from IHÉS in 1963 and after his appointment remained there until his death in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=edited by Lawrence D. Kritzman, Brian J. Reilly |title=The Columbia History Of Twentieth-Century French Thought |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |page=665}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dennis Sullivan]] is remembered as one who had a special talent for encouraging fruitful exchanges among visitors and provoking a new and deeper insight into their ideas.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The IHÉS runs a highly regarded mathematical journal, ''[[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]]''.

IHÉS celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008&lt;ref name="50th anniversary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jackson |first=Allyn |title=Grothendieck at 80, IHES at 50 |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200808/tx080800962p.pdf |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |accessdate=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 40th anniversary in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jackson |first=Allyn |title=The IHÉS at Forty |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |accessdate=March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">The '''Institute for Law, Science and Global Security [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/]''' in the Department of Government at [[Georgetown University]] was established to promote teaching and research in the area of intersection between [[international law]] and [[international relations]]. The Institute sponsors undergraduate and graduate courses and runs a Master's Program in International Law and Global Security [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/programs/maprogram/]. The Institute seeks to inform the public policy debate about the nature, role and importance of international law as it connected to issues of science and global security. To this end, it sponsors a series of specific programs including the Program on Non-Proliferation Law and Policy [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/programs/nlp/], which is jointly run with the James Martin Center of the [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]]. 

Most recently, the Institute has begun a special initiative in the area of cyber security [http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/events/disciplines/][http://lsgs.georgetown.edu/events/colloquium/cybersecurity/]. Among the participants in this initiative have been former Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[Michael Hayden (general)|General Michael Hayden]][http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=48778], Siobhan Gorman, national security correspondent of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and [[Suzanne Spaulding]], former General Counsel for the [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]. Since its creation, the Institute has also sponsored events with a variety of other speakers, including [[Paul D. Clement]], former [[Solicitor General of the United States]], [[Bill Richardson]], the Governor of New Mexico, [[Neal Katyal]], Deputy Solicitor General of the United States and legal counsel to former detainee [[Salim Hamdan]], and [[David H. Remes]], a former partner at [[Covington &amp; Burling]] and currently representing detainees in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camps]]. 

The Institute was founded by Professors [[Christopher C. Joyner]] and [[Anthony Clark Arend]], and was initially called '''The Institute for International Law and Politics.''' It is currently directed by Professor Joyner, and Professor [[Catherine Lotrionte]] serves as the Associate Director of the Institute. [[Amit Yoran]], former Chief of the National Cyber Security Division at the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and Phillip A. Karber serve on the Board of Advisers of the Institute.  From 2007 to 2009, Brendan P. Geary--previously an Associate Attorney at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP and currently an Attorney in the Department of Justice's National Security Division--served as the Institute's William V. O'Brien Fellow.

==Legitimacy==

With respect to political theory, a state is perceived as being [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] when its citizens treat it as properly holding and exercising political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilley|first1=Bruce|title=The meaning and measure of state legitimacy: Results for 72 countries|journal=European Journal of Political Research|date=2006|page=500|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6765.2006.00307.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fraser&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraser|first1=John|title=Validating a Measure of National Political Legitimacy|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1974|volume=18|issue=1|pages=117–134, 118|doi=10.2307/2110657}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the term exists beyond the political realm, as it encompasses sociology, philosophy, and psychology, legitimacy is often referred to with respect to actors, institutions, and the political orders they constitute.&lt;ref name=Reus-Smit/&gt; In other words, actors, institutions, and social orders can be seen as being either legitimate or illegitimate. When political actors engage in the process of legitimation they are pursuing legitimacy for themselves or for another institution.&lt;ref name=Reus-Smit/&gt; According to Morris Zelditch, Jr., Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Stanford, theories of legitimacy span 24 centuries, beginning with [[Thucydides]]' [[History of the Peloponnesian War]].&lt;ref name=Morris33-53/&gt;

==Theories of legitimacy==

[[File:Aristotle Politica page 1.png|thumb|First page of Aristotle's ''Politics'' ca. 335-323 B.C.]]

===Aristotle===

Some of the earliest [[#Chronology of Legitimacy Theories|accounts of legitimacy]] come from early Greek thought.&lt;ref name=Morris33-53/&gt; [[Aristotle]] is mainly concerned with the stability of the government.&lt;ref name=Morris36&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelditch Jr.|first1=Morris|editor1-last=Jost|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Major|editor2-first=Brenda|title=The Psychology of Legitimacy Emerging: Perspectives on Ideology, Justice, and Intergroup Relations|date=September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=33–53, 36}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he argues that the legitimacy of the government relies upon [[constitutionalism]] and consent, he posits that political stability relies upon the [[Distributive justice|legitimacy of rewards]].&lt;ref name=Morris38&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Zelditch Jr.|editor1-last=Jost|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Major|editor2-first=Brenda|title=The Psychology of Legitimacy Emerging: Perspectives on Ideology, Justice, and Intergroup Relations|date=September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=33–53, 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Breede&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breede|first1=Christian|title=The Challenge of Nation-Building: Insights from Aristotle|journal=The Journal of Conflict Studies|date=2009|volume=29|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/view/15240/24501}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book [[Aristotle politics|''Politics'']], Aristotle argues the ways in which rewards are distributed are found within politics, and distributive justice (the proper allocation of rewards according to merit) is what makes a government stable.&lt;ref name=Morris36/&gt;&lt;ref name=Breede&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breede|first1=Christian|title=The Challenge of Nation-Building: Insights from Aristotle|journal=The Journal of Conflict Studies|date=2009|volume=29|url=http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/view/15240/24501}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is distributive injustice, on the other hand, the government becomes unstable. Also concerned with justness and distinguishing between right and wrong constitutions, Aristotle bases legitimacy on the rule of law, voluntary consent, and the public interest.&lt;ref name=Morris41&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelditch Jr.|first1=Morris|editor1-last=Jost|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Major|editor2-first=Brenda|title=The Psychology of Legitimacy: Emerging Perspectives on Ideology, Justice, and Intergroup Relations|date=September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=33–53, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Aristotle's theory of distribution of rewards and legitimacy of constitutions both deal with legitimation, the prior emphasizes an actors acceptance that rewards are just,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=J.S.|title=Towards an understanding of inequity|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|date=1963|volume=67|pages=422–436|doi=10.1037/h0040968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=J.|last2=Zelditch|first2=M.|last3=Anderson|first3=B.|last4=Cohen|first4=B.P|title=Sociological theories in progress|date=1972|chapter=Structural aspects of distributive justice: A status value formulation|volume=2|pages=119–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homans|first1=G.C.|title=Social behavior: Its elementary forms|date=1961|publisher=Harcourt, Brace, &amp; World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner|first1=M.J.|title=The belief in a just world: A fundamental delusion|date=1980|publisher=Plenum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walster|first1=E.|last2=Walster|first2=G.W.|last3=Berscheid|first3=E.|title=Equity: Theory and research|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter is concerned with an actors acceptance of a "moral obligation to obey a system of power."&lt;ref name=Morris38/&gt;

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===

Detailed at greater length in ''[[The Social Contract]]'', Rousseau insists that government legitimacy is dependent upon the "general will" of its members.&lt;ref name=Morris41/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bertram&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertram|first1=Christopher|title=Jean Jacques Rousseau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general will itself is the common interests of all the citizens to provide for the common good of all citizens, as opposed to individual interests.&lt;ref name=Bertram&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertram|first1=Christopher|title=Jean Jacques Rousseau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people who express this general will, according to Rousseau, are those who have consensually entered into a civil society.&lt;ref name=Morris41/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bertram&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertram|first1=Christopher|title=Jean Jacques Rousseau|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, implicit consent is not sufficient for political legitimacy; rather, it requires the active participation of citizens in the justification of state's laws, through the general will of the people.&lt;ref name=Fabienne1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fabienne|first1=Peter|title=Political Legitimacy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because legitimacy rests on the general will of the people, Rousseau believes republican or popular rule is legitimate, while tyranny and despotism are illegitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=J.J.|editor1-last=Gourevitch|editor1-first=Victor|title=The Social Contract and other later political writings|publisher=The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Max Weber===

According to [[Max Weber|Weber]], a political regime is legitimate when the citizens have faith in that system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Odero, Mbondenyi, Lumumba|first1=Steve O.,  Morris K.,  P. L. O.|title=The Constitution of Kenya: Contemporary Readings|publisher=LawAfrica Publishing Ltd|date=2011|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grafstein&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grafstein|first1=Robert|title=The Failure of Weber's Conception of Legitimacy: Its Causes and Implications|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=1981|volume=43|issue=2|pages=456–472, 456|doi=10.2307/2130377}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''[[The Theory of Social and Economic Organization]]'', Weber expands upon this idea when he writes “the basis of every system of authority, and correspondingly of every kind of willingness to obey, is a belief, a belief by virtue of which persons exercising authority are lent prestige." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weber|first1=Max|title=The Theory of Social and Economic Organization|date=1964|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber provides [[The Three Types of Legitimate Rule|three main sources of legitimate rule]]: traditional (it has always been that way), rational-legal (trust in legality), and charismatic (faith in the ruler).&lt;ref name=Fabienne1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fabienne|first1=Peter|title=Political Legitimacy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pakulski35-56&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pakulski|first1=Jan|title=Legitimacy and Mass Compliance: Reflections on Max Weber and Soviet-Type Societies|journal=British Journal of Political Science|volume=16|date=1986|issue=1|pages=35–56|doi=10.1017/s0007123400003793}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Weber explains in his book ''[[Economy and Society]]'', these ideal forms of legitimacy will necessarily always overlap.&lt;ref name=Pakulski35&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pakulski|first1=Jan|title=Legitimacy and Mass Compliance: Reflections on Max Weber and Soviet-Type Societies|journal=British Journal of Political Science|volume=16|date=1986|issue=1|page=35|doi=10.1017/s0007123400003793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The example that Weber gives is with that of legal authority. Legality is partly traditional, for it is "established and habitual."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weber|first1=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that due to the presence of legitimate authority  and the way legitimate authority structures society, citizens who do not share in the belief of this legitimacy still face incentives to act as if they did.&lt;ref name=Morris44&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zelditch Jr.|first1=Morris|editor1-last=Jost|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Major|editor2-first=Brenda|title=The Psychology of Legitimacy: Emerging Perspectives on Ideology, Justice, and Intergroup Relations|date=September 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=33–53, 44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mark C. Suchman ===
In his book ''Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches'', [[Mark C. Suchman|Suchman]] defines legitimacy as “a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions."&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; He later adds to this definition, stating that because legitimacy is socially conferred, legitimacy is independent of individual participants, while dependent upon the collective constituency.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; In other words, an organization is legitimate when it enjoys public approval, even though the actions of an organization might deviate from particular individual interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; Suchman states three types of legitimacy: pragmatic legitimacy, moral legitimacy, and cognitive legitimacy.

====Pragmatic legitimacy====
Pragmatic legitimacy relies upon the self-interests of an organizations constituencies, in which the constituency scrutinizes actions and behaviors taken by the organization in order to determine their effects.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; This is further broken down into three sub-sections: exchange legitimacy, influence legitimacy, and dispositional legitimacy. Suchman defines exchange legitimacy as the support for organizational policies due to the policy's benefit to the constituencies.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues86-92&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influence legitimacy is the support for the organization not due to the benefits that constituencies believe they will receive, but rather due to their belief that the organization will be responsive to their larger interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues87&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dispositional legitimacy is defined as support for an organization due to the good attributes constituencies believe the organization has, such as trustworthy, decent, or wise.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues88&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that people typically personify organizations and characterize them as being autonomous.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;

====Moral legitimacy====
Moral legitimacy is dependent upon whether the actions of an organization or institution are judged to be moral.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; In other words, if the constituency  believe the organization is breaking the rules of the political or economic system for immoral reasons, then this can threaten moral legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Yankelovich&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yankelovich|first1=Daniel|title=A Crisis of Moral Legitimacy|date=1974|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suchman breaks moral legitimacy down into four sub-sections: consequential legitimacy, procedural legitimacy, structural legitimacy, and personal legitimacy. Consequential legitimacy relates to what an organization has accomplished based on criteria that is specific to that organization.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues89&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff1-22&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brinkerhoff|first1=Derick|title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedural legitimacy can be obtained by an organization by adhering to socially formalized and accepted procedures (e.g. regulatory oversight).&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff4&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brinkerhoff|first1=Derick|title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of structural legitimacy, people view an organization as legitimate because its structural characteristics allow it to do specific kinds of work.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidhues89"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff4/&gt;  Suchman refers to this organization as being the "right organization for the job."&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; Lastly, personal legitimacy refers to legitimacy that is derived from the charisma of individual leaders.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues90&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92, 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff5&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brinkerhoff|first1=Derick|title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22, 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive legitimacy====
Cognitive legitimacy is created when an organization pursues goals that society deems to be proper and desirable.&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff5/&gt; Constituency support for the organization is not due to self-interest, but rather due to its taken-for-granted character.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sun|first1=William|last2=Louche|first2=Céline|last3=Pérez|first3=Roland|title=Finance and Sustainability: Towards a New Paradigm? A Post-Crisis Agenda|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|date=2011|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an organization has reached this taken-for-granted status, an organization is beyond dissent.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; While moral and pragmatic legitimacy deal with some form of evaluation, cognitive legitimacy does not. Instead, with cognitive legitimacy society accepts these organizations as being necessary or inevitable.&lt;ref name=Chaison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff6&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brinkerhoff|first1=Derick|title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German sociologist and philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] was the first to use the term "legitimation crisis," which he defined in ''[[Legitimation Crisis (book)|Legitimation Crisis]]'', his 1973 book of the same name.&lt;ref name="Habermas"/&gt; A ''legitimation crisis'' is an identity crisis that results from a loss of confidence in administrative institutions, which occurs despite the fact that they still retain legal authority by which to govern.&lt;ref name="Scambler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scambler|first1=Graham|title=Habermas and Crisis Tendencies|url=http://www.grahamscambler.com/habermas-and-crises-tendencies/|website=Graham Scambler Discover Society Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a legitimation crisis, governing structures are unable to demonstrate that their practical functions fulfill the role for which they were instituted.&lt;ref name="Scambler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scambler|first1=Graham|title=Habermas and Crisis Tendencies|url=http://www.grahamscambler.com/habermas-and-crises-tendencies/|website=Graham Scambler Discover Society Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas46-48"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[crisis]] is a state of jeopardy that arises because of contradicting motivations of the subsystems within a self-enclosed system.&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Michael Geerin|title=Legitimation Crisis: Jürgen Habermas|url=http://www.ppanda.us/2011/11/legitimation-crisis-jurgen-habermas.html|website=PP and A: Philosophy, Art, and History|publisher=Loyola University Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Habermas, the definition of crisis used in the social sciences is often based on the principles of [[systems theory]].&lt;ref name="Habermas2-3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argues that a crisis is properly understood in two dimensions, the objective and the subjective, though this connection has been difficult to grasp using conventional approaches such as systems theory or [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]].&lt;ref name="Habermas2-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giddens"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giddens|first1=Anthony|title=Review Essay: Habermas's Social and Political Theory|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1977|volume=83|issue=1|pages=198–212|jstor=2777774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between social integration and system integration helps distinguish between the objective and subjective components of crises.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social integration]] refers to what Habermas calls the "life-world," a term adapted from the writings of [[Alfred Schutz]], which is composed of a consensual foundation of shared understandings, including norms and values, upon which a society is built.&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Michael Geerin|title=Legitimation Crisis: Jürgen Habermas|url=http://www.ppanda.us/2011/11/legitimation-crisis-jurgen-habermas.html|website=PP and A: Philosophy, Art, and History|publisher=Loyola University Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Arthur W.|title=Notes on Habermas: Lifeworld and System|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~frank/habermas.html|website=University of Calgary: Department of Sociology|publisher=University of Calgary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snow"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schweickart|first1=David|article=Reading Legitimation Crisis During the Meltdown|editor1-last=Snow|editor1-first=Nancy E.|title=Social Philosophy Today: Poverty, Justice, and Markets|publisher=Philosophy Documentation Center|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[System integration]], alternatively, refers to the determinants of a society, which break down when their structures "allow fewer possibilities for problem solving than are necessary to the[ir] continued existence[s]."&lt;ref name="Habermas2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles of rationalization are efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control, which are characteristic of systems as Habermas refers to them.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frank|first1=Arthur W.|title=Notes on Habermas: Lifeworld and System|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~frank/habermas.html|website=University of Calgary: Department of Sociology|publisher=University of Calgary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a social system exist three subsystems: the economic, the political, and the socio-cultural.&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Michael Geerin|title=Legitimation Crisis: Jürgen Habermas|url=http://www.ppanda.us/2011/11/legitimation-crisis-jurgen-habermas.html|website=PP and A: Philosophy, Art, and History|publisher=Loyola University Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas5"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsystem that assumes functional primacy in a society is determined by the type of social formation that exists in the society.&lt;ref name="Habermas17-18"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four types of social formations can potentially characterize a social system: primitive, traditional, capitalist (liberal and advanced/organized capitalist), and post-capitalist.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these, with the exception of the primitive, is a class-based society.&lt;ref name="Habermas17"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''principle of organization'' of a social system determines when crises occur and what type of crisis predominates in each type of social system.&lt;ref name="Habermas16-17"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Liberal [[capitalism]]'' has its principle of organization in the "relationship of wage labor and capital, which is anchored in the system of bourgeois civil law."&lt;ref name="gutierrez"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Michael Geerin|title=Legitimation Crisis: Jürgen Habermas|url=http://www.ppanda.us/2011/11/legitimation-crisis-jurgen-habermas.html|website=PP and A: Philosophy, Art, and History|publisher=Loyola University Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas20"/&gt; One of the facets of this social formation is the "political anonymization of class rule," which results in the socially dominant class having to convince itself that it no longer rules.&lt;ref name="Habermas22"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argues that it is for this reason that unconstrained communication is imperative to social progress, since analysis and critique of the bourgeois society is one way to "unmask" these ideologies and cause the bourgeois to confront the contradiction between the idea and reality of its society.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crises in liberal capitalism arise through unresolved economic steering problems.&lt;ref name="Habermas24"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, markets steer the social formation not only through the use of money and power but through ideology, although they appear to be anonymous and unpolitical entities.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Dave|title=Reading Guide to Habermas, J (1976) Legitimation Crisis, London: Heinemann Educational Books (Trans. and intro. by Thomas McCarthy)|url=http://www.arasite.org/hablc.htm|website=Dave Harris &amp; Colleagues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legitimation crisis tendencies===

The political subsystem of the social world requires an input of mass loyalty in order to produce an output, which consists of legitimate administrative decisions that are executed by the state.&lt;ref name="Habermas46"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''rationality crisis'' is an output crisis that occurs when the state fails to meet the demands of the economy.&lt;ref name="Scambler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scambler|first1=Graham|title=Habermas and Crisis Tendencies|url=http://www.grahamscambler.com/habermas-and-crises-tendencies/|website=Graham Scambler Discover Society Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermas46-48"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|pages=46–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''legitimation crisis'', on the other hand, is an input crisis that occurs when "the legitimation system does not succeed in maintaining the requisite level of mass loyalty."&lt;ref name="Habermas46"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an identity crisis in which administrations are unable to establish normative structures to the extent required for the entire system to function properly.&lt;ref name="Habermas47"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habermas|first1=Jürgen|title=Legitimation Crisis|date=1975|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the state suffers a loss of support by the public when the electorate judges its administration unaccountable.&lt;ref name="Scambler"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scambler|first1=Graham|title=Habermas and Crisis Tendencies|url=http://www.grahamscambler.com/habermas-and-crises-tendencies/|website=Graham Scambler Discover Society Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hohendah|first1=Peter Uwe|title=Critical Theory, Public Sphere and Culture.

==Historical examples==
In the past, there have been many examples of social upheaval and systemic power exchanges that can be classified as legitimation crises.  According to Habermas, these crises have all occurred as a natural consequence of society's productive advancement, as the social system struggles to adapt to the strains on relations of production.  In other words, as a society's "technical knowledge" advances, the equilibrium is disturbed between the technical and political aspects of production, which can result in a crisis if the imbalance isn't corrected by adequate advancement of "moral-practical knowledge." &lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owen|first1=David|title=Between Reason and History: Habermas and the Idea of Progress|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A prime example of this is in the process of [[industrialization]], where the establishment of factories and massive workforces often precedes the establishment of government regulations, workers' rights and labor unions.  As sociologist [[Robert K. Merton|Robert Merton]] explains, a group is most successful and stable when it is satisfied by the achievement of its institutional goals (technical/forces of production) and also with the institutional norms and regulations condoned to achieve those goals (moral-practical/relations of production).  Therefore, in order to maintain legitimacy, a society, constituted by both the government and the governed,  must engage in an ongoing and competitive reevaluation of its goals and norms to ensure they continue to satisfy the society's needs.  The establishment of new social movements is essential to this process.

Historically, the most stable societies have been those that enjoy widespread acceptance of both the society's institutional goals and the means used to achieve them.  In contrast, every crisis of legitimacy has occurred when a large and/or important portion of a society strongly disagrees with some or all aspects of the institutional norms, as established and advanced by a particular regime or government.&lt;ref name="Merton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert|title=Social Structure and Anomie|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1938|volume=3|pages=672–682|doi=10.2307/2084686}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a government loses support, in this regard, it risks losing its legitimacy, as the public begins to question and doubt the grounds upon which the government's claim to power is built.&lt;ref name="Zhong201-221"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=201–221|doi=10.1080/00472339680000131}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In dealing with these crises, individuals and groups of individuals in the society resort to various modes of adjustment or adaptation.&lt;ref name="Merton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert|title=Social Structure and Anomie|journal=American Sociological Review|date=1938|volume=3|pages=672–682|doi=10.2307/2084686}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, these have usually cropped up in the form of revolutions, coups and wars.

Additionally, it is important to note that the logic of legitimation strongly depends on the system of domination deployed.  In fact, it's the logic of legitimation that informs the concrete ways citizens and subjects comply to authority and/or contend with authority.  In other words, the basis for any claim to legitimacy is often the basis for resistance against that same claim to legitimacy.  For example, in some societies the economic achievements under a particular regime or government form the basis for its legitimation claims; in those societies, counterclaims to legitimacy will often highlight economic failures in order to strategically undermine the regime or government's authority.&lt;ref name="Shue"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shue|first1=Vivienne|title=State and Society in 21st-Century China|date=2004|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|location=New York|pages=27–28|chapter=Legitimacy crisis in China?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Weber, who first advanced this point, summarizes it below:

::every...system [of domination] attempts to establish and to cultivate the belief in its legitimacy.  But according to the kind of legitimacy which is claimed, the type of obedience, the kind of administrative staff developed to guarantee it, and the mode of exercising authority, will all differ fundamentally.&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weber|first1=Max|title=Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology|date=1978|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolutionary France===
The events of the [[French Revolution]], from 1789 to 1799, and the socio-political changes that it comprised can be classified as a legitimation crisis.  The revolution was characteristic of a time in Europe where the divine right of monarchical rule was being undermined and transformed as the universal rights of the common citizen were emphasized instead.&lt;ref name="How187"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=How|first1=Alan|title=Habermas, History and Social Evolution: Moral Learning and the Trial of Louis XVI|journal=Sociology|date=February 2001|volume=35|pages=187|doi=10.1177/0038038501035001011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the mythological world views that underpinned the governing institutions of law and that bound popular conceptions of morality were replaced with more rational ones.&lt;ref name="How186"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=How|first1=Alan|title=Habermas, History and Social Evolution: Moral Learning and the Trial of Louis XVI|journal=Sociology|date=February 2001|volume=35|pages=186|doi=10.1177/0038038501035001011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===

The legitimation crisis in China took place after decades of power struggles and cultural shifts that had been in effect since the 1960s. The legitimation crisis, itself, was the result of several economic and political reforms made by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) as part of an effort to salvage their reputation after the [[socialism|socialist]] policies and [[populism|populist]] leadership of [[Mao Zedong]] in the 60s and 70s had left the Chinese economy in poor condition.

During Mao's rule, an informal [[social contract]] was established, in which the government would supply socialist benefits (e.g. egalitarianism, food and shelter, medical care, education, job security, stable prices, social stability, and elimination of social evils) in return for the public's acquiescence to one-party rule and the loss of some civil liberties and political rights.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=History.com Staff|title=Cultural Revolution|url=http://history.com/topics/cultural-revolution|publisher=A+E Networks|website=history.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the midst of the a time referred to as the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, the social contract was put in jeopardy as political and social stability faded.&lt;ref name="Zhong5-6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When Mao died in 1976, a brief crisis of legitimation followed, as the cult of personality died with him and the CPC was left without its last strong grounds for authority. Since the party's core socialist policies had also failed, in order to regain and maintain legitimacy the party was forced to shift away from its longstanding focus on Marxist ideology, economic socialism, and charismatic appeals to focusing on political and economic rationalization and legalization instead.&lt;ref name="Zhong7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=7|doi=10.1080/00472339680000131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's economic achievements (e.g. improved standard of living, growth and development) under its newly liberalized policies became the primary evidence of its legitimacy. In essence, the reforms were a solid move away from a control-oriented economy towards a more market-oriented, capitalist one.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dickson|first1=Bruce J.|editor1-last=Gries|editor1-first=Peter Hays|editor2-last=Rosen|editor2-first=Stanley|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|location=New York City|pages=141|title=Dilemmas of Party adaptation: The CCP's strategies for survival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPC faced a new legitimation crisis with the move toward capitalism, as it violated the terms of the previously established social contract (inflation rose, the income gap widened, job insecurity increased, social welfare programs deteriorated and social evils returned) and the CPC's claim to one-party rule was challenged, as the public began to wonder why they were necessary as a party if socialism had failed and capitalism was the answer;&lt;ref name="Zhong9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=9|doi=10.1080/00472339680000131}}&lt;/ref&gt; after all, the CPC's leaders were not the most qualified to exercise market-oriented economic reforms. The shift towards capitalist policies coupled with the CPC's inability to accommodate increased pressure for political liberalization and democratization eventually culminated in the Chinese democracy movement and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.&lt;ref name="Zhong1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhong|first1=Yang|title=Legitimacy Crisis and Legitimation in China|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|date=1996|volume=26|pages=1|doi=10.1080/00472339680000131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postcolonial Africa===
In the twentieth-century, as African states adjusted to postcolonial independence, legitimation crises and state collapse were constant threats.&lt;ref name="Zartman1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zartman|first1=I. William|title=Collapsed States: The Disintegration and Restoration of Legitimate Authority|date=1995|publisher=Lynne Reinner Publishers, Inc.|location=Colorado|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While authority was passed from colonial to independent rule successfully in most African states throughout the continent, some attempts at transition resulted in collapse.  In Congo, for example, the state collapsed as its respective institutions (e.g. army, executives, local governments, populations) refused to recognize each other's authority and work together.&lt;ref name="Zartman2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zartman|first1=I. William|title=Collapsed States: The Disintegration and Restoration of Legitimate Authority|date=1995|publisher=Lynne Reinner Publishers, Inc.|location=Colorado|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It took international intervention and the installation of a strongman with foreign connivance to reconstitute the state there.

[[File:JStalin Secretary general CCCP 1942.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseph Stalin]]'s brand of communism successfully took hold due to a combination of terror and charisma.]]

In other African countries, state collapse was not a strictly postcolonial issue, as most states had some success transferring between regimes.  Problems arose, however, when second-generation (and later) regimes began overthrowing original nationalist ones.  Chad, Uganda, and Ghana are all instances of this happening – in each, a successfully established, but dysfunctional independent regime was replaced by a military regime that managed to concentrate power, but failed to effectively wield it.  Legitimation crises and state collapse soon followed.&lt;ref name="Zartman3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zartman|first1=I. William|title=Collapsed States: The Disintegration and Restoration of Legitimate Authority|date=1995|publisher=Lynne Reinner Publishers, Inc.|location=Colorado|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Europe===
In Eastern European countries where [[Stalinism]] was the system of domination, the legitimacy of the system was dependent on the instillment of fear among citizens and the charisma of the state leader.&lt;ref name="Heller141"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Agnes|editor1-last=Tismaneanu|editor1-first=Vladimir|title=Legitimation Deficit and Legitimation Crisis in East European Socieites|date=2009|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Paul G.|title=Eastern Europe: Political Crisis and Legitimation|date=1984|publisher=Croom Held Australia Pty Ltd|location=Australia|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the strategy that worked for [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], himself, in the Soviet Union, as his brand of terror and charisma inspired a strong personality cult that placed authority and legitimacy in Stalin's hands alone.&lt;ref name="Heller142"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Agnes|editor1-last=Tismaneanu|editor1-first=Vladimir|title=Legitimation Deficit and Legitimation Crisis in East European Socieites|date=2009|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; For other Eastern European states, however, Soviet [[communism]] was a foreign system that had to be imported.  This proved to be a major problem, as the communist leaders in other Eastern European states lacked Stalin's charisma.

Furthermore, communism was implemented in other East European states (e.g. Romania, Hungary, Poland) in a much shorter time frame and developed very differently from the way it did in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Heller143"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Agnes|editor1-last=Tismaneanu|editor1-first=Vladimir|title=Legitimation Deficit and Legitimation Crisis in East European Socieites|date=2009|publisher=Central European University Press|location=Budapest|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hungary, for example, the communist party initially came to power via tacit consent to a coalition government. Over time, the party began to strategically gain more power and get rid of competition.

==Contemporary examples==

===Tunisia===

[[File:Zine El Abidine Ben Ali 2.jpg|thumb|Ben Ali, former president of Tunisia, was deposed by the Tunisian people when the Arab Spring began in his state in late 2010.]]

The [[Tunisian Revolution]] began with the self-immolation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] on December 17, 2010, although it is also possible to consider the miner strike in the west central town of Gafsa in 2008 to be the official beginning of the movement.&lt;ref name="Promises132"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Promises and Challenges: The Tunisian Revolution of 2010-2011|journal=National Lawyers Guild Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=68|issue=3|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Tunisian people toppled [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]], who had imposed a [[police state]].&lt;ref name="Promises131-132"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Promises and Challenges: The Tunisian Revolution of 2010-2011|journal=National Lawyers Guild Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=68|issue=3|page=|pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The revolution, like other [[Arab Spring]] revolutions which would soon follow, was prompted by endemic poverty, rising food prices, and chronic unemployment.&lt;ref name="Promises131"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Promises and Challenges: The Tunisian Revolution of 2010-2011|journal=National Lawyers Guild Review|date=Fall 2011|volume=68|issue=3|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tunisians demanded democracy, human rights, the end of corruption, and the end of the enforcement of the [[Terrorism Acts|2003 Anti-Terrorism Act]], which effectively criminalized their religious ideas and practices.&lt;ref name="Promises132"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tunsian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tunisian anti-terrorism law: A balance between security and freedoms|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/africa/12016-tunisian-anti-terrorism-law-a-balance-between-security-and-freedoms|accessdate=25 November 2014|publisher=Middle East Monitor|date=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous legitimacy of the Tunisian government had been based on a combination of the charisma of former president [[Habib Bourguiba|Bourguiba's]] secular legacy and an achievement legitimacy based on the modernization of the Tunisian state.&lt;ref name="Redissi383"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=383|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this legitimacy had failed and its accompanying regime had fallen, [[Ennahda Movement|En-Nahdha]], an Islamist party, sought to provide legitimacy through criticism of the previous regime.&lt;ref name="Redissi382"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=382|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tunisia initiated a top-down modernization, led by civil, urban, and secular petty bourgeoisie,&lt;ref name="Redissi383"/&gt; contrasting with the military coups in Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, the leadership of traditional scriptural elites in Morocco and Libya, and the leadership of revolutionary armed peasantry in Algeria.&lt;ref name="Redissi383"/&gt;

Tunisians asked that a [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|National Constituent Assembly]] (NCA) be formed that would be charged with writing the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Redissi384"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=384|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The party of the former regime, the [[Democratic Constitutional Rally|Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD) was banned from running for re-election, and En-Nahdha received 40% of the vote in an election overseen by a higher independent authority in April 2011.&lt;ref name="Redissi384"/&gt;  With its share of 89 out of 217 total seats, En-Nahdha then formed a coalition in the form of a [[triumvirate]], or troika, with the [[Congress for the Republic]] and the Forum known as [[Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties|Ettakatul]] within the NCA.&lt;ref name="Redissi385"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=385|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

En-Nahdha then seized considerable control by appointing 83% of public agents at all levels, and shutting down the media by physically attacking hundreds of journalists.&lt;ref name="Redissi385"/&gt;  En-Nahdha was also suspected of several assassinations, prompting the resignation of En-Nahdha prime minister [[Hamadi Jebali]] in April 2013.&lt;ref name="Redissi385"/&gt;  En-Nahdha also failed to produce a constitution by the agreed-upon time of a year, causing many political parties, including the major political party [[Nidaa Tounes]], to declare the end of En-Nahdha's electoral legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Redissi386"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=386|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tunisian public and political parties then asked for a compromise legitimacy that consisted of a mandatory national dialogue between En-Nahdha and the other ruling members of the NCA, which began in October 2013.&lt;ref name="Redissi386"/&gt;  This effectively forced En-Nahdha to negotiate its own immediate departure from the government, while at the same time conceding the current failure of Islamism as a means of legitimacy.  The national dialogue, which is still taking place, is seeking to establish a legitimate government, end the legislative process for the constitution and electoral code, and set up an independent body to organize elections and fix a definitive date.&lt;ref name="Redissi388"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Redissi|first1=Hamadi|title=The decline of political Islam's legitimacy: The Tunisian case|journal=Philosophy and Social Criticism|date=May 2014|volume=40|issue=4/5|page=388|doi=10.1177/0191453714527286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi's legitimacy waned as his regime failed to benefit those of most need in the state.

Since Gaddafi's departure, tribal elders, [[non-governmental organization|NGOs]], youth groups, town councils, and local brigades have stepped in to fill the power vacuum.&lt;ref name="Wehrey116"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=[[Frederic Wehrey|Wehrey]]|first1=Frederic|title=Libya's Revolution at Two Years: Perils and Achievements|journal=Mediterranean Politics|date=March 2013|volume=18|issue=1|page=116|doi=10.1080/13629395.2013.764655}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many different tribes in Libya, not all of which have supported the regime change,&lt;ref name="Eldin193"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eldin|first1=Kamal|last2=Salih|first2=Osman|title=The Roots and Causes of the 2011 Arab Uprisings|journal=Arab Studies Quarterly|date=Spring 2013|volume=35|issue=2|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the establishment of a new form of legitimacy difficult.  However, unlike Egypt, Libya has no entrenched officer class or judiciary to prolong or obstruct the country's transition to democracy.&lt;ref name="Wehrey116"/&gt;  Since the revolution, no single group has been dominant,&lt;ref name="Wehrey116"/&gt; although several brigades, or katiba, have been able to exercise considerable strength.

These katiba are “armed fighting groups ranging from 20 to 200 young men, formed along neighborhood, town or regional lines.”&lt;ref name="Wehrey117"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehrey|first1=Frederic|title=Libya's Revolution at Two Years: Perils and Achievements|journal=Mediterranean Politics|date=March 2013|volume=18|issue=1|page=117|doi=10.1080/13629395.2013.764655}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These brigades were central to the military strength of the revolutionary forces.&lt;ref name="Wehrey117"/&gt;  After Gaddafi's overthrow, the powerful brigades from Misrata and Zintan raided Tripoli, the Libyan capital, “pillaged automobiles, took over ministries and encamped at key institutions like the airport and oilfields”&lt;ref name="Wehrey117"/&gt; in order to gain political power.

In order to establish democratic legitimacy and sovereignty, the National Transitional Council has had to deal with these brigades, a process which has so far been mostly unsuccessful due to mistrust between the two bodies and the popularly illegitimate but regardless tangible military strength of the brigades.&lt;ref name="Wehrey118"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehrey|first1=Frederic|title=Libya's Revolution at Two Years: Perils and Achievements|journal=Mediterranean Politics|date=March 2013|volume=18|issue=1|page=118|doi=10.1080/13629395.2013.764655}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To firmly establish democratic legitimacy, the National Transitional Council is attempting to draft a new constitution.  It has also struggled in this task, for which it is looking back to Libya's first constitution in 1951.&lt;ref name="Wehrey120"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehrey|first1=Frederic|title=Libya's Revolution at Two Years: Perils and Achievements|journal=Mediterranean Politics|date=March 2013|volume=18|issue=1|page=120|doi=10.1080/13629395.2013.764655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ali Abdullah Saleh 2004.jpg|thumb|Former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh operated an extensive, primarily tribal patronage system in Yemen.]]
Even before the 2011 revolution, former Yemeni president [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]]’s regime’s legitimacy relied on a patronage network based on the entrenched Yemeni tribal system, effectively tying Saleh’s political legitimacy to the tribes’ much more established and trusted socio-political legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Dingli97"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dingli|first1=Sophia|title=Is the Failed State Thesis Analytically Useful?

==International crises of legitimacy==
The implications of an international crisis of legitimacy usually reach further than domestic crises, given that the actors have power over several different countries. International crises can threaten the stability between countries, increasing the probability for conflict.

===The European Union===
The [[European Union]] (E.U.) is a governing body over 28 European countries. The E.U. does not have complete legitimacy over the citizens of the 28 countries given that it only governs in the realm of politics and economics.

===The United States===
During the [[Cold war era|Cold War era]], most European Countries respected the authority of the United States as an international leader.&lt;ref name="Kagan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kagan|first1=Robert|title=America's Crisis of Legitimacy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=2004|volume=83|pages=65–87|doi=10.2307/20033903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans accepted the United States as the primary defender against the [[Soviet Union]]. After the Soviet Union fell, however, some scholars believe the United States was no longer needed by the Europeans for that purpose and therefore lost international legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Kagan /&gt;

In this time period, it was accepted by many political theorists that the United States was undergoing a crisis of legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Friedrichs2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedrichs|first1=David O.|title=The Legitimacy Crisis in the United States: A Conceptual Analysis|journal=Social Problems|date=June 1980|volume=27|issue=5|pages=540–555|doi=10.2307/800195|jstor=800195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minorities in the United States began to question the legitimacy of the government because they felt they were being denied rights.&lt;ref name="Kateb"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kateb|first1=George|title=On the "Legitimation Crisis"|journal=Social Research|date=Winter 1979|volume=46|issue=4|pages=695–727|jstor=40970809}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mindset was transferred into movements beginning in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which primarily involved African Americans and college students but eventually spread to a larger portion of the population.&lt;ref name="Friedrichs2"/&gt; The United States government's reaction to the legitimation crisis of the late twentieth century shows that in a consolidated democracy, undergoing a legitimation crisis can strengthen legitimacy. In this case, the system adapted to the wants of the citizens and the United States re-established legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Friedrichs2"/&gt; In the mid 1960s, the legitimacy of the United States government was challenged when citizens began to question the [[legality of the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Hendrickson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hendrickson|first1=David|title=The Sources of American Legitimacy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=November 2004|url=http://www.cfr.org/world/sources-american-legitimacy/p7473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Harry|title=On Strategy:  A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War|date=1995|publisher=Presidio Press|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000: Bush v. Gore reelection===

In the United States 2000 presidential election, [[United States presidential election, 2000]], Bush lost the popular vote but still won the electoral vote. Many United States citizens did not believe this was right. The legitimacy of the United States came into question after the Supreme Court Decision, [[Bush v. Gore]].&lt;ref name="Casebeer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casebeer|first1=Kenneth|title=A cautionary tale: Globalisation and legitimation crisis in the rule of law in the United States|journal=International Journal of the Legal Profession|date=March 2001|volume=8|issue=1|pages=57–68|doi=10.1080/09695950120103181|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=5655234&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some believe the legitimacy of the presidency came into question,&lt;ref name="Friedrichs2"/&gt; others believe the legitimacy of the court was jeopardized after the decision was released&lt;ref name="Yates"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yates|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Whitford|first2=Andrew|title=The Presidency and the Supreme Court After Bush v.

==Resolution==
When an actor loses [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]], the public no longer trusts the actor to maintain a [[social contract]]. Without the social contract, the natural rights of the public, such as life, liberty, and property,&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jim|title=John Locke: Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property|url=http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/john-locke-natural-rights-to-life-liberty-and-property|website=The Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; are in jeopardy.&lt;ref name="Fabienne2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peter|first1=Fabienne|last2=Zalta|first2=Edward|title=Political Legitimacy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legitimacy/#FunPolLeg|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is usually in the interest of both the public and the actor to end the legitimation crisis.There are several ways in which to end a legitimation crisis, but there is currently no unified theory as for the best method. Although the actor could be replaced, as seen in many of the examples above and effectively ending the legitimation crisis, this section will focus on the [[conflict resolution]] of the crisis. In this situation, the actor that was seeking legitimacy before the crisis regains legitimacy.

An actor can regain legitimacy in two ways:
# Re-establish the base:  realigning the political actions to the widely accepted social values and norms. In 1956 in Montgomery, Alabama, the more than year-long [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] eventually led to repeal of the local ordinance for bus segregation. In     this case, by realigning the laws to fit with public opinion, the government was able to regain legitimacy. 
# Coerce legitimacy:  drawing on capital goods to create a "material source of power."&lt;ref name="Reus-Smit"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reus-Smit|first1=Christian|title=International Crises of Legitimacy|journal=International Politics|date=2007|volume=44|pages=157–174|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ip/journal/v44/n2/full/8800182a.html|accessdate=8 November 2014|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Rwandan Genocide]] in 1994, the loss of government legitimacy led to an outbreak in genocide. One of the political factions, the Hutu, killed thousands of members of the Tutsi party. The RPF had to rely on the capital goods of the international community, in the form of weapons and money, and thus were able to regain control and legitimacy in Rwanda.

[[File:Manga Example.png|thumb|right|A page from the ''[[Marmalade Boy]]'' manga, volume 1 (Japanese version)]]
{{Anime and manga}}

Japanese [[manga]] has developed its own visual language or [[iconography]] for expressing emotion and other internal character states. This drawing style has also migrated into [[anime]], as many manga stories are adapted into television shows and films. While this article addresses styles from both types of output, the emphasis here is on the manga origins for these styles.

The popular and recognizable style of manga is very distinctive. Emphasis is often placed on line over form, and the storytelling and panel placement differ from those in American comics. Impressionistic backgrounds are very common, as are sequences in which the panel shows details of the setting rather than the characters. Panels and pages are typically read from right to left, consistent with traditional [[Japanese language#Writing system|Japanese writing]].

Because manga is a diverse art form, however, not all manga artists adhere to the conventions most popularized in the West through series such as ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball (manga)|Dragon Ball]]'', and ''[[Ranma ½]]''.

==Panel characteristics==

There are several expressive techniques typical (and some of them unique) to the manga art form:

*'''[[Screentone]]:''' Transparent adhesive sheets manufactured with a distinctive pattern (typically, some form of dots or hatching, but also including a variety of flashy effects like stars or explosions, or commonplace scenes such as cityscapes, schoolyards, and natural landscapes), these are cut out and overlapped on the panel to introduce shading and detail that would be time-consuming or unfeasible to draw by hand. Increasingly, physical tone sheets are being replaced by computer-generated equivalents.
*'''Expressive dialogue bubbles:''' The borders of the [[Speech balloon|speech/thought bubbles]] change in pattern/style to reflect the tone and mood of the dialogue. For example, an explosion-shaped bubble for an angry exclamation. Also, manga does not usually follow the normal Western comic conventions for speech (solid arc extending from the character's head) and thought bubble (several small circles used in place of the arc). The latter bubble style is often used for whispered dialogue in manga, which can confuse Western readers.
*'''[[Speed line]]s:''' Often in action sequences, the background will possess an overlay of neatly ruled lines to portray direction of movements. Speed lines can also be applied to characters as a way to emphasise the motion of their bodies (limbs in particular). This style, especially background blurs, extends into most action based anime as well.
*'''Mini flashbacks:''' Many artists employ copies of segments from earlier chapters (sometimes only a single panel) and edit them into the story panels to act as a flashback (also applying an overlay of darker tone to differentiate it from current events). This can be considered a convenient method to evoke prior event(s) along with visual imagery. In situations where a character's life events flash across his/her mind, a splash page may be used with the entire background consisting of segments from earlier chapters.
*'''Abstract background effects:''' These involve elaborate hatching patterns in the background and serve to indicate or strengthen the mood of the plot. It can also illustrate a character's state of mind.

==Facial features==
While the art can be incredibly realistic or cartoonish, characters often have large eyes (female characters usually have larger eyes than male characters), small noses, tiny mouths, and flat faces.  Psychological and social research on [[Neoteny|facial attractiveness]] has pointed out that the presence of childlike facial features increases [[Physical attractiveness|attractiveness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/phil_Fak_II/Psychologie/Psy_II/beautycheck/english/kindchenschema/kindchenschema.htm|title=Babyfaceness|date=2002-07-15|publisher=www.beautycheck.de and Universität Regensburg|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manga artists often play on this to increase the appeal of protagonists. Large eyes have become a permanent fixture in manga and anime since the 1960s when [[Osamu Tezuka]] was inspired by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] cartoons from the [[United States]] and started drawing them in this way.

Furthermore, inside the big eyes, the transparent feeling of pupils and the glares, or [[Purkinje images|small reflections]] in the corners of the eyes are often exaggerated, regardless of surrounding lighting, although they are only present in living characters: the eyes of characters who have died are the colour of the iris, but darker. Sometimes this death effect is also used to indicate characters who are emotionless due to trauma or loss of conscious control because of [[spirit possession|possession]] ([[ghost]], [[demon]], [[zombie]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], etc.). In characters with hair partially covering the face, the eyes that would otherwise be covered are often outlined to make them visible, even when the hair is particularly dense and dark.

Certain visual symbols have been developed over the years to become common methods of denoting emotions, physical conditions and mood:

===Eyes===
Eye shape and size can be exaggerated or changed altogether.  Love-hearts and doe-eyes indicate an [[infatuation]], while stars indicate that the character is star-struck.  Spirals indicate confusion or dizziness, while [[flame]]s or wide empty semicircles indicate that the character is angry or vengeful.  When dead, unconscious or stunned, "X"s are sometimes used as an indication of the state. Eyes may be replaced with two "&lt;"s facing in opposite directions to represent a variety of emotions, such as nervousness or excitement.  Eyes without pupils and with reflective glints indicate a state of [[delirium]].

Enlargement of the eyes, where they become huge and perfectly round with tiny pupils and no iris and going beyond the reach of the face (often shown with the mouth becoming like a stretched semicircle, the point of which extends past the chin) symbolises extreme excitement.  Similarly, turning eyes into two thick half-circles, conveys a cute, delighted look (see [[#Character design|Character design]] section below).

The character's eye shapes and sizes are sometimes symbolically used to represent the character. For instance, bigger eyes will usually symbolize beauty, innocence, or purity, while smaller, more narrow eyes typically represent coldness and/or evil. Completely blackened eyes ([[shadow]]ed) indicates a vengeful personality or underlying deep [[anger]]. It could also indicate that someone's being a wise-guy type, particularly when accompanied by grinning. A character's eyes are shadowed regardless of the lighting in the room when they become angry, upset, something is wrong with them, or they are emotionally hurt. Bubbles forming in the corner of a child's or female character's eyes often indicate that the character is about to cry.

===Mouth===

Mouths are often depicted as small, usually rendered with one line on the face.  A fang peeking from the corner of the mouth indicates mischief or feistiness (unless, of course, the character has fangs normally).  A cat mouth (like a number "3" rotated 90° clockwise) replacing the character's normal mouth, and usually accompanied by larger eyes may also represent mischief or feistiness (a notable exception being [[Konata Izumi]] from ''[[Lucky Star (manga)|Lucky Star]]'', whose usual mouth shape is this).

===Nose===

Again, noses are often depicted as small, with only a brief L-shaped mark to locate them.  With female characters, the nose can sometimes be removed completely when the character is facing forward.  In profile, female noses are often button shaped, consisting little more than a small triangle.  A nosebleed indicates sexual excitation following exposure to stimulating imagery or situation. It is based on a Japanese [[old wives' tale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/mangaguide/au1907.html|title=Tanioka Yasuji|last=Van Huffel|first=Peter|accessdate=2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A balloon dangling from one nostril (a "snot bubble") indicates sleep.

===Head and face===

[[File:Anirage-alternate.svg|right|thumb|Cruciform popping veins above eye on the left and large sweat drop above eye on the right]]
Sweat drops are a common visual convention. Characters are drawn with one or more prominent beads of sweat on their brow or forehead (or floating above the hair on characters whose back is turned). This represents a broad spectrum of emotions, including embarrassment, exasperation, confusion, and shock, not all of which are necessarily considered to be sweat-inducing under normal conditions.  Actual physical perspiration in manga is signified by even distribution of sweat drops over the body, occasionally on top of clothing or hair.

Throbbing "cross popping"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossPoppingVeins |title=Cross-Popping Veins |publisher=TV Tropes |accessdate=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; veins, usually depicted as a cruciform or [[triskelion]] in the upper head region, indicate [[anger]] or [[irritation]].  These shapes can sometimes be exaggerated, and placed on top of hair when the character is facing away from the viewer. Further throbs indicate additional anger. However, some manga such as ''[[Doraemon]]'' use smoke puffs to represent anger, and does not have the vein insignia.

A red cheek or hatchings on the cheek represent [[blushing]], usually used when embarrassed by romantic feelings, while oval "blush dots" on the cheeks represent rosy cheeks. This can sometimes be confused with a scribble on the cheek, indicating injury. Sometimes when the character is expressing strong emotions, such as sadness, a long blush through the nose would appear.

Facial shape changes depending on the character's mood, and can look from round apple-shaped to a more subtle carrot shape.

Parallel vertical lines with dark shading over the head or under the eye may represent mortification, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or horror. If the lines are wavy, they may represent [[disgust]].  A far cuter way to represent frustration/mortification is (mainly for female/young female characters) that they tend to puff out their cheeks while their line is delivered in a gruff voice, an elongated "3" showing puffed lips, to emphasize that puffed look.

Hair colors of anime characters are not just selected randomly. In some cases they express significant elements of that person's character (based on color symbolism in Japan).

* '''[[Black]]''': Power, [[evil]], [[emptiness]], [[sadness]], mystery, [[sophistication]], completeness, [[death]]
* '''[[White]]''': Purity, simplicity, [[peace]], [[humility]], [[cold]], [[heaven]] (can also mean [[death]])
* '''[[Blue]]''': [[Peace]], calm, stability, [[dependability]], [[male]], [[cold]], [[loyalty]]. With dependability, dark blue means more responsible than light blue.
* '''[[Purple]]''': Royalty, [[wisdom]], [[spirituality]]
* '''[[Red]]''': [[passion (emotion)|Passion]], [[joy]], [[aggression]], [[energy]], [[love]] (basically strong emotions)
* '''[[Pink]]''': [[Femininity]], purity, [[child|childlike]], [[love]], [[kindness]]
* '''[[orange (colour)|Orange]]''': [[Energy]], balance, [[enthusiasm]], [[heat|warmth]], seeking attention
* '''[[blond|Blond(e)]]''': [[Wealth]], heaven, childlike, [[courage]]
* '''[[Green]]''': [[luck|Fortune]] (good and bad), [[envy]], harmony, life, vigor, [[tranquility]]
* '''[[silver (colour)|Silver]]/[[grey|Gray]]''': Reliability, [[intelligence]], [[adult|maturity]], [[sadness]], [[boredom]]
* '''[[Brown]]''': [[Comfort]], simplicity, [[endurance]]

==Character design==

To better elicit a more emotional response with the audience for a certain character, a manga artist or animator will sometimes use certain traits in the character's design. The most common features include youthfulness as a physical trait (younger age or pigtails) or as an emotional trait such as a naive or innocent outlook, a childlike personality, or some obvious sympathetic weakness the character works hard to correct (extreme clumsiness or a life-threatening disease) but never really succeeds to get rid of.

{{see also|Moe (slang)}}

Other artistic conventions used in mainstream manga include:

*A round swelling, sometimes drawn to the size of baseballs, is a visual exaggeration of swelling from injury.
*A white cross-shaped bandage symbol denotes pain. (In older manga, eyes pop out to symbolize pain, as shown in ''[[Dragon Ball]]''.)
*Thick black lines around the character may indicate trembling due to anger, shock or astonishment.&lt;ref name="SB200510"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norimi|first=Morisaki|title=How To Draw Manga: Lesson Three|journal=Shojo Beat|date=October 2005|volume=1|issue=4|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually accompanied by a rigid pose or [[super deformed]] styling.
*Sparks literally fly between the eyes of two characters when they are fighting, or simply glaring at each other (in this case, their eyes may also be connected by a lightning streak).
*A character suddenly falling onto the floor, usually with one or more extremities twisted above himself or herself, is a typically humorous reaction to something unexpected happening.
*All facial features shrinking, the nose disappearing, the character sometimes lifting off the floor and the limbs being multiplied as if moving very fast symbolizes panic; if the same but with larger facial features it symbolizes comic rage or shock. Some may come with a yellow spark like symbol near their head.
*Exaggerated facial features signify anger. Examples such as star-like eyes with dark shading surrounding them while the face is framed by a red and black background imply comedic and/or understated rage. Others may include white circular eyes with slanted eyebrows and a square jaw with sharp teeth or even burning eyes with gritted teeth.
*Tear drops everywhere or forming a twin fountain indicate either intense joy or sadness.
*An [[ellipsis]] appearing over a character's head indicates a silence, implying that something is going unsaid.
*A drooping head may indicate sorrow or depression.&lt;ref name=SB200510 /&gt; Some may come with lines drawn of the hunched character or over their eyes. Variations with wavy lines and white circular eyes can imply embarrassment.
*More often than not, character colorisations tend to represent the character in some way. A more subdued character will be coloured with lighter tones, while a flamboyant character will be done in bright tones. Similarly, villains are often coloured in darker tones, while colder characters will be given neutral tones (black, white, grey, etc.).
*Characters push their index fingers together when admitting a secret or telling the truth to another.
*An odd white shape (more often than not, something close to a mushroom) that appears during an exhale represents a sigh of awkward relief or depression.
*A wavy ghost coming out of the mouth is often a comical representation of depression, mortification, or a comedic and figurative death. This is a reference to the [[hitodama]], as is the above example.
*Cherry blossoms indicate a sweet or beautiful moment. This is a reference to [[Mono no aware]].
*A flower blossom falling off its stem may indicate death or, more commonly, loss of [[virginity]].
*Unbound hair may represent freedom, while hair that is tied back may represent some form of either literal, figurative or emotional enslavement of some kind.
*Sleeping people may be indicated by having a bubble coming out of the nose, said bubble inflating and deflating as they snore. This is usually done when the character sleeps at an inappropriate moment (e.g. during class, at work, outside, in public, in an unusual pose or location, etc.).
*Sometimes, when a character screams or is surprised, they will do [[The Scream]] pose.
*Twitching eyebrows or eyelids may indicate anger or shock that the character is holding back.
*[[Negative (photography)|Negative imagery]] or rapidly dilating eyes often indicates either severe shock or a severe psychological effect.

'''Marc Fumaroli''' (born 10 June 1932 in [[Marseille]]), is a French historian and essayist. Fumaroli was elected to the [[Académie française]] on 2 March 1995 and became its director. He is also a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions]], the sister academy devoted to high erudition. Following his appointment to a chair in Seventeenth Century Studies at the University of Paris-IV, La Sorbonne (1980), he was elected to a Chair in Rhetoric and Society in Europe (16th and 17th century) at the [[Collège de France]]. He held it from 1986 to 2002, until mandatory retirement, and is now an emeritus professor. He is acknowledged for the revival of [[Rhetoric]] as field of study of European culture, in a sharp move away from both structuralism and post-modernism. His pioneering work remains ''L'Age De l'Eloquence'' (1980).  This massive work redrew the map of rhetorical scholarship across Europe. Fumaroli was also a member of the [[University of Chicago]]'s Committee on Social Thought.  He is a recipient of the prestigious [[Balzan Prize]], the "Nobel" of the humanities (in 2001). He is a foreign member of the [[British Academy]] and of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

{{Politics}}

A '''merger''', '''consolidation''' or '''amalgamation''', in a political or administrative sense, is the combination of two or more political or administrative entities, such as [[municipality|municipalities]] (in other words [[city|cities]], [[town]]s, etc.), [[county|counties]], [[district]]s, etc., into a single entity. This term is used when the process occurs within a sovereign entity.

Unbalanced growth or outward expansion of one neighbor may necessitate an administrative decision to merge (see [[urban sprawl]]). In some cases, common perception of continuity may be a factor in prompting such a process (see [[conurbation]]).  Some cities (see [[#Notable municipal mergers|below]]) that have gone through amalgamation or a similar process had several administrative sub-divisions or jurisdictions, each with a separate [[Mayor|person in charge]].

[[Annexation]] is similar to amalgamation, but differs in being applied mainly to two cases:
#The units joined are sovereign entities before the process, as opposed to being units of a single political entity.
#A city's boundaries are expanded by adding territories not already incorporated as cities or villages.

==Notable municipal mergers==
The act of merging two or more [[Municipality|municipalities]] into a single new municipality may be done for a variety of reasons, including urban growth, reducing the cost of local government and improving the efficiency of municipal service delivery.

===Belgium===
In 1977, the 2,359 [[municipalities of Belgium]] were merged to 596 new municipalities.

===Brazil===
In 1975, the [[Guanabara (state)|state of Guanabara]] and the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil were merged. The former consisted of only the territorial limits of the city of Rio de Janeiro, formerly the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] as Brazilian capital until 1960, when it was moved to newly built [[Brasília]]. When merged, Guanabara became the [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|municipality of Rio de Janeiro]] within the new state. In geographical terms, it would seem the state of Rio would have incorporated Guanabara; but, as the administrative and financial resources of the former capital were significant and even larger than the rest of the state, the change was more correctly referred to as a merger (''fusão'').

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the 1990s saw the forced amalgamation of several municipal entities in the provinces of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] into larger new municipalities. The process created what was labeled a ''megacity'' by the media, although none of the created municipalities fit in the definition of a megacity in the international sense and some of them have fewer than a million inhabitants.

;Ontario
{{See also|Amalgamation of Toronto}}
The provincial government of [[Mike Harris]] undertook an extensive program of municipal mergers between 1996 and 2002. The province had 815 municipalities in 1996; by 2002, this had been reduced to just 447.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/currentrestructure.aspx Municipal restructuring since 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105084333/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/currentrestructure.aspx |date=2012-11-05 }}. Archives of Ontario. Retrieved January 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[list of municipalities in Ontario]] is updated regularly.
* [[Toronto]] – In 1967, the towns of [[Leaside]], [[Mimico]], [[New Toronto]] and [[Weston, Toronto|Weston]] and the villages of [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], [[Long Branch, Toronto|Long Branch]] and [[Swansea, Toronto|Swansea]] amalgamated into the city and boroughs comprising [[Metropolitan Toronto]]. In 1998, the former boroughs within Metropolitan Toronto were merged into a new [[Toronto|City of Toronto]].
* [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] – In 1973, the provincial government created the new City of Cambridge by amalgamating the City of Galt, the towns of [[Preston, Ontario|Preston]] and [[Hespeler, Ontario|Hespeler]], and the hamlet of Blair.

* [[Greater Sudbury]] – resulted from the merger of the former [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]] in 2001; the regional municipality itself was created by a series of municipal amalgamations in 1973.
* [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] – In 2001, the former City of [[Stoney Creek, Ontario|Stoney Creek]] and the former towns of [[Ancaster, Ontario|Ancaster]], [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas]], [[Flamborough, Ontario|Flamborough]] and [[Glanbrook, Ontario|Glanbrook]] merged to create the new City of Hamilton.
* [[Temiskaming Shores]] – In 2004, the towns of New Liskeard and Haileybury, along with the township of Dymond, merged to create the new town of Temiskaming Shores.

;Quebec

The word ''unicity'' is used more commonly than megacity to describe that particular amalgamation.

===Denmark===
In 1970, mergers brought the number of [[municipalities of Denmark]] from 1,098 to 277. In 2007, the (by then) 270 municipalities were consolidated into 98 municipalities, most of them results of mergers.

===Finland===
An ongoing series of mergers has reduced the number of [[municipalities of Finland]] from 432 in 2006 to 311 in 2017.

===Germany===
Several [[states of Germany|states]] of [[West Germany]] carried out municipal merger programmes in the 1960s and 1970s. In [[Baden-Württemberg]], the number of municipalities dropped from 3,379 to 1,110 between 1968 and 1975; in [[Bavaria]], from roughly 7,000 to roughly 2,000 between 1972 and 1978; in [[Hesse]], from 2,642 to 421 between 1972 and 1977; in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], from 2,365 to 396 between 1967 and 1975; and in [[Saarland]], from 345 to 50 in 1974. In the Bavarian town of [[Ermershausen]], citizens occupied the town hall to resist the merger with [[Maroldsweisach]] – unsuccessfully, although Ermershausen was reconstituted as an independent municipality in 1994 – and [[Horgau]], also in Bavaria, successfully appealed its merger with [[Zusmarshausen]] to the Constitutional Court of Bavaria (''Bayerischer Verfassungsgerichtshof''). Mergers have also taken place in the former [[East Germany]] after 1990, for example in [[Brandenburg]] in 2003.

===Greece===
The [[Kallikratis Plan]] replaced the 1033 [[municipalities and communities of Greece]] with 325 new municipalities in 2011.

===Hungary===
[[Budapest]], the capital and largest city in Hungary, was formed from the merger of the cities of Buda and Pest across the river Danube in 1873.

===Israel===
In 2003 the cities of [[Baqa al-Gharbiyye]] and [[Jatt, Israel|Jatt]] joined to form the city of [[Baqa-Jatt]], but the merger was dissolved in 2010.

===Japan===

===Malaysia===
On 21 April 2018, The Negeri Sembilan state government declared about merger of [[Seremban Municipal Council]] (MPS) and [[Nilai Municipal Council]] (MPN) to become Seremban City Council (MBS). Thus making [[Seremban]] elevated to city status in Jan 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesundaily.my/node/534043&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In November 2010, the Seven Councils of Auckland City: Auckland City Council, Manukau City Council, Waitakere City Council, North Shore City Council, Papakura District Council, Rodney District Council and most of Franklin District Council has seen amalgamated to form Auckland City Council.

===Portugal===
[[Portugal]] was one of the first countries in the world to make an enlarged modern administrative reform, particularly during the 19th century. In early 19th century, the country was divided into more than 800 municipalities. In 1832, during [[Portuguese Civil War]], a law from [[Mouzinho da Silveira]], minister from the liberal [[government-in-exile]] (which then ruled only in the [[Azores]]) simplified the public administration, and reduced the number of municipalities to 796. In 1836, after the liberal victory, Passos Manuel, minister from the government of the [[Bernardo de Sá Nogueira de Figueiredo, 1st Marquess of Sá da Bandeira|Marquess of Sá da Bandeira]] made a profound administrative reform which reduced significantly the number of municipalities, fixing it to 351. Passos Manuel reform followed a trend very decentralist, creating an elected municipal administration. In 1855, another series of mergers reduced the number of municipalities to 254. In the rest of the 19th century, some series of mergers occurred (particularly during the 1890s), meanwhile other municipalities were restored. Thereafter, the changes to the municipal map focused mainly on the restoration and creation of new municipalities, particularly in the 20th century. Nowadays, there are 308 [[municipalities of Portugal|municipalities in Portugal]]. The last alteration to the municipal map, occurred in 1998, with the creation of the municipalities of [[Odivelas Municipality|Odivelas]] (in [[Lisbon district]]), [[Trofa Municipality|Trofa]] (in [[Porto district]]) and [[Vizela Municipality|Vizela]] (in [[Braga district]]).

In 2013, more than 1,000 [[parish]]es/[[freguesia]]s were merged.

===Sweden===
Many rural [[municipalities of Sweden]] were merged in 1952; the number of them decreasing from 2,281 to 816. Another series of mergers, this time also including cities and market towns, reduced the total number of municipalities from roughly 1,000 in the early 1960s to 278 in 1974. As of 2013, Sweden has 290 municipalities.

===United States===
In United States politics, such a merged entity may be called a [[consolidated city–county]].
* [[City of Greater New York]] – The amalgamation of the 5 boroughs ([[Manhattan]], [[The Bronx]], [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[Queens, New York|Queens]], and [[Staten Island]]) of New York.
* [[Unigov]] – The local government amalgamation of [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]].
* In [[New Jersey]], [[Borough of Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton Borough]] and [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]] became one municipality ([[Princeton, New Jersey]]), in January 2013, after voters passed a referendum in early November 2011, supported by residents of both municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Mancuso/The Times |url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2011/11/princeton_voters_approve_conso.html |title=Princeton voters approve consolidation of borough, township into one municipality |publisher=NJ.com |date= |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|right| The Ancient Library of Alexandria.]]
The '''Musaeum''' or '''Mouseion at Alexandria''' ({{lang-grc|Μουσεῖον τῆς Ἀλεξανδρείας}}), which included the famous [[Library of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;The relation of the institutions is still a matter of debate. The ''Musaeum'' is discussed by P.M. Fraser, ''Ptolemaic Alexandria'' (1972: vol. I:213-19 etc), and Mostafa el-Addabi, ''The Life and Fate of the Ancient Library of Alexandria'' (Paris 1990:84-90).&lt;/ref&gt; was an institution founded by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] or, perhaps more likely, by his son [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]. This original ''Musaeum'' ("Institution of the Muses") was the home of music or poetry, a philosophical school and library such as [[Plato]]'s [[Academy]], also a storehouse of  texts. It did not have a collection of works of art, rather it was an institution that brought together some of the best scholars of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]], analogous to a modern [[university]]. This original ''Musaeum'' was the source for the modern usage of the word ''[[museum#Etymology|museum]]''.

==History==
The Musaeum was an institution founded, according to [[Johannes Tzetzes]], by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] (c. 367 BC – c. 283 BC) or, perhaps more likely, by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] (309–246 BC)&lt;ref&gt;There is no ancient source for the founding either of the Library or the Musaeum, [[Roger S. Bagnall]] notes, in "Alexandria: Library of Dreams", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''146'''.4 (December 2002:348-362) p. 348. We rely instead on the self-confident but unreliable Byzantine scholar [[Johannes Tzetzes]]' remarks in an introduction to Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Alexandria]]. The ''Mouseion'' remained supported by the patronage of the royal family of the [[Ptolemies]]. Such a Greek ''Mouseion'' was the home of music or poetry, a philosophical school and library such as [[Plato]]'s [[Academy]], also a storehouse of  texts.&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368883 Μουσείον] at [[Liddell &amp; Scott]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mouseion'', connoting an assemblage gathered together under the protection of the [[Muses]], was the title given to a collection of stories about the esteemed writers of the past assembled by [[Alcidamas]], an Athenian [[sophist]] of the fourth century BC.

Though the ''Musaeum'' at Alexandria did not have a collection of sculpture and painting presented as works of art,&lt;ref&gt;The Ptolemaic dynasty displayed these in their palace nearby.&lt;/ref&gt; as was assembled by the Ptolemies' rival [[Attalid dynasty|Attalus]] at the [[Library of Pergamum]], it did have a room devoted to the study of [[anatomy]] and an installation for astronomical observations. Rather than simply a [[museum]] in the sense that has developed since the Renaissance, it was an institution that brought together some of the best scholars of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic world]], as [[Germain Bazin]] compared it, "analogous to the modern [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] or to the [[Collège de France]] in Paris."&lt;ref&gt;Bazin, ''The Museum Age'' 1967:16.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 21st century, the nearest equivalent is a [[university]].

More than 1,000 scholars lived in the Mouseion at a given time. Staff members and scholars were salaried by the Mouseion and paid no taxes. They also received free meals, free room and board, and free servants. The Mouseion was administered by a priest appointed by the Pharaoh.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

The Mouseion's scholars conducted scientific research, published, lectured, and collected as much literature as possible from the known world. In addition to Greek works, foreign texts were translated from Assyrian, Persian, Jewish, Indian languages, and other sources.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt; The edited versions of the Greek [[literary canon]] that we know today, from [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]] forward, exist in editions that were collated and corrected by the scholars assembled in the Musaeum at Alexandria.

==Appearance==
The Greek geographer [[Strabo]] described the Musaeum and Library as richly decorated edifices in a campus of buildings and gardens.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Mouseion is also part of the palaces, possessing a ''peripatos''&lt;ref&gt;An open loggia for walking and talking.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''exedra''&lt;ref&gt;The curved seat of an ''exedra'' is more accommodating to a group conversation than a bench in a straight line.&lt;/ref&gt; and large ''oikos'', in which the common table&lt;ref&gt;''Oikos'' signifies "household" in the broadest sense; an English analogy might be a university "commons".&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''philologoi'', men who are members of the ''Mouseion'', is located. This ''synodos'' has property in common and a priest in charge of the ''Mouseion'', formerly appointed by the kings, but now by Caesar."  --Strabo &lt;ref&gt;Strabo, ''Geography'' 17.1.8, noted by Bagnall 2002:57 note 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Mouseion featured a roofed walkway, an arcade of seats, and a communal dining room where scholars routinely ate and shared ideas.  The building was filled with private study rooms, residential quarters, lecture halls, and theaters.&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailywriting.net/Mouseion.htm|title=Mouseion|website=www.dailywriting.net|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
{{See also|Serapeum of Alexandria}}
The classic period of the Musaeum did not survive the purge and expulsion of most of the intellectuals attached to it in 145 BC, when [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] resigned his position; at any rate, the sources that best describe the Musaeum and library, [[Johannes Tzetzes]] and others, all Byzantine and late, do not mention any further directors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Heller-Roazen]], "Tradition's Destruction: On the Library of Alexandria" ''October'', '''100''', Obsolescence (Spring 2002:133-1530 esp. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; The Musaeum continued as an institution in the Roman period when [[Strabo]] gave his description of it, and according to [[Suetonius]],&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Claudius'', 42&lt;/ref&gt; the emperor [[Claudius]] added an additional building.&lt;ref name="watts147"&gt;Edward Jay Watts, (2008), ''City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria'', page 147. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Under the emperors, membership of the Musaeum was awarded to prominent scholars and statesmen, often as a reward to supporters of the emperor.&lt;ref name="watts148"&gt;Edward Jay Watts, (2008), ''City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria'', page 148. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Caracalla]] suppressed the Musaeum in 216,&lt;ref name="Butler"&gt;Butler, Alfred, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=O3-yWUIs7TkC The Arab Conquest of Egypt – And the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion]'', p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps as a temporary measure.&lt;ref name="watts147"/&gt; By this time, the center of learning in Alexandria had already moved to the [[Serapeum of Alexandria|Serapeum]].&lt;ref name="Butler"/&gt;

==Destruction==
The last known references to Musaeum membership occur in the 260s.&lt;ref name="watts150"&gt;Edward Jay Watts, (2008), ''City and School in Late Antique Athens and Alexandria'', page 150. University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; The Bruchion, the section of Alexandria that included the Musaeum, was probably destroyed by fire on the orders of Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272, although we do not know for sure whether it still existed in 272, the area having already been set ablaze during the occupation by [[Julius Caesar]]. Scattered references in later sources suggest that a Musaeum was reestablished in the 4th century on a different site, but little is known about this later organisation and it is unlikely to have had the resources of its predecessor.&lt;ref name="watts150"/&gt; The mathematician [[Theon of Alexandria|Theon]] (ca. 335&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; ca. 405), father of [[Hypatia]], is described in the tenth century ''[[Suda]]'' as "the man from the Mouseion." It is not known what connection he actually had with the Musaeum. [[Zacharias Rhetor]] and [[Aeneas of Gaza]] both speak of a physical space known as the "Mouseion" in the later 5th century.&lt;ref name="watts150"/&gt;

==Legacy==
This original '''Musaeum''' or '''Institution of the Muses''' was the source for the modern usage of the word ''[[museum#Etymology|museum]]''. In early modern [[France]], it denoted as much a community of scholars brought together under one roof as it did the collections themselves. French and English writers referred to these collections as a "cabinet" as in "a [[cabinet of curiosities]]." A catalogue of the 17th century collection of [[John Tradescant the elder]] and his son [[John Tradescant the younger]] was the founding core of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]]. It was published as ''[[Musaeum Tradescantianum]]: or, a Collection of Rarities. Preserved at South-[[Lambeth]] near [[London]] by John Tradescant'', 1656.

The '''National Association for the Promotion of Social Science (NAPSS)''', often known as the '''Social Science Association''', was a British reformist group founded in 1857 by [[Lord Brougham]]. It pursued issues in [[public health]], [[industrial relations]], [[penal reform]], and [[female education]]. It was dissolved in 1886.&lt;ref name="Hastings"&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=39463|title=Hastings, George Woodyatt|first=Lawrence|last=Goldman|authorlink=Lawrence Goldman|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Social Science Congress 1879.jpg|thumb|The Social Science Congress 1879, illustration from ''[[The Graphic]]'']]
The efforts of [[George Hastings (MP for East Worcestershire)|George Hastings]] brought together three groups of the 1850s to form the NAPSS: the Society for Promoting the Amendment of the Law, the National Reformatory Union, and the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]] (the Langham Place Group).&lt;ref name="Hastings"/&gt; It took as model the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], holding an itinerant annual meeting, which provided a forum for social reformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harriet Martineau|author2=Fanny Wedgewood|title=Harriet Martineau's Letters to Fanny Wedgewood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR2rAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-1146-3|page=171 note 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the Association was defined as "to coordinate the efforts of the experts and the politicians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Griffin|title=The Politics of Gender in Victorian Britain: Masculinity, Political Culture and the Struggle for Women's Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsnnyrckKqQC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=23 June 2013|date=12 January 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-01507-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor in the eventual decline of the NSPSS was that the objectives of medical reformers changed. Legislation and the efforts of central government to improve public health became less important to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Goldman|title=Science, Reform, and Politics in Victorian Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=io2nB6RcaIwC&amp;pg=PA200|accessdate=23 June 2013|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43301-3|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Oceanography Centre (NOC)''' is a [[marine science]] research and technology institution based on two sites in [[Southampton]] and [[Liverpool]], [[United Kingdom]].   It is the UK’s largest institution for integrated sea level science, coastal and deep ocean research and technology development.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2005/nocs.asp | title=National Oceanography Centre: NERC 2005 Press Release | accessdate=30 June 2011 | publisher=National Oceanography Centre | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927104624/http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2005/nocs.asp | archivedate=27 September 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NOC is wholly owned by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC) and was formed in April 2010 by bringing together the [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]]-managed activity at the [[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton]] and Liverpool’s [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]].

The centre was set up to work in close partnership with institutions across the UK marine science community to address key science challenges, including sea level change, the oceans’ role in climate change, predicting and simulating the behaviour of the oceans through [[computer modelling]], the future of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and long-term monitoring technologies.

== Marine science national capability ==
[[File: RRS James Cook 1.jpg|thumb|{{ship|RRS|James Cook}} returning to Southampton]]
The NOC provides the bulk of the UK’s capability to meet the needs of the country’s marine [[research community]].

National marine capability provided by the NOC includes Royal Research Ships, {{ship|RRS|James Cook}} and {{ship|RRS|Discovery|2013|6}}, deep [[submersibles]], including the [[Autosub]] [[autonomous underwater vehicle]]s (AUVs), advanced ocean sensors and other instruments.

Across its two sites, the National Oceanography Centre is responsible for the global mean sea level data archive, the UK’s sea level monitoring system for flood warning and climate change, the national archive of subsea sediment cores (British Ocean Sediment Core Research Facility), the [[National Oceanographic Library]], which houses the nationally important {{ship|RRS|Discovery}} and [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS ''Challenger'']] archives, and the UK’s main facility for holding and distributing data concerning the marine environment.

== History ==
[[File:National Oceanography Centre Southampton UK seen from waterfront.jpg|thumb|NOC Southampton]]
[[File:National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool (1).JPG|thumb|NOC Liverpool]]
The National Oceanography Centre’s waterfront headquarters were opened in 1996 by [[Duke of Edinburgh#Dukes of Edinburgh, third creation (1947-)|HRH the Duke of Edinburgh]], as the Southampton Oceanography Centre. It brought together the University of Southampton's departments of oceanography and geology with the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, formerly based in [[Wormley, Surrey]], and Research Vessel Services, formerly based in [[Barry Docks]], [[South Wales]].

It was renamed the [[National Oceanography Centre, Southampton]] in 2005, again by HRH the Duke of Edinburgh, its new name reflecting its prominence in ocean and earth sciences within the UK.

Until April 2010, the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton was jointly owned by the University of Southampton and the Natural Environment Research Council.  The term National Oceanography Centre, Southampton continues to be used to describe the collaborative relationship at the waterfront campus.

The National Oceanography Centre’s Liverpool site, on the University of Liverpool campus, was formerly the [[National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool|Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] and specialises in tidal and sea level science.  It hosts the [[National Tidal and Sea Level Facility]], the [[Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level]] and the British Oceanographic Data Centre. It was formerly housed at the [[British Oceanographic Data Centre#History|Bidston Observatory]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] before moving to the [[University of Liverpool]] campus in 2004. It maintained a popular web presence displaying realtime weather and ocean data, but since mid 2013 has failed to continue to maintain these services.

== NOC Association ==
The NOC is at the centre of a strategic network of partners and associates - at universities and research institutes - working collaboratively with the Centre in its support of world-class research, technology development and training the scientists of the future. Together, these organisations form the NOC Association, sharing in the delivery of the NERC’s marine science priorities.

== Partners ==
The NOC’s partners include the [[University of Southampton]], whose Ocean and Earth Science academic unit is co-located at the NOC’s dockside headquarters, home to around 520 research scientists, engineers and technicians, ship operations and support staff, as well as around 700 [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] students. The University of Liverpool is the NOC’s other hosting partner and postgraduate students are taught in a research-led environment in NOC's Joseph Proudman Building on the university's campus.

The NOC is responsible for managing UK marine science national capability. This includes provision of major facilities, programmes of sustained observing, survey, mapping, data management and other functions. The NOC also manages contracts placed by NERC with other organisations to provide some national capability functions. Such organisations are known as Delivery Partners and include:

* [[Plymouth Marine Laboratory]]
* [[Scottish Association for Marine Science]]
* [[British Antarctic Survey]]
* [[British Geological Survey]]
* [[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom |Marine Biological Association]]
* [[Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science]] (named after [[Alister Hardy|Alistair Hardy]])

The centre is committed to international engagement and has developed a range of international partnerships through the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120320201631/http://noc.ac.uk/using-science/NMCO/about International and Strategic Partnerships Office], including an alliance of Europe’s three principal oceanographic research institutions with [[Ifremer]] of France and IFM Geomar of Germany.

The NOC is a member of the European Global Ocean Observing System (EuroGOOS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) / National Oceanography Centre (NOC) - EuroGOOS|url=http://eurogoos.eu/member/natural-environment-research-council-nerc/|website=EuroGOOS|accessdate=27 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nature center''' (or '''nature centre''') is an organization with a [[visitor center]] or [[interpretive center]] designed to educate people about nature and the environment. Usually located within a protected [[Open space reserve|open space]], nature centers often have trails through their property.  Some are located within a state or city [[park]], and some have special [[garden]]s or an [[arboretum]].  Their properties can be characterized as nature preserves and wildlife sanctuaries.  Nature centers generally display small live animals, such as [[reptile]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[insect]]s, or [[fish]].  There are often museum exhibits and displays about [[natural history]], or preserved mounted animals or nature [[dioramas]].   Nature centers are staffed by paid or volunteer [[naturalists]] and most offer educational programs to the general public, as well as summer camp, after-school and school group programs.

Some nature centers allow free admission but collect voluntary donations in order to help offset expenses.  They usually rely on support from dedicated [[volunteering|volunteers]].

[[Environmental education]] centers differ from nature centers in that their museum exhibits and education programs are available mostly by appointment, although casual visitors may be allowed to walk on their grounds.

Some city, state and national parks have facilities similar to nature centers, such as museum exhibits, [[dioramas]] and trails, and some offer park nature education programs, usually presented by a [[park ranger]].

The '''New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities''' states that it is an inter-disciplinary research centre "dedicated to providing the research base for innovative solutions to the economic, social, environmental and cultural development" of New Zealand urban centres. It states "87% of New Zealanders live in cities. The health and well-being of a significant proportion of (New Zealand) population is reliant on developing environments that take into account the connections between transport, design, energy, health and governance and other issues." &lt;ref name="New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities |url= http://sustainablecities.org.nz/|publisher=New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5031">'''Non-representational theory''' is a [[theory]] developed in [[human geography]], largely through the work of [[Nigel Thrift]] ([[Warwick University]]),&lt;ref&gt;Thrift, N. 2000. "Non-representational theory" in RJ Johnston, D Gregory, G Pratt and M Watts (eds) The Dictionary of Human Geography (Blackwell, Oxford)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thrift, N. 2007. ''Non-representational theory: Space, Politics, Affect'' (Routledge, London)&lt;/ref&gt; and his colleagues such as J.D. Dewsbury ([[University of Bristol]]) and Derek McCormack ([[University of Oxford]]), and later by their respective graduate students. It challenges those using [[social theory]] and conducting [[geography|geographical]] research to "go beyond [[knowledge representation|representation]]"&lt;ref&gt;Thrift, Nigel; 1996; ''Spatial Formations''; Sage&lt;/ref&gt; and focus on embodied experience.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. {{doi|10.1111/area.12339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormack, D.P., 2017. The circumstances of post‐phenomenological life worlds. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 42(1), pp.2-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Dewsbury describes practices of "witnessing" that produce "knowledge without contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;Dewsbury, J.D., 2003; "Witnessing space: 'knowledge without contemplation'" Environment and Planning A", volume 35, pp. 1907–1932&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emphasis on practice==
Instead of studying and representing social relationships, non-representational theory focuses upon practices&amp;nbsp;– how human and nonhuman formations are enacted or performed&amp;nbsp;– not simply on what is produced.&lt;ref name="Thrift, Nigel pp 124"&gt;Thrift, Nigel; 1997; 'The still point: expressive embodiment and dance', in Pile, S and Keith, M (eds.), ''Geographies of Resistance''; (Routledge) pp 124–151&lt;/ref&gt; "First, it valorizes those processes  that operate before … conscious, reflective thought … [and] second, it insists on the  necessity of not prioritizing representations  as the primary epistemological vehicles through which knowledge is extracted from the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCormack|first1=Derek|date=2005|title=Diagramming Practice and Performance|url=http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=d51j|journal=Society and Planning|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have examined a wide range of activities including dance,&lt;ref name="Thrift, Nigel pp 124"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek, McCormack; 2003; 'Geographies for Moving Bodies: Thinking, Dancing, Spaces'; (Sage)&lt;/ref&gt; musical performance,&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Frances; 2005; 'Performing ethnography: Irish traditional music sessions and new methodological spaces' (Taylor and Frances)&lt;/ref&gt; walking,&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, John; 2005' A single day's walking: narrating self and landscape on the South West Coast Path' (Transactions of the British Geographers)&lt;/ref&gt; gardening,&lt;ref&gt;Crouch, David; 2003; 'Performances and constitutions of natures: a consideration of the performance of lay geographies'&lt;/ref&gt; rave,&lt;ref&gt;Saldanha; 2005; 'Trance and visibility at dawn: racial dynamics in Goa's rave scene' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; listening to music&lt;ref&gt;Anderson; 2004; 'A Principle of Hope: Recorded Music, Listening Practices and the Immanence of Utopia'&lt;/ref&gt; and children's play.&lt;ref&gt;Harker; 'Playing and affective time-spaces'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-structuralist origins==
This is a [[post-structuralist]] theory inspired in part by the ideas of thinkers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Michel Serres]], and by [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenonologists]] such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Richard G. pp 67 - 84"&gt;Smith, Richard G., 2003; "Baudrillard's nonrepresentational theory: burn the signs and journey without maps" in ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space'' 21; pp 67–84&lt;/ref&gt; More recently it considers views from political science (including ideas about [[radical democracy]]) and anthropological discussions of the material dimensions of human life.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} It parallels the conception of "hybrid geographies" developed by [[Sarah Whatmore (geographer)|Sarah Whatmore]].&lt;ref&gt;Whatmore, S. 2002. ''Hybrid Geographies'' (Sage)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have suggested that Thrift's use of the term "non-representational theory" is problematic, and that other non-representational theories could be developed. [[Richard G. Smith (geographer)|Richard G. Smith]] said that [[Baudrillard]]'s work could be considered a "non-representational theory", for example,&lt;ref name="Smith, Richard G. pp 67 - 84"/&gt; which has fostered some debate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 2005, Hayden Lorimer (Glasgow University) said that the term "more-than-representational" as preferable.&lt;ref&gt;Lorimer, H., 2005; "Cultural geography: the busyness of being 'more-than-representational'", ''Progress in Human Geography'' 29, 1 (2005) pp. 83–94&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henri Rousseau - Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henri Rousseau]], ''In a Tropical Forest Combat of a Tiger and a Buffalo'', 1908-1909, [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]]]

'''Primitivism''' is a mode of aesthetic idealization that either emulates or aspires to recreate "primitive" experience. In [[Western art]], primitivism typically has borrowed from non-Western or prehistoric people perceived to be "primitive", such as [[Paul Gauguin]]'s inclusion of [[Tahiti]]an motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from primitive art has been important to the development of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-388-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitivism has often been critiqued for reproducing the racist stereotypes about non-European peoples used by Europeans to justify colonial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Marianna Torgovnick. ''Gone primitive: Savage intellects, Modern lives'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2018) for an account of the different understandings and critiques of primitivism.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "primitivism" is often applied to other professional painters working in the style of [[Naïve art|naïve]] or [[folk art]] like [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]] and others.

== Philosophy ==
Primitivism is a utopian idea that is distinctive for its reverse teleology. The utopian end toward which primitivists aspire usually lies in a notional "state of nature" in which their ancestors existed (chronological primitivism), or in the supposed natural condition of the peoples that live beyond "civilization" (cultural primitivism).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A. O. Lovejoy and George Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire of the "civilized" to be restored to a "state of nature" is as longstanding as civilization itself.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In antiquity the superiority of "primitive" life principally found expression in the so-called Myth of the [[Golden Age]], depicted in the genre of European poetry and visual art known as the [[Pastoral]]. Primitivist idealism between gained new impetus with the onset of industrialization and the European encounter with hitherto unknown peoples after the colonization of the Americas, the Pacific and other parts of what would become the modern imperial system.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the idealization of indigenous peoples were chiefly used as a rhetorical device to criticize aspects of European society.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, “The Savage Critic: Some European Images of the Primitive,” ''The Yearbook of English Studies'', 13 (1983), 32–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In the realm of aesthetics, however, the eccentric Italian philosopher, historian and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]] (1688–1744) was the first to argue that primitive peoples were closer to the sources of poetry and artistic inspiration than "civilized" or modern man. Vico was writing in the context of the celebrated contemporary debate, known as the great [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]. This included debates over the merits of the poetry of Homer and the Bible as against modern vernacular literature.

In the 18th century, the German scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] identified the distinctive character of oral literature and located Homer and the Bible as examples of folk or oral tradition (''Prolegomena to Homer'', 1795). Vico and Wolf's ideas were developed further in the beginning of the 19th century by [[Herder]].&lt;ref&gt;See Isaiah Berlin, ''Vico and Herder'' (New York: Viking, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, although influential in literature, such arguments were known to a relatively small number of educated people and their impact was limited or non-existent in the sphere of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Rubin]], "Modernist Primitivism, 1984," p. 320 in ''Primitivism: Twentieth Century Art, A Documentary History'', Jack Flam and Miriam Deutch, editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw for the first time the emergence of [[historicism]], or the ability to judge different eras by their own context and criteria. A result of this, new schools of visual art arose that aspired to hitherto unprecedented levels of historical fidelity in setting and costumes. [[Neoclassicism]] in visual art and architecture was one result. Another such "historicist" movement in art was the [[Nazarene movement]] in Germany, which took inspiration from the so-called Italian "primitive" school of devotional paintings (i.e., before the age of Raphael and the discovery of oil painting).

Where conventional academic painting (after Raphael) used dark glazes, highly selective, idealized forms, and rigorous suppression of details, the Nazarenes used clear outlines, bright colors, and paid meticulous attention to detail. This German school had its English counterpart in the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], who were primarily inspired by the critical writings of [[John Ruskin]], who admired the painters before Raphael (such as Botticelli) and who also recommended painting outdoors, hitherto unheard of.

Two developments shook the world of visual art in the mid-19th century. The first was the invention of the photographic camera, which arguably spurred the development of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in art. The second was a discovery in the world of mathematics of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], which overthrew the 2000-year-old seeming absolutes of Euclidean geometry and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multiple dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref&gt;See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art'' (Princeton University Press, 19810).&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of possible new dimensions had the opposite effect of photography and worked to counteract realism. Artists, mathematicians, and intellectuals now realized that there were other ways of seeing things beyond what they had been taught in [[École des Beaux-Arts|Beaux Arts]] Schools of [[Academic painting]], which prescribed a rigid curriculum based on the copying of idealized classical forms and held up [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance perspective painting]] as the culmination of civilization and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|title=Ecole des Beaux-Arts|first=|last=Natasha|date=|website=www.jssgallery.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106041532/http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux Arts academies held than non-Western peoples had had no art or only inferior art.

In rebellion against this dogmatic approach, Western artists began to try to depict realities that might exist in a world beyond the limitations of the three dimensional world of conventional representation mediated by classical sculpture. They looked to [[Japanese art|Japanese]] and [[Chinese art]], which they regarded as learned and sophisticated and did not employ Renaissance one-point perspective. Non-euclidean perspective and [[tribal art]] fascinated Western artists who saw in them the still-enchanted portrayal of the spirit world. They also looked to the art of untrained painters and to children's art, which they believed depicted interior emotional realities that had been ignored in conventional, cook-book-style academic painting.

Tribal and other non-European art also appealed to those who were unhappy with the repressive aspects of European culture, as [[pastoral]] art had done for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Connelly, F, ''The Sleep of Reason'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Imitations of tribal or archaic art also fall into the category of nineteenth-century "historicism", as these imitations strive to reproduce this art in an authentic manner. Actual examples of tribal, archaic, and folk art were prized by both creative artists and collectors.

The painting of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] and the music of [[Igor Stravinsky]] are frequently cited as the most prominent examples of primitivism in art. Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', is "primitivist" in so far as its [[Program music|programmatic]] subject is a pagan rite: a human sacrifice in pre-Christian Russia. It employs harsh dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms to depict "[[Dionysian]]" [[Musical modernism|modernism]], i.e., abandonment of inhibition (restraint standing for civilization). Nevertheless, Stravinsky was a master of learned classical tradition and worked within its bounds. In his later work he adopted a more "[[Apollonian]]" [[neoclassicism]], to use [[Nietzsche]]'s terminology, although in his use of [[serialism]] he still rejects 19th-century convention. In modern visual art, Picasso's work is also understood as rejecting Beaux Arts artistic expectations and expressing primal impulses, whether he worked in a cubist, neo-classical, or tribal-art-influenced vein.

==The origins of modernist primitivism==
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|150px|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris just prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']] 
Primitivism gained a new impetus from anxieties about technological innovation but above all from the "[[Age of Discovery]]", which introduced the West to previously unknown peoples and opened the doors to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, S: ''In Search of the Primitive'', (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1974), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; As the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. With the decline of [[feudalism]], philosophers started questioning many fixed medieval assumptions about human nature, the position of humans in society, and the strictures of Christianity, and especially Catholicism. They began questioning the nature of humanity and its origins through a discussion of the natural man, which had intrigued theologians since the European encounter with the [[New World]].

From the 18th century, Western thinkers and artists continued to engage in the retrospective tradition, that is "the conscious search in history for a more deeply expressive, permanent human nature and cultural structure in contrast to the nascent modern realities".&lt;ref&gt;Diamond 1974, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Their search led them to parts of the world that they believed constituted alternatives to modern civilization.

The invention of the steamboat and other innovations in global transportation in the 19th century brought the indigenous cultures of the European colonies and their artifacts into metropolitan centres of empire. Many western-trained artists and connoisseurs were fascinated by these objects, attributing their features and styles to "primitive" forms of expression; especially the perceived absence of linear perspective, simple outlines, the presence of symbolic signs such as the [[hieroglyph]], emotive distortions of the figure, and the perceived energetic rhythms resulting from the use of repetitive ornamental pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater, ''Primitivism in Modern Art'', rev. ed. (New York: Vintage, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent cultural critics, it was primarily the cultures of [[Africa]] and the [[Oceanic islands]] that provided artists an answer to what these critics call their "white, Western, and preponderantly male quest" for the "elusive ideal" of the primitive, "whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference."&lt;ref&gt;See Solomon-Godeau 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indians of the Americas, could also be found in the archaic and peasant art of Europe and Asia, as well.

==Paul Gauguin==
[[File:Paul Gauguin- Manao tupapau (The Spirit of the Dead Keep Watch).JPG|thumb|left|[[Paul Gauguin]]. ''Spirit of the Dead Watching'', 1892. Oil on canvas. [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]].]]
Painter [[Paul Gauguin]] sought to escape European [[civilization]] and technology, taking up residence in the French colony of [[Tahiti]] and adopted a stripped-back lifestyle which he felt to be more natural than was possible in Europe.

Gauguin's search for the primitive was manifestly a desire for sexual freedom, and this is reflected in such paintings as ''[[Spirit of the Dead Watching|The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch]]'' (1892), ''Parau na te Varua ino'' (1892), ''Anna the Javanerin'' (1893), ''Te Tamari No Atua'' (1896), and ''Cruel Tales'' (1902), among others. Gauguin's view of Tahiti as an earthly [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of free love, gentle climate, and naked nymphs is quite similar, if not identical, to that of the classical [[pastoral]] of academic art, which has shaped Western perceptions of rural life for millennia. One of his Tahitian paintings is called "Tahitian Pastoral" and another "[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?|Where Do We Come From"]].&lt;ref&gt;Writing about "Where Do We Come From?" in a review entitled "Back to Paradise", New York Times Art Critic Hilton Kramer quotes art historian George T.M. Shackelford: "Although, [Gauguin] downplayed the painting's relationship to the murals of Puvis on the grounds of procedure and intention, in formal terms he cannot have hoped that his figured landscape&amp;mdash;for all its apparent rejection of classical formulas and execution&amp;mdash;could escape comparison with the timeless groves that Puvis had popularized in murals for the museums in Lyon and Rouen, as well as the great hemicycle of the Sorbonne."&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Gauguin extended the academic pastoral tradition of Beaux Arts schools which had hitherto been based solely on idealized European figures copied from Ancient Greek sculpture to include non-European models.

Gauguin also believed he was celebrating Tahitian society and defending the Tahitians against European colonialism. Feminist [[postcolonial]] critics, however, decry the fact that Gauguin took adolescent mistresses, one of them as young as thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; They remind us that like many European men of his time and later, Gauguin saw freedom, especially sexual freedom, strictly from the male colonizer's point of view. Using Gauguin as an example of what is "wrong" with primitivism, these critics conclude that, in their view, elements of primitivism include the "dense interweave of racial and sexual fantasies and power both colonial and patriarchal".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.315.&lt;/ref&gt; To these critics, primitivism such as Gauguin's demonstrates fantasies about racial and sexual difference in "an effort to essentialize notions of primitiveness" with "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]ness". Thus, they contend, primitivism becomes a process analogous to [[Exoticism]] and [[Orientalism]], as critqued by [[Edward Said]], in which European [[imperialism]] and monolithic and degrading views of the "East" by the "West" defined colonized peoples and their cultures.&lt;ref&gt;(See [[Edward Said]]'s 1978 book, ''[[Orientalism]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fauves and Picasso==
[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. The two figures on the right are the beginnings of [[Picasso|Picasso's]] African-inspired period.]]
{{see also|Picasso's African Period}}
In 1905-06, a small group of artists began to study art from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Oceania]], in part because of the compelling works of [[Paul Gauguin]] that were gaining visibility in Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 exerted a strong influence.  Artists including [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] grew increasingly intrigued and inspired by the select objects they encountered. 

[[Pablo Picasso]], in particular, explored  [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African sculpture]], [[African traditional masks]], and other historical works including the [[Mannerism|Mannerist paintings]] of [[El Greco]], resulting in his masterpiece ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and, eventually, the invention of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"&gt;Cooper, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalizing term "primitivism" tends to obscure the distinct contributions to modern art from these various visual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Joshua I. “Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8.” The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticolonial primitivism==
Although primitivism in art is usually regarded as a Western phenomenon, the structure of primitivist idealism can be found in the work of non-Western and especially anticolonial artists. The desire to recover a notional and idealized past in which humans had been at one with nature is here connected to a critique of the impact of Western modernity on colonized societies. These artists often critique Western stereotypes about "primitive" colonized peoples at the same time as they yearn to recover pre-colonial modes of experience. Anticolonialism fuses with primitivism's reverse teleology to produce art that is distinct from the primitivism of Western artists which usually reinforces rather than critiques colonial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of artists connected with the [[Négritude]] movement in particular demonstrates this tendency. ''Négritude'' was a movement of neo-African idealism and political agitation that was begun by francophone intellectuals and artists on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s, and which spread across Africa and the African diaspora in subsequent years. They self-consciously idealized pre-colonial Africa, something that took many forms. This typically consisted in rejecting overweening European rationalism and the associated ravages of colonialism while positing pre-colonial African societies as having had a more communal and organic basis. The work of the Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]] is particularly notable among the visual artists of negritude. Lam met Pablo Picasso and the European surrealists while living in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowery Stokes Sims. Wifredo Lam and the international avant-garde, 1923-1982. University of Texas Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Cuba in 1941, Lam was emboldened to create images in which humans, animals, and nature combined in lush and dynamic tableaux. In his iconic work of 1943, ''The Jungle'', Lam's characteristic polymorphism recreates a fantastical jungle scene with African motifs between stalks of cane. It vividly captures the way in which negritude's neo-African idealism is connected to a history of plantation slavery centred on the production of sugar.

A '''religious community''' is a [[community]] (group of people) who practice the same [[religion]]. The term is used in a wider sense and a different narrower sense. People who define themselves as having a particular religion are considered to be members of the religion's community. 

In the wider sense, the term is used to refer to members of one religion who may live in groups, or near or intermingled with members of other religions. Community members may mix with others in everyday life, but worship separately, typically in a dedicated [[temple]] such as a [[church (building)|church]] or [[mosque]]. One might speak of the Catholic community of [[Belfast]] (a city), or the Jewish community of France (a country). In other cases, a person must be formally accepted by community authorities to become acknowledged as a member. In Israel only couples both from the same officially recognized religious community [[marriage in Israel|may marry]].

The term is also used in a different, narrower sense to mean a group of people of the same religion living together specifically for religious purposes, often subject to formal commitments such as [[religious vows]],  as in a [[monastery]].&lt;ref name="Deegan"/&gt;

== Types of Christian Communities ==

=== Order ===
Orders are Institutes in which solemn vows are made by at least some of the members. All members of these orders are called regulars, and if they are women they are called nuns ("moniales"). Additionally, Orders are typically dated in history as older than Congregations.

=== Congregations ===
A group of people assembled for religious worship. The Catholic [[Congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] in the Roman Curia is the most notable congregation.

=== Clerical ===
These Christian [[Institutes of the Christian Religion|institutes]], in accordance with the intentions of the Founder or by reason of legitimate tradition, are governed by [[Clergy|clerics]], assume the exercise of sacred Orders, and are recognized by the Church as clerical Institutes.

=== Lay ===
Lay, also known as lay affiliates or associates, play an important part in a religious community. Men and women who take part, formally, in a religious community, to make their mission and spirituality, and have great influence on the like of the community are known as lay affiliates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://anunslife.org/blog/nun-talk/the-role-of-lay-associates-in-religious-life}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Canons Regular ===
Canons regular 
=== Monastic Orders ===

=== Mendicant Orders ===

=== Clerks Regular ===

=== Clerical Religious Congregations ===

=== Lay Religious Congregations ===

Lay religious communities include groups such as the Hutterites, [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bruderhof|title=Bruderhof - Why Community|date=2012-01-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pBrSi5jld8|accessdate=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Amish and some Mennonite churches.  Some of these communities are tightly-bound, such as the Bruderhof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hutterites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/hutterites/|title=Hutterites|last=Ryan|first=John|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Amish and similar groups tend to be more loosely formed, but still act in a communal way.  All of these communities will claim to be Christ-centred.

It is a [[Learned society]] member of the UK [[Academy of Social Sciences]].  In addition to the umbrella organisation, it has branches that cater specifically to researchers in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and Ireland (including both the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]).  Among other activities, it publishes a code of conduct for social researchers which is widely adopted as a standard of [[research ethics]] by funding agencies in the social sciences.

'''Social impact entertainment''' ('''SIE''') is a variety of mainstream entertainment, predominately films and TV, that intends to have social impact next to great entertainment value.

The practitioners in this field are predominately producers and directors who want to add a "social surplus" to their entertainment, as contrasted to the field of [[Entertainment-education]] which often starts out with a social change directive and then creates the entertainment around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediaimpact.org/entertainment-education/|title=Entertainment-Education|date=2012-10-24|work=PCI Media Impact|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A focus in the field is the study of actual effects (social impact measurement), while the predominant interest is still to create entertaining, profitable content and work within the ecosystem of commercial film production and distribution. A common theme in the field of SIE is that mainstream film production companies employ so-called "[[Impact producer|Impact Producers]]" who specialize in impact-oriented distribution campaigns which can often include community screenings, screenings for legislators as well as impact measurement and evidence-building.

[[Cinema of Change]] reports on progress in the Social Impact Entertainment world. Currently, there are approximately 130 organizations, companies and film festivals operating in the ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinemaofchange.com/the-cinema-of-change-ecosystem/|title=The Cinema of Change EcosystemThe Cinema of Change Ecosystem - Cinema of Change|website=www.cinemaofchange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable being [[Participant Media]] due to its $100 million+ funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jmkdbrhlfK8C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Tech Billionaires: Reshaping Philanthropy in a Quest for a Better World|last=Solomon|first=Lewis D.|date=2011-12-31|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412813747|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social impact entertainment is taught at a few universities and has taken foot with a handful of institutes, most notably [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Norman Lear Center]] and [[UCLA TFT]]'s Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5001">'''Student teaching''' is a college-supervised instructional experience; usually the culminating course in a university or college [[undergraduate education]] or [[graduate school]] program leading to [[teacher education]] and certification.  Examples of programs include Early Childhood (Birth-Grade 3), Middle Childhood (Grades 4-9), and Adolescence to Young Adult (Grades 7-12).  It is required by those earning either a [[Bachelor of Education]] or [[Master of Education]] degree, as well as liberal arts [[Bachelor of Science]] or [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees with a major in education.

Student teaching is required for students who are not yet certified to teach.  It is different from a [[practicum]], which is required when a student ''already'' holds certification to teach, yet wants a certificate extension to teach another area of specialization; they are both college-supervised field-based experiences.

The student teaching experience lasts about the length of a semester or quarter; long enough to fulfill the college’s assigned tasks. It is an unpaid [[internship]]. This experience gives the prospective teaching professional an opportunity to teach under the supervision of a permanently certified master teacher (see [[schoolmaster]]).

The student teacher is usually placed in a neighboring or participating school.  The student teacher is monitored by the cooperating teacher from the school, as well as a supervisor through the college.  The supervisor acts as a liaison between the cooperating teacher and the head of the college’s student teaching department.

The student teacher normally shadows the cooperating teacher for about one week, eventually gaining more responsibility in teaching the class as the days and weeks progress. Eventually, the student teacher will assume most of the teaching responsibilities for the class including class management, lesson planning, assessment, and grading. Thus, the student teacher is able to more fully experience the role of the teacher as the classroom teacher takes on the observation role in the class. There is sometimes a "phasing out" week when the student teacher returns the teaching role back to the regular teacher.

The supervisor, as well as cooperating teacher, monitor the progress of the student teacher throughout the experience, ensuring ''satisfactory'' work.  A grade of ''Pass'' or ''Fail'' in student teaching, as well as satisfactory completion of a school's education program, is an indication as to whether the college recommends the student for certification to teach.

==Student teaching as a learning challenge==
Student teaching has been used as a  challenge to foreign language learners to facilitate the integration of their language skills by placing them at the center of classroom activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iteslj.org/Techniques/Ogawa-StudentsTeach.html Ogawa &amp; Wilkinson - Let Your Students Teach Their Class (I-TESL-J)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Student teaching philosophy has proven to be a decisive between the newer cohort of teachers, and older educators. Trained under differing teaching philosophies, both groups have a difference of opinion on instructional methodology. The two most prevalent teaching philosophies in America are called Modern teaching philosophy and Traditional teaching philosophy respectively. The former relies on inquiry-based instruction, while the later relies heavily on lecture-based teaching. The differing of philosophies is being seen at every rung of the educational ladder, from Pre-K to Collegiate instruction.

In describing the difference between the two methodologies, one can note characteristics that define them. In traditional teaching methods, there is a high emphasis on attending lectures, reading texts, and solving problems. In modern teaching approaches, there is a high premium put on developing one's unique knowledge through the pursuit of the scientific method, using such didactic methods as observation and hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/download/1885/1827 Traditional Teaching Methods Vs. Teaching through the Application of Information]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hallmark of the modern teaching approach is the incorporation of technology, a highly useful skill that is required of most who intend on entering the job market in future years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://is.muni.cz/th/86952/ff_m_b1/MgrDiplomkaBoumova.pdf Traditional Vs. Modern Teaching Methods: Advantages and Disadvantages]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of technological inclusion within the classroom has become supported in many counties through the United States. Most schools are equipped with smart boards and include roaming laptop carts that allow all students, regardless of financial ability, gain experience with the technology that will make them successful in the next steps of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.mit.edu/papers/GamesSimsSocNets_EdArcade.pdf Using the Technology of Today, in the Classroom of Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kaplun building Racah Institute Givat Ram 2010.JPG|thumb|300px|Racah Institute of Physics building, [[Givat Ram]]]]

'''The Racah Institute of Physics''' is an institute at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], part of the faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences on the Edmund J. Safra Campus in the [[Givat Ram]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.huji.ac.il Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute is the center for all research and teaching in the various fields of physics at the Hebrew University.  These include [[astrophysics]], [[high energy physics]], [[quantum physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[solid state physics]], laser and [[plasma physics]], [[biophysics]], [[non-linear and statistical physics]], and [[nanophysics]]. Both experimental and theoretical research is carried on in these fields.

==History==
In 1913, before the opening of the Hebrew University, first steps towards physics research in Jerusalem were taken by [[Chaim Weizmann]]. Weizmann, the President of the Zionist Organisation, and the major figure in the planning and founding of the Hebrew University contacted Leonard Ornstein, the known physicist from Utrecht, the Netherlands, to prepare plans for physics research at the upcoming university. After the University was officially opened, he became the chairman of the physics group for several years, acting from his seat at Utrecht.
In the year 1923, two years before its official opening, [[Albert Einstein]] gave a talk on [[Mount Scopus]], the first campus of the University, on his [[Theory of Relativity]]. This talk was considered by many as the opening talk of the Hebrew University.&lt;ref&gt;Unna, Issachar, "The Genesis of Physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem", Physis  in Perspective 2, 336 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenkranz, Ze'ev, ''Einstein Before Israel'' (Princeton, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
Einstein, who supported actively the foundation and development of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem since 1919 and throughout his entire life, was particularly active in helping to establish a good physics institute. 
The known mathematician, [[Abraham Fraenkel]], who was on the governing board and served later as dean and rector of the University, invested great efforts looking for an excellent physicist to take the chair of theoretical physics in Jerusalem. He corresponded extensively with Einstein on this matter,  seeking advice on the various possible candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Parzen, H., The Hebrew University 1925–1935 (New York, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first experimental physicist to be appointed (in 1928) was Shmuel Sambursky.  He carried out his experiments in atomic spectroscopy during his visits to Ornstein's laboratory in Utrecht. His teaching duties consisted of the courses in classical experimental physics. In later years he became a well known historian of physics.
In 1933 Ernst Alexander  joined the experimental physics department and a year later – Guenther Wolfson. Both had to leave their posts in Germany due to the new racial laws, in spite of being highly appraised experimental physicists there. Both of them contributed substantially to the creation of an experimental infrastructure for physics research in Jerusalem.
In 1934 the already known nuclear physicist George Placzek accepted a position in the department. After a few months in Jerusalem he left due to the lack of the experimental facilities which he considered necessary for his research.

During the years 1935–38, several great physicists were offered the chair in theoretical physics. Felix Bloch, Eugene Wigner and Fritz London considered the offer seriously, everyone in his turn, after they had to leave their positions in Europe. They all declined after lengthy negotiations for differing personal reasons.
Finally, [[Giulio Racah|Giulio (Yoel) Racah]], a young professor in Pisa, Italy, was appointed. He was highly recommended by his teacher and mentor [[Enrico Fermi]], as well as by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Niels Bohr]] and others. As a Zionist  he was determined to come and teach in Hebrew in Jerusalem.  He turned the theoretical physics department  in Jerusalem into a world center for atomic spectroscopy. He died in an accident in 1965, age 56. Five years later, in 1970, experimental and theoretical physics departments were united into one new Institute named after Racah.

===Early research===
In a series of groundbreaking papers, Racah developed the mathematical methods, which are now textbook methods, for the calculation of  the spectra of complex atoms. This work was carried out in Jerusalem in complete scientific isolation during the years of World War II. In this work he pioneered the use of symmetries and group theory for these calculations. Theoretical atomic spectroscopy was also the subject of most of his students and visitors. However, some of his best students started to apply his elaborate methods to the young science of nuclear spectroscopy. In Jerusalem, Nissan Zeldes, who became the world expert in the theory of nuclear masses, and Gideon Rakavy. Two of Racah's students, Amos de-Shalit and Igal Talmi, became the world leaders in theoretical nuclear spectroscopy. They founded the nuclear physics department at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovoth.
As mentioned, experimental physics was carried out from the late 1920s, first by Sambursky in atomic spectroscopy then by Alexander and Wolfson in X-ray spectroscopy, crystallography and optics.
In 1950 William Low (Ze'ev Lev), who was a student of Charles Townes in the United States,  joined the experimental physics. He started new fields of research in Jerusalem. Starting to work on microwaves, he then set up a laboratory for magnetic resonance research. He also pioneered cryogenics and laser physics in Jerusalem. Nuclear magnetic resonance followed, including its medical application. Abraham Halperin and Abraham Many, two of  Racah's early graduates, started new research directions in the physics of the solid state. They did experimental research on the optical and electrical properties of insulators and semiconductors, as well as the surface properties of solids. These fields of research were just starting to thrive along with the birth of the transistor. 
An important addition to the experimental group was Solly G. Cohen from England. He joined the physics in 1949 and became its first nuclear experimentalist measuring very long lived radionuclides as well as extremely short lived nuclear states. In the early sixties his interests shifted to the newly discovered Mossbauer effect, and established a research group which turned Jerusalem into a world center in this field.

Many graduates of the Racah Institute (and the physics departments which preceded it) became leading professors and scientists (including a Nobel Laureate)  in Israel and all over the world.
During its existence the Institute enjoyed visits of many important physicists from all over the world. Niels Bohr, Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli, Robert Oppenheimer, John Wheeler and Stephen Hawking, to mention just a few. All Wolf Prize winners and a great number of Nobel Laureates were amongst the visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Zeldes, Nissan,  "Giulio Racah and Theoretical Physics in Jerusalem", Archives in the History of Exact Sciences 63, 289 – 323 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current research===

Current research at the Racah Institute covers the fields of astrophysics, high energy physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, statistical physics, nonlinear physics, biophysics, quantum optics, quantum information and computational neuroscience.

'''Condensed Matter Physics''' at the Racah Institute contains both a strong theoretical and an experimental effort. Most investigations are performed within the expansive field of many-body physics, with particular emphasis on nonequilibrium phenomena, the effects of decoherence and dissipation, the study of low-dimensional systems, and glassy systems, to name but a few subjects. Another direction of research includes statistical physics applied, for example, to reaction diffusion systems, especially in cases where fluctuations have an important effect.

Within the realm of theory, the methods being employed range from various field theoretic methods, both exact and perturbative, to numerical methods and exact methods based on the theory of both classical and quantum integrability. These concepts and methods are applied to a variety of physical systems, such as quantum impurity problems (realized, e.g., in quantum dots), the fractional quantum Hall effect, one-dimensional fermionic gases, Anderson transitions, and superconductivity, including special aspects related to high-Tc superconductivity.

On the experimental side, benefiting from the facilities of the Harvey M. Krueger center for nanoscience and nanotechnology, researchers apply modern measuring and fabrication techniques to study the physics of nano-structures, their application to quantum information processing, the interaction of light and matter, high-Tc superconductivity, and the physics of electron glasses. More specifically, and summarizing but a few of the research directions, researchers study excitonic fluids in semiconductor nanostructures with an eye on both a better physical understanding of their macroscopic quantum coherence properties and possible future applications in electro-optic devices. Josephson junctions are being studied in order to expose and optimize the conditions that allow for long-lived macroscopic quantum coherence, and to clarify the processes that lead to noise and decoherence. Electron glasses are being studied in order to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to their peculiar properties, specifically the interplay of interactions, disorder and nonequilibrium, as well as how these are manifested in transport properties.

'''High Energy Physics''' '''(HEP)''': High Energy research includes both HEP theory and particle phenomenology.

One of the current activities of the High Energy Physics group at the Racah Institute of Physics involves the [[Physical law|fundamental laws of nature]], toucing upon both [[Quantum field theory|Quantum Field Theory]] and [[General relativity]] (Einstein's gravity) together with the [[geometry]] and mathematics which underly them. Evaluation of [[Feynman diagram|Feynman diagrams]] lies at the computational core of Quantum Field Theory, yet despite considerable progress over more than 70 years a general and full theory is not available. Research in the group addresses this issue. This research line grew out of an approach to solving the [[Two-body problem in general relativity|two-body]] problem in Einstein's gravity in the [[Post-Newtonian expansion|post-Newtonian limit]] through a (classical) [[effective field theory]], a problem which is essential for detection of interpretation of [[gravitational waves]]. In this approach Feynman diagrams are used to compute the two-body effective action.

A second research area is focused on physics [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|beyond the Standard Model]] of the  electro-weak and the strong interactions. Examples include models of [[Supersymmetry breaking|Supersymmetry-breaking]] and its mediation to Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, with an emphasize on models whose properties may allow a relatively early discovery at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at CERN, models of extra dimensions and their potential signatures at the LHC and future colliders, as well as their embedding in string theory, the dynamics of Supersymmetric theories and Supersymmetry-breaking, the interplay between gauge theory and its embedding on brane constructions in string theory, the physics of [[Black hole|black holes]] and the early universe in string theory, and its interplay with brane dynamics and gauge theory, e.g. via the [[AdS/CFT correspondence|Anti-de-Sitter/Conformal-Field-Theory correspondence]], as well as various aspects of the underlying structure of string theory.

A third research area addresses [[quantum entanglement]] in [[Quantum field theory|Quantum Field Theory]]. 

'''The Nonlinear and Statistical Physics''' group pursues extensive theoretical and experimental studies, 
trying to understand the behavior of complex non-equilibrium systems. 
The subjects are diverse and span from [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], [[laser]] and [[atomic physics]] to physics of materials and [[biophysics]]. Specific research areas include the fundamental physics of fracture and frictional motion, elasticity of growing objects, theory of large fluctuations in systems far from equilibrium, theory and applications of autoresonance, nonequilibrium statistical physics of ultrashort laser pulse formation, and semiclassical wave packet theory of cavity/circuit quantum electrodynamics and cold atom physics. 

'''Quantum Information''' is researched both experimentally and theoretically at the Racah institute. The experimental implementations include atomic, photonic, semiconductor and superconducting realizations. Entanglement and the production of single photons is actively pursued. On the theoretical side, fundamental questions of entanglement and its characterization are investigated. Another topic of research is the theory of dynamical control of ion traps and Nitrogen vacancies in Diamond.

[[File:Shiva Musée Guimet 22971.jpg|thumb|A Cambodian [[Shiva]] head showing a third eye.]]
The '''third eye''' (also called the '''mind's eye''', or '''inner eye''') is a mystical and [[esoteric]] concept of a speculative invisible eye which provides perception beyond ordinary sight.&lt;ref name=MMM&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Myth and Magic&amp;nbsp;– Volume 19|year=1994|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York, NY|isbn=0839360355|page=2606|editor=Richard Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious overview==
In certain dharmic spiritual traditions the third eye refers to the [[ajna]] (or brow) [[chakra]].&lt;ref name=Saraswati&gt;{{cite book|last=Saraswati|first=Swami Satyananda Saraswati|title=Kundalini iuuuggTantra|year=2001|publisher=Yoga I Publications Trust|location=Bihar, India|isbn=978-8185787152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third eye refers to the gate that leads to inner realms and spaces of [[higher consciousness]]. In [[New Age]] spirituality, the third eye often [[symbol]]izes a state of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] or the evocation of [[mental image]]s having deeply personal [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[psychological]] significance. The third eye is often associated with [[vision (religion)|religious visions]], [[clairvoyance]], the ability to observe [[chakra]]s and [[aura (paranormal)|auras]],&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Chakras'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA:1927 Theosophical Publishing House Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[precognition]], and [[out-of-body experience]]s. People who are claimed to have the capacity to utilize their third eyes are sometimes known as ''seers''.  In [[Hinduism]], the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows. 

In [[Taoism]] and many traditional Chinese religious sects such as Chan (called [[Zen]] in Japanese), "third eye training" involves focusing attention on the point between the eyebrows with the eyes closed, and while the body is in various [[qigong]] postures. The goal of this training is to allow students to tune into the correct "vibration" of the universe and gain a solid foundation on which to reach more advanced meditation levels. Taoism teaches that the third eye, also called the [[mind's eye]], is situated between the two physical eyes, and expands up to the middle of the forehead when opened. Taoism claims that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth [[Chakra]], forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The doctrine of the elixir by R.B. Jefferson Coombe Springs Press 1982 chapter 4. The Archaic Anatomy of Individual Organs.&lt;/ref&gt; In Taoist alchemical traditions, the third eye is the frontal part of the "Upper Dan Tien" (upper cinnabar field) and is given the evocative name "muddy pellet".

According to the Christian teaching of Father [[Richard Rohr]], the concept of the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), "but they know not to confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes—and yet goes further." Rohr refers to this level of awareness as "having the mind of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Rohr, Richard "The Naked Now: Learning to See as the Mystics See", The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8245-2543-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8245-2543-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[H.P. Blavatsky]]&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, ''[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd-hp.htm The Secret Doctrine]'', Vol. 2, 1888, {{ISBN|1-55700-124-3}}, pp. 289-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the third eye is in fact the partially dormant [[pineal gland]], which resides between the two hemispheres of the brain. [[Reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s sense light via a third [[parietal eye]]—a structure associated with the pineal gland—which serves to regulate their [[circadian rhythm]]s, and for navigation, as it can sense the polarization of light. [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claimed that by extending an "etheric tube" from the third eye, it is possible to develop microscopic and telescopic vision.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"/&gt;  It has been asserted by Stephen Phillips that the third eye's microscopic vision is capable of observing objects as small as [[quark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Stephen ''Extrasensory Perception of Quarks'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA 1980 Theosophical Publishing House {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0227-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland.&lt;ref name="Helena Petrovna Blavatsky 1993"&gt;Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'' vol. II, (Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House, 1993), 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Rick Strassman]] has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (dimethyltryptamine), an [[entheogen]] which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.&lt;ref name="strassman"&gt;{{cite book |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule. A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences |last=Strassman |first=Rick J. |authorlink=Rick Strassman |year=2001 |publisher=Park Street |location=Rochester, Vt |isbn=978-0-89281-927-0}} ({{cite web | url=http://rickstrassman.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=60 | title=Chapter summaries | accessdate=27 February 2012}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The use of the phrase ''mind's eye'' does not imply that there is a single or unitary place in the mind or brain where visual consciousness occurs.  Philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] have critiqued this view.&lt;ref&gt;''Consciousness Explained'', Daniel C. Dennett, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991.  {{ISBN|0-316-18065-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others, such as [[Johnjoe McFadden]] of the [[University of Surrey]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the New Zealand-based neurobiologist [[Susan Pockett]],  propose that the brain's [[electromagnetic field]] is consciousness itself, thus causing the perception of a unitary location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unisci.com/stories/20022/0516026.htm Our Conscious Mind Could Be An Electromagnetic Field], UniSci.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surrey.ac.uk/qe/pdfs/cemi_theory_paper.pdf Synchronous Firing and Its Influence on the Brain's Electromagnetic Field: Evidence for an Electromagnetic Field Theory of Consciousness], J.

'''Wageningen University &amp; Research''' (also known as '''Wageningen UR'''; abbreviation: '''WUR''') is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] public university in [[Wageningen]], [[Netherlands]]. It consists of Wageningen University and the former agricultural research institutes (Dienst Landbouwkundig Onderzoek (DLO)) of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Agriculture]]. Wageningen University &amp; Research trains specialists (BSc, MSc and PhD) in life and social sciences and focuses its research on scientific, social and commercial problems in the field of life sciences and natural resources. In the field of life sciences, agricultural and environmental science, the university is considered world-class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2016/subject-ranking/life-sciences#!/paheeact.edu.tw|title=Subject Ranking 2015-2016: life sciences top 100|date=9 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/environmental-studies#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2015 - Environmental Sciences|date=22 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Viviano|first1=Frank|title=This Tiny Country Feeds the World|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/09/holland-agriculture-sustainable-farming/|accessdate=1 September 2017|work=National Geographic|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Times Higher Education World University Rankings'' it is the best university in the [[Netherlands]] and No. 1 worldwide, in agriculture and forestry for 2017 on the [[QS World University Rankings]] charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2016/agriculture-forestry#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2016 - Agriculture &amp; Forestry|date=17 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has about 12,000 students from over 100 countries. It is also a member of the [[Euroleague for Life Sciences]] (ELLS) university network.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}

In 1876 the ''Rijkslandbouwschool'' (National Agricultural College) was established in Wageningen. Due to the development of the training to a higher educational level it changed in 1896 to the ''Hoogere Land- en Boschbouwschool'' (Agricultural and Forestry College) and in 1904 in ''Rijks Hoogere Land-, Tuin- en Boschbouwschool'' (National Agricultural, Horticulture and Forestry College).

In 1918 the school became academic by law (Academic Education Act). The name changed to ''Rijks Landbouw Hoogeschool'' (National Agricultural College). The openings date and official [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|Dies natalis]] is 9 March 1918.

In 1986 the "hogescholen" (comparable to scientific [[institute of technology]]) were renamed to University in a modification of the Academic Education Act. The new name became ''Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen (LUW)'' (Wageningen Agricultural University (WAU)). The 1986 law changes resulted in the use of the name [[Hogeschool#Netherlands|hogeschool]] in the Dutch system to be used exclusively for universities of applied science.

Over the years the research and teaching branched out into life sciences in general; while interest for agriculture as a career opportunity waned. In 1997, when the DLO institutes merged with the university, the new holding was rebranded as Wageningen UR (Wageningen University and Research Centre); with the University being renamed Wageningen University. Under the Dutch laws the University and the institutes had to remain separate legal entities.

In 2006, the university of applied sciences [[Van Hall Larenstein]] became part of Wageningen UR. The idea was to create better collaboration between applied teaching and research at Van Hall and the academic research at Wageningen University. This would also support students to continue with an academic program upon completing their applied degree. However, due to differences in organizational culture and incompatibility of procedures for the different types of higher education, collaboration between the two schools remained problematic. In 2012 it was decided that Van Hall Larenstein would leave Wageningen UR and continue as an independent school once more. In the spring of 2015 the separation was marked by the move of the final Wageningen-based Van Hall Larenstein studies back to [[Velp, Gelderland|Velp]].

In 2009 it was decided that the University would consistently use the English name in its communication. In addition university research could be presented under the name of the university: ''Wageningen University (WU)'' (as an alternative of using the name of the holding Wageningen UR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wageningen Universiteit (WU)|url=http://www.studie.nl/school/W/Wageningen_Universiteit_%28WU%29|publisher=Studie.nl|accessdate=6 March 2013|language=Dutch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107041532/http://www.studie.nl/school/W/Wageningen_Universiteit_(WU)|archive-date=2012-11-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Wageningen UR|url=http://www.wageningenur.nl/en/About-Wageningen-UR/History-of-Wageningen-UR.htm|publisher=Wageningenur.nl|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September 2016 Wageningen University and the research institutes decided to continue as one, jointly brand: ''Wageningen University &amp; Research'' (''WUR''). On 9 March 2018 Wageningen University &amp; Research celebrates her 100 years anniversary. During this year there are many events and festivities around the campus and in the city of Wageningen. 

==Academic profile==
Wageningen University &amp; Research was the first Dutch university or school that was allowed to use the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System]] (ECTS) label. This label is awarded by the [[European Commission]] and guarantees the quality of the study programme. An important consideration is that the university consequently applies the European Credit Transfer System; this promotes the mobility of students within Europe and prevents study delay. The label is an acknowledgement of the international character of the university. Out of 56 European applications in 2005, only three ECTS labels were awarded.

===BSc programmes===

[[File:WUR Orion 100years.jpg|thumb|100 years WUR on the campus]]

On 9 March 2018 Wageningen University &amp; Research celebrates her 100th Dies Natalis. This is the start of the anniversary year with lots of events and festivities. Within the themes of life, food and earth, numerous activities are planned in which science, art, sports and business are brought together. The 100 years WUR events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wur.nl/en/About-Wageningen/100years.htm|title=100 years Wageningen University &amp; Research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; take place at different locations, both inside and outside the campus. 

==Student activities and associations==
[[File:WURwolf.jpg|thumb|The mascot of the university, the WURwolf]]

* '''Aktief Slip''' is the study association for students participating in the study programmes Milieuwetenschappen (BMW), Environmental Sciences (MES), Climate Studies (MCL) and Urban Environmental Management (MUE). The name is in Dutch and originates from the bacteria containing material (active sludge), that is used to clean wastewater. It was founded in 1966.
* '''M.S.V. Alchimica''' is the study association for students Molecular Life Sciences. Since 1970 it has been organising different activities for its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M.S.V. Alchimica|url=http://msvalchimica.nl/site/alchimica/geschiedenis/|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''B.V.W. 'Biologica'''' is the study Association for all Biology Students.
* '''CODON''' is the study Association for all Biotechnology students. Established by the first students of Bioprocesstechnology on 16 September 1991. At that time the association carried the name "BiPS" which was later changed to CODON. The association's main language is Dutch and in the past has been criticised for excluding international students.
* '''Di-Et-Tri''' is the study Association for Nutrition and health students. The name is a play on words for the Dutch word for diet ('dieet').
* '''Genius Loci''' is the study Association for students Landscape Architecture and Spatial Planning. The name reflects the atmosphere of a certain place. It was founded on February 15, 1990 after the merger of two older study programmes.
* '''Heeren XVII''' is the study Association for Agrotechnology students. It was founded on 1 April 1965.
* '''Ipso Facto''' is the study association for the students of International Development Studies and Communication Studies. It was created in 2000 when the study 'international culture techniques' split up in 'international land and water management' and 'international development studies'. 
* '''Licere''' is the study association for the students of the MSc Leisure, Tourism and Environment. It was founded in 2006 and its name means 'Leisure time' in Latin.
* '''Mercurius''' is the study association for students of Management &amp; Consumer studies, Economics &amp; Governance and Health &amp; Society. It was created in 2000 when several study associations merged, but the association celebrated its 50-year anniversary in November 2012, as it considers the Dies Natalis of the former separate associations to be its own Dies Natalis. The association has nearly 900 members, making it one of the largest study associations in Wageningen.
* '''Nicolas Appert''' is the study Association for Food Technology students. It was founded on 6 September 1962, and was named after the French food scientist [[Nicolas Appert]].
* '''Nitocra''' is the study association for students International land and water management.
* '''Pyrus''' is the study association for students Soil, water and atmosphere.
* '''Semper Florens''' is the study Association for Plant Scientists and Plant Biotechnologists.
* '''StEL''' is the study Association for Organic Agriculture students.
* '''WSBV Sylvatica''' is the study Association for students Forest and Nature conservation. It is the oldest study association in Wageningen, founded in 1939.
* '''De Veetelers''' is the study association for Animal Sciences students. The name means "Animal Breeders". It was founded in 1962.

'''''Walden Two''''' is a [[utopian novel]] written by [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral]] psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]], first published in 1948.  In its time, it could have been considered [[science fiction]], since science-based methods for altering people's behavior did not yet exist.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1986). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1348231/pdf/jeabehav00047-0109.pdf "Some Thoughts About the Future"]. ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior'', '''45'''(2), p. 229. "What the protagonist in ''Walden Two'' called a behavioral technology was at the time still science fiction, but it soon moved into the real world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1948). ''Walden Two.'' Indianapolis: [[Hackett Publishing Company]]. Revised 1976 edition, page vi. {{ISBN|0-87220-779-X}}. "The 'behavioral engineering' I had so frequently mentioned in the book was, at the time, little more than science fiction".&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods  are now known as [[applied behavior analysis]].

''Walden Two'' is controversial because its characters speak of a rejection of [[free will]],&lt;ref&gt;Aschner, Mary Jane McCue (1965). "The Planned Man: Skinner". ''The Educated Man: Studies in the History of Educational Thought.'' Paul Nash, Andreas M. Kazamias, and Henry J. Perkinson (Editors). [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], pp. 389–421. "Public reaction to ''Walden Two'', with its proposal for planned man, was initially slow. But eventually Skinner found himself at the storm center of a controversy that has scarcely abated to this day.  Philosophers and psychologists charged into the latest jousting match in the perennial tourney between proponents of determinism and defenders of free will". p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; including a rejection of the proposition that human behavior is controlled by a non-corporeal entity, such as a [[spirit]] or a [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivie, Stanley D. (2006). "Models and Metaphors". [http://www.journalofphilosophyandhistoryofeducation.com/jophe56.pdf ''Journal of Philosophy and History of Education'' '''56'''], pp. 82–92. Retrieved August 23, 2012. "Skinner’s system does not provide for a God or a human soul". p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Walden Two'' embraces the proposition that the behavior of organisms, including humans, is [[Determinism|determined]] by environmental variables,&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1938). ''[[The Behavior of Organisms|The Behavior of Organisms: An Experimental Analysis]].'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: B.F. Skinner Foundation. {{ISBN|1-58390-007-1}}, {{ISBN|0-87411-487-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that systematically altering environmental variables can generate a sociocultural system that very closely approximates [[utopia]].&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F.

==Synopsis==
The [[first-person narrator]] and [[protagonist]], Professor Burris, is a university instructor of psychology, who is approached by two young men (one a former student) sometime in the late 1940s. The young men are recent veterans of [[World War II]] and, intrigued by [[utopian]]ism, express interest in an old acquaintance of Burris, named T. E. Frazier, who in the 1930s started an [[intentional community]] that still thrives. Burris contacts Frazier, who invites them all to stay for several days to experience life in the supposedly utopian community. Venturing to the community, named Walden Two, the young men bring their girlfriends and Burris brings along a colleague named Professor Castle, who teaches philosophy and ethics.

The rest of the book proceeds largely as a [[novel of ideas]], mostly involving Frazier, a smug, talkative, and colorful character, guiding his new visitors around Walden Two and proudly explaining its socio-politico-economic structures and collectivist achievements. A wide range of intellectual topics such as [[behavioral modification]], [[political ethics]], [[educational philosophy]], [[sexual equality]] (specifically, advocacy for [[women in the workforce]]), the [[common good]], [[historiography]], [[political freedom|freedom]] and [[free will]], the [[problem of free will|dilemma of determinism]], [[fascism]], [[American democracy]], and [[Soviet communism]] are discussed and often debated among the self-satisfied Frazier, the skeptical and doubting Castle, and the quietly intrigued Burris.

In effect, Walden Two operates using a flexible design, by continually testing the most successful, evidence-based strategies in order to organize the community. Frazier argues that Walden Two thus avoids the way that most societies collapse or grow dysfunctional: by remaining dogmatically rigid in their politics and social structure. He verifies Walden Two's success by pointing to its members' overall sense of happiness and freedom&amp;mdash;thanks in part to a program of "[[behavioral engineering]]" begun at birth. Despite these behavior-guiding procedures during childhood, the adults of Walden Two indeed appear to be legitimately peaceful, productive, and happy people; they also appear to govern the course of their own lives.

Frazier delightedly explains that Walden Two's decision-making system is not authoritarian, anarchic, or even democratic. Except for a small fluctuating group of community organizers, called Planners (temporarily including Frazier), Walden Two has no real governing body; certainly, the Planners have no power to exercise violent force on the community, a feature that Frazier often praises. Each member of the community is apparently self-motivated, with an amazingly relaxed work schedule of only four average hours of work a day, directly supporting the common good and accompanied by the freedom to select a fresh new place to work each day. The members then use the large remainder of their  time to engage in creative or recreational activities of their own choosing. The only money is a simple system of points that buys greater leisure periods in exchange for less desirable labor. Members automatically receive ample food and sleep, with higher needs met by nurturing one's artistic, intellectual, and athletic interests, ranging from music to literature and from chess to tennis. 

As Burris and the other visitors tour the grounds, they discover that certain radically unusual customs have been established in Walden Two, quite bizarre to the American mainstream, but showing apparent success in the long run. Some of these customs include that children are raised communally, families are non-nuclear, free affection is the norm, and personal expressions of thanks are taboo. Such behavior is mandated by the community's individually self-enforced "Walden Code", a guideline for self-control techniques, which encourages members to credit all individual and other achievements to the larger community, while requiring minimal strain. [[Community counselors]] are also available to supervise behavior and assist members with better understanding and following the Code.

Excitedly, two of the young visitors sign up and are soon admitted as permanent members. Castle, though, has fostered a growing hunch that Frazier is somehow presenting a sham society or is in fact, secretly, a dictator. Defending the virtues of democracy, Castle finally confronts Frazier directly, accusing him of [[despotism]], though he has no definitive proof. Frazier rebuts, on the contrary, that the vision for Walden Two is as a place safe from all forms of despotism, even the "despotism of democracy". 

At some points, Frazier and Burris have pleasant talks in private, with Frazier revealing that other communities loosely associated with Walden Two have now cropped up, the most recent being Walden Six. Although enticed by Walden Two's obvious success as a peaceful community, Burris finds it difficult to look past Frazier's irritating pride and boastfulness about the community. During one conversation, Frazier admits to being boastful, but argues that his personality should not influence Burris's opinion of Walden Two and his own observations. By the end of their stay, the remaining visitors leave the community in a mostly impressed state of wonder, except for Castle, who has stubbornly settled on the idea that, somehow, Frazier is a scoundrel and the community is fraudulent. 

During the visitors' trip back to the university, Burris ultimately decides in an inspired moment that he wishes to fully embrace the Walden Two lifestyle. Quickly abandoning his professorial post, Burris travels back in a long and spiritually satisfying journey on foot; he is welcomed once again to Walden Two with open arms.

==The community==
The novel describes "an experimental community called Walden Two".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1985). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741768/pdf/behavan00064-0007.pdf "News From Nowhere, 1984"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''8'''(1), pp. 5–14. "My name is Burris. I live in an experimental community called Walden Two". p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altus"&gt;Altus, Deborah E., and Morris, Edward K. (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2778813/pdf/bhan-32-02-319.pdf "B. F. Skinner's Utopian Vision: Behind and Beyond ''Walden Two''"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''32'''(2), pp. 319–335. B. F. Skinner regarded ''Walden Two'' as his "book about an experimental community". p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The community is located in a rural area and "has nearly a thousand members".&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The community encourages its members "to view every habit and custom with an eye to possible improvement" and to have "a constantly experimental attitude toward everything".&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The culture of Walden Two can be changed if experimental evidence favors proposed changes. The community emulates (on a communal scale) the [[simple living]] and [[self-sufficiency]] that [[Henry David Thoreau]] practiced (on an individual scale) at [[Walden Pond]], as described in his 1854 book ''[[Walden]]''. Walden Two engages in behavioral engineering of young children that aims toward cooperative relationships and the erasure of competitive sentiments. The community has also dissolved the [[nuclear family]] through placing the responsibility of child-rearing in the hands of the larger community and not just the child's parents or immediate family.

==Community governance==
Walden Two consists of four loose classes or groupings of people by occupation (though they are not akin to strict [[economic class]]es): ''Planners'', ''Managers'', ''Workers'', and ''Scientists''. Walden&amp;nbsp;Two has a constitution that provides for a “''Board of Planners''”, which is Walden&amp;nbsp;Two’s “only government”,&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"&gt;''Walden Two,'' p.&amp;nbsp;48.&lt;/ref&gt; though the power they wield only amounts to that, approximately, of community organizers. The “Board of Planners” was conceived of while Walden&amp;nbsp;Two was still in its earliest theoretical stages, and there are “six Planners, usually three men and three women”,&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; who are “charged with the success of the community. They make policies, review the work of the Managers (heads of each area of labor), keep an eye on the state of the nation in general. They also have certain judicial functions.”&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A Planner “may serve for ten years, but no longer.”&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A vacancy on the Board of Planners is filled by the Board "from a pair of names supplied by the Managers".&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; Furthermore, the Walden&amp;nbsp;Two constitution “can be changed by a unanimous vote of the Planners and a two-thirds vote of the Managers”.&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two,'' p.&amp;nbsp;254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazier and five other people constitute the current Board of Planners during Burris’s visit to Walden&amp;nbsp;Two. Planners hold office in staggered, limited terms. They do not rule with any kind of force and are so extremely opposed to creating a [[cult of personality]], system of favoritism, or other possibilities for corruption going against the common good that they do not even publicly announce their office, and, likewise, most of the community members do not bother to know the Planners' identities. Due to this and also as a result of this, the Planners live as modestly as the other members of the community; ostentatious displays of wealth and status simply have no opportunity to arise from Walden&amp;nbsp;Two’s [[egalitarian]] cultural structure.

Managers, meanwhile, are “specialists in charge of the divisions and services of Walden&amp;nbsp;Two”.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 48"/&gt; A member of the community can “work up to be a Manager – through intermediate positions which carry a good deal of responsibility and provide the necessary apprenticeship”.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 49"&gt;''Walden Two'', p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Managers are not elected by the members of Walden Two in any kind of democratic process.&lt;ref name="Walden Two, p. 49"/&gt; The method of selecting Managers is not specified, though they are likely appointed by the Board of Planners.

The regular community members are known (though only for official reasons) as Workers, and they have the flexible option of changing their field and location of employment every single day, so as not to grow bored or stagnant during the week with their four-on-average daily hours of work. Available work often includes the necessary physical labor that goes into maintaining a community, such as basic building or repairing projects, cleaning duties, or agricultural work. Labor in Walden&amp;nbsp;Two operates using a simple point system of units called “credits”, in which more menial or unpleasant jobs (such as waste management) earn a Worker a higher number of credits than more relaxing or interesting jobs, ultimately allowing more free time for that Worker.

The final grouping within Walden&amp;nbsp;Two is the Scientists, who conduct experiments “in plant and animal breeding, the control of infant behavior, educational processes of several sorts, and the use of some of [Walden Two’s] raw materials”.&lt;ref&gt;''Walden Two'', pp.&amp;nbsp;49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists are the least discussed group in the novel; little is said about the selection, total number, specific duties, or methods of the Scientists, though they presumably carry out the ongoing social experiments that help determine the most beneficial social strategies for the community.

==Thoreau's ''Walden''==
''Walden&amp;nbsp;Two'''s title is a direct reference to [[Henry David Thoreau]]’s book ''[[Walden]]''. In the novel, the Walden&amp;nbsp;Two Community is mentioned as having the benefits of living in a place like Thoreau’s Walden, but “with company”. It is, as the book says, ‘Walden for two’ – meaning a place for achieving personal self-actualization, but within a vibrant community, rather than in a place of solitude. Originally, Skinner indicated that he wanted to title it ''The Sun is but a Morning Star'', a quote of the last sentence of Thoreau’s ''Walden'',&lt;ref name=morningstar&gt;{{cite book |author=Thoreau, Henry David |year=1854 |url=https://archive.org/details/waldenorlifeinwo1854thor |title=Walden; or, Life in the woods |location=Boston, Massachusetts |publisher=[[Ticknor and Fields]] |quote=The sun is but a morning star. |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the publishers suggested the current title as an alternative.

In theory and in practice, Thoreau’s Walden Pond experiment and the fictive Walden&amp;nbsp;Two experiment were far different from one another: For instance, Thoreau’s book ''Walden'' espouses the virtues of self-reliance at the individual level, while ''Walden&amp;nbsp;Two'' espouses
# the virtues of self-reliance at the community level, and
# Skinner’s underlying premise that free will of the individual is weak&lt;br/&gt;compared to how environmental conditions [[Shaping (psychology)|shape]] behavior.

The cover of ''Walden Two'', shown above, includes an ‘O’ filled with yellow ink, with yellow lines radiating from the center of the ‘O’. That Sun-like ‘O’ is an allusion to the proposition that ''The sun is but a morning star''.&lt;ref name=morningstar/&gt;

==''News From Nowhere, 1984''==
Skinner published a follow-up to ''Walden Two'' in an essay titled ''News From Nowhere, 1984''. It details the discovery of Eric Blair in the community who seeks out and meets Burris, confessing his true identity as [[George Orwell]]. Blair seeks out Frazier as the 'leader' and the two have discussions which comprise the essay. Blair was impressed by Walden Two's "lack of any institutionalized government, religion, or economic system", a state of affairs that embodied "the dream of nineteenth-century [[anarchism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1985). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2741768/pdf/behavan00064-0007.pdf "News From Nowhere, 1984"]. ''The Behavior Analyst,'' '''8'''(1), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real-world efforts==
Many efforts to create a Walden Two in real life are detailed in Hilke Kuhlmann's ''Living Walden Two''&lt;ref&gt;Kuhlmann, Hilke (2005). ''Living Walden Two.'' [[University of Illinois Press]]. {{ISBN|0-252-02962-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Daniel W. Bjork's ''B.F. Skinner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=B.F.

Twin Oaks is detailed in [[Kat Kinkade]]'s book, ''A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community''.&lt;ref&gt;Kinkade, Kathleen (1973). ''A Walden Two experiment: The first five years of Twin Oaks Community''. [[William Morrow and Company]]. {{ISBN|0-688-00020-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally started as a Walden Two community, it has since rejected its Walden Two position, however it still uses its modified Planner-Manager system as well as a system of labor credits based on the book.

Los Horcones does not use the Planner-Manager governance system described in ''Walden Two.''  They refer to their governance system as a "personocracy".&lt;ref&gt;Comunidad Los Horcones (February 25, 2012). [http://directory.ic.org/715/Comunidad_Los_Horcones "Communities Directory"]. [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]], Retrieved August 23, 2012. "We value the participation of all members in decision making. We call our organization 'personocracy'".&lt;/ref&gt; This system has been "developed through ongoing experimentation".&lt;ref&gt;Sanguinetti, Angela (2012).

''Behavior and Social Issues,'' 21, pp. 5-25. "The ''Walden Two''-inspired community of Los Horcones in Sonora, Mexico, proclaims an egalitarian system of governance developed through ongoing experimentation, called 'Personocracy' (Los Horcones), which they describe as equitable and unrestricted access to power, participation, and responsibility." p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Twin Oaks, Los Horcones "has remained strongly committed to an [[Experimental analysis of behavior|experimental science of human behavior]] and has described itself as the only true Walden Two community in existence."&lt;ref&gt;Lamal, Peter (2009).

Skinner said that  Los Horcones "comes closest to the idea of the 'engineered utopia' that he put forth in ''Walden Two"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/07/science/isolated-desert-community-lives-by-skinner-s-precepts.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm| author=Rohter, Larry| title=Isolated Desert Community Lives by Skinner's Precepts| publisher=''The New York Times''| date=November 7, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural engineering==
Skinner wrote about cultural engineering in at least two books, devoting a chapter to it in both ''Science and Human Behavior'' and ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]''. In ''Science and Human Behavior''&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1953). [http://www.bfskinner.org/BFSkinner/PDFBooksSHB_files/Science_and_Human_Behavior_1.pdf ''Science and Human Behavior''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108010009/http://www.bfskinner.org/bfskinner/PDFBooksSHB_files/Science_and_Human_Behavior_1.pdf |date=2013-01-08 }}, Chapter XXVIII: "Designing a Culture". Cambridge, Massachusetts: B.F. Skinner Foundation. Paperback edition: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] (March 1, 1965). {{ISBN|0029290406}}, {{ISBN|978-0029290408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a chapter is titled "Designing a Culture" and expands on this position as well as in other documents. In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' there are many indirect references to ''Walden Two'' when describing other cultural designs.

==Criticisms==
Hilke Kuhlmann's ''Living Walden Two'' possesses many subtle and not-so-subtle criticisms of the original ''Walden Two'' which are related to the actual efforts that arose from the novel. One criticism is that many of the founders of real-life Walden Twos identified with, or wanted to emulate, Frazier, the uncharismatic and implicitly despotic founder of the community.

In a critique of ''Walden Two,'' Harvey L. Gamble, Jr. asserted that Skinner's "fundamental thesis is that individual traits are shaped from above, by social forces that create the environment", and that Skinner's goal "is to create a frictionless society where individuals are properly socialized to function with others as a unit", and to thus "make the community [Walden Two] into a perfectly efficient [[anthill]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Harvey L., Jr., (1999). [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-54552225/walden-two-postmodern-utopia.html "''Walden Two,'' Postmodern Utopia, and the Problems of Power, Choice, and the Rule of Law".] ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language,'' 41(1), p. 3. Retrieved September 19, 2009 from accessmylibrary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Gamble writes, "We find at the end of ''Walden Two'' that Frazier [a founding member of Walden Two]... has sole control over the political system and its policies. It is he who regulates food, work, education, and sleep, and who sets the moral and economic agenda." However, contrary to Gamble's critique, it should be noted that neither Frazier nor any other person has the ''sole'' power to amend the constitution of Walden Two.  See the "Community governance" section, above.

There are several varieties of behaviorism but only Skinner’s radical behaviorism, has proposed to redesign society. The relevant principles were expounded at length two decades later in a best-seller ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' (1971).

''Walden Two'' was criticized in John Staddon's ''The New Behaviorism''.&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, John (2014)  ''The New Behaviorism'' (2nd edition)  Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner thought ''Walden Two'' an accomplishment comparable to two science-fiction classics: [[Aldous Huxley]]’s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1931) and [[George Orwell]]’s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949).  He assigned all three in his Nat Sci 114 introductory psychology course at Harvard.  There is some irony in Skinner’s choice, because Orwell’s and Huxley’s novels are both dystopias.  They portray not the supposed benefits of a technological approach to human society, but the evil consequences of either coercive (''Nineteen Eighty-Four'') or stealthy (''Brave New World'') efforts to control or gentle human beings.  On the contrary, ''Walden Two'' is supposed to light the technological path to utopia.

Skinner’s Walden proposal is in a tradition that goes back to Plato’s philosopher king: a ‘legislator’ (monarch) and a set of guardians who are wiser than the common people.  The guardians “are to be a class apart, like the Jesuits in old Paraguay, the ecclesiastics in the States of the Church until 1870 and the Communist Party in the U.S.S.R. at the present day,” wrote [[Bertrand Russell]], one of Skinner’s heroes, in 1946.   Not too different from Walden Two’s Managers and Planners, and Frazier, Skinner’s avatar and leader of the community.  Skinner was quite explicit about the need for technocratic rule: “We must delegate control of the population as a whole to specialists – to police, priests, teachers, therapies, and so on, with their specialized reinforcers and their codified contingencies.”&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond freedom and dignity'', 1971, August Psychology Today 37-81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wistarburg sign.jpg|thumb|Wistarburg Glass Works roadsign]]
The ''' Wistarburg Glass Works ''' (sometimes spelled '''Wistarburgh Glass Works'''; also known as the ''' United Glass Company''') was the first successful glass factory and  [[joint venture|joint-venture]] enterprise in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], referred to as Colonial America. [[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]] founded the glass works company in 1739. He began by recruiting experienced glass artisans from Europe, and built homes for the workers along with a mansion for the factory's foreman. Wistar also had a [[company store]] built near the factory.

The village that developed around the factory adopted Wistar's name, and became known as Wistarburg. The village was in [[Salem County, New Jersey]], in the township of [[Alloway Township, New Jersey|Alloway]]. Wistar's factory produced thousands of glass bottles per year, as well as [[flat glass|window glass]]. Wistar was a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]], and made glass globes for Franklin's electricity-producing machines used for scientific research. Wistar's son inherited the business and his son, Wistar's grandson, eventually gained control of the company, but owing to his mismanagement it closed.

==Company foundation==
[[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]] (1696–1752) emigrated from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palitinate region of Germany]] to Philadelphia in 1717. There he began making brass buttons, which he would take with him on sales visits to [[Salem County, New Jersey]]. On one such trip he noticed that the township of [[Alloway Township, New Jersey|Alloway]] had an abundant supply of the necessary materials for glass manufacture&amp;nbsp;– white sand, clay, wood, and accessible waterways of the nearby [[Deep Run (Alloway Creek)|Deep Run]] and [[Alloway Creek]] rivers for transporting raw materials in and finished products out. He was thus encouraged to establish a glass factory there.&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-american-glass.com/wistarburgh-glass.html |first1=J. Victor |last1=Owen |publisher=Historical American Glass |title=The United Glass Company located at Wistarburg |access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pierce|1960|page=97}} Wistar's was not the first to be built in colonial America. Earlier establishments had been setup at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607 and 1621. They were founded to export glass items to England, but ultimately failed, having produced little, if any, glass.&lt;ref name=JamestownGlassmaking&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/learn/historyculture/glassmaking-at-jamestown.htm |title=Glassmaking at Jamestown |work=Historic Jamestowne |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wistar's button-making business proved to be a success, and together with his gains from speculating in land allowed him to accumulate sufficient capital to fund a new enterprise. He began his glass-making venture in 1737 by buying {{convert|2000|acres}} of land about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Salem, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=CreekLocation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/7926-2/past-exhibitions/1987-to-1989-exhibitions/1989-the-wistars-and-their-glass-1739-1777/ |title=The Wistars and their Glass 1739–1777 / Factory Operations |date=2015 |website= |publisher=WheatonArts |access-date=July 22, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced construction of his factory&amp;nbsp;– which became the first commercially successful glass factory in America.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=251}}{{sfn|Cantele|Kaplan|2010|page=275}} He arranged in January 1738 to lease {{convert|50|acres|ha}} of land containing {{convert|18000|cord}} of wood from John Ladd, a local landowner.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=155}} Wistar then recruited four experienced glass makers from the Palitinate region of Germany&amp;nbsp;– C. Halter, S. Griessmeyer, J. Wentzel, and J. Halter&amp;nbsp;– to make the factory operational. He organized a joint venture with them, dividing profits in exchange for the art of glass making. The four artisans were to teach this art to the Wistars and nobody else in the colonies.&lt;ref name=Cradle&gt;{{cite news |last=Cunningham |first=John T. |date=July 2, 1964 |title=Cradle of American Glass |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17268234/|work=Bernardsville News |location= Bernardsville, New Jersey |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wistar had arranged for their journey to America, and they arrived in Philadelphia from [[Rotterdam]] on the ship ''Two Sisters'' in September 1738.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=164-167}}{{efn|There are no historical records that tell whether the two Halters were related.&lt;ref name=related&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/7926-2/past-exhibitions/1987-to-1989-exhibitions/1989-the-wistars-and-their-glass-1739-1777/|title=The Wistars and their Glass 1739–1777 |date=2017 |publisher=Wheaton Arts and cultural center |access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wistar had houses built near the factory to rent for the key artisans and other workers that were usually [[Indentured servitude|indentured immigrants]].{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=169}} He also had a mansion constructed for the factory's foreman, which also served as a lodging and office for Wistar while on his visits to the factory from his home in Philadelphia. A [[company store]] was constructed for the workers' needs. Products could be purchased on credit against the glass a worker would make in the future; a bookkeeper was employed to keep track of the store accounts and housing rents. The store also served the people of the village of Alloway, and was the center of community life.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=170}}

==Joint venture==
Wistar entered into a [[profit sharing|profit-sharing]] arrangement with the four German artisans who had helped to make his new factory operational. To ensure their continuing support he set up a [[joint venture]] between five members, the first cooperative manufacturing joint-venture business in America and the first long-term successful glasshouse. The 1739 company began trading as the United Glass Company, which consisted of three individual joint ventures. Wistar was the general manager and primary share holder, with a two-thirds majority ownership in each of the joint ventures.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=165}} The four Germans held one-third ownership and shared the expenses, assets, and profits of the three individual joint ventures. The first entity under the umbrella enterprise was held between Wistar and Wentzel, the second between Wistar and C. Halter, and the third between Wistar, Griesmeyer and J. Halter. The joint venture arrangement remained in effect until Wistar's death in 1752.&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CMG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/artwork/bottle-seal-richard-wistar |title=Bottle with the Seal of Richard Wistar |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |access-date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GlassHouse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peachridgeglass.com/2013/09/the-united-glass-company-located-at-wistarburgh/ |publisher=Peachridge Glass |title=The United Glass Company located at Wistarburg |date=September 24, 2013 |first2=Ferdinand, V, |last2=Meyer |first1=Stephen |last1=Atkinson |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HAG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-american-glass.com/wistarburgh-glass.html |title= The United Glass Company located at Wistarburgh|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=A History of  Early American made Glass |publisher=Historical American Glass |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Franklin machine globe.jpg|thumb|Glass globes for [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|Benjamin Franklin's electrostatic machines]] were made by Wistarburg Glass Works.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=65}}]]
Wistar's factory produced about 15,000 glass bottles per year made in the [[Waldglas]] style, which had been a way of making glass in Europe since the Middle Ages. It was an inexpensive traditional method whereby the main materials of wood ash and sand produced a greenish-yellow glass. The factory produced window glass and was the first American supplier for the thirteen colonies.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=94}} The Glass House (as it was often called) also produced rum flasks and tableware.{{sfn|Time Inc|1955|p=58}} Wistar had unlimited access to white [[silica sand]], as well as other necessary materials, and the company's success was further aided by New Jersey's low taxation; Wistar was easily able to obtain more assets for the business.&lt;ref name=lowtaxes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=1 |title=Caspar Wistar established the first successful glass manufacturing business in North America |last1=Kummer|first1=Insa |date=2014 |website=Immigrant Entrepreneurship |publisher=[[German Historical Institute]] |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wistar lived in Philadelphia, and was aware that the British did not allow the manufacture of certain items that were in competition with those imported from Britain. He therefore downplayed the profits from his glass business, so as to avoid arousing the suspicions of the British. Wistar ran his business affairs from Philadelphia, spending little time in Alloway. He sold the manufactured glass products through his store in Philadelphia, the Wistarburg company store, and his son Richard's store in New York City.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=100}}

Wistar was friends with [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Philadelphia and made glass globes for [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|Franklin's electricity producing machines]], used for scientific research into electricity.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=65}} Franklin built several of his machines, using the Wistarburg glass globes, for [[Cadwallader Colden]] and [[Lewis Evans (surveyor)|Lewis Evans]], for which they paid him between ten and twelve pounds each.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=75}} The Wistarburg Glass Works also made glass tubes for [[David Rittenhouse]] to use in his experiments on electricity.{{sfn|Davis|2012|p=27}}

Wistar died of [[dropsy]] in Philadelphia on March 21, 1752,{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=170}} and his son Richard took over the glass works. Richard also mostly ran the business from Philadelphia, but worked on increasing sales and expanding the company's product range. Just like his father, he relied on hired artisans to run the glass works factory in Alloway. The glass enterprise continued into the 1770s, but struggled owing to deforestation around Wistarburg. Wood from the trees was needed as fuel to run the glass furnaces, and when supplies began to run short some of the company's key artisans resigned and went to start their own glass company in [[Glassboro, New Jersey]], where there were new uncut forests and plenty of wood. Richard also had personal problems that occupied much of his time, and financial difficulties caused by the Revolutionary War; in an attempt to make ends meet, he sold a major portion of his father's New Jersey real estate.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=100}} Richard died in 1781, and his son John took over the business. John failed to devote the effort necessary to run the glass works, allowing it to go into serious decline and ultimately it went out of business. The final year of the enterprise is disputed by scholars, but it is known that in 1793 the property that the factory was on was divided up among Richard's heirs and sold in parcels.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=156}}
