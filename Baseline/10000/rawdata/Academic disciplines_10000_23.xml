      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20540">In the pre-modern tradition, the '''aesthetics of music''' or '''musical aesthetics''' explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

The critic uses a range of aesthetic evaluation tools to write their review. They may assess the tone of the orchestra, the tempos that the conductor chose for the symphony movements, the taste and judgement showed by the conductor in their creative choices, and even the selection of pieces which formed the concert program.]]

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of [[philosophy]]. In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener. Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental [[tone poem]]s, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music. Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a system of tuning called [[just intonation]].

Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''The Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

== History: Aesthetics and European classical music ==

=== 18th century ===
In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in [[William Hogarth]]'s treatise ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]''. He considered [[dance]] beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers.

However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance. [[Immanuel Kant]], whose ''Critique of Judgment'' is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial. Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose. To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the era of [[romanticism]] in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot. Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 [[E. T. A. Hoffman]] argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition. Five years later, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality.

Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer's linking of music and metaphysics. The mainstream consensus endorsed music's capacity to represent particular emotions and situations. In 1832, composer [[Robert Schumann]] stated that his piano work [[Papillons]] was "intended as a musical representation" of the final scene of a novel by [[Jean Paul]], ''[[Flegeljahre]]''. The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the [[Formalism (music)|formalism]] of [[Eduard Hanslick]], setting off the "War of the Romantics."

This fight divided the aesthetics into two competing groups: On one side are formalists (e.g., Hanslick), who emphasize that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side are the anti-formalists, such as [[Richard Wagner]], who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends.

=== 20th century ===
A group of [[modernism|modernist]] writers in the early 20th century (including the poet [[Ezra Pound]]) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn't represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself. In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick's ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music. (Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included [[Albert Schweitzer]], who argued against the alleged 'purity' of music in a classic work on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music.

Among 20th-century composers, [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy. When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing "is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything. He can say nothing whatever about meanings" (Stravinsky 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;115). Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience.

The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' music, now understood to align with the distinction between [[art music]] and [[popular music]], respectively. [[Theodor Adorno]] suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more 'difficult' and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life. [[False consciousness|False needs]] are cultivated in people by the culture industries. These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people's 'true' needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness. Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary). 

Beginning with [[Peter Kivy]]'s work in the 1970s, [[analytic philosophy]] has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music. Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty. Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music. He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of [[authentic performance]] of music (1995).

== Popular music ==

=== Bad music ===
[[Simon Frith]] (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;17-9) argues that, "'bad music' is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics." He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include "Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can't sing, players who can't play, producers who can't produce," and "Tracks involving genre confusion. The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style." Another type of "bad music" is "rock critical lists," such as "Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty" and "Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song."

Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: [[kitsch]]), and stupid. He argues that "The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as 'bad' is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds. And 'bad' is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters" (p.&amp;nbsp;28). Frith's analysis of popular music is based in sociology.

=== Philosophical aesthetics of popular music ===
[[Theodor Adorno]] was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music. A [[Marxist]], Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music. His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II. As a result, Adorno often uses "jazz" as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from [[Louis Armstrong]] to [[Bing Crosby]]. He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;126).

However good or bad it sounds to its audience, he believed that music is genuinely good only if it challenges society through its role as an inaccessible Other. This function is advanced by musical structure, rather than lyrics. In his opinion, although many popular musicians seem to superficially oppose the political status quo, the use of familiar song forms and the artist's involvement in capitalism results in music that ultimately encourages the audience to accept things as they are - only radically [[experimental music]] can encourage audiences to become critical of prevailing society. However, the [[mass media]] cannot handle the confrontational nature of good music, and offers instead a steady diet of recycled, simplified and politically ineffective music.

Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music. He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996). At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007).

In 2007 musicologist and journalist [[Craig Schuftan]] published ''The Culture Club'', a book drawing links between [[modernism]] art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries. His story involves drawing lines between [[art]], or [[high culture]], and pop, or [[low culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-culture-club-craig-schuftan&lt;/ref&gt; A more scholarly study of the same topic, ''Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde'', was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.

In Germany, the musicologist [[Ralf von Appen]] (2007) has published a book on the aesthetics of popular music that focuses on everyday judgments of popular records. He analyzes the structures and aesthetic categories behind judgments found on amazon.com concerning records by musicians such as Bob Dylan, Eminem, Queens of the Stone Age etc. In a second step, von Appen interprets these findings on the basis of current theoretical positions in the field of philosophical aesthetics.

[[Image:Euclid flowchart.svg|thumb|right| [[Flowchart]] of an algorithm ([[Euclid's algorithm]]) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A yields "yes" (or true) (more accurately the ''number'' ''b'' in location B is greater than or equal to the ''number'' ''a'' in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ← B − A (meaning the number ''b'' − ''a'' replaces the old ''b''). Similarly, IF A &gt; B, THEN A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).]]

In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], an '''algorithm''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-algorithm.ogg|ˈ|æ|l|ɡ|ə|r|ɪ|ð|əm}}) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform [[calculation]], [[data processing]] and [[automated reasoning]] tasks.

As an [[effective method]], an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time&lt;ref&gt;"Any classical mathematical algorithm, for example, can be described in a finite number of English words" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; and in a well-defined formal language&lt;ref&gt;Well defined with respect to the agent that executes the algorithm: "There is a computing agent, usually human, which can react to the instructions and carry out the computations" (Rogers 1987:2).&lt;/ref&gt; for calculating a [[Function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;"an algorithm is a procedure for computing a ''function'' (with respect to some chosen notation for integers) ... this limitation (to numerical functions) results in no loss of generality", (Rogers 1987:1).&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps [[Empty string|empty]]),&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has [[zero]] or more inputs, i.e., [[quantity|quantities]] which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; the instructions describe a [[computation]] that, when [[Execution (computing)|executed]], proceeds through a finite&lt;ref&gt;"A procedure which has all the characteristics of an algorithm except that it possibly lacks finiteness may be called a 'computational method'" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"&lt;ref&gt;"An algorithm has one or more outputs, i.e. quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs" (Knuth 1973:5).&lt;/ref&gt; and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily [[deterministic]]; some algorithms, known as [[randomized algorithms]], incorporate random input.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not a process with random interior processes (not including the input) is an algorithm is debatable. Rogers opines that: "a computation is carried out in a discrete stepwise fashion, without use of continuous methods or analogue devices . . . carried forward deterministically, without resort to random methods or devices, e.g., dice" Rogers 1987:2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries. Greek mathematicians used algorithms in, for example, the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]] for finding prime numbers and the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.&lt;ref name=Cooke2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooke |first=Roger L. |title=The History of Mathematics: A Brief Course |date=2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118460290}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word ''algorithm'' itself derives from the 9th century mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], Latinized ''Algoritmi''. A partial formalization of what would become the modern concept of algorithm began with attempts to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] (decision problem) posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Later formalizations were framed as attempts to define "[[effective calculability]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:274&lt;/ref&gt; or "effective method".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:225&lt;/ref&gt; Those formalizations included the [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]–[[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]–[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]] of 1930, 1934 and 1935, [[Alonzo Church]]'s [[lambda calculus]] of 1936, [[Emil Post]]'s [[Formulation 1]] of 1936, and [[Alan Turing]]'s [[Turing machines]] of 1936–37 and 1939.

The word 'algorithm' has its roots in Latinizing the name of [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] in a first step to ''algorismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Al-Khwarizmi.html|title=Al-Khwarizmi biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etymology of algorithm|url=http://chambers.co.uk/search/?query=algorithm&amp;title=21st|website=Chambers Dictionary|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwārizmī ({{lang-fa|خوارزمی}}, c. 780–850) was a [[Persian people|Persian]]  mathematician, [[astronomer]], [[geographer]], and scholar in the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]], whose name means 'the native of [[Khwarezm]]', a region that was part of [[Greater Iran]] and is now in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="Hogendijk"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jan P. |last=Hogendijk |title=al-Khwarzimi |journal=Pythagoras |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1998 |pages=4–5 |url=http://www.kennislink.nl/web/show?id=116543 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412193516/http://www.kennislink.nl/web/show?id=116543 |archivedate=April 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oaks"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeffrey A.|last=Oaks|url=http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/MHMC.htm|title=Was al-Khwarizmi an applied algebraist?|publisher=[[University of Indianapolis]]|accessdate=May 30, 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5uGLbfttF?url=http://facstaff.uindy.edu/~oaks/MHMC.htm|archive-date=November 15, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 825, al-Khwarizmi wrote an [[Arabic language]] treatise on the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]], which was translated into [[Latin]] during the 12th century under the title ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. This title means "Algoritmi on the numbers of the Indians", where "Algoritmi" was the translator's [[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of Al-Khwarizmi's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brezina| first = Corona| title = Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor Of Algebra| url = https://books.google.com/?id=955jPgAACAAJ| year = 2006| publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group| isbn = 978-1-4042-0513-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Khwarizmi was the most widely read mathematician in Europe in the late Middle Ages, primarily through another of his books, the [[Al-Jabr|Algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Extras/Boyer_Foremost_Text.html Foremost mathematical texts in history], according to [[Carl B. Boyer]].&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Latin, ''algorismus'', English '[[algorism]]', the corruption of his name, simply meant the "decimal number system". In the 15th century, under the influence of the Greek word ἀριθμός 'number' (''cf.'' 'arithmetic'), the Latin word was altered to ''algorithmus'', and the corresponding English term 'algorithm' is first attested in the 17th century; the modern sense was introduced in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third Edition, 2012 [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/4959 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, it was first used in about 1230 and then by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] in 1391. English adopted the French term, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that "algorithm" took on the meaning that it has in modern English.

Another early use of the word is from 1240, in a manual titled ''Carmen de Algorismo'' composed by [[Alexander of Villedieu|Alexandre de Villedieu]]. It begins thus:

{{quote|''Haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur, in qua / Talibus Indorum fruimur bis quinque figuris.''}}
which translates as:
{{quote|Algorism is the art by which at present we use those Indian figures, which number two times five.}}

The poem is a few hundred lines long and summarizes the art of calculating with the new style of Indian dice, or Talibus Indorum, or Hindu numerals.

==Informal definition==
{{about||a detailed presentation of the various points of view on the definition of "algorithm"| Algorithm characterizations}}
An informal definition could be "a set of rules that precisely defines a sequence of operations."&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; which would include all computer programs, including programs that do not perform numeric calculations. Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually.&lt;ref&gt;Stone simply requires that "it must terminate in a finite number of steps" (Stone 1973:7–8).&lt;/ref&gt;

A prototypical example of an algorithm is the [[Euclidean algorithm]] to determine the maximum common divisor of two integers; an example (there are others) is described by the [[flowchart]] above and as an example in a later section.

{{Harvtxt|Boolos|Jeffrey|1974, 1999|ref=CITEREFBoolosJeffrey1999}} offer an informal meaning of the word in the following quotation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No human being can write fast enough, or long enough, or small enough† ( †"smaller and smaller without limit ...you'd be trying to write on molecules, on atoms, on electrons") to list all members of an enumerably infinite set by writing out their names, one after another, in some notation. But humans can do something equally useful, in the case of certain enumerably infinite sets: They can give ''explicit instructions for determining the '''n'''th member of the set'', for arbitrary finite ''n''. Such instructions are to be given quite explicitly, in a form in which ''they could be followed by a computing machine'', or by a ''human who is capable of carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols.''&lt;ref&gt;Boolos and Jeffrey 1974,1999:19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An "enumerably infinite set" is one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the integers. Thus, Boolos and Jeffrey are saying that an algorithm implies instructions for a process that "creates" output integers from an ''arbitrary'' "input" integer or integers that, in theory, can be arbitrarily large. Thus an algorithm can be an algebraic equation such as ''y = m + n'' – two arbitrary "input variables" ''m'' and ''n'' that produce an output ''y''. But various authors' attempts to define the notion indicate that the word implies much more than this, something on the order of (for the addition example):
:Precise instructions (in language understood by "the computer")&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1972:5&lt;/ref&gt; for a fast, efficient, "good"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7 states: "In practice we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms ... one criterion of goodness is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm ... other criteria are the adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity, and elegance, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; process that specifies the "moves" of "the computer" (machine or human, equipped with the necessary internally contained information and capabilities)&lt;ref&gt;cf Stone 1973:6&lt;/ref&gt; to find, decode, and then process arbitrary input integers/symbols ''m'' and ''n'', symbols ''+'' and ''='' ... and "effectively"&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1973:7–8 states that there must be, "...a procedure that a robot [i.e., computer] can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." Stone adds finiteness of the process, and definiteness (having no ambiguity in the instructions) to this definition.&lt;/ref&gt; produce, in a "reasonable" time,&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, loc. cit&lt;/ref&gt; output-integer ''y'' at a specified place and in a specified format.

The concept of ''algorithm'' is also used to define the notion of [[decidability (logic)|decidability]]. That notion is central for explaining how [[formal system]]s come into being starting from a small set of [[axiom]]s and rules. In [[logic]], the time that an algorithm requires to complete cannot be measured, as it is not apparently related to our customary physical dimension. From such uncertainties, that characterize ongoing work, stems the unavailability of a definition of ''algorithm'' that suits both concrete (in some sense) and abstract usage of the term.

==Formalization==
&lt;!-- [[Computer program]] links here. --&gt;
Algorithms are essential to the way computers process data. Many computer programs contain algorithms that detail the specific instructions a computer should perform (in a specific order) to carry out a specified task, such as calculating employees' paychecks or printing students' report cards. Thus, an algorithm can be considered to be any sequence of operations that can be simulated by a [[Turing reduction|Turing-complete]] system. Authors who assert this thesis include Minsky (1967), Savage (1987) and Gurevich (2000):
&lt;blockquote&gt; Minsky: "But we will also maintain, with Turing . . . that any procedure which could "naturally" be called effective, can, in fact, be realized by a (simple) machine. Although this may seem extreme, the arguments . . . in its favor are hard to refute".&lt;ref name="Minsky 1967:105"&gt;{{harvnb|Minsky|1967|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;Gurevich: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine ... according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational process defined by a Turing machine".&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich 2000:1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Typically, when an algorithm is associated with processing information, data can be read from an input source, written to an output device and stored for further processing. Stored data are regarded as part of the internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more [[data structure]]s.

For some such computational process, the algorithm must be rigorously defined: specified in the way it applies in all possible circumstances that could arise. That is, any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with, case-by-case; the criteria for each case must be clear (and computable).

Because an algorithm is a precise list of precise steps, the order of computation is always crucial to the functioning of the algorithm. Instructions are usually assumed to be listed explicitly, and are described as starting "from the top" and going "down to the bottom", an idea that is described more formally by ''[[control flow|flow of control]]''.

So far, this discussion of the formalization of an algorithm has assumed the premises of [[imperative programming]]. This is the most common conception, and it attempts to describe a task in discrete, "mechanical" means. Unique to this conception of formalized algorithms is the [[assignment operation]], setting the value of a variable. It derives from the intuition of "[[memory]]" as a scratchpad. There is an example below of such an assignment.

For some alternate conceptions of what constitutes an algorithm see [[functional programming]] and [[logic programming]].

===Expressing algorithms===
Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including [[natural language]]s, [[pseudocode]], [[flowchart]]s, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]], [[programming language]]s or [[control table]]s (processed by [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreters]]). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be verbose and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms in a form that can be executed by a computer but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.

There is a wide variety of representations possible and one can express a given [[Turing machine]] program as a sequence of machine tables (see more at [[finite-state machine]], [[state transition table]] and [[control table]]), as flowcharts and [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] (see more at [[state diagram]]), or as a form of rudimentary [[machine code]] or [[assembly code]] called "sets of quadruples" (see more at [[Turing machine]]).

Representations of algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels of Turing machine description:&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:157&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1 High-level description
: "...prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level, we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."
; 2 Implementation description
: "...prose used to define the way the Turing machine uses its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level, we do not give details of states or transition function."
; 3 Formal description
: Most detailed, "lowest level", gives the Turing machine's "state table".

For an example of the simple algorithm "Add m+n" described in all three levels, see [[Algorithm#Examples]].

==Design==

{{See also|Algorithm#By design paradigm}}

Algorithm design refers to a method or mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms is part of many solution theories of [[operation research]], such as [[dynamic programming]] and [[Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer]]. Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called algorithm design patterns,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://ww3.algorithmdesign.net/ch00-front.html|title=Algorithm Design: Foundations, Analysis, and Internet Examples|last1=Goodrich|first1=Michael T.|author1-link=Michael T. Goodrich|last2=Tamassia|first2=Roberto|author2-link=Roberto Tamassia|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-471-38365-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the template method pattern and decorator pattern.

One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient run-time, also known as its [[Big O notation|Big O]].

Typical steps in the development of algorithms:
# Problem definition
# Development of a model
# Specification of the algorithm
# Designing an algorithm
# Checking the correctness of the algorithm
# Analysis of algorithm
# Implementation of algorithm
# Program testing
# Documentation preparation

==Implementation==
[[Image:TTL npn nand.svg|right|thumb|[[Logical NAND]] algorithm implemented electronically in [[7400 series|7400]] chip]]
Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as [[computer programs]]. However, algorithms are also implemented by other means, such as in a [[biological neural network]] (for example, the [[human brain]] implementing [[arithmetic]] or an insect looking for food), in an [[electrical circuit]], or in a mechanical device.

==Computer algorithms==
[[File:Euclid's algorithm structured blocks 1.png|thumb|right|176px|Flowchart examples of the canonical [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini structures]]: the SEQUENCE (rectangles descending the page), the WHILE-DO and the IF-THEN-ELSE. The three structures are made of the primitive conditional GOTO (&lt;tt&gt;IF ''test''=true THEN GOTO step xxx&lt;/tt&gt;) (a diamond), the unconditional GOTO (rectangle), various assignment operators (rectangle), and HALT (rectangle). Nesting of these structures inside assignment-blocks result in complex diagrams (cf Tausworthe 1977:100,114).]]

In [[computer systems]], an algorithm is basically an instance of [[logic]] written in software by software developers, to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce ''output'' from given (perhaps null) ''input''. An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher [[time complexity]]) algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware, are considered technology.

''"Elegant" (compact) programs, "good" (fast) programs '': The notion of "simplicity and elegance" appears informally in [[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] and precisely in [[Gregory Chaitin|Chaitin]]:
:Knuth: ". . .we want ''good'' algorithms in some loosely defined aesthetic sense. One criterion . . . is the length of time taken to perform the algorithm . . .. Other criteria are adaptability of the algorithm to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc"&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:7&lt;/ref&gt;

:Chaitin: " . . . a program is 'elegant,' by which I mean that it's the smallest possible program for producing the output that it does"&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin 2005:32&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaitin prefaces his definition with: "I'll show you can't prove that a program is 'elegant'"—such proof would solve the [[Halting problem]] (ibid).

''Algorithm versus function computable by an algorithm'': For a given function multiple algorithms may exist. This is true, even without expanding the available instruction set available to the programmer. Rogers observes that "It is . . . important to distinguish between the notion of ''algorithm'', i.e. procedure and the notion of ''function computable by algorithm'', i.e. mapping yielded by the procedure. The same function may have several different algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers 1987:1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, there may be a tradeoff between goodness (speed) and elegance (compactness)—an elegant program may take more steps to complete a computation than one less elegant. An example that uses Euclid's algorithm appears below.

''Computers (and computors), models of computation'': A computer (or human "computor"&lt;ref&gt;In his essay "Calculations by Man and Machine: Conceptual Analysis" Seig 2002:390 credits this distinction to Robin Gandy, cf Wilfred Seig, et al., 2002 ''Reflections on the foundations of mathematics: Essays in honor of Solomon Feferman'', Association for Symbolic Logic, A. K Peters Ltd, Natick, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a restricted type of machine, a "discrete deterministic mechanical device"&lt;ref&gt;cf Gandy 1980:126, Robin Gandy ''Church's Thesis and Principles for Mechanisms'' appearing on pp. 123–148 in [[Jon Barwise|J. Barwise]] et al. 1980 ''The Kleene Symposium'', North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; that blindly follows its instructions.&lt;ref&gt;A "robot": "A computer is a robot that performs any task that can be described as a sequence of instructions." cf Stone 1972:3&lt;/ref&gt; Melzak's and Lambek's primitive models&lt;ref&gt;Lambek's "abacus" is a "countably infinite number of locations (holes, wires etc.) together with an unlimited supply of counters (pebbles, beads, etc). The locations are distinguishable, the counters are not". The holes have unlimited capacity, and standing by is an agent who understands and is able to carry out the list of instructions" (Lambek 1961:295). Lambek references Melzak who defines his Q-machine as "an indefinitely large number of locations . . . an indefinitely large supply of counters distributed among these locations, a program, and an operator whose sole purpose is to carry out the program" (Melzak 1961:283). B-B-J (loc. cit.) add the stipulation that the holes are "capable of holding any number of stones" (p. 46). Both Melzak and Lambek appear in ''The Canadian Mathematical Bulletin'', vol. 4, no. 3, September 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced this notion to four elements: (i) discrete, distinguishable ''locations'', (ii) discrete, indistinguishable ''counters''&lt;ref&gt;If no confusion results, the word "counters" can be dropped, and a location can be said to contain a single "number".&lt;/ref&gt; (iii) an agent, and (iv) a list of instructions that are ''effective'' relative to the capability of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;"We say that an instruction is ''effective'' if there is a procedure that the robot can follow in order to determine precisely how to obey the instruction." (Stone 1972:6)&lt;/ref&gt;

Minsky describes a more congenial variation of Lambek's "abacus" model in his "Very Simple Bases for [[Computability]]".&lt;ref&gt;cf Minsky 1967: Chapter 11 "Computer models" and Chapter 14 "Very Simple Bases for Computability" pp. 255–281 in particular&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minsky machine|Minsky's machine]] proceeds sequentially through its five (or six, depending on how one counts) instructions, unless either a conditional IF–THEN GOTO or an unconditional GOTO changes program flow out of sequence. Besides HALT, Minsky's machine includes three ''assignment'' (replacement, substitution)&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:3.&lt;/ref&gt; operations: ZERO (e.g. the contents of location replaced by 0: L ← 0), SUCCESSOR (e.g. L ← L+1), and DECREMENT (e.g. L ← L − 1).&lt;ref&gt;But always preceded by IF–THEN to avoid improper subtraction.&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely must a programmer write "code" with such a limited instruction set. But Minsky shows (as do Melzak and Lambek) that his machine is [[Turing complete]] with only four general ''types'' of instructions: conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment/replacement/substitution, and HALT.&lt;ref&gt;However, a few different assignment instructions (e.g. DECREMENT, INCREMENT, and ZERO/CLEAR/EMPTY for a Minsky machine) are also required for Turing-completeness; their exact specification is somewhat up to the designer. The unconditional GOTO is a convenience; it can be constructed by initializing a dedicated location to zero e.g. the instruction " Z ← 0 "; thereafter the instruction IF Z=0 THEN GOTO xxx is unconditional.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simulation of an algorithm: computer (computor) language'': Knuth advises the reader that "the best way to learn an algorithm is to try it . . . immediately take pen and paper and work through an example".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:4&lt;/ref&gt; But what about a simulation or execution of the real thing? The programmer must translate the algorithm into a language that the simulator/computer/computor can ''effectively'' execute. Stone gives an example of this: when computing the roots of a quadratic equation the computor must know how to take a square root. If they don't, then the algorithm, to be effective, must provide a set of rules for extracting a square root.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1972:5. Methods for extracting roots are not trivial: see [[Methods of computing square roots]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that the programmer must know a "language" that is effective relative to the target computing agent (computer/computor).

But what model should be used for the simulation? Van Emde Boas observes "even if we base [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] on abstract instead of concrete machines, arbitrariness of the choice of a model remains. It is at this point that the notion of ''simulation'' enters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Leeuwen| first = Jan| title = Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science: Algorithms and complexity. Volume A| url = https://books.google.com/?id=-X39_rA3VSQC| year = 1990| publisher = Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-444-88071-0 | page = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When speed is being measured, the instruction set matters. For example, the subprogram in Euclid's algorithm to compute the remainder would execute much faster if the programmer had a "[[modular arithmetic|modulus]]" instruction available rather than just subtraction (or worse: just Minsky's "decrement").

''Structured programming, canonical structures'': Per the [[Church–Turing thesis]], any algorithm can be computed by a model known to be [[Turing complete]], and per Minsky's demonstrations, Turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional GOTO, unconditional GOTO, assignment, HALT. Kemeny and Kurtz observe that, while "undisciplined" use of unconditional GOTOs and conditional IF-THEN GOTOs can result in "[[spaghetti code]]", a programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions; on the other hand "it is also possible, and not too hard, to write badly structured programs in a structured language".&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Kemeny]] and [[Thomas E. Kurtz]] 1985 ''Back to Basic: The History, Corruption, and Future of the Language'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. Reading, MA, {{ISBN|0-201-13433-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe augments the three [[Structured program theorem|Böhm-Jacopini canonical structures]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:101&lt;/ref&gt; SEQUENCE, IF-THEN-ELSE, and WHILE-DO, with two more: DO-WHILE and CASE.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1977:142&lt;/ref&gt; An additional benefit of a structured program is that it lends itself to [[proof of correctness|proofs of correctness]] using [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973 section 1.2.1, expanded by Tausworthe 1977 at pages 100ff and Chapter 9.1&lt;/ref&gt;

''Canonical flowchart symbols&lt;ref&gt;cf Tausworthe 1977&lt;/ref&gt;'': The graphical aide called a [[flowchart]], offers a way to describe and document an algorithm (and a computer program of one). Like the program flow of a Minsky machine, a flowchart always starts at the top of a page and proceeds down. Its primary symbols are only four: the directed arrow showing program flow, the rectangle (SEQUENCE, GOTO), the diamond (IF-THEN-ELSE), and the dot (OR-tie). The Böhm–Jacopini canonical structures are made of these primitive shapes. Sub-structures can "nest" in rectangles, but only if a single exit occurs from the superstructure. The symbols, and their use to build the canonical structures are shown in the diagram.

===Algorithm example===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|right|An animation of the [[quicksort|quicksort algorithm]] sorting an array of randomized values. The red bars mark the pivot element; at the start of the animation, the element farthest to the right-hand side is chosen as the pivot.]]

One of the simplest algorithms is to find the largest number in a list of numbers of random order. Finding the solution requires looking at every number in the list. From this follows a simple algorithm, which can be stated in a high-level description of English prose, as:

''High-level description:''
# If there are no numbers in the set then there is no highest number.
# Assume the first number in the set is the largest number in the set.
# For each remaining number in the set: if this number is larger than the current largest number, consider this number to be the largest number in the set.
# When there are no numbers left in the set to iterate over, consider the current largest number to be the largest number of the set.

''(Quasi-)formal description:''
Written in prose but much closer to the high-level language of a computer program, the following is the more formal coding of the algorithm in [[pseudocode]] or [[pidgin code]]:

{{algorithm-begin|name=LargestNumber}}
   Input: A list of numbers ''L''.
   Output: The largest number in the list ''L''.

   '''if''' ''L.size'' = 0 '''return''' null
   ''largest'' ← ''L''[0]
   '''for each''' ''item'' '''in''' ''L'', '''do'''
     '''if''' ''item'' &gt; ''largest'', '''then'''
       ''largest'' ← ''item''
   '''return''' ''largest''
{{algorithm-end}}

===Euclid's algorithm===
{{further|Euclid's algorithm}}
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Book VII Proposition 2 2.png|250px|thumb|left|The example-diagram of Euclid's algorithm from T.L. Heath (1908), with more detail added. Euclid does not go beyond a third measuring and gives no numerical examples. Nicomachus gives the example of 49 and 21: "I subtract the less from the greater; 28 is left; then again I subtract from this the same 21 (for this is possible); 7 is left; I subtract this from 21, 14 is left; from which I again subtract 7 (for this is possible); 7 is left, but 7 cannot be subtracted from 7." Heath comments that "The last phrase is curious, but the meaning of it is obvious enough, as also the meaning of the phrase about ending 'at one and the same number'."(Heath 1908:300).]]

[[Euclid]]'s algorithm to compute the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD) to two numbers appears as Proposition II in Book VII ("Elementary Number Theory") of his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1908:300; Hawking's Dover 2005 edition derives from Heath.&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid poses the problem thus: "Given two numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure". He defines "A number [to be] a multitude composed of units": a counting number, a positive integer not including zero. To "measure" is to place a shorter measuring length ''s'' successively (''q'' times) along longer length ''l'' until the remaining portion ''r'' is less than the shorter length ''s''.&lt;ref&gt;" 'Let CD, measuring BF, leave FA less than itself.' This is a neat abbreviation for saying, measure along BA successive lengths equal to CD until a point F is reached such that the length FA remaining is less than CD; in other words, let BF be the largest exact multiple of CD contained in BA" (Heath 1908:297)&lt;/ref&gt; In modern words, remainder ''r'' = ''l'' − ''q''×''s'', ''q'' being the quotient, or remainder ''r'' is the "modulus", the integer-fractional part left over after the division.&lt;ref&gt;For modern treatments using division in the algorithm, see Hardy and Wright 1979:180, Knuth 1973:2 (Volume 1), plus more discussion of Euclid's algorithm in Knuth 1969:293–297 (Volume 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Euclid's method to succeed, the starting lengths must satisfy two requirements: (i) the lengths must not be zero, AND (ii) the subtraction must be “proper”; i.e., a test must guarantee that the smaller of the two numbers is subtracted from the larger (alternately, the two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero).

Euclid's original proof adds a third requirement: the two lengths must not be prime to one another. Euclid stipulated this so that he could construct a [[reductio ad absurdum]] proof that the two numbers' common measure is in fact the ''greatest''.&lt;ref&gt;Euclid covers this question in his Proposition 1.&lt;/ref&gt; While Nicomachus' algorithm is the same as Euclid's, when the numbers are prime to one another, it yields the number "1" for their common measure. So, to be precise, the following is really Nicomachus' algorithm.

[[File:Euclids-algorithm-example-1599-650.gif|350px|thumb|right|A graphical expression of Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor for 1599 and 650.
&lt;source lang="text" highlight="1,5"&gt;
 1599 = 650×2 + 299
 650 = 299×2 + 52
 299 = 52×5 + 39
 52 = 39×1 + 13
 39 = 13×3 + 0&lt;/source&gt;]]

====Computer language for Euclid's algorithm====
Only a few instruction ''types'' are required to execute Euclid's algorithm—some logical tests (conditional GOTO), unconditional GOTO, assignment (replacement), and subtraction.
* A ''location'' is symbolized by upper case letter(s), e.g. S, A, etc.
* The varying quantity (number) in a location is written in lower case letter(s) and (usually) associated with the location's name. For example, location L at the start might contain the number ''l'' = 3009.

====An inelegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
[[File:Euclid's algorithm Inelegant program 1.png|thumb|163px|right|"Inelegant" is a translation of Knuth's version of the algorithm with a subtraction-based remainder-loop replacing his use of division (or a "modulus" instruction). Derived from Knuth 1973:2–4. Depending on the two numbers "Inelegant" may compute the g.c.d. in fewer steps than "Elegant".]]

The following algorithm is framed as Knuth's four-step version of Euclid's and Nicomachus', but, rather than using division to find the remainder, it uses successive subtractions of the shorter length ''s'' from the remaining length ''r'' until ''r'' is less than ''s''. The high-level description, shown in boldface, is adapted from Knuth 1973:2–4:

'''INPUT''':
 {{vanchor|1|el1}} [Into two locations L and S put the numbers ''l'' and ''s'' that represent the two lengths]:
   INPUT L, S
 {{vanchor|2|el2}} [Initialize R: make the remaining length ''r'' equal to the starting/initial/input length ''l'']:
   R ← L

'''E0: [Ensure ''r'' ≥ ''s''.]'''
 {{vanchor|3|el3}} [Ensure the smaller of the two numbers is in S and the larger in R]:
   IF R &gt; S THEN
     the contents of L is the larger number so skip over the exchange-steps [[#4|4]], [[#5|5]] and [[#6|6]]:
     GOTO step [[#6|6]]
   ELSE
     swap the contents of R and S.
 {{vanchor|4|el4}}   L ← R (this first step is redundant, but is useful for later discussion).
 {{vanchor|5|el5}}   R ← S
 {{vanchor|6|el6}}   S ← L

'''E1: [Find remainder]''': Until the remaining length ''r'' in R is less than the shorter length ''s'' in S, repeatedly subtract the measuring number ''s'' in S from the remaining length ''r'' in R.
 {{vanchor|7|el7}} IF S &gt; R THEN
     done measuring so
     GOTO [[#10|10]]
   ELSE
     measure again,
 {{vanchor|8|el8}}   R ← R − S
 {{vanchor|9|el9}}   [Remainder-loop]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]].

'''E2: [Is the remainder zero?]''': EITHER (i) the last measure was exact, the remainder in R is zero, and the program can halt, OR (ii) the algorithm must continue: the last measure left a remainder in R less than measuring number in S.
 {{vanchor|10|el10}} IF R = 0 THEN
      done so
      GOTO [[#15|step 15]]
    ELSE
      CONTINUE TO [[#11|step 11]],

'''E3: [Interchange ''s'' and ''r'']''': The nut of Euclid's algorithm. Use remainder ''r'' to measure what was previously smaller number ''s''; L serves as a temporary location.
 {{vanchor|11|el11}}  L ← R
 {{vanchor|12|el12}}  R ← S
 {{vanchor|13|el13}}  S ← L
 {{vanchor|14|el14}}  [Repeat the measuring process]:
     GOTO [[#7|7]]

'''OUTPUT''':

 {{vanchor|15|el15}} [Done. S contains the [[greatest common divisor]]]:
    PRINT S

'''DONE''':
 {{vanchor|16|el16}} HALT, END, STOP.

====An elegant program for Euclid's algorithm====
The following version of Euclid's algorithm requires only six core instructions to do what thirteen are required to do by "Inelegant"; worse, "Inelegant" requires more ''types'' of instructions. The flowchart of "Elegant" can be found at the top of this article. In the (unstructured) Basic language, the steps are numbered, and the instruction &lt;source lang="cbmbas" inline&gt;LET [] = []&lt;/source&gt; is the assignment instruction symbolized by ←.
&lt;source lang="cbmbas"&gt;
  5 REM Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
  6 PRINT "Type two integers greater than 0"
  10 INPUT A,B
  20 IF B=0 THEN GOTO 80
  30 IF A &gt; B THEN GOTO 60
  40 LET B=B-A
  50 GOTO 20
  60 LET A=A-B
  70 GOTO 20
  80 PRINT A
  90 END
&lt;/source&gt;
The following version can be used with Object Oriented languages:
&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
// Euclid's algorithm for greatest common divisor
integer euclidAlgorithm (int A, int B){
     A=Math.abs(A);
     B=Math.abs(B);
     while (B!=0){
          if (A&gt;B) A=A-B;
          else B=B-A;
     }
     return A;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
''How "Elegant" works'': In place of an outer "Euclid loop", "Elegant" shifts back and forth between two "co-loops", an A &gt; B loop that computes A ← A − B, and a B ≤ A loop that computes B ← B − A. This works because, when at last the minuend M is less than or equal to the subtrahend S ( Difference = Minuend − Subtrahend), the minuend can become ''s'' (the new measuring length) and the subtrahend can become the new ''r'' (the length to be measured); in other words the "sense" of the subtraction reverses.

===Testing the Euclid algorithms===
Does an algorithm do what its author wants it to do? A few test cases usually suffice to confirm core functionality. One source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII2.html |title=Euclid's Elements, Book VII, Proposition 2 |publisher=Aleph0.clarku.edu |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses 3009 and 884. Knuth suggested 40902, 24140. Another interesting case is the two [[relatively prime]] numbers 14157 and 5950.

But exceptional cases must be identified and tested. Will "Inelegant" perform properly when R &gt; S, S &gt; R, R = S? Ditto for "Elegant": B &gt; A, A &gt; B, A = B? (Yes to all). What happens when one number is zero, both numbers are zero? ("Inelegant" computes forever in all cases; "Elegant" computes forever when A = 0.) What happens if ''negative'' numbers are entered? Fractional numbers? If the input numbers, i.e. the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the function computed by the algorithm/program, is to include only positive integers including zero, then the failures at zero indicate that the algorithm (and the program that [[instance (computer science)|instantiates]] it) is a [[partial function]] rather than a [[total function]]. A notable failure due to exceptions is the [[Ariane 5 Flight 501]] rocket failure (June 4, 1996).

''Proof of program correctness by use of mathematical induction'': Knuth demonstrates the application of [[mathematical induction]] to an "extended" version of Euclid's algorithm, and he proposes "a general method applicable to proving the validity of any algorithm".&lt;ref&gt;Knuth 1973:13–18. He credits "the formulation of algorithm-proving in terms of assertions and induction" to R. W. Floyd, Peter Naur, C. A. R. Hoare, H. H. Goldstine and J. von Neumann. Tausworth 1977 borrows Knuth's Euclid example and extends Knuth's method in section 9.1 ''Formal Proofs'' (pages 288–298).&lt;/ref&gt; Tausworthe proposes that a measure of the complexity of a program be the length of its correctness proof.&lt;ref&gt;Tausworthe 1997:294&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring and improving the Euclid algorithms===
''Elegance (compactness) versus goodness (speed)'': With only six core instructions, "Elegant" is the clear winner, compared to "Inelegant" at thirteen instructions. However, "Inelegant" is ''faster'' (it arrives at HALT in fewer steps). [[Algorithm analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;cf Knuth 1973:7 (Vol. I), and his more-detailed analyses on pp. 1969:294–313 (Vol II).&lt;/ref&gt; indicates why this is the case: "Elegant" does ''two'' conditional tests in every subtraction loop, whereas "Inelegant" only does one. As the algorithm (usually) requires many loop-throughs, ''on average'' much time is wasted doing a "B = 0?" test that is needed only after the remainder is computed.

''Can the algorithms be improved?'': Once the programmer judges a program "fit" and "effective"—that is, it computes the function intended by its author—then the question becomes, can it be improved?

The compactness of "Inelegant" can be improved by the elimination of five steps. But Chaitin proved that compacting an algorithm cannot be automated by a generalized algorithm;&lt;ref&gt;Breakdown occurs when an algorithm tries to compact itself. Success would solve the [[Halting problem]].&lt;/ref&gt; rather, it can only be done [[heuristic]]ally; i.e., by exhaustive search (examples to be found at [[Busy beaver]]), trial and error, cleverness, insight, application of [[inductive reasoning]], etc. Observe that steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated in steps 11, 12 and 13. Comparison with "Elegant" provides a hint that these steps, together with steps 2 and 3, can be eliminated. This reduces the number of core instructions from thirteen to eight, which makes it "more elegant" than "Elegant", at nine steps.

The speed of "Elegant" can be improved by moving the "B=0?" test outside of the two subtraction loops. This change calls for the addition of three instructions (B = 0?, A = 0?, GOTO). Now "Elegant" computes the example-numbers faster; whether this is always the case for any given A, B, and R, S would require a detailed analysis.

==Algorithmic analysis==
{{Main|Analysis of algorithms}}
It is frequently important to know how much of a particular resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods have been developed for the [[analysis of algorithms]] to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(''n''), using the [[big O notation]] with ''n'' as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of ''O(1)'', if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(''n'') if it is counted.

Different algorithms may complete the same task with a different set of instructions in less or more time, space, or '[[algorithmic efficiency|effort]]' than others. For example, a [[binary search]] algorithm (with cost O(log n) ) outperforms a sequential search (cost O(n) ) when used for [[lookup table|table lookups]] on sorted lists or arrays.

===Formal versus empirical===
{{Main|Empirical algorithmics|Profiling (computer programming)|Program optimization}}
The [[analysis of algorithms|analysis, and study of algorithms]] is a discipline of [[computer science]], and is often practiced abstractly without the use of a specific [[programming language]] or implementation. In this sense, algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines in that it focuses on the underlying properties of the algorithm and not on the specifics of any particular implementation. Usually [[pseudocode]] is used for analysis as it is the simplest and most general representation. However, ultimately, most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware/software platforms and their [[algorithmic efficiency]] is eventually put to the test using real code. For the solution of a "one off" problem, the efficiency of a particular algorithm may not have significant consequences (unless n is extremely large) but for algorithms designed for fast interactive, commercial or long life scientific usage it may be critical. Scaling from small n to large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign.

Empirical testing is useful because it may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance. [[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]] may be used to compare before/after potential improvements to an algorithm after program optimization.
Empirical tests cannot replace formal analysis, though, and are not trivial to perform in a fair manner.&lt;ref name="KriegelSchubert2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kriegel|first1=Hans-Peter|authorlink=Hans-Peter Kriegel|last2=Schubert|first2=Erich|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|authorlink3=Arthur Zimek|title=The (black) art of run-time evaluation: Are we comparing algorithms or implementations?|journal=Knowledge and Information Systems|volume=52|issue=2|year=2016|pages=341–378|issn=0219-1377|doi=10.1007/s10115-016-1004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Execution efficiency ===
{{Main|Algorithmic efficiency}}
To illustrate the potential improvements possible even in well-established algorithms, a recent significant innovation, relating to [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] algorithms (used heavily in the field of image processing), can decrease processing time up to 1,000 times for applications like medical imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Better Math Makes Faster Data Networks| author=Gillian Conahan| date=January 2013| url=http://discovermagazine.com/2013/jan-feb/34-better-math-makes-faster-data-networks#.URAnVieX98F| publisher=discovermagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, speed improvements depend on special properties of the problem, which are very common in practical applications.&lt;ref name="Hassanieh12"&gt;Haitham Hassanieh, [[Piotr Indyk]], Dina Katabi, and Eric Price, "[http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf ACM-SIAM Symposium On Discrete Algorithms (SODA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704180806/http://siam.omnibooksonline.com/2012SODA/data/papers/500.pdf |date=July 4, 2013 }}, Kyoto, January 2012. See also the [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/netmit/sFFT/ sFFT Web Page].&lt;/ref&gt; Speedups of this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use of image processing (like digital cameras and medical equipment) to consume less power.

== Classification ==
There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.

=== By implementation ===
One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.

; Recursion
: A [[recursive algorithm]] is one that invokes (makes reference to) itself repeatedly until a certain condition (also known as termination condition) matches, which is a method common to [[functional programming]]. [[Iteration|Iterative]] algorithms use repetitive constructs like [[Program loops|loops]] and sometimes additional data structures like [[Stack (data structure)|stacks]] to solve the given problems. Some problems are naturally suited for one implementation or the other. For example, [[towers of Hanoi]] is well understood using recursive implementation. Every recursive version has an equivalent (but possibly more or less complex) iterative version, and vice versa.
; Logical
: An algorithm may be viewed as controlled [[Deductive reasoning|logical deduction]]. This notion may be expressed as: ''Algorithm = logic + control''.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The logic component expresses the axioms that may be used in the computation and the control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms. This is the basis for the [[logic programming]] paradigm. In pure logic programming languages, the control component is fixed and algorithms are specified by supplying only the logic component. The appeal of this approach is the elegant [[Formal semantics of programming languages|semantics]]: a change in the axioms produces a well-defined change in the algorithm.
; Serial, parallel or distributed
: Algorithms are usually discussed with the assumption that computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time. Those computers are sometimes called serial computers. An [[algorithm design]]ed for such an environment is called a serial algorithm, as opposed to [[parallel algorithm]]s or [[distributed algorithms]]. Parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures where several processors can work on a problem at the same time, whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with a [[computer network]]. Parallel or distributed algorithms divide the problem into more symmetrical or asymmetrical subproblems and collect the results back together. The resource consumption in such algorithms is not only processor cycles on each processor but also the communication overhead between the processors. Some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently, but their communication overhead is expensive. Iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable. Some problems have no parallel algorithms and are called inherently serial problems.
; Deterministic or non-deterministic
: [[Deterministic algorithm]]s solve the problem with exact decision at every step of the algorithm whereas [[non-deterministic algorithm]]s solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through the use of [[heuristics]].
; Exact or approximate
: While many algorithms reach an exact solution, [[approximation algorithm]]s seek an approximation that is closer to the true solution. The approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the [[Knapsack problem]]. The Knapsack problem is a problem where there is a set of given items. The goal of the problem is to pack the knapsack to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that we can carry is no more than some fixed number X. So, we must consider weights of items as well as their value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540402862|title=Knapsack Problems {{!}} Hans Kellerer {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[Quantum algorithm]]
: They run on a realistic model of [[quantum computation]]. The term is usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of [[Quantum computing]] such as [[quantum superposition]] or [[quantum entanglement]].

=== By design paradigm ===
Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms. Some common paradigms are:

; [[Brute force search|Brute-force]] or exhaustive search
: This is the naive method of trying every possible solution to see which is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Carroll| first1 = Sue| last2 = Daughtrey| first2 = Taz| title = Fundamental Concepts for the Software Quality Engineer| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bz_cl3B05IcC&amp;pg=PA282| date = July 4, 2007| publisher = American Society for Quality| isbn = 978-0-87389-720-4| pages = 282 et seq. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Divide and conquer
: A [[divide and conquer algorithm]] repeatedly reduces an instance of a problem to one or more smaller instances of the same problem (usually [[recursion|recursively]]) until the instances are small enough to solve easily. One such example of divide and conquer is [[mergesort|merge sorting]]. Sorting can be done on each segment of data after dividing data into segments and sorting of entire data can be obtained in the conquer phase by merging the segments. A simpler variant of divide and conquer is called a ''decrease and conquer algorithm'', that solves an identical subproblem and uses the solution of this subproblem to solve the bigger problem. Divide and conquer divides the problem into multiple subproblems and so the conquer stage is more complex than decrease and conquer algorithms. An example of the decrease and conquer algorithm is the [[binary search algorithm]].
; Search and enumeration
: Many problems (such as playing [[chess]]) can be modeled as problems on [[graph theory|graphs]]. A [[graph exploration algorithm]] specifies rules for moving around a graph and is useful for such problems. This category also includes [[search algorithm]]s, [[branch and bound]] enumeration and [[backtracking]].
;[[Randomized algorithm]]
: Such algorithms make some choices randomly (or pseudo-randomly). They can be very useful in finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical (see heuristic method below). For some of these problems, it is known that the fastest approximations must involve some [[randomness]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the [[volume]] of a [[convex polytope]] (described using a membership oracle) can be approximated to high accuracy by a randomized polynomial time algorithm, but not by a deterministic one: see {{citation

# [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s return a correct answer with high-probability. E.g. [[RP (complexity)|RP]] is the subclass of these that run in [[polynomial time]].
# [[Las Vegas algorithm]]s always return the correct answer, but their running time is only probabilistically bound, e.g. [[Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial time|ZPP]].
; [[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction of complexity]]
: This technique involves solving a difficult problem by transforming it into a better-known problem for which we have (hopefully) [[asymptotically optimal]] algorithms. The goal is to find a reducing algorithm whose [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] is not dominated by the resulting reduced algorithm's. For example, one [[selection algorithm]] for finding the median in an unsorted list involves first sorting the list (the expensive portion) and then pulling out the middle element in the sorted list (the cheap portion). This technique is also known as ''[[Transform and conquer algorithm|transform and conquer]]''.
; [[Back tracking]]
: In this approach, multiple solutions are built incrementally and abandoned when it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid full solution.

=== Optimization problems ===

For [[optimization problem]]s there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:

; [[Linear programming]]
: When searching for optimal solutions to a linear function bound to linear equality and inequality constraints, the constraints of the problem can be used directly in producing the optimal solutions. There are algorithms that can solve any problem in this category, such as the popular [[simplex algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;
[[George B. Dantzig]] and Mukund N. Thapa. 2003. ''Linear Programming 2: Theory and Extensions''. Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems that can be solved with linear programming include the [[maximum flow problem]] for directed graphs. If a problem additionally requires that one or more of the unknowns must be an [[integer]] then it is classified in [[integer programming]]. A linear programming algorithm can solve such a problem if it can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial, i.e., the solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway. In the general case, a specialized algorithm or an algorithm that finds approximate solutions is used, depending on the difficulty of the problem.
; [[Dynamic programming]]
: When a problem shows [[optimal substructure]]s – meaning the optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems – and [[overlapping subproblems]], meaning the same subproblems are used to solve many different problem instances, a quicker approach called ''dynamic programming'' avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed. For example, [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a weighted [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] can be found by using the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices. Dynamic programming and [[memoization]] go together. The main difference between dynamic programming and divide and conquer is that subproblems are more or less independent in divide and conquer, whereas subproblems overlap in dynamic programming. The difference between dynamic programming and straightforward recursion is in caching or memoization of recursive calls. When subproblems are independent and there is no repetition, memoization does not help; hence dynamic programming is not a solution for all complex problems. By using memoization or maintaining a [[Mathematical table|table]] of subproblems already solved, dynamic programming reduces the exponential nature of many problems to polynomial complexity.
; The greedy method
: A [[greedy algorithm]] is similar to a dynamic programming algorithm in that it works by examining substructures, in this case not of the problem but of a given solution. Such algorithms start with some solution, which may be given or have been constructed in some way, and improve it by making small modifications. For some problems they can find the optimal solution while for others they stop at [[local optimum|local optima]], that is, at solutions that cannot be improved by the algorithm but are not optimum. The most popular use of greedy algorithms is for finding the minimal spanning tree where finding the optimal solution is possible with this method. [[Huffman coding|Huffman Tree]], [[kruskal's algorithm|Kruskal]], [[Prim's algorithm|Prim]], [[Sollin's algorithm|Sollin]] are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem.
;The heuristic method
:In [[optimization problem]]s, [[heuristic algorithm]]s can be used to find a solution close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to the optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include [[local search (optimization)|local search]], [[tabu search]], [[simulated annealing]], and [[genetic algorithm]]s. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an [[approximation algorithm]].

=== By field of study ===
{{See also|List of algorithms}}
Every field of science has its own problems and needs efficient algorithms. Related problems in one field are often studied together. Some example classes are [[search algorithm]]s, [[sorting algorithm]]s, [[merge algorithm]]s, [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithms]], [[graph theory|graph algorithms]], [[string algorithms]], [[computational geometry|computational geometric algorithms]], [[combinatorial|combinatorial algorithms]], [[medical algorithm]]s, [[machine learning]], [[cryptography]], [[data compression]] algorithms and [[parsing|parsing techniques]].

Fields tend to overlap with each other, and algorithm advances in one field may improve those of other, sometimes completely unrelated, fields. For example, dynamic programming was invented for optimization of resource consumption in industry but is now used in solving a broad range of problems in many fields.

=== By complexity ===
{{See also|Complexity class| Parameterized complexity}}
Algorithms can be classified by the amount of time they need to complete compared to their input size:

* Constant time: if the time needed by the algorithm is the same, regardless of the input size. E.g. an access to an [[Array data structure|array]] element.
* Linear time: if the time is proportional to the input size. E.g. the traverse of a list.
* Logarithmic time: if the time is a logarithmic function of the input size. E.g. [[binary search algorithm]].
* Polynomial time: if the time is a power of the input size. E.g. the [[bubble sort]] algorithm has quadratic time complexity.
* Exponential time: if the time is an exponential function of the input size. E.g. [[Brute-force search]].

Some problems may have multiple algorithms of differing complexity, while other problems might have no algorithms or no known efficient algorithms. There are also mappings from some problems to other problems. Owing to this, it was found to be more suitable to classify the problems themselves instead of the algorithms into equivalence classes based on the complexity of the best possible algorithms for them.

== Continuous algorithms ==
The adjective "continuous" when applied to the word "algorithm" can mean:
* An algorithm operating on data that represents continuous quantities, even though this data is represented by discrete approximations—such algorithms are studied in [[numerical analysis]]; or
* An algorithm in the form of a [[differential equation]] that operates continuously on the data, running on an [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Tsypkin| title = Adaptation and learning in automatic systems| url = https://books.google.com/?id=sgDHJlafMskC&amp;pg=PA54| year = 1971| publisher = Academic Press| isbn = 978-0-08-095582-7| page = 54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
{{see also|Software patent}}

Algorithms, by themselves, are not usually patentable. In the United States, a claim consisting solely of simple manipulations of abstract concepts, numbers, or signals does not constitute "processes" (USPTO 2006), and hence algorithms are not patentable (as in [[Gottschalk v. Benson]]). However practical applications of algorithms are sometimes patentable. For example, in [[Diamond v. Diehr]], the application of a simple [[feedback]] algorithm to aid in the curing of [[synthetic rubber]] was deemed patentable. The [[Software patent debate|patenting of software]] is highly controversial, and there are highly criticized patents involving algorithms, especially [[data compression]] algorithms, such as [[Unisys]]' [[Graphics Interchange Format#Unisys and LZW patent enforcement|LZW patent]].

Additionally, some cryptographic algorithms have export restrictions (see [[export of cryptography]]).

== History: Development of the notion of "algorithm" ==

=== Ancient Near East ===
Algorithms were used in ancient Greece. Two examples are the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]], which was described in [[Introduction to Arithmetic]] by [[Nicomachus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/men/eratosthenes.html|title=Eratosthenes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.2}} and the [[Euclidean algorithm]], which was first described in [[Euclid's Elements]] (c. 300 BC).&lt;ref name=Cooke2005/&gt;{{rp|Ch 9.1}} [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian clay tablets]] describe and employ algorithmic procedures to compute the time and place of significant astronomical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | author-link = Asger Aaboe | date = 2001 | title = Episodes from the Early History of Astronomy | publisher = Springer | place = New York | pages = 40–62 | isbn = 0-387-95136-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrete and distinguishable symbols ===
'''Tally-marks''': To keep track of their flocks, their sacks of grain and their money the ancients used tallying: accumulating stones or marks scratched on sticks or making discrete symbols in clay. Through the Babylonian and Egyptian use of marks and symbols, eventually [[Roman numerals]] and the [[abacus]] evolved (Dilson, p.&amp;nbsp;16–41). Tally marks appear prominently in [[unary numeral system]] arithmetic used in [[Turing machine]] and [[Post–Turing machine]] computations.

=== Manipulation of symbols as "place holders" for numbers: algebra ===
The work of the ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek geometers]] ([[Euclidean algorithm]]), the [[List of Indian mathematicians|Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]], and the [[List of Iranian mathematicians|Persian mathematician]] [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|Al-Khwarizmi]] (from whose name the terms "[[algorism]]" and "algorithm" are derived), and Western European mathematicians culminated in [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s notion of the [[calculus ratiocinator]] (ca 1680):
{{quote|A good century and a half ahead of his time, Leibniz proposed an algebra of logic, an algebra that would specify the rules for manipulating logical concepts in the manner that ordinary algebra specifies the rules for manipulating numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:18&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Mechanical contrivances with discrete states ===
''The clock'': Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven [[clock]] as "The key invention [of Europe in the Middle Ages]", in particular, the [[verge escapement]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:24&lt;/ref&gt; that provides us with the tick and tock of a mechanical clock. "The accurate automatic machine"&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:26&lt;/ref&gt; led immediately to "mechanical [[automata theory|automata]]" beginning in the 13th century and finally to "computational machines"—the [[difference engine]] and [[analytical engine]]s of [[Charles Babbage]] and Countess [[Ada Lovelace]], mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bolter 1984:33–34, 204–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelace is credited with the first creation of an algorithm intended for processing on a computer – Babbage's analytical engine, the first device considered a real [[Turing-complete]] computer instead of just a [[calculator]] – and is sometimes called "history's first programmer" as a result, though a full implementation of Babbage's second device would not be realized until decades after her lifetime.

''Logical machines 1870—[[Stanley Jevons]]' "logical abacus" and "logical machine"'': The technical problem was to reduce [[Boolean equation]]s when presented in a form similar to what is now known as [[Karnaugh map]]s. Jevons (1880) describes first a simple "abacus" of "slips of wood furnished with pins, contrived so that any part or class of the [logical] combinations can be picked out mechanically . . . More recently, however, I have reduced the system to a completely mechanical form, and have thus embodied the whole of the indirect process of inference in what may be called a ''Logical Machine''" His machine came equipped with "certain moveable wooden rods" and "at the foot are 21 keys like those of a piano [etc] . . .". With this machine he could analyze a "[[syllogism]] or any other simple logical argument".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from W. Stanley Jevons 1880 ''Elementary Lessons in Logic: Deductive and Inductive'', Macmillan and Co., London and New York. Republished as a googlebook; cf Jevons 1880:199–201. Louis Couturat 1914 ''the Algebra of Logic'', The Open Court Publishing Company, Chicago and London. Republished as a googlebook; cf Couturat 1914:75–76 gives a few more details; he compares this to a typewriter as well as a piano. Jevons states that the account is to be found at January 20, 1870 ''The Proceedings of the Royal Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This machine he displayed in 1870 before the Fellows of the Royal Society.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons 1880:199–200&lt;/ref&gt; Another logician [[John Venn]], however, in his 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', turned a jaundiced eye to this effort: "I have no high estimate myself of the interest or importance of what are sometimes called logical machines ... it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known or likely to be discovered really deserve the name of logical machines"; see more at [[Algorithm characterizations]]. But not to be outdone he too presented "a plan somewhat analogous, I apprehend, to Prof. Jevon's ''abacus'' ... [And] [a]gain, corresponding to Prof. Jevons's logical machine, the following contrivance may be described. I prefer to call it merely a logical-diagram machine ... but I suppose that it could do very completely all that can be rationally expected of any logical machine".&lt;ref&gt;All quotes from John Venn 1881 ''Symbolic Logic'', Macmillan and Co., London. Republished as a googlebook. cf Venn 1881:120–125. The interested reader can find a deeper explanation in those pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jacquard loom, Hollerith punch cards, telegraphy and telephony—the electromechanical relay'': Bell and Newell (1971) indicate that the [[Jacquard loom]] (1801), precursor to [[Hollerith cards]] (punch cards, 1887), and "telephone switching technologies" were the roots of a tree leading to the development of the first computers.&lt;ref&gt;Bell and Newell diagram 1971:39, cf. Davis 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century the [[telegraph]], the precursor of the telephone, was in use throughout the world, it's discrete and distinguishable encoding of letters as "dots and dashes" a common sound. By the late 19th century the [[ticker tape]] (ca 1870s) was in use, as was the use of Hollerith cards in the 1890 U.S. census. Then came the [[teleprinter]] (ca. 1910) with its punched-paper use of [[Baudot code]] on tape.

''Telephone-switching networks'' of electromechanical [[relay]]s (invented 1835) was behind the work of [[George Stibitz]] (1937), the inventor of the digital adding device. As he worked in Bell Laboratories, he observed the "burdensome' use of mechanical calculators with gears. "He went home one evening in 1937 intending to test his idea... When the tinkering was over, Stibitz had constructed a binary adding device".&lt;ref&gt;* Melina Hill, Valley News Correspondent, ''A Tinkerer Gets a Place in History'', Valley News West Lebanon NH, Thursday, March 31, 1983, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis (2000) observes the particular importance of the electromechanical relay (with its two "binary states" ''open'' and ''closed''):
: It was only with the development, beginning in the 1930s, of electromechanical calculators using electrical relays, that machines were built having the scope Babbage had envisioned."&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2000:14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics during the 19th century up to the mid-20th century ===
''Symbols and rules'': In rapid succession, the mathematics of [[George Boole]] (1847, 1854), [[Gottlob Frege]] (1879), and [[Giuseppe Peano]] (1888–1889) reduced arithmetic to a sequence of symbols manipulated by rules. Peano's ''The principles of arithmetic, presented by a new method'' (1888) was "the first attempt at an axiomatization of mathematics in a symbolic language".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:81ff&lt;/ref&gt;

But Heijenoort gives Frege (1879) this kudos: Frege's is "perhaps the most important single work ever written in logic. ... in which we see a " 'formula language', that is a ''lingua characterica'', a language written with special symbols, "for pure thought", that is, free from rhetorical embellishments ... constructed from specific symbols that are manipulated according to definite rules".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary on Frege's ''Begriffsschrift, a formula language, modeled upon that of arithmetic, for pure thought'' in van Heijenoort 1967:1&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Frege was further simplified and amplified by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] in their [[Principia Mathematica]] (1910–1913).

''The paradoxes'': At the same time a number of disturbing paradoxes appeared in the literature, in particular, the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] (1897), the [[Russell paradox]] (1902–03), and the [[Richard Paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon 1906, cf. Kleene 1952:36–40&lt;/ref&gt; The resultant considerations led to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s paper (1931)—he specifically cites the paradox of the liar—that completely reduces rules of [[recursion]] to numbers.

''Effective calculability'': In an effort to solve the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] defined precisely by Hilbert in 1928, mathematicians first set about to define what was meant by an "effective method" or "effective calculation" or "effective calculability" (i.e., a calculation that would succeed). In rapid succession the following appeared: [[Alonzo Church]], [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]]'s [[λ-calculus]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. footnote in Alonzo Church 1936a in Davis 1965:90 and 1936b in Davis 1965:110&lt;/ref&gt; a finely honed definition of "general recursion" from the work of Gödel acting on suggestions of [[Jacques Herbrand]] (cf. Gödel's Princeton lectures of 1934) and subsequent simplifications by Kleene.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1935–6 in Davis 1965:237ff, Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:255ff&lt;/ref&gt; Church's proof&lt;ref&gt;Church 1936 in Davis 1965:88ff&lt;/ref&gt; that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable, [[Emil Post]]'s definition of effective calculability as a worker mindlessly following a list of instructions to move left or right through a sequence of rooms and while there either mark or erase a paper or observe the paper and make a yes-no decision about the next instruction.&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Finite Combinatory Processes&amp;mdash;formulation 1", Post 1936 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Turing's proof of that the Entscheidungsproblem was unsolvable by use of his "a- [automatic-] machine"&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:116ff&lt;/ref&gt;—in effect almost identical to Post's "formulation", [[J. Barkley Rosser]]'s definition of "effective method" in terms of "a machine".&lt;ref&gt;Rosser 1939 in Davis 1965:226&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. C. Kleene]]'s proposal of a precursor to "[[Church thesis]]" that he called "Thesis I",&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1943 in Davis 1965:273–274&lt;/ref&gt; and a few years later Kleene's renaming his Thesis "Church's Thesis"&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:300, 317&lt;/ref&gt; and proposing "Turing's Thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:376&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emil Post (1936) and Alan Turing (1936–37, 1939) ===
Here is a remarkable coincidence{{According to whom|date=March 2017}} of two men not knowing each other but describing a process of men-as-computers working on computations—and they yield virtually identical definitions.

[[Emil Post]] (1936) described the actions of a "computer" (human being) as follows:
:"...two concepts are involved: that of a ''symbol space'' in which the work leading from problem to answer is to be carried out, and a fixed unalterable ''set of directions''.

His symbol space would be
:"a two-way infinite sequence of spaces or boxes... The problem solver or worker is to move and work in this symbol space, being capable of being in, and operating in but one box at a time.... a box is to admit of but two possible conditions, i.e., being empty or unmarked, and having a single mark in it, say a vertical stroke.

:"One box is to be singled out and called the starting point. ...a specific problem is to be given in symbolic form by a finite number of boxes [i.e., INPUT] being marked with a stroke. Likewise, the answer [i.e., OUTPUT] is to be given in symbolic form by such a configuration of marked boxes...

:"A set of directions applicable to a general problem sets up a deterministic process when applied to each specific problem. This process terminates only when it comes to the direction of type (C ) [i.e., STOP]".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:289–290&lt;/ref&gt; See more at [[Post–Turing machine]]
[[File:Alan Turing.jpg|thumb|200px|Alan Turing's statue at [[Bletchley Park]]]]
[[Alan Turing]]'s work&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in Davis 1965, Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt; preceded that of Stibitz (1937); it is unknown whether Stibitz knew of the work of Turing. Turing's biographer believed that Turing's use of a typewriter-like model derived from a youthful interest: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; Mrs. Turing had a typewriter, and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'".&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, p.&amp;nbsp;96&lt;/ref&gt; Given the prevalence of Morse code and telegraphy, ticker tape machines, and teletypewriters we{{Who|date=March 2017}} might conjecture that all were influences.

Turing—his model of computation is now called a [[Turing machine]]—begins, as did Post, with an analysis of a human computer that he whittles down to a simple set of basic motions and "states of mind". But he continues a step further and creates a machine as a model of computation of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7:116&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Computing is normally done by writing certain symbols on paper. We may suppose this paper is divided into squares like a child's arithmetic book...I assume then that the computation is carried out on one-dimensional paper, i.e., on a tape divided into squares. I shall also suppose that the number of symbols which may be printed is finite...

:"The behavior of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his "state of mind" at that moment. We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite...

:"Let us imagine that the operations performed by the computer to be split up into 'simple operations' which are so elementary that it is not easy to imagine them further divided."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's reduction yields the following:
:"The simple operations must therefore include:
::"(a) Changes of the symbol on one of the observed squares
::"(b) Changes of one of the squares observed to another square within L squares of one of the previously observed squares.
"It may be that some of these change necessarily invoke a change of state of mind. The most general single operation must, therefore, be taken to be one of the following:
::"(A) A possible change (a) of symbol together with a possible change of state of mind.
::"(B) A possible change (b) of observed squares, together with a possible change of state of mind"

:"We may now construct a machine to do the work of this computer."&lt;ref name="Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1965:136"/&gt;

A few years later, Turing expanded his analysis (thesis, definition) with this forceful expression of it:
:"A function is said to be "effectively calculable" if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process. Though it is fairly easy to get an intuitive grasp of this idea, it is nevertheless desirable to have some more definite, mathematical expressible definition . . . [he discusses the history of the definition pretty much as presented above with respect to Gödel, Herbrand, Kleene, Church, Turing, and Post] . . . We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability † with effective calculability . . . .
::"† We shall use the expression "computable function" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and we let "effectively calculable" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions".&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1939 in Davis 1965:160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== J. B. Rosser (1939) and S. C. Kleene (1943) ===
[[J. Barkley Rosser]] defined an 'effective [mathematical] method' in the following manner (italicization added):
:"'Effective method' is used here in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely determined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps. With this special meaning, three different precise definitions have been given to date. [his footnote #5; see discussion immediately below]. The simplest of these to state (due to Post and Turing) says essentially that ''an effective method of solving certain sets of problems exists if one can build a machine which will then solve any problem of the set with no human intervention beyond inserting the question and (later) reading the answer''. All three definitions are equivalent, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Moreover, the fact that all three are equivalent is a very strong argument for the correctness of any one." (Rosser 1939:225–6)

Rosser's footnote No. 5 references the work of (1) Church and Kleene and their definition of λ-definability, in particular Church's use of it in his ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' (1936); (2) Herbrand and Gödel and their use of recursion in particular Gödel's use in his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I'' (1931); and (3) Post (1936) and Turing (1936–37) in their mechanism-models of computation.

[[Stephen C. Kleene]] defined as his now-famous "Thesis I" known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. But he did this in the following context (boldface in original):
:"12. ''Algorithmic theories''... In setting up a complete algorithmic theory, what we do is to describe a procedure, performable for each set of values of the independent variables, which procedure necessarily terminates and in such manner that from the outcome we can read a definite answer, "yes" or "no," to the question, "is the predicate value true?"" (Kleene 1943:273)

=== History after 1950 ===
A number of efforts have been directed toward further refinement of the definition of "algorithm", and activity is on-going because of issues surrounding, in particular, [[foundations of mathematics]] (especially the [[Church–Turing thesis]]) and [[philosophy of mind]] (especially arguments about [[artificial intelligence]]).

In 1931 the Sugarcane Seedling Testing Station was established in Dhaka. It was changed to the Sugarcane Research Station on 1953 and placed under the Department of Agriculture. [[Bangladesh Sugar and Food Industries Corporation]] was placed in charge on the institute in 1973.

In this model the effect of [[dark energy]] reverses, stopping the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and causing an infinite rate of deceleration.

[[File:Biotic Components Living Factors.svg|thumb|Diagram of a bacterium, tree, and a bee that are living factors of biotic components found in an ecosystem that are influenced by abiotic factors (non-living components). ]]
'''Biotic components''' or '''biotic factors,''' can be described as any living component that affects another [[organism]], or shapes the [[ecosystem]]. This includes both animals that consume other organisms within their ecosystem, and the organism that is being consumed. Biotic factors also include human influence, [[pathogens]], and [[disease outbreaks]]. Each biotic factor needs the proper amount of energy and nutrition to function day to day.  

Biotic components are typically sorted into three main categories:

# '''[[wiktionary:producer#Noun|Producers]]''', otherwise known as [[autotrophs]], convert energy (through the process of photosynthesis) into food.
# '''[[Consumer|Consumers]]''', otherwise known as [[heterotrophs]], depend upon producers (and occasionally other consumers) for food.
# '''[[Decomposer|Decomposers]]''', otherwise known as [[detritivores]], break down chemicals from producers and consumers (usually antibiotic) into simpler form which can be reused.

== Influences ==

=== Species ===
Nearly all species are influenced by biotic factors in one way or another. If the number of [[Predator|predators]] was to increase, the entire [[food chain]] would be affected as any prey falling below that specified predator in the food chain will become [[prey]]. If the prey is not given enough time by the predator to repopulate, this could not only cause endangerment and extinction in the prey, but the predator as well. Contradicting a decrease in [[population size]], if a particular species reproduces too rapidly, this will cause an increase in population size, thus affecting the environment around them. 

=== Pathogens and Disease Outbreaks ===
When disease outbreaks occur, it can be detrimental to an ecosystem. When a disease hits, it will usually affect more than one species, thus causing a serious outbreak. This has the potential to set off a chain reaction thus, causing endangerment to a variety of species within that ecosystem. 

=== Human Contact ===
Humans make the most sudden and long-term changes in an environment (e.g. pollution and waste). These changes either drive species out of their territory or force them to adapt to their new surroundings. These changes have the largest impact on an ecosystems population size, typically causing a serious decrease.

== Biotic Components vs Abiotic Components ==
Biotic components are the living things that shape an ecosystem. Examples of biotic components include animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. [[Abiotic components]] are non-living components that influence an ecosystem. Examples of abiotic factors are temperature, air currents, and minerals.

The factors mentioned above may either cause an increase or decrease in population size depending on the organism and ecosystem in question.

{{italic title}}'''''Brave New World''''' is a [[dystopian]] [[novel]] written in 1931 by English author [[Aldous Huxley]], and published in 1932. Largely set in a futuristic [[World State in Brave New World|World State]] of [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] citizens and an intelligence-based [[social hierarchy]], the novel anticipates huge scientific developments in [[reproductive technology]], [[sleep-learning]], [[psychological manipulation]], and [[classical conditioning]] that are combined to make a [[utopian society]] that goes challenged only by a single outsider. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment in an essay, ''[[#Brave New World Revisited|Brave New World Revisited]]'' (1958), and with ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'' (1962), his final novel.

In 1999, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Brave New World'' fifth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].&lt;ref name="100 Best Novels"&gt;{{cite web |title=100 Best Novels |publisher=Random House |year=1999 |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/100bestnovels.html |accessdate=23 June 2007}} This ranking was by the [http://www.randomhouse.com/modernlibrary/about/board.html Modern Library Editorial Board] of authors.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Robert McCrum]] writing for ''[[The Observer]]'' included ''Brave New World'' chronologically at number 53 in "the top 100 greatest novels of all time",&lt;ref name="McCrum"&gt;{{Cite news |title=100 greatest novels of all time |publisher=Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/12/features.fiction |accessdate=10 October 2012 |location=London |first=Robert |last=McCrum |date=12 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the novel was listed at number 87 on the [[BBC]]'s survey [[The Big Read]].&lt;ref name="BBC – The Big Read"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100_2.shtml "BBC – The Big Read"].

Translations of the title often allude to similar expressions used in domestic works of literature: the French edition of the work is entitled ''Le Meilleur des mondes'' (''The Best of All Worlds''), an allusion to an expression used by the philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]]&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. 'Leibniz', by Nicholas Jolley (Routledge, 2005){{page needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satirised in ''[[Candide|Candide, Ou l'Optimisme]]'' by [[Voltaire]] (1759).

==History==
Huxley wrote ''Brave New World'' while living in [[Sanary-sur-Mer]], France, in the four months from May to August 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Iltis, Université Nancy II, http://www.sanary.com/a-huxley-in-sanary-1-introduction.html&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Huxley had already established himself as a writer and social satirist. He was a contributor to ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913-1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazines, and had published a collection of his poetry (''The Burning Wheel'', 1916) and four successful satirical novels: ''[[Crome Yellow]]'' (1921), ''[[Antic Hay]]'' (1923), ''[[Those Barren Leaves]]'' (1925), and ''[[Point Counter Point]]'' (1928). ''Brave New World'' was Huxley's fifth novel and first [[dystopia]]n work.

Huxley said that ''Brave New World'' was inspired by the [[utopia]]n novels of [[H. G. Wells]], including ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905), and ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Aldous Huxley, ''Letters of Aldous Huxley'', ed. by Grover Smith (New York and Evanston: Harper &amp; Row, 1969), p. 348: "I am writing a novel about the future—on the horror of the Wellsian Utopia and a revolt against it. Very difficult. I have hardly enough imagination to deal with such a subject. But it is none the less interesting work" (letter to Mrs. Kethevan Roberts, 18 May 1931).&lt;/ref&gt; Wells's hopeful vision of the future's possibilities gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novels, which became ''Brave New World''. He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had "been having a little fun pulling the leg of H. G. Wells", but then he "got caught up in the excitement of [his] own ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heje |first=Johan |chapter=Aldous Huxley |editor-last=Harris-Fain |editor-first=Darren |title=British Fantasy and Science-Fiction Writers, 1918–1960 |location=Detroit |publisher=Gale Group |year=2002 |page=100 |isbn=0-7876-5249-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the most popular optimist utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred to ''Brave New World'' as a "negative utopia", somewhat influenced by Wells's own ''[[The Sleeper Awakes]]'' (dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works of [[D. H. Lawrence]].

[[George Orwell]] believed that ''Brave New World'' must have been partly derived from the 1921 novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]].&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell: [http://www.orwelltoday.com/weorwellreview.shtml ''Review''], ''Tribune'', 4 January 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins, Huxley says that he wrote ''Brave New World'' long before he had heard of ''We''.&lt;ref name="Russell, p. 13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Zamiatin's We|last=Russell|first=Robert|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-85399-393-0|location=Bristol|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''We'' translator Natasha Randall, Orwell believed that Huxley was lying.&lt;ref name="NR1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2006/aug/18/underappreciated-literature-yevgeny-zamyatin/|title=Leonard Lopate Show|date=18 August 2006|publisher=WNYC|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405075001/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2006/aug/18/underappreciated-literature-yevgeny-zamyatin/|archivedate=5 April 2011|df=dmy}} (radio interview with ''We'' translator Natasha Randall)&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific futurism in ''Brave New World'' is believed to be cribbed from ''[[Daedalus; or, Science and the Future|Daedalus]]'' by [[J. B. S. Haldane]].&lt;ref&gt;''Disturbing the Universe'', Chapter 15, Freeman Dyson, Basic Books, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in Britain in 1931, with its mass unemployment and the abandonment of the gold currency standard, persuaded Huxley to assert that stability was the "primal and ultimate need" if civilisation was to survive the present crisis.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"/&gt; The ''Brave New World'' character Mustapha Mond, Resident World Controller of Western Europe, is named after Sir [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|Alfred Mond]]. Shortly before writing the novel, Huxley visited [[Billingham Manufacturing Plant|Mond's technologically advanced plant]] near [[Billingham]], north east England, and it made a great impression on him.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"&gt;Introduction by David Bradshaw. p. xxii. Huxley, Aldous. "Brave New World". Random House, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley used the setting and characters in his science fiction novel to express widely held opinions, particularly the fear of losing individual identity in the fast-paced world of the future. An early trip to the United States gave ''Brave New World'' much of its character. Not only was Huxley outraged by the culture of youth, commercial cheeriness and sexual promiscuity, and the inward-looking nature of many Americans,&lt;ref&gt;The Vintage Classics edition of ''Brave New World''.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had also found the book ''My Life and Work'' by [[Henry Ford]] on the boat to America, and he saw the book's principles applied in everything he encountered after leaving San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Bradshaw, David.

==Plot==
The novel opens in the [[World state in Brave New World|World State]] city of [[London]] in AF (After Ford) 632 (AD 2540 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), where citizens are engineered through [[artificial uterus|artificial wombs]] and childhood indoctrination programmes into predetermined [[social class|classes]] (or castes) based on intelligence and labour. Lenina Crowne, a hatchery worker, is popular and sexually desirable, but Bernard Marx, a psychologist, is not. He is shorter in stature than the average member of his high caste, which gives him an [[inferiority complex]]. His work with [[hypnopaedia|sleep-learning]] allows him to understand, and disapprove of, his society's methods of keeping its citizens peaceful, which includes their constant consumption of a soothing, happiness-producing drug called ''soma''. Courting disaster, Bernard is vocal and arrogant about his criticisms, and his boss contemplates exiling him to [[Iceland]] because of his nonconformity. His only friend is Helmholtz Watson, a gifted writer who finds it difficult to use his talents creatively in their pain-free society.

Bernard takes a holiday with Lenina outside the World State to a Savage Reservation in [[New Mexico]], in which the two observe [[natural childbirth|natural-born]] people, disease, the aging process, other languages, and religious lifestyles for the first time. (The culture of the village folk resembles the contemporary Native American groups of the region, descendants of the [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]], including the [[Puebloan peoples]] of [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]], [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]] and [[Zuni people|Zuni]].) Bernard and Lenina witness a violent public ritual and then encounter Linda, a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John, now a young man. She, too, visited the reservation on a holiday many years ago, but became separated from her group and was left behind. She had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow-holidaymaker (who is revealed to be Bernard's boss, the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning). She did not try to return to the World State, because of her shame at her pregnancy. Despite spending his whole life in the reservation, John has never been accepted by the villagers, and his and Linda's lives have been hard and unpleasant. Linda has taught John to read, although from the only two books in her possession&amp;nbsp;— a scientific manual and the complete works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Ostracised by the villagers, John is able to articulate his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama, especially the tragedies of ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''. Linda now wants to return to London, and John, too, wants to see this "brave new world". Bernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him, and gets permission to take Linda and John back. On their return to London, John meets the Director and calls him his "father", a vulgarity which causes a roar of laughter. The humiliated Director resigns in shame before he can follow through with exiling Bernard.

Bernard, as "custodian" of the "savage" John who is now treated as a celebrity, is fawned on by the highest members of society and revels in attention he once scorned. Bernard's popularity is fleeting, though, and he becomes envious that John only really bonds with the literary-minded Helmholtz. Considered hideous and friendless, Linda spends all her time using ''soma'', while John refuses to attend social events organised by Bernard, appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society. Lenina and John are physically attracted to each other, but John's view of courtship and romance, based on Shakespeare's writings, is utterly incompatible with Lenina's freewheeling attitude to sex. She tries to seduce him, but he attacks her, before suddenly being informed that his mother is on her deathbed. He rushes to Linda's bedside, causing a scandal, as this is not the "correct" attitude to death. Some children who enter the ward for "death-conditioning" come across as disrespectful to John until he attacks one physically. He then tries to break up a distribution of ''soma'' to a lower-caste group, telling them that he is freeing them. Helmholtz and Bernard rush in to stop the ensuing riot, which the police quell by spraying ''soma'' vapor into the crowd.

Bernard, Helmholtz, and John are all brought before Mustapha Mond, the "Resident World Controller for Western Europe", who tells Bernard and Helmholtz that they are to be exiled to islands for antisocial activity. Bernard pleads for a second chance, but Helmholtz welcomes the opportunity to be a true individual, and chooses the [[Falkland Islands]] as his destination, believing that [[Climate of the Falkland Islands|their bad weather]] will inspire his writing. Mond tells Bernard that exile is actually a reward. The islands are full of the most interesting people in the world, individuals who did not fit into the social model of the World State. Mond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control. John rejects Mond's arguments, and Mond sums up John's views by claiming that John demands "the right to be unhappy". John asks if he may go to the islands as well, but Mond refuses, saying he wishes to see what happens to John next.

Jaded with his new life, John moves to an abandoned hilltop tower, near the village of [[Puttenham, Surrey|Puttenham]], where he intends to adopt a solitary [[ascetic]] lifestyle in order to purify himself of civilization, practising [[self-flagellation]]. This soon draws reporters and eventually hundreds of amazed sightseers, [[Rubbernecking|hoping to witness]] his bizarre behaviour; one of them is implied to be Lenina. At the sight of the woman he both adores and loathes, John attacks her with [[Cat o' nine tails|his whip]]. The onlookers are wildly aroused by the display and John is caught up in the crowd's ''soma''-fueled frenzy. The next morning, he remembers the previous night's events and is stricken with remorse. Onlookers and journalists who arrive that evening discover John dead, having hanged himself.

==Characters==
'''Bernard Marx''' – a sleep-learning specialist at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Although Bernard is an Alpha-Plus (the upper class of the society), he is a misfit. He is unusually short for an Alpha; an alleged accident with alcohol in Bernard's blood-surrogate before his decanting has left him slightly stunted. Bernard's independence of mind stems more from his inferiority complex and depressive nature than from any depth of philosophical conviction. Unlike his fellow utopians, Bernard is often angry, resentful, and jealous. At times, he is also cowardly and hypocritical. His conditioning is clearly incomplete. He doesn't enjoy communal sports, solidarity services, or promiscuous sex. He doesn't even get much joy out of ''soma''. Bernard is in love with Lenina but he doesn't like her sleeping with other men, even though "everyone belongs to everyone else". Bernard's triumphant return to utopian civilisation with John the Savage from the Reservation precipitates the downfall of the Director, who had been planning to exile him. Bernard's triumph is short-lived. Success goes to his head. Despite his tearful pleas, he is ultimately banished to an island&lt;!--NOTE: Although John asks if he could 'go to the islands' with Bernard and Watson, it is not necessarily true that Bernard and Watson are both going to the Falkland Islands. Only Watson is definitely going to the Falklands. Bernard's island is never explicitly stated.--&gt; for his non-conformist behaviour.

'''John''' – the illicit son of the Director and Linda, born and reared on the Savage Reservation ("Malpais") after Linda was unwittingly left behind by her errant lover. John ("the Savage", as he is often called) is an outsider both on the Reservation—where the natives still practice marriage, natural birth, family life and religion—and the ostensibly civilised World State, based on principles of stability and shallow happiness. He has read nothing but the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]], which he quotes extensively, and, for the most part, aptly, though his allusion to the "Brave New World" (Miranda's words in ''[[The Tempest]]'') takes on a darker and bitterly ironic resonance as the novel unfolds. John is intensely moral according to a code that he has been taught by Shakespeare and life in Malpais but is also naïve: his views are as imported into his own consciousness as are the [[hypnopedia|hypnopedic]] messages of World State citizens. The admonishments of the men of Malpais taught him to regard his mother as a whore; but he cannot grasp that these were the same men who continually sought her out despite their supposedly sacred pledges of monogamy. Because he is unwanted in Malpais, he accepts the invitation to travel back to London and is initially astonished by the comforts of the World State. However, he remains committed to values that exist only in his poetry. He first spurns Lenina for failing to live up to his Shakespearean ideal and then the entire utopian society: he asserts that its technological wonders and consumerism are poor substitutes for individual freedom, human dignity and personal integrity. After his mother's death, he becomes deeply distressed with grief, surprising onlookers in the hospital. He then ostracizes himself from society and attempts to purify himself of "sin" (desire), but is finally unable to do so and hangs himself in despair.

'''Helmholtz Watson''' – a handsome and successful Alpha-Plus lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering and a friend of Bernard. He feels unfulfilled writing endless propaganda doggerel, and the stifling conformism and philistinism of the World State make him restive. Helmholtz is ultimately exiled to the [[Falkland Islands]]—a cold asylum for disaffected Alpha-Plus non-conformists—after reading a heretical poem to his students on the virtues of solitude and helping John destroy some Deltas' rations of ''soma'' following Linda's death. Unlike Bernard, he takes his exile in his stride and comes to view it as an opportunity for inspiration in his writing.

'''Lenina Crowne''' – a young, beautiful fetus technician at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. She is  part of the 30% of the female population that are not freemartins (sterile women). Lenina is promiscuous and popular but somewhat quirky in her society: she had a four-month relation with Henry Foster, choosing not to have sex with anyone but him for a period of time. She is basically happy and well-conditioned, using ''soma'' to suppress unwelcome emotions, as is expected. Lenina has a date with Bernard, to whom she feels ambivalently attracted, and she goes to the Reservation with him. On returning to civilization, she tries and fails to seduce John the Savage. John loves and desires Lenina but he is repelled by her forwardness and the prospect of pre-marital sex, rejecting her as an "[[List of quotes from Shakespeare in Brave New World#Chapter 13|impudent strumpet]]". Lenina visits John at the lighthouse but he attacks her with a whip, unwittingly inciting onlookers to do the same. Her exact fate is left unspecified.

'''Mustapha Mond''' – Resident World Controller of Western Europe, "His Fordship" Mustapha Mond presides over one of the ten zones of the World State, the global government set up after the cataclysmic Nine Years' War and great Economic Collapse. Sophisticated and good-natured, Mond is an urbane and hyperintelligent advocate of the World State and its ethos of "Community, Identity, Stability". Among the novel's characters, he is uniquely aware of the precise nature of the society he oversees and what it has given up to accomplish its gains. Mond argues that art, literature, and scientific freedom must be sacrificed to secure the ultimate [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] goal of maximising societal happiness. He defends the genetic caste system, behavioural conditioning, and the lack of personal freedom in the World State: these, he says, are a price worth paying for achieving social stability, the highest social virtue because it leads to lasting happiness.

'''Fanny Crowne''' – Lenina Crowne's friend (they have the same last name because only ten thousand last names are in use in the World State). Fanny voices the conventional values of her caste and society, particularly the importance of promiscuity: she advises Lenina that she should have more than one man in her life because it is unseemly to concentrate on just one. Fanny then, however, warns Lenina away from a new lover whom she considers undeserving, yet she is ultimately supportive of the young woman's attraction to the savage John.

'''Henry Foster''' – One of Lenina's many lovers, he is a perfectly conventional Alpha male, casually discussing Lenina's body with his coworkers. His success with Lenina, and his casual attitude about it, infuriate the jealous Bernard. Henry ultimately proves himself every bit the ideal World State citizen, finding no courage to defend Lenina from John's assaults despite having maintained an uncommonly longstanding sexual relationship with her.

'''Benito Hoover''' – Another of Lenina's lovers. She remembers that he is particularly hairy when he takes his clothes off.

'''The Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning (DHC)''', also known as '''Thomas "Tomakin"''' – He is the administrator of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where he is a threatening figure who intends to exile Bernard to Iceland. His plans take an unexpected turn, however, when Bernard returns from the Reservation with Linda (see below) and John, a child they both realize is actually his. This fact, scandalous and obscene in the World State not because it was extramarital (which all sexual acts are) but because it was procreative, leads the Director to resign his post in shame.

'''Linda''' – John's mother, decanted as a Beta-Minus in the World State, originally worked in the DHC's Fertilizing Room, and subsequently lost during a storm while visiting the New Mexico Savage Reservation with the Director many years before the events of the novel. Despite following her usual precautions, Linda became pregnant with the Director's son during their time together and was therefore unable to return to the World State by the time that she found her way to Malpais. Having been conditioned to the promiscuous social norms of the World State, Linda finds herself at once popular with every man in the pueblo (because she is open to all sexual advances) and also reviled for the same reason, seen as a whore by the wives of the men who visit her and by the men themselves (who come to her nonetheless). Her only comforts there are ''mescal'' brought by Popé as well as ''[[peyote|peyotl]]''. Linda is desperate to return to the World State and to ''soma'', wanting nothing more from her remaining life than comfort until death.

'''The Arch-Community-Songster''' – The secular equivalent of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in the World State society.

'''The Warden''' – An Alpha-Minus, the talkative chief administrator for the New Mexico Savage Reservation. He is blond, short, broad-shouldered, and has a booming voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=101}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Darwin Bonaparte''' – a "big game photographer" (i.e. filmmaker) who films John flogging himself. Darwin Bonaparte is known for two other works: "feely of the gorillas' wedding",&lt;ref name="Brave New World"&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=253}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and "Sperm Whale's Love-life".&lt;ref name="Brave New World"/&gt; He has already made a name for himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=252}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but still seeks more. He renews his fame by filming the savage, John, in his newest release "The Savage of Surrey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New World|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|date=1932|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|isbn=978-0-06-085052-4|location=New York|page=254}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-04-16--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His name alludes to [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].

===Others===
* [[Freemartin#Fictional use|Freemartins]]: These women have been deliberately made sterile by exposure to male hormones during fetal development but still physically normal except for "the slightest tendency to grow beards." In the book, government policy requires freemartins to form 70% of the female population.

===Of Malpais===
*'''Popé''', a native of Malpais. Although he reinforces the behaviour that causes hatred for Linda in Malpais by sleeping with her and bringing her ''[[mescal]]'', he still holds the traditional beliefs of his tribe. In his early years John also attempts to kill him. He gave Linda a copy of the Complete Works of Shakespeare.
*'''Mitsima''', an elder tribal [[shaman]] who also teaches John survival skills such as rudimentary ceramics (specifically [[coil pot]]s, which were traditional to Native American tribes) and bow-making.

===Background figures===
These are non-fictional and factual characters who lived before the events in this book, but are of note in the novel:
*'''[[Henry Ford]]''', who has become a [[messianism|messianic]] figure to the [[World state in Brave New World|World State]]. "Our Ford" is used in place of "Our Lord", as a credit to popularising the use of the [[assembly line]]. Huxley's description of Ford as a central figure in the emergence of the ''Brave New World'' might also be a reference to the utopian industrial city of ''[[Fordlândia]]'' commissioned by Ford in 1927.{{speculation inline|date=August 2014}}
*'''[[Sigmund Freud]]''', "Our Freud" is sometimes said in place of "Our Ford" because Freud's psychoanalytic method depends implicitly upon the rules of classical conditioning, and because Freud popularized the idea that sexual activity is essential to human happiness. (It is also strongly implied that citizens of the World State believe Freud and Ford to be the same person.)&lt;ref&gt;chapter 3, "Our Ford-or Our Freud, as, for some inscrutable reason, he chose to call himself whenever he spoke of psychological matters–Our Freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life"&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[H. G. Wells]]''', "Dr Wells", British writer and [[utopian socialism|utopian socialist]], whose book ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' was an incentive for ''Brave New World''. "All's well that ends Wells", wrote Huxley in his letters, criticising Wells for anthropological assumptions Huxley found unrealistic.
*'''[[Ivan Pavlov|Ivan Petrovich Pavlov]]''', whose conditioning techniques are used to train infants.
*'''[[William Shakespeare]]''', whose banned works are quoted throughout the novel by John, "the Savage". The plays quoted include ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. Mustapha Mond also knows them because as a World Controller he has access to a selection of books from throughout history, including the Bible.
*'''[[Thomas Robert Malthus]]''', 19th century British economist, believed the people of the Earth would eventually be threatened by their inability to raise enough food to feed the population. In the novel, the eponymous character devises the contraceptive techniques (Malthusian belt) that are practiced by women of the World State. 
*'''Reuben Rabinovitch''', the Russian-Jewish character on whom the effects of sleep-learning, [[Sleep-learning|hypnopædia]], are first observed.
*'''[[John Henry Newman]]''', 19th century Catholic theologian and educator, believed university education the critical element in advancing post-industrial Western civilization. Mustapha Mond and The Savage discuss a passage from one of Newman's books.
*[[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|'''Alfred Mond''']], British industrialist, financier and politician. He is the namesake of Mustapha Mond&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/22/aldous-huxley-prophet-dystopia-cs-lewis|title=Aldous Huxley: the prophet of our brave new digital dystopia {{!}} John Naughton|last=Naughton|first=John|date=2013-11-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of names and references===
The limited number of names that the World State assigned to its bottle-grown citizens can be traced to political and cultural figures who contributed to the bureaucratic, economic, and technological systems of Huxley's age, and presumably those systems in ''Brave New World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jerome |last=Meckier |editor1-last=Firchow |editor1-first=Peter Edgerly |editor2-last=Nugel |editor2-first=Bernfried |chapter=Onomastic Satire: Names and Naming in ''Brave New World'' |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=D159Z5kJa_YC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1#PPA185,M1 |title=Aldous Huxley: modern satirical novelist of ideas |publisher=Lit Verlag |year=2006 |pages=187ff |isbn=3-8258-9668-4 |oclc=71165436 |accessdate=28 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Upon publication, [[Rebecca West]] praised ''Brave New World'' as "The most accomplished novel Huxley has yet written",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 5 February 1932. Reprinted in Donald Watt, “Aldous Huxley: The Critical Heritage. London; Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1136209697}} (pp. 197–201).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Needham]] lauded it as "Mr. Huxley's remarkable book",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]'', May 1932 . Reprinted in Watt, (pp. 202–205).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] also praised it, stating, "Mr. Aldous Huxley has shown his usual masterly skill in ''Brave New World.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Leader]]'', 11 March 1932. Reprinted in Watt, (pp. 210–13).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''Brave New World'' also received negative responses from other contemporary critics, although his work was later embraced.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous. ''Brave New World''. Harper Perennial Modern Classics; Reprint edition (17 October 2006), P.S. Edition, {{ISBN|978-0-06-085052-4}} &amp;nbsp;— "About the Book."&amp;nbsp;— "Too Far Ahead of Its Time? The Contemporary Response to ''Brave New World'' (1932)" p. 8-11&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the 4 May 1935 issue of the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', [[G. K. Chesterton]] explained that Huxley was revolting against the "Age of Utopias". Much of the discourse on man's future before 1914 was based on the thesis that humanity would solve all economic and social issues. In the decade following the war the discourse shifted to an examination of the causes of the catastrophe. The works of [[H. G. Wells]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] on the promises of socialism and a World State were then viewed as the ideas of naive optimists. Chesterton wrote:

{{bquote|After the Age of Utopias came what we may call the American Age, lasting as long as the Boom. Men like Ford or Mond seemed to many to have solved the social riddle and made capitalism the common good. But it was not native to us; it went with a buoyant, not to say blatant optimism, which is not our negligent or negative optimism. Much more than Victorian righteousness, or even Victorian self-righteousness, that optimism has driven people into pessimism. For the Slump brought even more disillusionment than the War. A new bitterness, and a new bewilderment, ran through all social life, and was reflected in all literature and art. It was contemptuous, not only of the old Capitalism, but of the old Socialism. ''Brave New World'' is more of a revolution against Utopia than against Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;G.K. Chesterton, review in ''The Illustrated London News'', 4 May 1935&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, in 1944 economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] described ''Brave New World'' as a [[satire]] of utopian predictions of [[socialism]]: "Aldous Huxley was even courageous enough to make socialism's dreamed paradise the target of his sardonic irony."&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises (1944). [https://mises.org/system/tdf/Bureaucracy_3.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document Bureaucracy], New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''Brave New World'' fifth on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].&lt;ref name="100 Best Novels"/&gt; In 2003, [[Robert McCrum]] writing for ''[[The Observer]]'' included ''Brave New World'' chronologically at number 53 in "the top 100 greatest novels of all time",&lt;ref name="McCrum"/&gt; and the novel was listed at number 87 on the [[BBC]]'s survey [[The Big Read]].&lt;ref name="BBC – The Big Read"/&gt;

==Fordism and society==
{{Main|World State in Brave New World}}
The World State is built upon the principles of [[Henry Ford]]'s [[assembly line]]: mass production, homogeneity, predictability, and consumption of disposable consumer goods. While the World State lacks any supernatural-based religions, Ford himself is revered as the creator of their society but not as a deity, and characters celebrate Ford Day and swear oaths by his name (e.g., "By Ford!"). In this sense, some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a "T". In England, there is an Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury, obviously continuing the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and in America the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' continues publication as ''The Fordian Science Monitor''. The World State calendar numbers years in the "AF" era — "Anno Ford" — with the calendar beginning in AD 1908, the year in which Ford's first [[Ford Model T|Model T]] rolled off his assembly line. The novel's [[Gregorian calendar]] year is AD 2540, but it is referred to in the book as AF 632.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

From birth, members of every class are [[indoctrination|indoctrinated]] by recorded voices repeating slogans while they sleep (called "hypnopædia" in the book) to believe their own class is superior, but that the other classes perform needed functions. Any residual unhappiness is resolved by an [[antidepressant]] and [[hallucinogenic drug]] called ''soma.''

The biological techniques used to control the populace in ''Brave New World'' do not include [[genetic engineering]]; Huxley wrote the book before the structure of [[DNA]] was known. However, [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work with inheritance patterns in peas had been rediscovered in 1900 and the [[eugenics]] movement, based on [[artificial selection]], was well established. [[Huxley family|Huxley's family]] included a number of prominent biologists including [[Thomas Huxley]], half-brother and [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Andrew Huxley]], and his brother [[Julian Huxley]] who was a biologist and involved in the eugenics movement. Nonetheless, Huxley emphasises conditioning over breeding ([[nature versus nurture|nurture versus nature]]); human embryos and fetuses are conditioned through a carefully designed regimen of chemical (such as exposure to hormones and toxins), thermal (exposure to intense heat or cold, as one's future career would dictate), and other environmental stimuli, although there is an element of [[selective breeding]] as well.

==Comparisons with George Orwell's '' Nineteen Eighty-Four ''==
Social critic [[Neil Postman]] contrasted the worlds of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''Brave New World'' in the foreword of his 1985 book ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]''. He writes:
{{Quote|What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egotism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in ''Brave New World Revisited,'' the civil [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny "failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions." In ''1984'', Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In ''Brave New World,'' they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that our fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that our desire will ruin us.}}

Journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]], who himself published several articles on Huxley and a book on Orwell, noted the difference between the two texts in the introduction to his 1999 article "Why Americans Are Not Taught History":

{{Quote|We dwell in a present-tense culture that somehow, significantly, decided to employ the telling expression "You're history" as a choice reprobation or insult, and thus elected to speak forgotten volumes about itself. By that standard, the forbidding dystopia of George Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' already belongs, both as a text and as a date, with [[Ur]] and [[Mycenae]], while the [[hedonism|hedonist]] [[nihilism]] of Huxley still beckons toward a painless, amusement-sodden, and stress-free consensus. Orwell's was a house of horrors. He seemed to strain credulity because he posited a regime that would go to any lengths to own and possess history, to rewrite and construct it, and to inculcate it by means of coercion. Whereas Huxley ... rightly foresaw that any such regime could break because it could not bend. In 1988, four years after 1984, the [[Soviet Union]] scrapped its official history curriculum and announced that a newly authorized version was somewhere in the works. This was the precise moment when the regime conceded its own extinction. For true blissed-out and vacant servitude, though, you need an otherwise sophisticated society where no serious history is taught.&lt;ref name="Hitches"&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens]], "Goodbye to All That: Why Americans Are Not Taught History." ''[[Harper's Magazine]]''. November 1998, pp. 37–47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==''Brave New World Revisited''==
[[File:BraveNewWorldRevisited.JPG|thumb|First UK edition]]
'''''Brave New World Revisited''''' ([[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Brothers]], US, 1958; [[Chatto &amp; Windus]], UK, 1959),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betweenthecovers.com/btc/item/60450 |title=Brave New World Revisited – HUXLEY, Aldous &amp;#124; Between the Covers Rare Books |publisher=Betweenthecovers.com |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609233725/http://www.betweenthecovers.com/btc/item/60450 |archivedate=9 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; written by Huxley almost thirty years after ''Brave New World'', is a non-fiction work in which Huxley considered whether the world had moved toward or away from his vision of the future from the 1930s. He believed when he wrote the original novel that it was a reasonable guess as to where the world might go in the future. In ''Brave New World Revisited'', he concluded that the world was becoming like ''Brave New World'' much faster than he originally thought.

Huxley analysed the causes of this, such as [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], as well as all the means by which populations can be controlled. He was particularly interested in the effects of [[recreational drug use|drugs]] and [[subliminal message|subliminal suggestion]]. ''Brave New World Revisited'' is different in tone because of Huxley's evolving thought, as well as his conversion to Hindu [[Vedanta]] in the interim between the two books.

The last chapter of the book aims to propose action which could be taken to prevent a democracy from turning into the [[totalitarian]] world described in ''Brave New World''. In Huxley's last novel, ''[[Island (Huxley novel)|Island]]'', he again expounds similar ideas to describe a utopian nation, which is generally known as a counterpart to his most famous work.

== Censorship/banning instances, accusation of plagiarism ==
The [[American Library Association]] ranks ''Brave New World'' as No. 52 on their list of [[most challenged books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=bbwlinks&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=85714|title=The 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10#2010|title=Top ten frequently challenged books lists of the 21st century|work=ala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following list includes some notable incidents in which it has been censored, banned, or challenged:

*In 1932, the book was banned in [[Ireland]] for its language, and for supposedly being anti-family and anti-religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classiclit.about.com/od/bannedliteratur1/tp/aa_bannedbooks.htm|title=Banned Books|date=2 November 2009|publisher=Classiclit.about.com|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcc.edu/library/news/banned_books.html |title=Banned Books |publisher=pcc.edu |accessdate=11 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602184644/https://www.pcc.edu/library/news/banned_books.html |archivedate= 2 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1965, a [[Maryland]] English teacher alleged that he was fired for assigning ''Brave New World'' to students. The teacher sued for violation of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights but lost both his case and the appeal.&lt;ref name="karolides2011_p472_1"&gt;{{cite book|title=120 Banned Books: Censorship Histories of World Literature|last2=Bald|first2=Margaret|last3=Sova|first3=Dawn B.|publisher=Checkmark Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8160-8232-2|edition=Second|page=472|quote=In 1965, a teacher of English in Maryland claimed that the local school board had violated his First Amendment rights by firing him after he assigned ''Brave New World'' as a required reading in his class. The district court ruled against the teacher in ''Parker v. Board of Education'', 237 F. Supp. 222 (D.Md) and refused his request for reinstatement in the teaching position. When the case was later heard by the circuit court, ''Parker v. Board of Education'', 348 F.2d 464 (4th Cir. 1965), the presiding judge affirmed the ruling of the lower court and included in the determination the opinion that the nontenured status of the teacher accounted for the firing and not the assignment of a particular book.|last1=Karolides|first1=Nicholas J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The book was banned in India in 1967, with Huxley accused of being a "pornographer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bare breasts and Bare Bottoms: Anatomy of Film Censorship in India|last=Sharma|first=Partap|publisher=[[Jaico Publishing House]]|year=1975|editor-last=Razdan|editor-first=C.

*In 1980, it was removed from classrooms in [[Miller, Missouri|Miller]], Missouri among other challenges.
*In 1982, [[Polish people|Polish]] author Antoni Smuszkiewicz, in his analysis of Polish science-fiction ''Zaczarowana gra'' ("The Magic Game"), presented accusations of [[plagiarism]] against Huxley. Smuszkiewicz showed similarities between ''Brave New World'' and two science fiction novels written earlier by Polish author [[Mieczysław Smolarski]], namely ''Miasto światłości'' ("The City of Light", 1924) and ''Podróż poślubna pana Hamiltona'' ("Mr Hamilton's Honeymoon Trip", 1928).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zaczarowana gra|last=Smuszkiewicz|first=Antoni|publisher=Wydawn. Poznanskie|year=1982|location=[[Poznań]]|language=Polish|oclc=251929765}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smolarski wrote in his open letter to Huxley: "This work of a great author, both in the general depiction of the world as well as countless details, is so similar to two of my novels that in my opinion there is no possibility of accidental analogy."&lt;ref&gt;Nowiny Literackie" 1948 No. 4, p 7&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kurt Vonnegut]] said that in writing ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' (1952), he "cheerfully ripped off the plot of ''Brave New World'', whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin's ''We''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Playboy]] [http://www.playboy.com/magazine/interview_archive/kurt-vonnegut/kurt-vonnegut.html interview with Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210155908/http://www.playboy.com/magazine/interview_archive/kurt-vonnegut/kurt-vonnegut.html |date=10 February 2009 }}, July 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Carbon-neutral fuels are synthetic hydrocarbons. They can be produced in chemical reactions between carbon dioxide, which can be captured from power plants or the air, and hydrogen, which is created by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy. The fuel, often referred to as [[electrofuel]], stores the energy that was used in the production of the hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Richard |author2=Eisaman |title=Energy Storage Via Carbon-Neutral Fuels Made From Carbon dioxide, Water, and Renewable Energy |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |date=2011 |url=http://www.uk-shec.org.uk/uk-shec/news/IEEE_Paper_6_3_5_finalx1x.pdf |accessdate=18 October 2012 |doi=10.1109/jproc.2011.2168369 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=440–460 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508220516/http://www.uk-shec.org.uk/uk-shec/news/IEEE_Paper_6_3_5_finalx1x.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.359.8746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal can also be used to produce the hydrogen, but that would not be a carbon-neutral source. Carbon dioxide can be captured and buried, making fossil fuels carbon-neutral, although not renewable. Carbon capture from exhaust gas can make carbon-neutral fuels carbon negative. Other hydrocarbons can be broken down to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide which could then be stored while the hydrogen is used for energy or fuel, which would also be carbon-neutral.&lt;ref name=Kleiner&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kleiner |first=kurt |title=Carbon Neutral Fuel; a new approach |journal=The Globe and Mail |date=17 January 2009 |pages=F4 |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=303830&amp;sr=HLEAD(CARBON-NEUTRAL+FUEL)+and+date+is+January+17%2C+2009 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most energy-efficient fuel to produce is [[hydrogen]] gas,&lt;ref name ="ubaposition"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/377/publikationen/uba_position_powertoliquid_engl.pdf |title =Integration of Power to Gas/Power to Liquids into the ongoing transformation process |date = June 2016|accessdate = August 10, 2017 |page =12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and which requires the fewest process steps to produce.

Methanol can be made from a chemical reaction of a carbon-dioxide molecule with three hydrogen molecules to produce methanol and water. The stored energy can be recovered by burning the methanol in a combustion engine, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and heat. [[Methane]] can be produced in a similar reaction. Special precautions against methane leaks are important since methane is nearly 100 times as potent as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in terms of [[Global warming potential]]. More energy can be used to combine methanol or methane into larger hydrocarbon fuel molecules.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

Researchers have also suggested using methanol to produce [[dimethyl ether]]. This fuel could be used as a substitute for diesel fuel due to its ability to self ignite under high pressure and temperature. It is already being used in some areas for heating and energy generation. It is nontoxic, but must be stored under pressure.&lt;ref name=Olah&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olah |first=George |author2=Alain Geoppert |author3=G. K.

All synthetic hydrocarbons are generally produced at temperatures of 200–300&amp;nbsp;°C, and at pressures of 20 to 50 bar. [[Catalyst]]s are usually used to improve the efficiency of the reaction and create the desired type of hydrocarbon fuel. Such reactions are exothermic and use about 3&amp;nbsp;mol of hydrogen per mole of carbon dioxide involved. They also produce large amounts of water as a byproduct.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt;

== Sources of carbon for recycling ==
The most economical source of carbon for recycling into fuel is [[flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion]] where it can be obtained for about USD $7.50 per ton.&lt;ref name=MacDowell2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolow2011/&gt;&lt;ref name= Pennline2010/&gt; Automobile exhaust gas capture has also been seen as economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting.&lt;ref name=Musadi2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Musadi |first=M.R. |last2=Martin |first2=P. |last3=Garforth |first3=A. |last4=Mann |first4=R. |date=2011 |title=Carbon neutral gasoline re-synthesised from on-board sequestrated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Chemical Engineering Transactions |volume=24 |pages=1525–30 |doi=10.3303/CET1124255 |url=http://www.aidic.it/cet/11/24/255.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since carbonic acid in seawater is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with atmospheric carbon dioxide, extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=DiMascio |first=Felice |last2=Willauer |first2=Heather D. |authorlink2=Heather Willauer |last3=Hardy |first3=Dennis R. |last4=Lewis |first4=M.

Proposals for this method involve using a caustic chemical to react with carbon dioxide in the air to produce [[carbonate]]s. These can then be broken down and hydrated to release pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas and regenerate the caustic chemical. This process requires more energy than other methods because carbon dioxide is at much lower concentrations in the atmosphere than in other sources.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

Researchers have also suggested using biomass as a carbon source for fuel production. Adding hydrogen to the biomass would reduce its carbon to produce fuel. This method has the advantage of using plant matter to cheaply capture carbon dioxide. The plants also add some chemical energy to the fuel from biological molecules. This may be a more efficient use of biomass than conventional [[biofuel]] because it uses most of the carbon and chemical energy from the biomass instead of releasing as much energy and carbon. Its main disadvantage is, as with conventional ethanol production, it competes with food production.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt;

== Renewable and nuclear energy costs ==

Nighttime [[wind power]] is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the [[load curve]] for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U.S. averaged 1.64 cents per [[kilowatt-hour]] in 2009, but only 0.71 cents/kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; Typically, [[wholesale]] electricity costs 2 to 5 cents/kWh during the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newfuelist.com/ Electricity Price] ''NewFuelist.com'' (compare to [http://dotyenergy.com/Images/windprice-2010-W.jpg off-peak wind power price graph.]) Retrieved September 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce gasoline for less than [[petroleum]] fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last=Holte |first=Laura L. |last2=Doty |first2=Glenn N. |last3=McCree |first3=David L. |last4=Doty |first4=Judy M. |last5=Doty |first5=F.

In 2010, a team of process chemists led by [[Heather Willauer]] of the U.S. Navy, estimates that 100 megawatts of electricity can produce 41,000 gallons of [[jet fuel]] per day and shipboard production from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon. While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a [[carrier battle group]] costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive.&lt;ref name="jetsea"&gt;{{Cite report |last=Willauer |first=Heather D. |last2=Hardy |first2=Dennis R. |last3=Williams |first3=Frederick W. |date=September 29, 2010 |title=''Feasibility and Current Estimated Capital Costs of Producing Jet Fuel at Sea'' |publisher=Chemistry Division, Navy Technology Center for Safety and Survivability, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory |location=Washington, DC |type=memorandum report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA539765 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greenhouse gas remediation ==
Carbon-neutral fuels can lead to greenhouse gas remediation because carbon dioxide gas would be reused to produce fuel instead of being released into the atmosphere. Capturing the carbon dioxide in flue gas emissions from power plants would eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions, although burning the fuel in vehicles would release that carbon because there is no economical way to capture those emissions.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; This approach would reduce net carbon dioxide emission by about 50% if it were used on all fossil fuel power plants. Most [[coal power plant|coal]] and [[natural gas power plant]]s have been predicted to be economically retrofittable with [[carbon dioxide scrubber]]s for [[carbon capture]] to recycle flue exhaust or for [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=DiPietro |first=Phil |last2=Nichols |first2=Chris |last3=Marquis |first3=Michael |date=January 2011 |title=''Coal-Fired Power Plants in the United States: Examination of the Costs of Retrofitting with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture Technology, Revision 3'' |publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy |type=report NETL-402/102309 |docket=DOE contract DE-AC26-04NT41817 |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/energy-analyses/pubs/GIS_CCS_retrofit.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolow2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=House2011/&gt; Such recycling is expected to not only cost less than the excess [[economic impacts of climate change]] if it were not done, but also to pay for itself as global fuel [[economic demand|demand]] growth and [[peak oil]] shortages increase the price of [[petroleum]] and [[Fungibility|fungible]] [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name=Goeppert2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lackner2012/&gt;

Capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly from the air or extracting carbonic acid from seawater would also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment, and create a closed cycle of carbon to eliminate new carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt; Use of these methods would eliminate the need for fossil fuels entirely, assuming that enough renewable energy could be generated to produce the fuel. Using synthetic hydrocarbons to produce synthetic materials such as plastics could result in permanent sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

== Traditional fuels, methanol or ethanol ==
{{See also|Methanol economy}}

Some authorities have recommended producing [[methanol]] instead of traditional transportation fuels. It is a liquid at normal temperatures and can be toxic if ingested. Methanol has a higher [[octane rating]] than gasoline but a lower [[energy density]], and can be mixed with other fuels or used on its own. It may also be used in the production of more complex hydrocarbons and polymers. Direct methanol fuel cells have been developed by Caltech's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] to convert methanol and oxygen into electricity.&lt;ref name=Olah /&gt; It is possible to convert methanol into gasoline, jet fuel or other hydrocarbons, but that requires additional energy and more complex production facilities.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt; Methanol is slightly more corrosive than traditional fuels, requiring automobile modifications on the order of USD $100 each to use it.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steinberg1995&gt;{{Cite report |last=Steinberg |first=Meyer |date=August 1995 |title=''The Carnol Process for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Mitigation from Power Plants and the Transportation Sector |publisher=Department of Advanced Technology, Brookhaven National Laboratory |location=Upton, New York |type=informal report BNL–62110 |docket=(Prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-76CH00016) |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/100204-X2uZUC/webviewable/100204.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a method using [[carbon spikes]], [[copper nanoparticle]]s and nitrogen that converts carbon dioxide to [[ethanol]] was developed.&lt;ref name="CO2_to_ethanol" /&gt;

Investigation of carbon-neutral fuels has been ongoing for decades. A 1965 report suggested synthesizing methanol from carbon dioxide in air using nuclear power for a mobile fuel depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=Beller |first=M. |last2=Steinberg |first2=M. |date=November 1965 |title=''Liquid fuel synthesis using nuclear power in a mobile energy depot system'' |publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory, under contract with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission |location=Upton, New York |type=research report BNL 955 / T–396 |docket=(General, Miscellaneous, and Progress Reports — TID–4500, 46th Ed.) |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015086582635 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipboard production of synthetic fuel using [[nuclear power]] was studied in 1977 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Bushore |first=U.S. Navy Lieutenant Robin Paul |date=May 1977 |title=Synthetic Fuel Generation Capabilities of Nuclear Power Plants with Applications to Naval Ship Technology |degree=M.Sc. |publisher=Department of Ocean Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |url=https://archive.org/details/syntheticfuelgen00bush |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Terry |first=U.S. Navy Lieutenant Kevin B. |date=June 1995 |title=Synthetic Fuels for Naval Applications Produced Using Shipboard Nuclear Power |degree=M.Sc. |publisher=Department of Nuclear Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA299090 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1984 report studied the recovery of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=Steinberg |first=M. |date=1984 |title=''A Systems Study for the Removal, Recovery and Disposal of Carbon Dioxide from Fossil Power Plants in the U.S.'' |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, Carbon Dioxide Research Division |location=Washington, D.C. |type=technical report DOE/CH/0016-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_systems_study_for_the_removal_recovery.html?id=y-3kAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=September 8, 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 report compared converting [[vehicle fleet]]s for the use of carbon-neutral methanol with the further [[Gas to liquids#Mobil process|synthesis of gasoline]].&lt;ref name=Steinberg1995/&gt;

The '''Committee on Standards in Public Life''' (CSPL) is an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] of the United Kingdom Government, established in 1994 to advise the Prime Minister on ethical standards of public life.

==Organisation==

The Committee on Standards in Public Life is an independent advisory [[non-departmental public body]], with a secretariat and budget provided by the [[Cabinet Office]]. It is responsible for:&lt;ref name="About the committee"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about | title=Committee on Standards in Public Life/About | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* advising the Prime Minister on ethical issues relating to standards in public life
* conducting broad inquiries into standards of conduct
* making recommendations as to changes in present arrangements
* promoting the [[#The Seven Principles of Public life|7 principles of public life]].

The Committee does not investigate individual allegations of misconduct, that being the role of the relevant regulator.
 
The Committee is made up of the chair, five independent members appointed by the Prime Minister following open competition, and three political members appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the leaders of the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrat Party.&lt;ref name="Membership"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about/membership | title=Membership | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the Committee members were [[Paul Bew|Lord Bew]] (Chair), The [[Lord Alderdice]], The Rt Hon [[Dame Margaret Beckett]] DBE MP, [[Sheila Drew Smith]] OBE, [[Patricia Moberly]], [[Richard Thomas (lawyer)|Richard Thomas]] CBE, and [[Dame Angela Watkinson]] DBE MP.&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about/membership | title=Members | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Committee was initially established in October 1994 by the Prime Minister, [[John Major]], in response to concerns that conduct by some politicians was unethical—-for example, during the [[cash-for-questions affair]].&lt;ref&gt;Leopold (2004). p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994 terms of reference===
The Committee's original terms of reference were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04888.pdf House of Commons Library, ''Committee on Standards in Public Life'', SN/PC/04888, 11 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|To examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of [[public office]], including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards of propriety in public life.}}

The term "public office" was defined to include [[minister (government)|ministers]], civil servants and advisers; [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] and UK Members of the [[European Parliament]];&lt;ref&gt;See {{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/31457667/Libero_mandato_e_compravendita_di_parlamentari_garanzie_e_patologia_delle_immunit%C3%A0 Giampiero Buonomo, ''Libero mandato e “compravendita” di parlamentari: garanzie e patologia delle immunità'', Questione giustizia, 16 febbraio 2017, p. 4/12].&lt;/ref&gt; Members and senior officers of all non-departmental public bodies and of national health service bodies; non-ministerial office holders; members and other senior officers of other bodies discharging publicly funded functions; and elected members and senior officers of [[local authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;Leopold (2004). pp. 417–418.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First report, 1995 ===
The Committee's First Report&lt;ref name="firstreport"&gt;First Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (1995). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 established ''The Seven Principles of Public Life'', also known as the "Nolan principles". They were:&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt;
*'''[[Altruism|Selflessness]]''' – Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest. They should not do so to gain financial or other benefits for themselves, their family or their friends.
*'''[[Integrity]]''' – Holders of public office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organisations that might seek to influence them in the performance of their official duties.

*'''[[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivity]]''' – In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of public office should make choices on merit and facts not on personal judgements
*'''[[Accountability]]''' – Holders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.
*'''[[Openness]]''' – Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.
*'''[[Honesty]]''' – Holders of public office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest.
*'''[[Leadership]]''' – Holders of public office should promote and support these principles by leadership and example.

===1997 terms of reference===
In November 1997, [[Tony Blair]] extended the Committee's terms of reference: "To review issues in relation to the funding of political parties, and to make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements."&lt;ref name="2011-14"&gt;Annual Report 2010–11 (2011). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 terms of reference===
On 5 February 2013, the Committee's terms of reference were clarified in two ways – (1): ‘…in future the Committee should not inquire into matters relating to the devolved legislatures and governments except with the agreement of those bodies’, and (2): ‘…the Committee’s remit to examine “standards of conduct of all holders of public office” [encompasses] all those involved in the delivery of public services, not solely those appointed or elected to public office.'&lt;ref name="Terms of reference"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about/terms-of-reference | title=Terms of reference | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 clarification===
The terms of reference were further clarified on 28 February 2013 to explain that the Committee "can examine issues relating to the ethical standards of the delivery of public services by private and voluntary sector organisations, paid for by public funds, even where those delivering the services have not been appointed or elected to public office.”

==The Seven Principles of Public life==
The ''Seven Principles of Public Life'' have been amended over the years. They are currently (2015) worded as follows:&lt;ref name="2015 principles"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2 | title=The 7 principles of public life | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Altruism|Selflessness]]''' – Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest.
*'''[[Integrity]]''' – Holders of public office must avoid placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work. They should not act or take decisions to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. They must declare and resolve any interests and relationships.
*'''[[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivity]]''' – Holders of public office must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias.
*'''[[Accountability]]''' – Holders of public office are accountable to the public for their decisions and actions and must submit themselves to the scrutiny necessary to ensure this.
*'''[[Openness]]''' – Holders of public office should act and take decisions in an open and transparent manner. Information should not be withheld from the public unless there are clear and lawful reasons for so doing.
*'''[[Honesty]]''' – Holders of public office should be truthful
*'''[[Leadership]]''' – Holders of public office should exhibit these principles in their own behaviour. They should actively promote and robustly support the principles and be willing to challenge poor behaviour wherever it occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Conceptual architecture''' is a form of architecture that utilizes [[conceptualism]], characterized by an introduction of ideas or concepts from outside of architecture often as a means of expanding the discipline of architecture. This produces an essentially different kind of building than one produced by the widely held 'architect as a master-builder' model, in which craft and construction are the guiding principles. The finished building as product is less important in conceptual architecture, than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations. Architects that work in this vein are [[Diller and Scofidio|Diller + Scofidio]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Peter Eisenman]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]].

Conceptual architecture was studied in the essay, ''Notes on Conceptual Architecture: Towards a Definition'' by [[Peter Eisenman]] in 1970, and again by the Harvard Design Magazine in Fall of 2003 and Winter 2004, by a series of articles under the heading ''Architecture as Conceptual Art''. But the understanding of design as a construction of a concept was understood by many [[modern architecture|modernist architects]] as well. To quote [[Louis Kahn]] on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]:

:''It doesn't work, it doesn't have to work. Wright had the shape conceived long before he knew what was going into it. I claim that is where architecture starts, with the concept.''&lt;ref&gt;
Louis Kahn quote from Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture, a critical history.'' page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

These organisms are formally referred to as [[heterotroph]]s, which include [[animal]]s, some [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. Such organisms may consume by various means, they are called primary consumers.

== Classification ==
Consumers are typically viewed as predatory animals such as the wolf and hyena. However, herbivorous animals and parasitic fungi are also consumers. Some carnivorous plants, like the [[Venus flytrap]], are classified as both.

Within an ecological food chain, Consumers are categorized into [[primary consumer]]s, [[secondary consumer]]s, and the [[tertiary consumer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usoe.k12.ut.us/curr/science/sciber00/8th/energy/sciber/chains.htm |title= Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091007085914/http://www.usoe.k12.ut.us/curr/science/sciber00/8th/energy/sciber/chains.htm |archivedate= 2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary consumers are [[herbivores]], feeding on plants. Secondary consumers, on the other hand, are [[carnivore]]s, and prey on other animals. [[Omnivores]], who feed on both plants and animals, can also be considered a secondary consumer. Tertiary consumers, sometimes also known as [[apex predator]]s, are usually at the top of food chains, capable of feeding on secondary consumers and primary consumers. Tertiary consumers can be either fully carnivorous or omnivorous. Humans are one such example of a tertiary consumer.

==Importance to the ecosystem==
Consumers have important roles to play within an [[ecosystem]] such as balancing the food chain by keeping plant populations at a reasonable number. Without proper balance, an ecosystem can collapse and cause the decline of all affected species. This will lead to a severely disrupted ecosystem and a nonfunctional consumer web.

[[Image:Blurshadow.png|frame|A red rectangle casting a drop shadow over a wood-like background.]]
In [[graphic design]], a '''drop shadow''' is a visual effect consisting of a drawing element which looks like the [[shadow]] of an object, giving the impression that the object is raised above the objects behind it. The drop shadow is often used for elements of a [[graphical user interface]] such as [[window (computing)|window]]s or [[menu (computing)|menu]]s, and for simple text. The text label for [[Computer icon|icon]]s on desktops in many [[desktop environment]]s has a drop shadow, as this effect effectively distinguishes the text from any colored background it may be in front of.

A simple way of drawing a drop shadow of a rectangular object is to draw a gray or black area underneath and offset from the object. In general, a drop shadow is a copy in black or gray of the object, drawn in a slightly different position. Realism may be increased by:

# Darkening the colors of the pixels where the shadow casts instead of making them gray. This can be done with [[alpha blending]] the shadow with the area it is cast on.
# Softening the edges of the shadow. This can be done by adding [[Gaussian blur]] to the shadow's [[alpha channel]] before blending.

[[File:Bialystok Technical University - Faculty of Electrical Engineering.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Bialystok Technical University, [[Poland]].]]

Both electrical and electronics engineers typically possess an [[academic degree]] with a major in electrical/ electronics engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually three or four years and the completed degree may be designated as a [[Bachelor of Engineering]], [[Bachelor of Science]] or [[Bachelor of Applied Science]] depending upon the university.

==Scope of undergraduate education==
The degree generally includes units covering [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[project management]] and [[list of electrical engineering topics|specific topics in electrical and electronics engineering]]. Initially such topics cover most, if not all, of the sub fields of electrical engineering. Students then choose to specialize in one or more sub fields towards the end of the degree.
In most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards certification and the degree program itself is certified by a professional body. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience requirements) before being certified. Once certified the engineer is designated the title of Professional Engineer (in the United States and Canada), Chartered Engineer (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, Pakistan, South Africa and Zimbabwe), Chartered Professional Engineer (in Australia) or European Engineer (in much of the European Union).

==Post graduate studies==
Electrical engineers can also choose to pursue a postgraduate degree such as a [[Master of Engineering]], a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Engineering or an [[Engineer's degree]]. The Master and Engineer's degree may consist of either [[research]], [[coursework]] or a mixture of the two. The [[Doctor of Philosophy]] consists of a significant research component and is often viewed as the entry point to [[academia]]. In the United Kingdom and various other European countries, the [[Master of Engineering]] is often considered an undergraduate degree of slightly longer duration than the [[Bachelor of Engineering]].

==Typical electrical/electronics engineering undergraduate syllabus==
Apart from electromagnetics and network theory, other items in the syllabus are particular to ''electronics'' engineering course. ''Electrical'' engineering courses have other specializations such as [[electrical machines|machines]], [[power generation]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribution]]. Note that the following list does not include the large quantity of mathematics (maybe apart from the final year) included in each year's study.

==Certification==
The advantages of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada "only a licensed engineer may...seal engineering work for public and private clients". [4] This requirement is enforced by state and provincial legislation such as Quebec's Engineers Act. [5] In other countries, such as Australia, no such legislation exists. Practically all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion. [6] In this way these organizations play an important role in maintaining ethical standards for the profession. Even in jurisdictions where certification has little or no legal bearing on work, engineers are subject to contract law. In cases where an engineer's work fails he or she may be subject to the tort of negligence and, in extreme cases, the charge of criminal negligence. [7] An engineer's work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as building codes and legislation pertaining to environmental law.

Significant professional bodies for electrical engineers include the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]](IET). The IEEE claims to produce 30 percent of the world's literature on electrical engineering, has over 360,000 members worldwide and holds over 300 conferences annually. [8] The IET publishes 14 journals, has a worldwide membership of 120,000, certifies Chartered Engineers in the United Kingdom and claims to be the largest professional engineering society in Europe.

In European academic traditions, '''fine art''' is art developed primarily for [[aesthetics]] or beauty, distinguishing it from [[applied art]], which also has to serve some practical function, such as [[pottery]] or most metalwork.

Historically, the five main fine arts were [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[music]], and [[poetry]], with performing arts including [[theatre]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35561/35561-h/35561-h.htm#ar209|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=11|volume=10|year=1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the fine arts commonly include additional forms, such as [[film]], [[photography]], [[video production]]/[[Video editing|editing]], [[design]], [[sequential art]], [[conceptual art]], and [[printmaking]].

One definition of ''fine art'' is "a visual art considered to have been created primarily for [[aesthetic]] and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness, specifically, painting, sculpture, drawing, watercolor, graphics, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fine+art |title=Fine art &amp;#124; Define Fine art at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, there are conceptual differences between the ''fine arts'' and the ''applied arts''. As originally conceived, and as understood for much of the modern era, the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good [[taste (sociology)|taste]], which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aesthetic-judgment/|title=Aesthetic Judgment|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "fine" does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This definition originally excluded the applied or [[decorative arts]], and the products of what were regarded as [[craft]]s.  In contemporary practice these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless, as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy, regardless of the means through which this is expressed.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==History==
{{Main article|Art history}}
{{History of art sidebar}}
According to some writers the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the [[early modern period]] in the West.  Larry Shiner in his ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' (2003) locates the invention in the 18th century:
"There was a traditional “system of the arts” in the West before the eighteenth century. (Other traditional cultures still have a similar system.) In that system, an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner, a work of art was the useful product of skilled work, and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life. “Art”, in other words, meant approximately the same thing as the Greek word techne, or in English “skill”, a sense that has survived in phrases like “the art of war”, “the art of love”, and “the art of medicine.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519|title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's ''The Invention of Art: A Cultural History''|journal=Contemporary Aesthetics|author=Clowney, David|accessdate=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar ideas have been expressed by [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]], and [[Terry Eagleton]] (e.g. The Ideology of the Aesthetic), though the point of invention is often placed earlier, in the [[Italian Renaissance]].

==Cultural perspectives==
The separation of arts and crafts that often exists in Europe and the US is not shared by all other cultures. In [[Japanese aesthetics]], the activities of everyday life are depicted by integrating not only art with craft but man-made with nature. Traditional [[Chinese art]] distinguished within [[Chinese painting]] between the mostly landscape [[literati painting]] of [[scholar gentlemen]] and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture. A high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the West, in particular ceramics, [[hardstone carving|jade carving]], weaving, and embroidery. [[Latin American art]] was dominated by European colonialism until the 20th-century, when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]], which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles. In Africa, [[Yoruba art]] often has a political and spiritual function. As with the art of the Chinese, the art of the Yoruba is also often composed of what would ordinarily be considered in the West to be craft production. Some of its most admired manifestations, such as sculpture and textiles, fall in this category.

==Visual arts==
=== Two-dimensional works ===

====Painting and drawing====
{{Main article|Painting|Drawing}}
Drawing is a form of visual expression  and is one of the major forms of the visual arts. Common instruments include: [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil]]s, [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[chalk]], [[pastel]]s, [[marker pen|marker]]s, [[stylus]], or various metals like [[silverpoint]].  There are a number of subcategories of drawing, including [[cartooning]] and creating [[comics]]. There remains debate whether the following is considered a part of “drawing” as “fine art”: "[[doodling]]", drawing in the fog a [[shower]] and leaving an imprint on the [[bathroom]] [[mirror]], or the [[surrealism|surrealist]] method of "[[entopic graphomania]]", in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and the lines are then made between the dots.

==== Mosaics ====
{{Main article|Mosaic}}
[[File:Christ Hagia Sofia.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]]]]
Mosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass, called ''[[tessera]]e''.  They can be decorative or functional.  An artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist.

==== Printmaking ====
{{Main article|Printmaking}}
[[File:Dürer Melancholia I.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Melencolia I]]'', 1514, [[Dürer]]]]
Printmaking is the process of making artworks by [[printing]], normally on [[paper]]. Except in the case of [[monotyping]], the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print is considered an original, as opposed to a copy. The reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another [[work of art]] in a different medium — for instance, a painting — but rather an image designed from inception as a print. An individual print is also referred to as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, known technically as a [[Matrix (printing)|matrix]]. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for [[engraving]] or [[etching]]; stone, used for [[lithography]]; blocks of wood for [[woodcut]]s, linoleum for [[linocut]]s and fabric in the case of [[screen-printing]]. But there are many other kinds, discussed below. Multiple nearly identical prints can be called an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]. In modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a "limited edition." Prints may also be published in book form, as [[artist's book]]s. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.

==== Calligraphy ====
{{Main article|Calligraphy}}
[[File:Folio from a Koran (8th-9th century).jpg|thumb|''Folio from a Koran'' (8–9th century), [[Abbasid]] [[Kufic]] Calligraphy]]
Calligraphy is a type of visual art. A contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is "the art of giving form to signs in an expressive, harmonious and skillful manner".&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mediavilla, C.|year=1996|title=Calligraphy|publisher=Scirpus Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand-lettered inscriptions and designs to fine-art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters.&lt;ref name="Mediavilla"/&gt; Classical calligraphy differs from typography and non-classical hand-lettering, though a calligrapher may create all of these; characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous, improvised at the moment of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2006|title=Kalligrafie: Intensiv Training|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pott, G.|year=2005|title=Kalligrafie:Erste Hilfe und Schrift-Training mit Muster-Alphabeten|publisher=Verlag Hermann Schmidt Mainz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=*[[Hermann Zapf|Zapf, H.]]|year=2007|title=Alphabet Stories: A Chronicle of Technical Developments|publisher=Cary Graphic Arts Press|location=Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Photography ====
{{Main article|Fine-art photography}}
[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Ansel Adams]], ''The Tetons and the Snake River'', 1942]]
''Fine art photography'' refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist. Fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography.  Photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas, mainly in print and digital media. Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but has also been important in advancing certain causes.

=== Three-dimensional works ===
====Architecture====
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Pantheon Dome.JPG|thumb|[[Pantheon, Rome|The Pantheon]]]]
[[Architecture]] is frequently considered a fine art, especially if its [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] components are spotlighted — in contrast to [[structural engineering|structural-engineering]] or [[construction management|construction-management]] components. Architectural works are perceived as cultural and political [[symbol]]s and works of art. Historical [[civilization]]s often are known primarily through their architectural achievements. Such buildings as the [[pyramids]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[Rome|Roman]] [[Colosseum]] are cultural symbols, and are important links in public consciousness, even when [[scholars]] have discovered much about past civilizations through other means. Cities, regions and cultures continue to identify themselves with, and are known by, their architectural monuments.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Tower Bridge]], the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Colosseum]] are representative of the buildings used on advertising brochures.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pottery====
One field where "fine" remains a valid technical term is [[pottery]], especially in [[archaeology]].  "Fine wares" are high-quality pottery, often painted, moulded or otherwise decorated, and in many periods distinguished from "coarse" wares, which are basic utilitarian pots used by the mass of the population, or in the kitchen rather than for more formal purposes.

====Sculpture====
{{Main article|Sculpture}}
[[File:Ife sculpture Inv.A96-1-4.jpg|thumb|upright|Head [[Ife]] [[Terracotta]], [[Nigeria]], 12th–14th century]]
[[Sculpture]] is [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Visual arts|artwork]] created by shaping hard or [[plastic]] material, commonly [[Stone sculpture|stone]] (either [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or [[marble]]), [[metal]], or [[wood]]. Some sculptures are created directly by [[Wikt:carving|carving]]; others are assembled, built up and [[Kiln|fired]], [[Welding|welded]], [[Molding (process)|molded]], or [[Casting|cast]]. Because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated, it is considered one of the [[plastic arts]]. The majority of [[public art]] is sculpture. Many sculptures together in a [[garden]] setting may be referred to as a [[sculpture garden]].

====Conceptual art====
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}
[[File:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|left|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]], 1973]]
Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of ''idea-based art'' that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text. However, through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/conceptual-art''Conceptual art'' Tate online glossary] tate.org.uk. Retrieved August 7, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
[[File:Pushkin (by Mate).jpg|thumb|[[Vasily Mate]], ''Portrait of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'' (1899)]]
{{Main article|Poetry}}
Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, poiesis, "making") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as sound symbolism, phonaesthetics and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetry|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|year=2013|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Fela Kuti.jpg|left|thumb|[[Fela Kuti]] in 1970]]
{{Main article|Music}}
Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").

==Performing Arts==
===Dance===
{{Main article|Dance}}
''Dance'' is an art form that generally refers to [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic, and to music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance |title=britannica |publisher=britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or performance setting.
Dance is also used to describe methods of [[nonverbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s ([[bee dance]], [[Fixed action pattern|patterns of behaviour]] such as a mating dance), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects ''(the leaves danced in the wind)'', and certain musical genres. In sports, gymnastics, [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are ''dance disciplines'' while the ''[[Kata]]s'' of the [[martial arts]] are often compared to dances.

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}
[[File:Royal Opera House and ballerina.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Opera House]], London]]
Modern Western [[theatre]] is dominated by [[realism (arts)|realism]], including [[drama]] and [[comedy]].  Another popular Western form is [[musical theatre]].  Classical forms of theatre, including [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]], classic [[English drama]] ([[Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] included), and [[Theatre of France|French theater]] ([[Molière]] included), are still performed today. In addition, performances of classic Eastern forms such as [[Noh]] and [[Kabuki]] can be found in the West, although with less frequency.

===Film===
{{Main article|Film|Art film}}
''Fine arts film'' is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine [[art]] form. A ''fine arts movie theater'' is a venue, usually a building, for viewing such movies. [[Film]]s are produced by [[Video recording|recording]] images from the world with [[camera]]s, or by creating images using [[animation]] techniques or [[special effect]]s.  Films are [[cultural artifact]]s created by specific [[culture]]s, which reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important [[art]] form, a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for [[documentary film|educating]] — or [[propaganda|indoctrinating]] — citizens. The visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] or [[subtitles]] that [[translation|translate]] the dialogue.

[[Cinematography]] is the discipline of making [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and [[camera]] choices when recording photographic [[image]]s for the [[film|cinema]]. It is closely related to the art of [[photography|still photography]], though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion.

[[Independent filmmaking]] often takes place outside of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], or other major [[studio system]]s. An independent film (or ''indie film)'' is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a [[list of Hollywood movie studios|major movie studio]].  Creative, business, and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century.

(See also the Form-based section of the [[Zoning in the United States#Form-based|Zoning in the United States]] article.)

A '''Form-Based Code''' (FBC) is a means of regulating land development to achieve a specific urban form. Form-Based Codes foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing principle, with a lesser focus on [[land use]], through municipal regulations. A FBC is a regulation, not a mere guideline, adopted into city, town, or county law and offers a powerful alternative to conventional zoning regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Form-Based Codes Defined|url=http://formbasedcodes.org/definition|website=Form Based Codes Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Form-Based Codes are a new response to the modern challenges of [[urban sprawl]], deterioration of historic neighborhoods, and neglect of pedestrian safety in new development. Tradition has declined as a guide to development patterns, and the widespread adoption by cities of single-use [[zoning]] regulations has discouraged compact, walkable urbanism. Form-Based Codes are a tool to address these deficiencies, and to provide local governments the regulatory means to achieve development objectives with greater certainty.

==Scope==
Form-Based Codes address the relationship between building facades and the public realm, the form and mass of buildings in relation to one another, and the scale and types of streets and blocks. The regulations and standards in Form-Based Codes, presented in both diagrams and words, are keyed to a regulating plan that designates the appropriate form and scale (and therefore, character) of development rather than only distinctions in land-use types. This is in contrast to conventional [[zoning]]'s focus on the micromanagement and segregation of land uses, and the control of development intensity through abstract and uncoordinated parameters (e.g., [[floor area ratio]]s, dwelling units per acre, [[Setback (land use)|setback]]s, parking ratios) to the neglect of an integrated built form. Not to be confused with design guidelines or general statements of policy, form-based codes are regulatory, not advisory.

Form-Based Codes are drafted to achieve a community vision based on time-tested forms of urbanism. Ultimately, a Form-Based Code is a tool;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective Implementation Tools for Walkable Urban Places|url=http://opticosdesign.com/projects/form-based-code-tools-walkable-urban-places/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the quality of development outcomes is dependent on the quality and objectives of the community plan that a code implements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1: What Is a Form-Based Code?|url=http://plannersweb.com/2014/12/fbc1/|website=Planners Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Form-Based Codes are part of a long history of shaping the built landscape. Such efforts go back to the urban designs of [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], the planning of cities in ancient China, and Roman town planning. The [[Laws of the Indies]], promulgated by the Spanish Crown starting in the 16th century, established some basic urban form requirements for colonial towns in the Americas. [[William Penn]] when planning [[Philadelphia]] in the 17th century did not shy from precise urban form requirements when he said, "Let every house be in a line, or upon a line, as much as may be." {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

During the 18th century, Baroque [[urban design]] commonly brought buildings to the fronts of their lots with common facade treatments. [[Baron Haussmann]], appointed by [[Napoleon III]] to oversee the redevelopment of Paris in the 19th century, stipulated precise ratios of building heights to street widths; disposition and sizes of windows and doors on building facades; consistent planting of street trees; and standardization of material colors to bring unity and harmony to the public environment.

===Emergence===
Regulating urban form is a challenge in modern democracies. Design guidelines adopted by municipalities, without legal enforceability, often invite capricious observance, thus failing to produce the comprehensive changes required to produce satisfying public places. When public planning exercises fail to produce predictable results, citizens often rebel against any development. In addition, from early in the twentieth century to the present, attempts at regulating the built landscape have usually been done for reasons that neglect community form, that are more concerned with the uses of property and impacts of scale than the form that development takes.  And a planning profession that in recent decades has focused on policy, neglecting design, encouraged an abstract intellectual response to problems that are largely physical in nature. {{Citation needed|reason=Text includes conclusions without foundation.|date=December 2016}}

The development of modern Form-Based Codes was started by architects, urban designers, and physical planners frustrated by the ineffectiveness of past criticisms of sprawl development and the failure of critics to propose realistic alternatives. These professionals, used to thinking physically about community problems, began the search for systematic physical solutions in the 1970s. Architect [[Christopher Alexander]] published ''A Pattern Language'' in 1977, a compendium of physical rules for designing humane buildings and places. [[Ian McHarg]] developed systematic mapping tools to encourage deliberate development patterns sensitive to local environmental conditions. Traditional Neighborhood Development ordinances were drafted beginning in the early 1990s as sets of development regulations to promote traditional neighborhood forms in new development projects. TND ordinances were typically adopted as an optional regulatory procedure that developers could request in place of conventional zoning . But their design regulations were not mapped to parcels or streets in advance, so lacked predictability of outcomes; TND ordinances proved to be an instructive effort, but showed few results.

Meanwhile, the accelerating scale of worldwide urban growth and the rapid expansion of the extent of cities heightened the need for regulatory tools better equipped to deal with such growth. The first serious attempt at creating a modern form-based code was done in 1982 to guide the development of the Florida resort town of [[Seaside, Florida|Seaside]] by the husband and wife design team of [[Andres Duany]] and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]]. Realizing that designing an entire town would be an overwhelming task and would in the end lack the visual serendipity that only comes from myriad creative minds at work, they created a design code that established basic physical standards mapped to parcels, and then invited developers and architects to put their own distinctive stamp on their projects—but operating within those standards. The Seaside Code proved very successful; the resulting development of the town of Seaside is widely recognized as one of the most important and appealing planning efforts of the post-World War II era.

Duany/Plater-Zyberk's codes and the work of subsequent form-based code practitioners are not top-down mandates from imperial designers as in the baroque era or the wishful thinking of design guidelines that lack enforceability, but are instead legal regulations adopted by units of local government. As regulations they possess [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]; violators of the regulations can be cited, and their invocation or retraction must go through a legislative process. As such, the community plays a more forceful role in shaping its physical future.

=== Recent developments ===
Although the Seaside code was commissioned by a private developer, most current codes are commissioned by counties and municipalities. Since Seaside, the scale of Form-Based Coding projects has grown. Form-Based Coding can be applied at many scales, from a two-block main street to a county-wide region. An early Form-Based Code was adopted for downtown West Palm Beach in 1995. A significant code for a major urban arterial, the Columbia Pike in Arlington County, Virginia, was adopted in 2003 (Ferrell Madden Associates). A regional FBC was adopted in 2006 by St. Lucie County, Florida (Spikowski Associates, Dover-Kohl Partners). Duany/Plater-Zyberk has drafted a model FBC that is also a [[transect (urban)|transect]]-based code that can be calibrated for local needs—the [[SMARTCODE]]. Its first attempted customization was done for Vicksburg, Mississippi in 2001 (Mouzon &amp; Greene). The lessons learned there led to the first California adoption of a citywide Form-Based Code for the City of Sonoma in March 2003 (Crawford Multari &amp; Clark Associates, Moule &amp; Polyzoides), followed on June 16, 2003, by the first SmartCode adopted in the U.S., for central Petaluma, California (Fisher and Hall Urban Design, Crawford Multari &amp; Clark Associates). SmartCodes are now being calibrated for Miami, Florida and Hurricane Katrina ravaged communities in Mississippi and Louisiana, along with cities as diverse as Taos, NM, Michigan City, IN, Jamestown, RI, Lawrence, KS, New Castle, DE, and Bran, Romania. Planetary climate change that must be mitigated by changes in the human environment will no doubt be an inducement to form-based and transect-based coding in the future.

The Cincinnati Form-Based Code adopted in 2013 is designed to be applied citywide in an incremental way, neighborhood by neighborhood. The code establishes transect zones and specifies standards for transects, building types, frontage types, walkable neighborhoods, and thoroughfares that can be adapted to each neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cincinnati Form-Based Code|url=http://formbasedcodes.org/codes/cincinnati-form-based-code|website=Form-Based Codes Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yung|first1=John|title=Here's how Cincinnati's form-based codes are designed to spur redevelopment|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2014/01/21/heres-how-cincinnatis-form-based.html?page=all|website=Cincinnati Business Courier|accessdate=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaufort County, South Carolina adopted one of the first multijurisdictional Form-Based Codes at the end of 2014:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Starkey|first1=Jackie|title=Beaufort looks to develop different planning method|url=http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_ffd55024-9e95-11e4-916f-83892b1f4c00.html|website=Carteret County News-Times|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beaufort County Eliminates PUDs in Favor of Walkable Neighborhoods!|url=http://opticosdesign.com/beaufort-county-council-votes-9-1-adopt-new-development-code/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the County, the City of Beaufort and the City of Port Royal came together to hire Opticos Design, Inc. in Berkeley, California to draft the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steuteville|first1=Rob|title=Beaufort County, SC, commissions form-based code|url=http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/13617/beaufort-county-sc-commissions-form-based-code|website=Better Cities &amp; Towns|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the growing number of consultants advertising themselves as capable of writing FBCs but with little or no training, in 2004 the non-profit [http://formbasedcodes.org/ Form-Based Codes Institute] was organized to establish standards and teach best practices. In addition, SmartCode workshops are regularly scheduled by PlaceMakers.com, SmartCodePro.com, and SmartCodeLocal.com. In Spring 2014, a new graduate-level studio dedicated to Form-Based Coding was launched at California State Polytechnic University. “Form-Based Codes in the Context of Integrated Urbanism,” is one of the only full courses on the subject in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opticos Goes to School on Form-Based Codes|url=http://opticosdesign.com/opticos-goes-school-form-based-codes/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course is taught by Tony Perez,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Perez, Director of Form-Based Coding|url=http://opticosdesign.com/people/tony-perez/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director of Form-Based Coding at Opticos Design; it is expected to be repeated for Spring 2015.

==Components==
Form-Based Codes commonly include the following elements:

* ''Regulating Plan.''  A plan or map of the regulated area designating the locations where different building form standards apply, based on clear community intentions regarding the physical character of the area being coded.
* ''Public Space Standards.'' Specifications for the elements within the public realm (e.g., sidewalks, travel lanes, on-street parking, street trees, street furniture, etc.).
* ''Building Form Standards''. Regulations controlling the configuration, features, and functions of buildings that define and shape the public realm.
* ''Administration.'' A clearly defined application and project review process.
* ''Definitions.'' A glossary to ensure the precise use of technical terms.

[[Image:FBC TypicalComponents.jpg|frame|center|At a minimum, a Form-Based Code, written to enable or preserve a specific urban form, consists of building form and public space standards keyed to a regulating plan. An urban design is the intention or goal, the form-based code is the regulatory tool to achieve it.]]&lt;br /&gt;
Form-based codes also sometimes include:
* ''Architectural Standards.'' Regulations controlling external architectural materials and quality.
* ''Landscaping Standards.'' Regulations controlling landscape design and plant materials on private property as they impact public spaces (e.g. regulations about parking lot screening and shading, maintaining sight lines, insuring unobstructed pedestrian movements, etc.).
* ''Signage Standards.'' Regulations controlling allowable signage sizes, materials, illumination, and placement.
* ''Environmental Resource Standards.'' Regulations controlling issues such as storm water drainage and infiltration, development on slopes, tree protection, solar access, etc.
* ''Annotation.'' Text and illustrations explaining the intentions of specific code provisions.

=== Building Form Standards ===
[[Image:FBC BldgFormStandards2.gif|frame|right|Building attributes that can be regulated in a Building Form Standard, in this case for a hypothetical street in a neighborhood center]]
The types of buildings that make for a lively main street are different from the types of buildings that make for a quiet residential street. Building Form Standards are sets of enforceable design regulations for controlling building types and how they impact the public realm. These Standards are mapped to streets on a Regulating Plan. Building Form Standards can control such things as: the alignment of buildings to the street; how close buildings are to sidewalks; the visibility and accessibility of building entrances; minimum and maximum buildings heights; minimum or maximum lot frontage coverage; minimum and maximum amounts of window coverage on facades; physical elements required on buildings (e.g. stoops, porches, types of permitted balconies); and the general usage of floors (e.g. office, residential, or retail). These regulations are less concerned with architectural styles and designs than in how buildings shape public spaces. If a local government also wishes to regulate the quality of architecture—for example to preserve the historic appearance of a neighborhood—then Architectural Standards should be drafted in addition to Building Form Standards.

=== Public Space Standards ===
[[Image:DPZ SmartCode9 OptionModule ThoroughfareAssemlies Page 21.png|right|thumb|An example of a Public Space Standard for public streets from the SmartCode 9.0]]
Public Space Standards control the physical form of squares, parks, the public right-of-way of streets, and other public spaces. Public spaces are typically under the control of public works, parks, and highway departments. Streets, being the most common public spaces in a community, are the most frequently regulated. Public Space Standards for streets are typically described with dimensioned cross-sections and/or plan views showing travel lane widths, sidewalk widths, street tree and street lamp placement, locations of transit lanes, and the placement of architecture. Plan view diagrams may also be included showing spacing of street trees and lamps, and the radii of the curves of street corners.

==Identification==
How does one determine if a development regulation is a form-based code and a well-crafted one? Form-based codes generally receive affirmative answers to all of the following questions:

* Is the code's focus primarily on regulating urban form and less on land use?
* Is the code regulatory rather than advisory?
* Does the code emphasize standards and parameters for form with predictable physical outcomes (build-to lines, frontage type requirements, etc.) rather than relying on numerical parameters (floor-area ratios, density, etc.) whose outcomes are impossible to predict?
* Does the code require private buildings to shape public space through the use of building form standards with specific requirements for building placement?
* Does the code promote and/or conserve an interconnected street network and pedestrian-scaled blocks?
* Are regulations and standards keyed to specific locations on a regulating plan?
* Are the diagrams in the code unambiguous, clearly labeled, and accurate in their presentation of spatial configurations? &lt;ref&gt;[http://formbasedcodes.org/take-quiz FBCI quiz]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
How are form-based codes incorporated into a local government's development regulations? There are three basic ways:

'''Mandatory codes.''' This is the most common adoption approach. It has the most regulatory  "teeth"—compliance is required. But it is the most ambitious of the approaches, making the new code a seamless part of, or a complete replacement for, the existing zoning ordinance. The form-based code can be adopted as a new zoning district or as an overlay district.

Unique to California and a few other states with appropriate enabling legislation, form-based codes can be contained within a planning document called a "specific plan," which can completely override the zoning ordinance for a given geographic area. Since it stands apart from the zoning ordinance, it can be more creative in its format, giving the coder greater freedom in designing for user-friendliness through page layout, diagrams, and illustrations. Also, the urban design plan and the implementing regulations are bundled together, greatly improving user comprehension. But since the specific plan is not securely integrated within the existing zoning ordinance, it may be more politically vulnerable to retraction.

Example adopted codes:
*''Winter Springs Town Center District Code'', [[Winter Springs, Florida]]
*''Farmers Branch Station Area Form-Based Code'', [[Farmers Branch, Texas]]
*''Central Petaluma Specific Plan and SmartCode'', [[Petaluma, California]]

'''Optional (parallel) codes.''' An optional or parallel form-based code serves as an alternative to, but doesn't replace, a present zoning ordinance. Compliance is voluntary. The developer has the choice of complying with the form-based code or the zoning ordinance, but it must be one or the other. This approach makes sense when compliance with the zoning ordinance is so difficult and time consuming that most development is stymied. Thus a developer has the option of following a form-based code that will streamline and simplify his development process. But, for a local government to maintain two different sets of development regulations for one area is added work which can be significant if the area is extensive. Also depending on the area being regulated, if some developers are choosing the form-based code and others nearby are not, the possibilities for integrated place-making can be compromised.

Example codes:
*''Columbia Pike Form-Based Code'', [[Arlington County, Virginia]]
*''Pike Road SmartCode'', [[Pike Road, Alabama]]
*''Pass Christian SmartCode'', [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]]

'''Floating-zone codes.''' Floating zones are most often written to facilitate master-planned suburban communities and are called PUDs (planned unit developments). However, floating-zone codes are now being written as form-based codes to facilitate urban development. A floating-zone form-based code does not contain a regulating plan but includes instructions and standards for developers to follow when they prepare a regulating plan for their property (e.g. maximum block dimensions, street types, building types, open space accessibility, sidewalk widths.) This distinguishes floating-zone codes from the other two approaches–developers rather than the local government create the regulating plans and the urban designs that they facilitate, but the local government sets the standards. Floating-zone codes allow local governments to establish urban form standards for development without incurring the expense of developing urban design and regulating plans. Developers are given the freedom, within clear parameters, to prepare regulating plans for their property that are likely to meet government approval. A developer submits his or her regulating plan for approval through the rezoning process. Upon rezoning, the floating zone replaces the prior zoning for that property and the regulating plan becomes binding.

Example codes:
*''Miami-Dade County TND District'', [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]]
*''Towns, Villages, Countryside Land Development Regulations'', [[Saint Lucie County, Florida]]
*''Flowood SmartCode'', [[Flowood, Mississippi]]
*''Montgomery SmartCode'', [[Montgomery, Alabama]] (not to be confused with the mandatory SmartCode for downtown)

Initially a local government may wish to adopt a form-based code for its entire jurisdiction following one approach, but find this too ambitious with short-term resource and political limitations requiring a more focused effort. Instead it may wish to follow one approach for a smaller area, and then phase in other areas using the same or different approaches as needed. Or a floating-zone code could be adopted for large areas awaiting the public resources coming later that would allow the local government to draft its own regulating plans. Whatever approach is followed—or combination of approaches—simplicity and consistency helps at the permit desk where the code is implemented.

[[File:Heat Pump.jpg|thumb|265px|Outdoor components of a residential air-source heat pump]]
A '''heat pump''' is a device that transfers heat energy from a source of heat to what is called a [[heat sink]]. Heat pumps move [[thermal energy]] in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses a small amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hQDOBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22heat+pump%22+%22heat+sink%22+opposite+direction#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heat%20pump%22%20%22heat%20sink%22%20opposite%20direction&amp;f=false|title=Sustainable Energy Solutions in Agriculture |last=Bundschuh |first=Jochen |last2=Chen|first2=Guangnan|date=2014-03-07|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781315778716|location=|pages=111|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most common design of a heat pump involves four main components – a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], an [[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], an [[evaporator]] and a [[compressor]]. The heat transfer medium circulated through these components is called [[refrigerant]].&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/market-technology/heat-pump-work/ Article on IEA HPT TCP How does a heat pump work?&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction – releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times more effective at heating than simple [[Electric heating|electrical resistance heater]]s using the same amount of electricity. However, the typical cost of installing a heat pump is also higher than that of a resistance heater.

When discussing about and comparing energy efficiency of heat pumping applications some different factors are mainly used, COP ([[Coefficient of Performance]]), SCOP ([[Seasonal Coefficient of Performance]]) and SPF ([[Seasonal Performance Factor]]). The more efficient a heat pump is the less energy consuming it will be and the more cost-effective it can be to operate. There are several factors that will affect the efficiency of a heat pump such as climate, temperature, auxiliary equipment, technology, size and control system.&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/market-technology/efficiency-heat-pumps/ IEA HPT TCP Efficiency and heat pumping application&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}
[[Heat|Heat energy]] naturally transfers from warmer places to colder spaces. However, a heat pump can reverse this process, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. Heat is not conserved in this process and requires some amount of external energy, such as electricity. In heating, ventilation and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) systems, the term ''heat pump'' usually refers to [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] devices optimized for high efficiency in both directions of thermal energy transfer. These heat pumps can be reversible, and work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space.

Heat pumps are used to transfer heat because less high-grade energy is required than is released as heat. Most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment, only a fraction of which comes from electricity (or some other high-grade energy source required to run a compressor). In electrically-powered heat pumps, the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical power consumed, giving the system a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3 or 4, as opposed to a COP of 1 for a conventional electrical resistance heater, in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy.

Heat pumps use a refrigerant as an intermediate fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes, in the evaporator, and then to release heat where the refrigerant condenses, in the condenser. The refrigerant flows through insulated pipes between the evaporator and the condenser, allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BxEOvbuMSGgC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22heat+pump%22+refrigerant+evaporator+condenser+efficient+thermal+energy+transfer#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heat%20pump%22%20refrigerant%20evaporator%20condenser%20efficient%20thermal%20energy%20transfer%20distance&amp;f=false|title=The Future of Energy Use|last=O'Keefe|first=Philip|last2=O'Brien|first2=Geoff|last3=Pearsall|first3=Nicola|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Earthscan|year=|isbn=9781844075041|location=|pages=224|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversible heat pumps===
Reversible heat pumps work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space. They employ a [[reversing valve]] to reverse the flow of refrigerant from the compressor through the condenser and evaporation coils.

In '''heating mode,''' the outdoor coil is an evaporator, while the indoor is a condenser. The refrigerant flowing from the evaporator (outdoor coil) carries the thermal energy from outside air (or soil, or better still, moving water) indoors. Vapor temperature is augmented within the pump by compressing it. The indoor coil then transfers thermal energy (including energy from the compression) to the indoor air, which is then moved around the inside of the building by an [[air handler]].

Alternatively, thermal energy is transferred to water, which is then used to heat the building via radiators or [[underfloor heating]]. The heated water may also be used for [[domestic hot water]] consumption.  The refrigerant is then allowed to expand, and hence cool, and absorb heat from the outdoor temperature in the outside evaporator, and the cycle repeats. This is a standard refrigeration cycle, save that the "cold" side of the refrigerator (the evaporator coil) is positioned so it is outdoors where the environment is colder.

In cold weather, the outdoor unit of an air source heat pump needs to be intermittently defrosted. This will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements (located in the air-handler) to be activated. At the same time, the frost on the outdoor coil will quickly be melted due to the warm refrigerant. The condenser/evaporator fan will not run during defrost mode.

In '''cooling mode''' the cycle is similar, but the outdoor coil is now the condenser and the indoor coil (which reaches a lower temperature) is the evaporator. This is the familiar mode in which air conditioners operate.

==Operating principles==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Mechanical heat pumps exploit the physical properties of a volatile evaporating and [[Condensation|condensing]] fluid known as a [[refrigerant]]. The heat pump compresses the refrigerant to make it hotter on the side to be warmed, and releases the pressure at the side where heat is absorbed. [[File:Heatpump2.svg|thumb|300px|A simple stylized diagram of a heat pump's [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle: 1)&amp;nbsp;[[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], 2)&amp;nbsp;[[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&amp;nbsp;[[evaporator]], 4)&amp;nbsp;[[compressor]]]]
[[File:refrigeration PV diagram.svg|thumb|300px|A fictitious pressure-volume diagram for a typical refrigeration cycle]]
The [[Working fluids|working fluid]], in its gaseous state, is pressurized and circulated through the system by a [[Gas compressor|compressor]]. On the discharge side of the compressor, the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a [[heat exchanger]], called a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], until it condenses into a high pressure, moderate temperature liquid. The condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device. This may be an [[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], [[capillary]] tube, or possibly a work-extracting device such as a [[turbine]]. The low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger, the evaporator, in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils. The refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ruR7U3IjrR0C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22heat+pump%22+turbine++expansion+valve,+capillary#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heat%20pump%22%20turbine%20%20expansion%20valve,%20capillary&amp;f=false|title=EXERGY: Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development|last=Dincer|first=Ibrahim|last2=Rosen|first2=Marc A.|date=2007-09-18|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780080531359|location=|pages=98|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential that the refrigerant reaches a sufficiently high temperature, when compressed, to release heat through the "hot" heat exchanger (the condenser). Similarly, the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand, or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger (the evaporator). In particular, the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the required pressure difference, and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid. Thus, as with all heat pumps, the [[coefficient of performance]] (amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required) decreases with increasing temperature difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.automaticheating.com.au/heat-pumps-explained/|title=Introduction to Heat Pumps|work=Automatic Heating|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermal insulation|Insulation]] is used to reduce the work and energy required to achieve a low enough temperature in the space to be cooled.

===Heat transport===
Heat is typically transferred through engineered heating or cooling systems by using a flowing gas or liquid.  Air is sometimes used, but quickly becomes impractical under many circumstances because it requires large ducts to transfer relatively small amounts of heat. In systems using refrigerant, this working fluid can also be used to transfer heat a considerable distance, though this can become impractical because of increased risk of expensive refrigerant leakage.  When large amounts of heat are to be transferred, water is typically used, often supplemented with [[antifreeze]], [[corrosion inhibitors]], and other additives.

===Heat sources/sinks===
A common source or sink for heat in smaller installations is the outside air, as used by an air-source heat pump.  A fan is needed to improve heat exchange efficiency.

Larger installations handling more heat, or in tight physical spaces, often use water-source heat pumps.  The heat is sourced or rejected in water flow, which can carry much larger amounts of heat through a given pipe or duct cross-section than air flow can carry.  The water may be heated at a remote location by [[boiler]]s, [[solar energy]], or other means.  Alternatively when needed, the water may be cooled by using a [[cooling tower]], or discharged into a large body of water, such as a lake, stream or an ocean.

[[Geothermal heat pump]]s or ground-source heat pumps use shallow underground heat exchangers as a heat source or sink, and water as the heat transfer medium.  This is possible because below ground level, the temperature is relatively constant across the seasons, and the earth can provide or absorb a large amount of heat. Ground source heat pumps work in the same way as air-source heat pumps, but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground. Ground source heat pumps are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or defrosting systems and can be housed inside. Although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost, the annual running costs are lower, because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter.

Heat pump installations may be installed alongside an auxiliary conventional heat source such as electrical resistance heaters, or oil or gas combustion. The auxiliary source is installed to meet peak heating loads, or to provide a back-up system.

==Applications==
There are millions of domestic installations using air source heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/buildings_roadmap.pdf pg16&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in climates with moderate space heating and cooling needs (HVAC) and may also provide domestic hot water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-systems|title = Heat Pump Systems |publisher = U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.gshp.org.uk/RHI_Domestic.html|title = Renewable Heat Incentive – Domestic RHI – paid over 7 years |website = Ground Source Heat Pump Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HVAC===
In [[HVAC]] applications, a heat pump is typically a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of ''heat flow'' (thermal energy movement) may be reversed. The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building. In cooler climates, the default setting of the reversing valve is heating.

The default setting in warmer climates is cooling. Because the two heat exchangers, the condenser and evaporator, must swap functions, they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes. Therefore, the SEER rating, which is the Seasonal Energy [[SEER|Efficiency]] Rating, of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than two separately optimized machines. For equipment to receive the Energy Star Rating, it must have a rating of at least 14.5 SEER.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rfohl.com/heating-cooling-mechanics-terminology/|title=Heating And Cooling Mechanics and Terminology - R.F. Ohl|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water heating===
In [[water heating]] applications, a heat pump may be used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools or heating potable water for use by homes and industry. Usually heat is extracted from outdoor air and transferred to an indoor water tank, another variety extracts heat from indoor air to assist in cooling the space.

===District heating===
[[File:Generations of district heating systems EN.svg|thumb|Heat pumps can be integrated in district heating systems, especially if these are operated with low temperatures.]]
Heat pumps can also be used as heat supplier for [[district heating]]. Possible heat sources for such applications are [[sewage]] water, ambient water (like sea, lake and river water), industrial [[waste heat]], [[geothermal energy]], [[flue gas]], waste heat from [[district cooling]] and heat from [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|solar heat storage]]. In Europe, more than 1500 MW were installed since the 1980s, of which about 1000 MW were in use in Sweden in 2017.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=David |first1=Andrei et al |last2= |first2= |date=2017 |title=Heat Roadmap Europe: Large-Scale Electric Heat Pumps in District Heating Systems |url= |journal=[[Energies]] |volume=10 |issue= 4|pages=578 |doi=10.3390/en10040578 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale heat pumps for district heating combined with thermal energy storage offer high flexibility for the integration of variable renewable energy. Therefore they are regarded as a key technology for smart energy systems with high shares of [[renewable energy]] up to 100 % and advanced 4th generation district heating systems.&lt;ref name="David" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Henrik Lund (academic)|Lund]] |first1=Henrik et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2014 |title=4th Generation District Heating (4GDH): Integrating smart thermal grids into future sustainable energy systems |url= http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/4th-generation-district-heating-4gdh(61c90957-a9e5-4725-b145-6d481776f827).html|journal=[[Energy (journal)|Energy]] |volume=68 |issue= |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.089 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayegh |first1=M.A. et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2018 |title=Heat pump placement, connection and operational modes in European district heating |url= |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=166 |issue= |pages=122–144 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.02.006 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example for such an usage is the [[Drammen Heat Pump]] commissioned in 2011. This heat pump uses heat from a fjord whose temperature is around 8&amp;nbsp;°C using 3 systems giving a combined capacity of 14 megawatts to town center residences and businesses. A city ordinance mandates this heating system for many new buildings.

===Industrial heating===
There is a great potential to reduce the energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions in the industry by application of industrial heat pumps. An international collaboration project completed in 2015 collected totally 39 examples of R&amp;D-projects and 115 case studies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/annex35/ IEA HPT TCP Annex 35&lt;/ref&gt; The study shows that short payback periods are possible (less than 2 years), high reduction of CO2-emissionen can be achieved (in some cases more than 50 %).&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/publications/?search=Annex+35 IEA HPT TCP Annex 35 Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/publications/application-of-industrial-heat-pumps-annex-35-two-page-summary/ IEA HPT TCP Annex 25 Summary &lt;/ref&gt;

==Refrigerants==
Until the 1990s, the [[refrigerant]]s were often [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s such as R-12 ([[dichlorodifluoromethane]]), one in a class of several refrigerants using the brand name [[Freon]], a trademark of [[DuPont]]. Its manufacture is now banned or severely restricted by the [[Montreal Protocol]] of August 1987 because of the [[ozone depletion|damage]] that [[CFCs]] cause to the [[ozone layer]] if released into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/Publications/MP_Handbook/Section_1.2_Control_measures/Annex_A_-_Group_I.shtml|title=Handbook for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer - 7th Edition|year=2007|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme - Ozone Secretariat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One widely adopted replacement refrigerant is the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) known as [[R-134a]] (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). Heat pumps using R-134a replaced [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] (dichlorodifluoromethane) and have similar thermodynamic properties but with insignificant [[ozone depletion potential]] and a somewhat lower [[global warming potential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/Refrigerants-Environment-Properties-d_1220.html|title=Refrigerants - Environmental Properties|website=The Engineering ToolBox|accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other substances such as liquid R-717 [[ammonia]] are widely used in large-scale systems, or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable [[propane]] or [[butane]], can also be used.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ammonia, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2006|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_143.pub2|author=Max Appl|chapter=Ammonia|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, [[carbon dioxide]], [[R-744]], has increasingly been used, utilizing the [[transcritical cycle]], although it requires much higher working pressures. In residential and commercial applications, the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) R-22 is still widely used, however, HFC [[R-410A]] does not deplete the ozone layer and is being used more frequently; however, it is a powerful greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change.&lt;ref name=R-410A&gt;[[R-410A#Environmental effects]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ecometrica.com|title=Calculation of green house gas potential of R-410A|url=http://ecometrica.com/article/calculating-the-global-warming-potential-of-refrigerant-gas-mixes|accessdate=2015-07-13|ref=Calculation of green house gas potential of R-410A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, or plain air is used in the [[Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|Stirling cycle]], providing the maximum number of options in environmentally friendly gases.

More recent refrigerators use [[R600A]] which is [[isobutane]], and does not deplete the ozone and is less harmful to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LpStalb-tF4C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=R600A+isobutane+ozone+environment#v=onepage&amp;q=R600A%20isobutane%20ozone%20environment&amp;f=false|title=Green Electricity and Global Warming|last=Itteilag|first=Richard L.|date=2012-08-09|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=|isbn=9781477217405|location=|pages=77|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimethyl ether]] (DME) has also gained in popularity as a refrigerant.&lt;ref name="mecanica-dme"&gt;[http://www.e-bookspdf.org/view/aHR0cDovL25yZWMubW4vZGF0YS91cGxvYWRzL05vbSUyMHNldGd1dWwlMjB4aWNoZWVsL092ZXJ2aWV3L0dsb2JhbCUyMHdhcm1pbmcucGRm/UjQwNGEgJiBEbWUgLSDQodGN0YDQs9GN0Y3Qs9C00Y3RhSDQrdGA0YfQuNC8INCl0q/Rh9C90LjQuQ== r404a &amp; dme eco-refrigerant blend as a new solution to limit the global warming effect] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211640/http://www.mecanica.pub.ro/frigo-eco/R404A_DME.pdf archive 2012.03.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

As quite similar criteria shall be fulfilled by [[working fluids]] applied to heat pumps, refrigeration and ORC cycles, several working fluids are applied by all these technologies and can be sorted into the same thermodynamic classification category based on the shape of their saturation curve.

==Noise==
A ground source heat pump has no need for an outdoor unit with moving mechanical components: no external noise is produced.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

An air source heat pump requires an outdoor unit containing moving mechanical components including fans which produce noise. In 2013, the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] started work on standards for protection from noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.cen.eu/BP/6095.pdf|title=HEAT PUMPS AND AIR CONDITIONING UNITS, Social Factors, CEN/TC 113 Business Plan, p. 2|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the CEN/TC 113 Business Plan outset was that "consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations", no standards for noise barriers or other means of noise protection had been developed by January 2016.

In the United States, the allowed nighttime noise level was defined in 1974 as "an average 24-hr exposure limit of 55 [[A-weighting|A-weighted decibels (dBA)]] to protect the public from all adverse effects on health and welfare in residential areas (U.S. EPA 1974). This limit is a day–night 24-hr average noise level (LDN), with a 10-dBA penalty applied to nighttime levels between 2200 and 0700 hours to account for sleep disruption and no penalty applied to daytime levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1307272/|title=Monica S. Hammer, Tracy K. Swinburn, and Richard L. Neitzel "Environmental Noise Pollution in the United States: Developing an Effective Public Health Response" Environmental Health Perspectives V122,I2,2014|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10-dB(A) penalty makes the permitted U.S. nighttime noise level equal to 45 dB(A), which is more than is accepted in some European countries but less than the noise produced by some heat pumps.

Another feature of [[Air source heat pumps|ASHP]] external heat exchangers is their need to stop the fan from time to time for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hannabery.com/faq8.shtml|title= Hannabery HVAC "Commonly Reported HVAC Problems: Outdoor unit makes strange or loud noises"|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode. After that, the heat pump starts to work again. This part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan. The acoustic effect of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dBA. This is included in legislation in France. According to the French concept of noise nuisance, "noise emergence" is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise, and ambient noise without the disturbing noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiil.org/bestpractices/How%20to%20determine%20acceptable%20levels%20of%20noise%20nuisance%20%28France%29|title=Hiil innovating Justice "How to determine acceptable levels of noise nuisance (France)|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006910540&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=cid |title=Code de la santé publique - Article R1334-33 (in French)|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance considerations==
When comparing the performance of heat pumps, it is best to avoid the word "efficiency", which has a very specific thermodynamic definition. The term [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) is used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input. Most vapor-compression heat pumps use electrically powered motors for their work input.

According to the US [[EPA]], geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44% compared with air-source heat pumps and up to 72% compared with electric resistance heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/choosing-and-installing-geothermal-heat-pumps|title=Choosing and Installing Geothermal Heat Pumps|website=Energy.gov|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COP for heat pumps range from 3.2 to 4.5 for air source heat pumps to 4.2 to 5.2 for ground source heat pumps.&lt;ref name="Lowe2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=David|last2=Madani|first2=Hatef|title=On heat pumps in smart grids: A review|journal=[[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]]|volume=70|issue=2|year=2017|pages=342–357|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.182|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895978/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used for heating a building with an outside temperature of, for example, 10&amp;nbsp;°C, a typical [[air-source heat pump]] (ASHP) has a COP of 3 to 4, whereas an electrical resistance [[heater]] has a COP of 1.0. That is, one [[joule]] of electrical energy will cause a resistance heater to produce only one joule of useful heat, while under ideal conditions, one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place. Note that an air source heat pump is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones, so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher COP (as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge).  When there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs, the COP is lower (worse). In extreme cold weather the COP will go down to 1.0.

On the other hand, well designed [[ground-source heat pump]] (GSHP) systems benefit from the moderate temperature underground, as the ground acts naturally as a store of thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/ThermalBanks.html Thermal Banks store heat between seasons | Seasonal Heat Storage | Rechargeable Heat Battery | Thermogeology | UTES | Solar recharge of heat batteries]&lt;/ref&gt; Their year-round COP is therefore normally in the range of 3.2 to 5.0.

When there is a high temperature differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F)), it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to [[Carnot cycle|Carnot efficiency]] limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273&amp;nbsp;°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18&amp;nbsp;°C (0&amp;nbsp;°F) for air source heat pumps.

Also, as the heat pump takes heat out of the air, some moisture in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely cold outside, it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an electric resistance heater, oil furnace, or gas furnace) rather than to run an air-source heat pump. Also, avoiding the use of the heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.

The design of the evaporator and condenser heat exchangers is also very important to the overall efficiency of the heat pump. The heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential (between the refrigerant and the air stream) directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has to do in order to provide the same heating or cooling effect. Generally, the larger the heat exchanger, the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes.

Heat exchangers are expensive, requiring drilling for some heat-pump types or large spaces to be efficient, and the heat pump industry generally competes on price rather than efficiency. Heat pumps are already at a price disadvantage when it comes to initial investment (not long-term savings) compared to conventional heating solutions like boilers, so the drive towards more efficient heat pumps and air conditioners is often led by legislative measures on minimum efficiency standards. Electricity rates will also influence the attractiveness of heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;[[BSRIA]], "European energy legislation explained", www.bsria.co.uk, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cooling mode, a heat pump's operating performance is described in the US as its [[energy efficiency ratio]] (EER) or [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] (SEER), and both measures have units of BTU/(h·W) (1 BTU/(h·W)&amp;nbsp;= 0.293 W/W). A larger EER number indicates better performance. The manufacturer's literature should provide both a COP to describe performance in heating mode, and an EER or SEER to describe performance in cooling mode. Actual performance varies, however, and depends on many factors such as installation details, temperature differences, site elevation, and maintenance.

As with any piece of equipment that depends on coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid, it is important for both the condenser and evaporator coils to be kept clean. If deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils, the efficiency of the unit (both in heating and cooling modes) will suffer.

Heat pumps are more ''effective'' for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has the net effect of heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.

The COP for a heat pump in a heating or cooling application, with steady-state operation, is:
:&lt;math&gt;
COP_\text{heating} = \frac{\Delta Q_\text{hot}}{\Delta A} \leq \frac{T_\text{hot}}{T_\text{hot}-T_\text{cool}},
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
COP_\text{cooling} = \frac{\Delta Q_\text{cool}}{\Delta A} \leq \frac{T_\text{cool}}{T_\text{hot}-T_\text{cool}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q_\text{cool}&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of heat extracted from a cold reservoir at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_\text{cool}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q_\text{hot}&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of heat delivered to a hot reservoir at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_\text{hot}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta A&lt;/math&gt; is the compressor's dissipated work.
* All temperatures are absolute temperatures usually measured in [[kelvin]]s or degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]].

=== Coefficient of performance and lift ===
The coefficient of performance (COP) increases as the temperature difference, or "lift", decreases between heat source and destination. The COP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature (e.g. underfloor heating), and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature (e.g. the ground). Domestic hot water (DHW) and conventional heating radiators require high water temperatures, reducing the COP that can be attained, and affecting the choice of heat pump technology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

One observation is that while current "best practice" heat pumps (ground source system, operating between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 35&amp;nbsp;°C) have a typical COP around 4, no better than 5, the maximum achievable is 8.8 because of fundamental [[Carnot cycle]] limits. This means that in the coming decades, the energy efficiency of top-end heat pumps could roughly double. Cranking up efficiency requires the development of a better [[gas compressor]], fitting HVAC machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows, and solving internal [[lubrication]] problems resulting from slower gas flow.

Depending on the working fluid, the expansion stage can be important also. Work done by the expanding fluid cools it and is available to replace some of the input power.  (An evaporating liquid is cooled by free expansion through a small hole, but an ideal gas is not.)

==Types==

The two main types of heat pumps are [[Gas compression|compression]] and absorption. Compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy (typically driven by electricity), while absorption heat pumps may also run on heat as an energy source (from electricity or burnable fuels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/brochure_warmtepomp.pdf Warmtepompen voor woningverwarming brochure] 9-10-2013&lt;/ref&gt; An absorption heat pump may be fueled by [[natural gas]] or [[LP gas]], for example. While the gas utilization efficiency in such a device, which is the ratio of the energy supplied to the energy consumed, may average only 1.5, that is better than a natural gas or LP gas furnace, which can only approach 1.

==Heat sources and sinks==
By definition, all heat sources for a heat pump must be colder in temperature than the space to be heated. Most commonly, heat pumps draw heat from the air (outside or inside air) or from the ground ([[groundwater]] or [[soil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/folder_warmtepomp.pdf |title=Heat pumps sources including groundwater, soil, outside and inside air) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007174118/http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/folder_warmtepomp.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat drawn from ground-sourced systems is in most cases stored solar heat, and it should not be confused with direct [[geothermal heating]], though the latter will contribute in some small measure to all heat in the ground. True geothermal heat, when used for heating, requires a circulation pump but no heat pump, since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated, so the technology relies only upon simple [[heat convection]].

Other heat sources for heat pumps include water; nearby streams and other natural water bodies have been used, and sometimes domestic waste water (via [[drain water heat recovery]]) which is often warmer than cold winter ambient temperatures (though still of lower temperature than the space to be heated).

A number of sources have been used for the heat source for heating private and communal buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/pdfs/26161b.pdf|title=Homeowners using heat pump systems|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]|date=September 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131222926/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/pdfs/26161b.pdf|archivedate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air source heat pump===
{{Main|Air source heat pumps}}
* Air source heat pump (extracts heat from outside air)
** Air–air heat pump (transfers heat to inside air)
** Air–water heat pump (transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water)

Air-air heat pumps, that extract heat from outside air and transfer this heat to inside air, are the most common type of heat pumps and the cheapest. These are similar to [[air conditioner]]s operating in reverse. Air-water heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps, but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit, [[floor heating]] being the most efficient, and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building. However, ground-water heat pumps are more efficient than air-water heat pumps, and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems.

Air source heat pumps are relatively easy and inexpensive to install and have therefore historically been the most widely used heat pump type. However, they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source. The higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency. In mild weather, [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] may be around 4.0, while at temperatures below around 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) an air-source heat pump may still achieve a COP of 2.5. The average COP over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8, with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates.

The heating output of low temperature optimized heat pumps (and hence their energy efficiency) still declines dramatically as the temperature drops, but the threshold at which the decline starts is lower than conventional pumps, as shown in the following table (temperatures are approximate and may vary by manufacturer and model):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Air source heat pump type !! Full heat output at or above this temperature !! Heat output down to 60% of maximum at
|-
| Conventional || 8.3&amp;nbsp;°C (47&amp;nbsp;°F)  || 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) 
|-
| Low Temp Optimized || 5&amp;nbsp;°C (41&amp;nbsp;°F) || -8.3&amp;nbsp;°C (17&amp;nbsp;°F)
|}

===Ground-source heat pump===
{{Main|Ground-source heat pump}}
* Ground source heat pump (extracts heat from the ground or similar sources)
** Ground–air heat pump (transfers heat to inside air)
*** Soil–air heat pump (soil as a source of heat)
*** Rock–air heat pump (rock as a source of heat)
*** Water–air heat pump (body of water as a source of heat, can be [[groundwater]], [[lake]], [[river]] etc.)
** Ground–water heat pump (transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water)
*** Soil–water heat pump (ground as a source of heat)
*** Rock–water heat pump (rock as a source of heat)
*** Water–water heat pump (body of water as a source of heat)

Ground-source heat pumps, also called geothermal heat pumps, typically have higher efficiencies than air-source heat pumps.  This is because they draw heat from the ground or [[groundwater]] which is at a relatively constant temperature all year round below a depth of about 30 feet (9 m).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130530033808/http://www.geo4va.vt.edu/A1/A1.htm Earth Temperature and Site Geology]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the temperature differential is lower, leading to higher efficiency.  Well maintained ground-source heat pumps typically have COPs of 4.0&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydro.mb.ca/regulatory_affairs/electric/gra_2012_2013/Appendix_38.pdf Performance of Ground Source Heat Pumps in Manitoba] Rob Andrushuk, Phil Merkel, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of the heating season, with lower seasonal COPs of around 3.0 as heat is drawn from the ground. The tradeoff for this improved performance is that a ground-source heat pump is more expensive to install, due to the need for the drilling of boreholes for vertical placement of heat exchanger piping or the digging of trenches for horizontal placement of the piping that carries the heat exchange fluid (water with a little antifreeze).

When compared, groundwater heat pumps are generally more efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil. Closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the ground loop is undersized. This can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity, and the overall system has been designed to be just big enough to handle a "typical worst case" cold spell, or is simply undersized for the load.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516220648/http://geothermalhelp.com/sizing-a-geothermal-heating-system/ Geothermalhelp.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days, thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop. There are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop; one way is to make large solar collectors, for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof, or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof, or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/asphalt_solar_collector.html Asphalt Solar Collector Renewable Heat for IHT | Solar Collectors | Solar Recharge for GSHP | Pavement Solar Collectors | Road Solar Thermal Collector&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized, by ensuring [[soil thermal properties]] and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbonzeroco.com/field-services/soil-thermal-conductivity-testing/ Soil Thermal Conductivity Surveys]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exhaust air heat pump===
{{Main|Exhaust air heat pump}}
* Exhaust air heat pump (extracts heat from the exhaust air of a building, requires [[Ventilation (architecture)|mechanical ventilation]])
** Exhaust air-air heat pump (transfers heat to intake air)
** Exhaust air-water heat pump (transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water)

===Water source heat pump===
* Uses flowing water as source or sink for heat
* Single-pass vs. recirculation
** Single-pass — water source is a body of water or a stream, and utilized water is rejected at a different temperature without further use
** Recirculation
*** When cooling, closed-loop heat transfer medium to central [[cooling tower]] or [[chiller]] (typically in a building or industrial setting)
*** When heating, closed-loop heat transfer medium from central boilers generating heat from combustion or other sources

===Hybrid heat pump===
Hybrid (or twin source) heat pumps: when outdoor air is above 4 to 8 Celsius, (40-50 Fahrenheit, depending on ground water temperature) they use air; when air is colder, they use the ground source. These twin source systems can also store summer heat, by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger, even when the heat pump itself is not running. This has dual advantage: it functions as a low running cost for air cooling, and (if ground water is relatively stagnant) it cranks up the temperature of the ground source, which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4% for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source.

===Air/water-brine/water heat pump (hybrid heat pump)===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
The air/water-brine/water heat pump is a hybrid heat pump, developed in Rostock, Germany, that uses only renewable energy sources.  Unlike other hybrid systems, which usually combine both conventional and renewable energy sources, it combines air and geothermal heat in one compact device. The air/water-brine/water heat pump has two evaporators — an outside air evaporator and a brine evaporator — both connected to the heat pump cycle. This allows use of the most economical heating source for the current external conditions (for example, air temperature).  The unit automatically selects the most efficient operating mode — air or geothermal heat, or both together.  The process is controlled by a control unit, which processes the large amounts of data delivered by the complex heating system.

The control unit comprises two controllers, one for the air heat cycle and one for the geothermal circulation, in one device.  All components communicate over a common bus to ensure they interact to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid heating system.  The German Patent and Trade Mark Office in Munich granted the air/water-brine/water heat pump a patent in 2008, under the title “Heat pump and method for controlling the source inlet temperature to the heat pump”. This hybrid heat pump can be combined with a solar thermal system or with an ice-storage.  It trades and is marketed under the name ''ThermSelect''.  In the United Kingdom, ''ThermSelect'' won the 2013 Commercial Heating Product of the Year award of the HVR Awards for Excellence, organised by ''Heating and Ventilating Review'', an industry magazine.

=== Solar-assisted heat pump ===
{{see also|Solar-assisted heat pump}}
A solar-assisted heat pump is a machine that represents the integration of a heat pump and [[Solar thermal collector|thermal solar panels]] in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce [[Water heating|hot water]].&lt;ref name = ref1&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bine.info/en/publications/themeninfos/publikation/elektrisch-angetriebene-waermepumpen/waermepumpen-plus-solar/ | title = Solar-assisted heat pumps | language = en | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.&lt;ref name = ref2&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | title = Pompe di calore elio-assistite | language = it | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this system is to get high [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] and then produce energy in a more [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficient]] and less expensive way.

==Solid state heat pumps==

===Magnetic===
{{Main|Magnetic refrigeration}}
In 1881, the German physicist [[Emil Warburg]] put a block of iron into a strong magnetic field and found that it increased very slightly in temperature. Some commercial ventures to implement this technology are underway, claiming to cut energy consumption by 40% compared to current domestic refrigerators&lt;!-- The article referenced is unclear what the reference "standard fridge" is --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Guardian Unlimited, December 2006 [http://environment.guardian.co.uk/energy/story/0,,1971818,00.html 'A cool new idea from British scientists: the magnetic fridge']&lt;/ref&gt; The process works as follows: Powdered [[gadolinium]] is moved into a magnetic field, heating the material by 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;°C (4 to 9&amp;nbsp;°F). The heat is removed by a circulating fluid. The material is then moved out of the magnetic field, reducing its temperature below its starting temperature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Thermoelectric===
{{Main|Thermoelectric cooling|Thermoelectric materials}}
Solid state heat pumps using the [[thermoelectric effect]] have improved over time to the point where they are useful for certain refrigeration tasks.  Thermoelectric (Peltier) heat pumps are generally only around 10-15% as efficient as the ideal [[refrigerator]] ([[Carnot cycle]]), compared with 40–60% achieved by conventional compression cycle systems (reverse [[Rankine cycle|Rankine]] systems using compression/expansion);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/pnnl-19259.pdf - The Prospects of Alternatives to Vapor Compression Technology for Space Cooling and Food Refrigeration Applications] DR Brown, N Fernandez, JA Dirks, TB Stout. [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; however, this area of technology is currently the subject of active research in materials science.
A reason why this is popular is because it has a "long lifetime" as there are no moving parts and it does not use potentially hazardous refrigerants.

The '''hemagglutination assay''' (or '''haemagglutination assay'''; '''HA''') and the '''hemagglutination inhibition assay''' ('''HI''' or '''HAI''') were developed in 1941–42 by American virologist [[George Hirst (virologist)|George Hirst]] as methods for quantifying the relative [[concentration]] of [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], or antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirst|first1=GK|title=The quantitative determination of Influenza virus and antibodies by means of red cell agglutination|journal=J Exp Med|date=1942|volume=75|pages=49–64|doi=10.1084/jem.75.1.49|pmc=2135212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HA and HI apply the process of [[hemagglutination]], in which sialic acid receptors on the surface of [[red blood cells]] (RBCs) bind to the hemagglutinin glycoprotein found on the surface of [[influenza virus]] (and several other viruses) and create a network, or lattice structure, of interconnected RBC’s and virus particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antigenic Characterization-Flu Activity &amp; Surveillance- Seasonal Influenza (Flu)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/laboratory/antigenic.htm|website=CDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agglutinated lattice maintains the RBC’s in a suspended distribution, typically viewed as a diffuse reddish solution.  The formation of the lattice depends on the concentrations of the virus and RBC’s, and when the relative virus concentration is too low, the RBC’s are not constrained by the lattice and settle to the bottom of the well.  Hemagglutination is observed in the presence of staphylococci, vibrios, and other bacterial species, similar to the mechanism viruses use to cause agglutination of erythrocytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neter|first1=E|last2=Gorzynski|first2=EA|last3=Zalewski|first3=J|last4=Rachman|first4=R|last5=Gino|first5=RM|title=Studies on Bacterial Hemagglutination|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=1954|volume=44|pages=49–54|doi=10.2105/ajph.44.1.49|pmc=1620628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neter|first1=E|title=Bacterial Hemagglutination and Hemolysis|journal=Statler Research Laboratories and Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, Laboratory of Bacteriology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, and Departments of Pediatrics and Bacteriology, University of Buffalo, School of Medicine, Buffalo, New York|date=1956|volume=20|pages=166–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RBC’s used in HA and HI assays are typically from chickens, turkeys, horses, guinea pigs, or humans depending on the selectivity of the targeted virus or bacterium and the associated surface receptors on the RBC.

==Procedure==
A general procedure for HA is as follows, a serial dilution of virus is prepared across the rows in a U or V- bottom shaped 96-well microtiter plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO|title=Serological detection of avian Influenza A (H7N9) virus infections by turkey haemagglutination-inhibition assay- Laboratory Procedures|url=http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/cnic_serological_diagnosis_hai_a_h7n9.pdf|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most concentrated sample in the first well is often diluted to be 1/5x of the stock, and subsequent wells are typically two-fold dilutions (1/10, 1/20, 1/40, etc.).  The final well serves as a negative control with no virus.  Each row of the plate typically has a different virus and the same pattern of dilutions.  After serial dilutions, a standardized concentration of RBCs is added to each well and mixed gently.  The plate is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following the incubation period, the assay can be analyzed to distinguish between agglutinated and non-agglutinated wells. The images across a row will typically progress from agglutinated wells with high virus concentration and a diffuse reddish appearance to a series of wells with low virus concentrations containing a dark red pellet, or button, in the center of the well.  The low concentration wells appear nearly identical to the no-virus negative control well.  The button appearance occurs because the RBC’s are not held in the agglutinated lattice structure and settle into the low point of the U or V-bottom well.  The transition from agglutinated to non-agglutinated wells occurs distinctively, within 1 to 2 wells.

The relative concentration, or titer, of the virus sample is based on the well with the last agglutinated appearance, immediately before a pellet is observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO|title=Serological detection of avian Influenza A (H7N9) virus infections by turkey haemagglutination-inhibition assay- Laboratory Procedures|url=http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/cnic_serological_diagnosis_hai_a_h7n9.pdf|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Relative to the initial viral stock concentration, the virus concentration in this well will be some dilution of the stock, for example, 1/40-fold.  The titer value of that sample is the inverse of the dilution, i.e., 40.  In some cases, the virus is initially so dilute that agglutinated wells are never observed.  In that case, the titer of these samples is commonly assigned as 5, indicating the highest possible concentration, but the accuracy of that value is clearly low.  Alternatively, if the relative concentration of the virus is extremely high and the wells never transition to a button appearance.  The titer value is then commonly assigned to be the highest dilution, such as 5120.

HI is closely related to the HA assay, but includes anti-viral antibodies as “inhibitors” to interfere with the virus-RBC interaction.  The goal is to characterize the concentration of antibodies in the antiserum or other samples containing antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noah|first1=DL|last2=Hill|first2=H|last3=Hines|first3=D|last4=While|first4=EL|last5=Wolff|first5=MC|title=Qualification of the Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay in Support of Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Licensure|journal=Clin Vaccine Immunology|date=2009|volume=16|pages=558–566|doi=10.1128/cvi.00368-08|pmc=2668270}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The HI assay is generally performed by creating a dilution series of antiserum across the rows of a 96-well microtiter plate.  Each row would usually be a different sample.   A standardized amount of virus or bacteria is added to each well, and the mixture is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes.  The last well in each row would be a negative control with no virus added.  During the incubation, antibodies bind to the viral particles, and if the concentration and binding affinity of the antibodies are high enough, the viral particles are effectively blocked from causing hemagglutination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=R|last2=Cox|first2=N|last3=Stohr|first3=K|title=WHO Manual on Animal Influenza Diagnosis and Surveillance|date=2002|publisher=WHO|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/whocdscsrncs20025rev.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, a standardized amount of RBCs is added to each well and allowed to incubate at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes.  The resulting HI plate images usually progress from non-agglutinated, “button” wells with high antibody concentration to agglutinated, red diffuse wells with low antibody concentration.  The HI titer value is the inverse of the last dilution of serum that completely inhibited hemagglutination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Virocyt|title=An Overview of virus quantification techniques|url=https://virocyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/VirusQuantificationWhitePaper.pdf|publisher=Virocyt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preceding descriptions of the HA and HI processes are generalized, and specific details can vary depending on the operator and laboratory.  For example, serial dilutions across the rows is described, but some laboratories use an alternate orientation and perform dilutions down the columns instead.  Similarly, the starting dilution, serial dilution factor, incubation times, and choice of U or V-bottom plate can depend on the specific laboratory.

==Advantages==
HA and HI have the advantages that the assays are simple, use relatively inexpensive and available instruments and supplies, and provide results within a few hours.  The assays are also well established in many laboratories around the world, allowing some measure of credibility, comparison, and standardization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Virocyt|title=An Overview of virus quantification techniques|url=https://virocyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/VirusQuantificationWhitePaper.pdf|publisher=Virocyt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noah|first1=DL|last2=Hill|first2=H|last3=Hines|first3=D|last4=While|first4=EL|last5=Wolff|first5=MC|title=Qualification of the Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay in Support of Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Licensure|journal=Clin Vaccine Immunology|date=2009|volume=16|pages=558–566|doi=10.1128/cvi.00368-08|pmc=2668270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
Optimal and reliable results require controlling several variables, such as incubation times, red blood cell concentration, and type of red blood cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO|title=Serological detection of avian Influenza A (H7N9) virus infections by turkey haemagglutination-inhibition assay- Laboratory Procedures|url=http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/cnic_serological_diagnosis_hai_a_h7n9.pdf|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-specific factors in the sample can lead to interference and incorrect titer values.  For example, molecules in the sample other than virus-specific antibodies can inhibit agglutination between virus and RBC’s, as well as potentially blocking antibody from binding to virus.  Receptor-destroying enzymes (RDE) are commonly used to treat samples prior to analysis to prevent non-specific inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO|title=Serological detection of avian Influenza A (H7N9) virus infections by turkey haemagglutination-inhibition assay- Laboratory Procedures|url=http://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/cnic_serological_diagnosis_hai_a_h7n9.pdf|publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of the HA or HI results relies on a qualified individual to read the plate and determine the titer values. The manual interpretation method introduces more opportunities for discrepancies in the assay because results can be subjective and the agreement between human readers is inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=J|last2=Laurie|first2=K|last3=Engelhardt|first3=O|title=A Comparative Examination of Influenza Haemagglutination-Inhibition Assay Protocols – Development of a Consensus HI Protocol|agency=CONSISE|issue=4th International Meeting|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is no digital record of the plate or titer determinations so the initial interpretation is tedious and commonly done in replicates.  The range of potential variables and differences between expert readers can make comparing inter-laboratory results difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=JM|last2=Major|first2=D|last3=Heath|first3=A|last4=Newman|first4=RW|last5=Hoschler|first5=K|last6=Stephenson|first6=I|last7=Clark|first7=T|last8=Katz|first8=J|last9=Zambon|first9=MC|title=Reproducibility of serology assays for pandemic influenza H1N1: Collaborative study to evaluate a candidate WHO International Standard.|journal=Vaccine|date=2012|volume=30|pages=210–217|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.11.019|pmid=22100887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information sensitivity''' is the control of access to [[information]] or [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge]] that might result in loss of an advantage or level of security if disclosed to others.

Loss, misuse, modification, or [[Access control|unauthorized access]] to sensitive information can adversely affect the [[privacy]] or [[welfare]] of an individual, [[trade secret]]s of a business or even the [[national security|security]] and international relations of a nation depending on the level of sensitivity and nature of the information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-032/_4768.htm "Sensitive Information"] (definition) Aug. 23, 1996. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-sensitive information==

===Public information===

This refers to information that is already a matter of public record or knowledge. With regard to government and private organizations, access to or release of such information may be requested by any member of the public, and there are often formal processes laid out for how to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipc.on.ca/english/access-to-information/accessing-public-information/ "Accessing Public Information" Information and Privacy Commissioner, Ontario, Canada. Retrieved Feb. 11 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; The accessibility of government-held public records is an important part of government transparency, accountability to its citizens, and the values of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracyweb.org/accountability/principles.php "Accountability and Transparency: Essential Principles" Democracy Web. Retrieved Feb. 11, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public records]] may furthermore refer to information about identifiable individuals that is not considered confidential, including but not limited to: [[census]] records, [[criminal records]], [[sex offender registry]] files, and [[voter registration]].

===Routine business information===

This includes business information that is not subjected to special protection and may be routinely shared with anyone inside or outside of the business.

==Types of sensitive information==
''Confidential information'' is used in a general sense to mean sensitive information whose access is subject to restriction, and may refer to information about an individual as well as that which pertains to a business.

However, there are situations in which the release of personal information could have a negative effect on its owner. For example, a person trying to avoid a stalker will be inclined to further restrict access to such personal information. Furthermore, a person's [[Social Security number|SSN]] or [[Social Insurance Number|SIN]], credit card numbers, and other financial information may be considered private if their disclosure might lead to [[crime]]s such as [[identity theft]] or [[fraud]].

Some types of private information, including records of a person's [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|health care]], education, and employment may be protected by [[privacy law]]s. Unauthorized disclosure of private information can make the perpetrator liable for civil remedies and may in some cases be subject to criminal penalties.

Even though they are often used interchangeably, personal information is sometimes distinguished from private information, or [[personally identifiable information]]. The latter is distinct from the former in that private information can be used to identify a unique individual. Personal information, on the other hand, is information belonging to the private life of an individual that cannot be used to uniquely identify that individual. This can range from an individual’s favourite colour, to the details of their domestic life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonsensemedia.org/educators/lesson/private-and-personal-information-3-5 "Private and Personal Information"] Common Sense Media Inc., 2013. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a common example of personal information that is also regarded as sensitive, where the individual sharing these details with a trusted listener would prefer for it not to be shared with anyone else, and the sharing of which may result in unwanted consequences.

===Confidential business information===

Confidential business information refers to information whose disclosure may harm the business. Such information may include [[trade secret]]s, sales and marketing plans, new product plans, notes associated with patentable inventions, customer and supplier information, financial data, and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsdd.com/articles/confidential-information-and-trade-secrets/ "Confidential information and trade secrets"] MaRS, Dec. 8 2009. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classified===
[[Classified information]] generally refers to information that is subject to special security classification regulations imposed by many national governments, the disclosure of which may cause harm to national interests and security. The protocol of restriction imposed upon such information is categorized into a hierarchy of classification levels in almost every national government worldwide, with the most restricted levels containing information that may cause the greatest danger to national security if leaked. Authorized access is granted to individuals on a [[need to know]] basis who have also passed the appropriate level of [[security clearance]]. Classified information can be reclassified to a different level or declassified (made available to the public) depending on changes of situation or new intelligence.

Classified information may also be further denoted with the method of communication or access. For example, Protectively Marked "Secret" Eyes Only or Protectively Marked "Secret" Encrypted transfer only. Indicating that the document must be physically read by the recipient and cannot be openly discussed for example over a telephone conversation or that the communication can be sent only using encrypted means. Often mistakenly listed as meaning for the eyes of the intended recipient only &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/eyes-only&lt;/ref&gt; the anomaly becomes apparent when the additional tag "Not within windowed area" is also used.

==Legal protection from unauthorised disclosure==

===Personal and private information===

Data privacy concerns exist in various aspects of daily life wherever personal data is stored and collected, such as on the [[Internet privacy|internet]], in [[Medical privacy|medical records]], [[Financial privacy|financial records]], and [[Political privacy|expression of political opinions]]. In over 80 countries in the world, personally identifiable information is protected by [[information privacy law]]s, which outline limits to the collection and use of personally identifiable information by public and private entities. Such laws usually require entities to give clear and unambiguous notice to the individual of the types of data being collected, its reason for collection, and planned uses of the data. In consent-based legal frameworks, explicit consent of the individual is required as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc300h/winter/13/lectures/week2-privacy.pdf "Basic Privacy"] (lecture). University of Toronto, Jan. 24, 2012. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the [[Data Protection Directive]] provides a rigorous standard for privacy protection legislation across all member states. Although the Directive is not legally binding in itself, all member states are expected to enact their own national privacy legislation within three years of the Directive’s adoption that conforms to all of its standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:NOT "Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data"] European Parliament, Council. Nov. 23 1995. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since adoption, the Directive has demonstrated significant influence on the privacy legislation of non-EU nations, through its requirements on the privacy laws of non-member nations engaging in transborder flows of private data with EU member nations.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, J. [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p172821_index.html "The Influence of the European Commission Data Privacy Protection Directive on 'Third Countries'"] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, TBA, San Francisco, CA, May 24, 2007. Retrieved Feb. 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU has passed the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR), which will replace the Directive. The regulation was adopted on 27 April 2016. It becomes enforceable from 25 May 2018 after a two-year transition period and, unlike a directive, it does not require national governments to pass any enabling legislation, and is thus directly binding and applicable.&lt;ref name="BlackmerGDPR16"&gt;

"The proposed new EU data protection regime extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents. It provides for a harmonisation of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for non-European companies to comply with these regulations; however, this comes at the cost of a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to 4% of worldwide turnover."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyp.is/oExZ4PVtEeefHEPs4cEz6w/www.mlawgroup.de/news/publications/detail.php|title=New draft European data protection regime|last=|first=|date=February 2, 2012|website=[[Law Patent Group]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GDPR also brings a new set of "digital rights" for EU citizens in an age when the economic value of personal data is increasing in the digital economy.
In Canada, the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] (PIPEDA) regulates the collection and use of personal data and electronic documents by public and private organizations. PIPEDA is in effect in all federal and provincial jurisdictions, except provinces where existing privacy laws are determined to be “substantially similar”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2002/2002-08-03/html/notice-avis-eng.html#i10 "DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY: PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT"] Canada Gazette, Apr. 03 2002. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though not through the unified sensitive information framework, the United States has implemented significant amount of privacy legislation pertaining to different specific aspects of data privacy, with emphasis to privacy in healthcare, financial, e-commerce, educational industries, and both on federal and state levels. Whether being regulated or self regulated, the laws require to establish ways at which access to sensitive information is limited to the people with different roles, thus in essence requiring establishment of the "sensitive data domain" model &lt;ref&gt;[http://mask-me.net/datamaskingwiki/wiki/35/sensitive-data-discovery "Sensitive Data Discovery"]&lt;/ref&gt; and mechanisms of its protection. Some of the domains have a guideline in form of pre-defined models such as "Safe Harbor" of HIPAA,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#standard&lt;/ref&gt; based on the research of [[Latanya Sweeny]] and established privacy industry metrics.

Additionally, many other countries have enacted their own legislature regarding data privacy protection, and more are still in the process of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationshield.com/intprivacylaws.html "International Privacy Laws "] InformationShield. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confidential business information===
The [[confidentiality]] of sensitive business information is established through [[non-disclosure agreements]], a legally binding contract between two parties in a professional relationship. NDAs may be one-way, such as in the case of an employee receiving confidential information about the employing organization, or two-way between businesses needing to share information with one another to accomplish a business goal. Depending on the severity of consequences, a violation of non-disclosure may result in employment loss, loss of business and client contacts, criminal charges or a civil lawsuit, and a hefty sum in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Niznik, J. S. [http://jobsearchtech.about.com/library/weekly/aa-nondisclosure-4.htm "Non-Disclosure Agreement"] About.com, 2002. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; When NDAs are signed between employer and employee at the initiation of employment, a [[non-compete clause]] may be a part of the agreement as an added protection of sensitive business information, where the employee agrees not to work for competitors or start their own competing business within a certain time or geographical limit.

Unlike personal and private information, there is no internationally recognized framework protecting [[trade secrets]], or even an agreed-upon definition of the term “trade secret”.&lt;ref&gt;Magri, K. A. [http://www.myersbigel.com/library/articles/InternationalAspectsofTradeSecret.pdf "International Aspects of Trade Secrets Law"] 1997. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many countries and political jurisdictions have taken the initiative to account for the violation of commercial confidentiality in their criminal or civil laws. For example, under the US [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]], it is a federal crime in the United States to misappropriate trade secrets with the knowledge that it will benefit a foreign power, or will injure the owner of the trade secret.&lt;ref&gt;104th US Congress.

In many countries, unauthorized disclosure of [[classified information]] is a criminal offence, and may be punishable by fines, prison sentence, or even the death penalty, depending on the severity of the violation.&lt;ref&gt;113th US Congress.

Pp 16-18. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of present and former government employees disclosing classified information regarding national government misconduct to the public and media, in spite of the criminal consequences that await them.

[[Espionage]], or spying, involves obtaining sensitive information without the permission or knowledge of its holder. The use of spies is a part of national intelligence gathering in most countries, and has been used as a political strategy by nation-states since ancient times. It is unspoken knowledge in international politics that countries are spying on one another all the time, even their allies.&lt;ref&gt;Woolsey, R. J. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB95326824311657269 "Why We Spy on Our Allies"] The Wall Street Journal: Mar. 17 2000. Retrieved Feb. 9 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital sensitive information==

[[Computer security]] is information security applied to computing and network technology, and is a significant and ever-growing field in computer science. The term [[computer insecurity]], on the other hand, is the concept that computer systems are inherently vulnerable to attack, and therefore an evolving arms race between those who exploit existing vulnerabilities in security systems and those who must then engineer new mechanisms of security.

A number of security concerns have arisen in the recent years as increasing amounts of sensitive information at every level have found their primary existence in digital form. At the personal level, [[credit card fraud]], [[internet fraud]], and other forms of [[identity theft]] have become widespread concerns that individuals need to be aware of on a day-to-day basis. 
The existence of large databases of classified information on computer networks is also changing the face of domestic and international politics. [[Cyber-warfare]] and [[cyber espionage]] is becoming of increasing importance to the national security and strategy of nations around the world, and it is estimated that 120 nations around the world are currently actively engaged in developing and deploying technology for these purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Brodkin, J.

Philosophies and internet cultures such as [[open-source governance]], [[hacktivism]], and the popular hacktivist slogan "[[information wants to be free]]" reflects some of the cultural shifts in perception towards political and government secrecy. The popular, controversial [[WikiLeaks]] is just one of many manifestations of a growing cultural sentiment that is becoming an additional challenge to the security and integrity of classified information.&lt;ref&gt;Ludlow, P.

The '''International Business and Economic Research Center''' (IBERC), was a company which provided advice, research and analysis on a variety of trade related issues including [[trade preference]] programs, [[Strategic sourcing|sourcing strategies]] and [[trade agreement]] negotiations, principally in the area of textiles and apparel. IBERC's principal products comprised a Quota Management Service and consulting capabilities to help users to make use of the data. IBERC clients included principally apparel and textile producing nations on the United States' quota and tariff system.

==Overview==
IBERC quota management system (database) was founded in the 1960s by lawyer, and former U.S. Army officer, Michael P. Davis. The firm broke up in 1986, when the chief executive, a recently retired [[U.S. Department of Commerce|United States Department of Commerce]] official, was investigated 1986 by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] for alleged activities on behalf of the Government of [[Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4308406.html|title="Some IBERC execs quit as US probes Lenahan".

(Walter Lenahan; International Business and Economic Research Corp.), July 18, 1986|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engagingnews.us/select/International-Business-and-Economic-Research-Corp.html "Eye Mudge Rose-IBERC Israeli activities", Daily News Record (Thu, 31 Jul 1986) (International Business and Economic Research Corp., textile issue activities)]&lt;/ref&gt; in violation of the U.S. [[Foreign Agents Registration Act ]] Dating-from the early 1990s, the IBERC database materials were managed by several different U.S. legal firms dealing with customs and trade affairs. i.e. the IBERC ceased to be a corporate entity, and remained as a product line offered by U.S.-based legal firms operating in the trade domain.

The principal use of IBERC's quota management system was by governments, dealing with the [[Multi Fibre Arrangement]] (MFA) which was managed under the [[GATT]] (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), i.e. principal clients were either textiles manufacturers in these countries, or the governments which were contracting-parties to the GATT. IBERC is used today by governments as a textiles quota database. The IBERC database is owned and managed by firm Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg.

== House Subcommittee investigation of IBERC ==
In 1986, the House Subcommittee On Commerce, Consumer, And Monetary Affairs Of [[United States House Committee on Government Operations|The Government Operations Committee]] investigated IBERC Vice President Walter Lenahan, verifying his compliance with ethics laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://shelf1.library.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/tiff2pdf/heinz/box00158/fld00012/bdl0007/doc0002/heinz.pdf | title=Ex-commerce official learned US position, then switched sides | date=May 22, 1986 | agency=The Washington Times | accessdate=June 4, 2012 | author=Archibald, George | pages=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Lenahan was the former U.S. assistant secretary of Commerce for textiles and apparel, in relation to his move from the [[Commerce Department]] ([[International Trade Centre]]) to working with IBERC. The House Subcommittee investigated at that time if Mr. Lenahan had violated “conflict of interest” laws, “post employment” laws, “FARA-laws” ([[Foreign Agent Registration Act]]) laws and the subject of former U.S. ITA (International Trade Agency) officials who left-office to represent foreign governments was examined. The subcommittee concluded that Mr. Lenahan may have violated a conflict of interest provision of U.S. Federal law, i.e. 18 U.S.C. 208.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gao.justia.com/office-of-personnel-management/1987/5/federal-personnel-ggd-87-57/GGD-87-57-full-report.pdf | title=Annual Report on Activities of OPM and MSPB, Fiscal Year 1986 | date=May 13, 1987 | accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1986/Former-Textile-Negotiator-Hit-on-Alleged-Conflict/id-9c4d0a9b905bf4f91e36194961a7b295 | title=Former Textile Negotiator Hit on Alleged Conflict | publisher=Associated Press | date=Jul 31, 1986 | accessdate=June 4, 2012 | author=Robinson , Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IBERC breakup ==
In the context of the House, and a [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] investigation, IBERC executives (themselves also former US-ITA, U.S. Department of Commerce officials) left the firm resulting in that the IBERC materials were subsumed by the new firm, International Development Systems, Inc., created by former US-ITA officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4308406.html | title=Some IBERC execs quit as US probes Lenahan.

The IBERC textiles quotation database was subsumed thereafter by the legal firm Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander and Ferdon, which operated the IBERC textiles data materials into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/THETORTURERSLOBBY.pdf |title=The torturers' lobby - How Human Rights-Abusing Nations Are Represented in Washington |accessdate=June 4, 2012 |author=Brogan, Pamela |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704124730/http://www.publicintegrity.org/assets/pdf/THETORTURERSLOBBY.pdf |archivedate=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IBERC database and Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg ==
In 2003, IBERC was acquired by the firm Sandler, Travis and Rosenberg P.A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.strtrade.com/Advisories/advisory.aspx?id=95 | title=Sandler, Travis &amp; Rosenberg, P.A. acquires IBERC to enhance information management services for textile/apparel industry clients | date=September 2, 2003 | accessdate=June 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2982">'''Involution''' refers to the shrinking or return of an [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] to a former size. At a cellular level, involution is characterized by the process of [[proteolysis]] of the [[basement membrane]] (basal lamina), leading to epithelial regression and [[apoptosis]], with accompanying [[stromal cell|stromal]] [[fibrosis]]. The consequent reduction in cell number and reorganization of stromal tissue leads to the reduction in the size of the organ.

==Examples==

===Thymus===
The [[thymus]] continues to grow between [[birth]] and [[puberty]] and then begins to [[atrophy]], a process directed by the high levels of circulating [[sex hormones]]. Proportional to thymic size, thymic activity ([[T cell]] output) is most active before [[puberty]]. Upon atrophy, the size and activity are dramatically reduced, and the organ is primarily replaced with [[fat]]. The atrophy is due to the increased circulating level of [[sex hormones]], and chemical or physical castration of an adult results in the thymus increasing in size and activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sutherland|first1=J.

===Uterus===
Involution is the process by which the [[uterus]] is transformed from pregnant to non-pregnant state. This period is characterized by the restoration of ovarian function in order to prepare the body for a new pregnancy. It is a physiological process occurring after [[parturition]]; the [[hypertrophy]] of the uterus has to be undone since it does not need to house the [[fetus]] anymore. This process is primarily due to the hormone [[oxytocin]]. The completion of this period is defined as when the diameter of the uterus returns to the size it is normally during a woman's menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4629562 | pmid=26623357 | volume=5 | issue=1 | title=Uterine involution and progesterone level during the postpartum period in Barbary ewes in north Libya | year=2015 | author=Medan MS, El-Daek T | journal=Open Vet J | pages=18–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammary gland===
During [[pregnancy]] until after birth, [[mammary glands]] grow steadily to a size required for optimal milk production. At the end of [[breastfeeding]], the number of cells in the mammary gland becomes reduced until approximately the same number is reached as before the start of pregnancy.

'''JRG Halad Museum''' is a musically-themed museum in [[Cebu City]], [[Philippines]] that pays homage to the musical heritage of Cebu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/cebu-lifestyle/2014/03/20/1303068/jrg-halad-museum "JRG Halad Museum"].

==Location==
Located along V. Gullas St. (former Manalili) and D. Jakosalem St. [[Cebu City]], the old building of [[The Freeman Newspaper]] has been converted to a museum which houses Cebuano and Visayan musical treasures and memorabilia.

==History==
Founded by Jose "Dodong" R. Gullas, the Halad Museum was inaugurated on January 12, 2010 and opened to the public on February 2, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://208.184.76.175/Article.aspx?articleId=543137&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=111]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piramide|first=Aven|title=Halad Museum from a different angle|url=http://www.philstar.com/freeman-opinion/699716/halad-museum-different-angle|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lao|first=Garry|title=Council lauds Gullas for Halad Museum|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=699005&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=107|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the founder's support, reviving works of long forgotten composers was achieved via concerts of an award-winning university-based choir, the UV Chorale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2009: A great year for the UV Chorale|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=536169&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=107|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which the first of the ''Halad'' concerts came about in 2007 wherein a group of composers were honored posthumously including [[Ben Zubiri]], composer of ''Matud Nila'',&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite news|title=Ben Zubiri's piano another addition to Kinaiyang Sugbuanon Museum|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=496461&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=51|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Vicente Rubi, composer of [[Kasadya Ning Taknaa]]. This started the donations of family members of the honorees for the three Halad concerts  (in 2007, 2008 and 2010) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=50876]&lt;/ref&gt; from lyric sheets to instruments, prompting the idea of a repository—a museum. Eventually, the founder was inspired to actively acquire other musical memorabilia, not just to keep the memory of the honorees alive, but also hopefully, to educate youngsters on how rich Cebu's musical heritage is.

''Halad'' means tribute or offering in the Cebuano language, as such, the museum is dedicated to the founder's parents, Don Vicente and Inday Pining Gullas, who founded the [[University of the Visayas]] in Cebu, Philippines.

In November 2010, expansion of the museum was carried out to make more room for the increasing collections held by the museum which includes memorabilia of Cebuano composers and artists in the 20th century, from musical instruments, lyric sheets to long-playing records.

The revamped and completed Halad Museum was opened to the public in June 13, 2011 with more musical pieces on exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duraliza|first=Debbie|title=Halad Museum now open to the public with more musical pieces on exhibit|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=695818&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=51|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum features three galleries dedicated to Cebuano music, ''kinaiyang Sugbuanon'' (Cebuano cultural traditions), and the founder's gallery.

==Mission-Vision==
The JRG Halad Museum pays tribute to the enduring legacies of  Cebuano cultural heritage as expressed through music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dioko|first=Eladio|title=Halad - museum for the heart|url=http://www.philstar.com/freeman-opinion/698756/halad-museum-heart|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors experience Cebuano music, performing arts, cultural heritage and research exhibitions.

==Permanent Exhibits==
The Halad Music Gallery displays composers from the 20th century who have produced well-known Cebuano songs, as well as artists who have earned international recognition for their talents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sumacot|first=Nina|title=Cebuano culture gets boost with Gullas Halad Museum|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=540379&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=107|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highlights include original music sheets and musical instruments played by the composers themselves and numerous awards and personal items from gowns to gadgets owned by the artists. Turntables and digital music stations are also available for visitors.

The musical memorabilia plus instruments occupy the main section of the museum, but with its recent expansion, it is now home to other interests. The ''Kinaiyang Sugbuanon'' section showcases the Cebuano traditions over time including life-cycle events, popular practices and expressions of religiosity in the different artworks depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tomada|first=Nathalie|title=Museum, concert to mark "Kinaiyang Sugbuanon"|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=529927&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=107|accessdate=27 June 2011|newspaper=The Freeman|date=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another gallery is devoted to the founder who pays tribute to the most influential people in his life, his parents and his living commitment to heritage preservation.

==Resolution==

On June 22, 2011, the Cebu City Council commended the museum founder, Jose R. Gullas, for his efforts to help preserve Cebu's musical and cultural heritage through the Halad Museum. A commendation was made through a resolution sponsored by Councilor Margarita Osmeña, chairperson of the Council’s committee on tourism and culture.

'''Leibniz's gap''' is a [[philosophy of mind]] term that is used to refer to the problem that thoughts cannot be observed or perceived solely by examining [[brain]] properties, events, and processes. Here the word 'gap' is a [[metaphor]] of a subquestion regarding the [[mind–body problem]] that allegedly must be answered in order to reach more profound understanding of [[consciousness]] and [[emergence]]. A [[theory]] that could correlate brain phenomena with [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomena would "bridge the gap." The term is named after [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who first presented the problem in his work ''[[The Monadology]]'' in 1714. Leibniz's passage describing the gap goes as follows:

{{cquote|It must be confessed, moreover, that perception, and that which depends on it, are inexplicable by mechanical causes, that is, by figures and motions, And, supposing that there were a mechanism so constructed as to think, feel and have perception, we might enter it as into a mill. And this granted, we should only find on visiting it, pieces which push one against another, but never anything by which to explain a perception. This must be sought, therefore, in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine.|author=Gottfried Leibniz|source=[http://people.uvawise.edu/philosophy/phil206/Leibniz.html ''Monadology'']}}

Leibniz himself sought to bridge the gap by introducing monads to explain the existence of immaterial, eternal souls. Leibniz's gap, however, applies to [[materialism]] and [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] alike. This brought late 19th century scientists to conclude that psychology must build on [[introspection]]; thus [[introspectionism]] was born. [[Computationalism]] seeks to answer the problem proposed by Leibniz's gap through functional analysis of the brain and its processes. Today the term Leibniz's gap is still in wide use in scientific debate as the mind body problem remains unsolved.

'''Life Beyond Tourism'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org&lt;/ref&gt;  (in short LBT) is a [[nonprofit]] worldwide portal free of banners, based in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The portal dates back to 2008 and stems from an orientation by the [[Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation]]. The portal is an international platform for exchange of experiences and good practices in the framework of a [[tourism]] based on values and not only on services and consumerism.

==History==

The portal originates from an orientation of the [[Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation]]. In 20 years of activity, the Foundation elaborated a new concept of the [[cultural heritage]] as an instrument of understanding among cultures. According to this orientation, [[cultural heritage]] is not only to be safeguarded and enhanced, but also to be “used and enjoyed” to foster intercultural dialogue.
In September 2008 the [[Romualdo Del Bianco Foundation]] announced the establishment of the association Life Beyond Tourism for Intercultural Dialogue. Soon after, a Declaration of Intents &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/imported/Declaration%20of%20Intents%20with%20Signatories(1).pdf |title=Declaration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215190757/http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/imported/Declaration%20of%20Intents%20with%20Signatories%281%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed (March 2008) by 59 experts of the Foundation from 20 different countries. In February 2011 the association developed the Life Beyond Tourism Non-Profit Portal. 
According to the LBT Manifesto &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifebeyondtourism.org/en/488-2/|title=Manifesto}}&lt;/ref&gt; “the tourist is a potential harbinger of knowledge and of intercultural dialogue” and therefore “the tourist destination is a workshop of knowledge, providing all visitors with an opportunity for cultural growth”
The Province of Florence welcomed the LBT orientation and decided to promote it. Many other cultural institutions and public administrations in Central Europe and Eurasia also joined the initiative.

===Main features===
Life Beyond Tourism gathers the cultural expressions representing a given region to provide a good picture of its “cultural personality” resulting from the interaction between its [[cultural heritage]] and ongoing developments.  The aim of the portal is to convey a territory’s specific features and to emphasize the way in which tangible and intangible heritage is combined to human and environmental levels.  
The portal is addressed to all cultural institutions, companies, professional and individuals who share the philosophy of the portal. In particular there are some typologies of members:
* cultural institutions, academies, foundations, associations, local authorities that operates in the field of cultural heritage;
* enterprises and companies rooted in the territory
* individuals that share the values of the LBT Manifesto and are willing to understand the cultural personality of a given territory
The portal is non-profit: the profits of memberships are reinvested into for cultural and development initiatives in the territory itself.
The supporters of Life Beyond Tourism promote a tourism of high cultural quality with a special focus on intercultural dialogue.

===Patronage and members===
Many organizations granted their patronage to Life Beyond Tourism. Among them: [[ICCROM]], [[ICOMOS]] Italia, the [[Council of Europe]], the Società Italiana per la Protezione dei Beni Culturali (CIPBC), the Borsa Mediterranea del Turismo Archeologico, the Associazione Città e Siti Italiani Patrimonio Mondiale [[UNESCO]].

In [[aeronautics]], '''limit load''' (LL) is the maximum [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] authorized during flight,&lt;ref name=Fundamentals&gt;{{cite book|last=Dole|first=Charles|title=Fundamentals of Aircraft Material Factors|year=1989|publisher=Jeppesen Sanderson Inc.|location=Englewood, CO|isbn=0891003401|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, limit load is LL =  LLF x W, where LL = limit load, LLF = limit load factor, and W = weight of the aircraft.

Limit load is [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] for all weights above design [[aircraft gross weight|gross weight]]. The limit load factor is reduced if gross weight is increased. But the LLF cannot be increased if the gross weight is decreased below the design gross weight. Engine mounts and other structural members are designed for the nominal LLF.&lt;ref name=Fundamentals/&gt; The nominal or limit load B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the load which should only occur once (or only a very few times) during the lifetime of an [[aircraft]]. B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; may therefore only occur once during (e.g.) 60,000 hours of flying. No [[plastic deformation]] is allowed at this level of a load.

The limit load can be found relatively easily by statistically analysing the data collected during the many hours of logged flights (which is continuously being gathered).

The '''logic of information''', or the ''logical theory of information'', considers the information content of logical [[sign (semiotics)|sign]]s and expressions along the lines initially developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].  In this line of work, the concept of information serves to integrate the aspects of signs and expressions that are separately covered, on the one hand, by the concepts of [[denotation]] and [[extension (semantics)|extension]], and on the other hand, by the concepts of [[connotation]] and [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]].

Peirce began to develop these ideas in his lectures "On the Logic of Science" at [[Harvard University]] (1865) and the [[Lowell Institute]] (1866).

'''MIKE 21C''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates the development in the [[river bed]] and [[Channel (geography)|channel]] plan form in two dimensions. MIKE 21C was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]]. MIKE 21C uses curvilinear finite difference grids.

Simulated processes with MIKE 21C include [[bank erosion]], scouring and shoaling brought about by activities such as construction and dredging, seasonal fluctuations in flow, etc.

==Applications==
MIKE 21C can be used for designing protection schemes against bank erosion, evaluating measures to reduce or manage shoaling, analyzing alignments and dimensions of navigation channels for minimizing capital and maintenance dredging, predicting the impact of bridge, tunnel and pipeline crossings on river channel hydraulics and morphology, optimizing restoration plans for habitat environment in channel floodplain systems, designing monitoring networks based on morphological forecasting.

Due to its accurate descriptions of the physical processes, MIKE 21C can simulate a [[braided river]] developing from a plane bed, which was illustrated by Enggrob &amp; Tjerry (1998).

==Theory==
As most other models made by DHI, MIKE 21C applies an add-on concept in which the overall time-loop can contain processes to be simulated, selected by the user. In its basic form the model is a 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model that can simulate dynamic as well as quasi-steady or steady-state hydrodynamic solutions. The [[hydrodynamic]] model solves the Saint-Venant equations in two dimensions with the water depth defined in cell centers and a staggered velocity field (internally the code solves the flux field, i.e. the water depth multiplied by the velocity vector) defined with direction as the local grid base vector.

The model is computationally a parallel code (written in [[Fortran]]) with parallelizations in all modules, which allows for simulations of morphological developments on fine grids over long periods of time. The model is typically applied with as much 25,000 computational points over periods of several years or even decades.

The most important secondary flow in rivers is the so-called helical flow, with its name derived from Helios (the Sun in Greek). The name helical is used because the flow arises as the water in the lower portions of the water column flowing towards the local center of curvature, and away from the local center of curvature along the water surface. This has only a minor impact on the hydrodynamics, usually only pronounced on a laboratory scale, but it has profound impacts on the sediment transport and morphology because the helical flow influences the otherwise zero transverse sediment component. MIKE 21C applies standard theory for the helical flow, which can be found in e.g. Rozowsky (1957). Standard helical flow theory provides a secondary flow velocity profile that is fully characterised by friction and the deviation angle between the main flow direction and the direction of the shear stress at the river bed.

MIKE 21C uses the traditional division of [[sediment]] transport into [[bedload]] and suspended load, and the model can simulate both non-cohesive and cohesive sediment in a mixture.

The bed-load model accounts for the impacts of secondary flow (bed shear stress direction) and local bed slope (gravity). Suspended load is calculated with an advection-dispersion equation for each fraction, which includes adaptation in time and space as well as the 2-dimensional depth-integrated effects of the 3-dimensional flow pattern through profile functions (Galappatti &amp; Vreugdenhil, 1985).

'''Mathematical methods''' are integral to the study of '''electronics'''.

==Mathematics in Electronics==
Electronics Engineering careers usually include courses in [[Calculus]] (single and [[Multivariable Calculus|multivariable]]), [[Complex analysis|Complex Analysis]], [[Differential Equations]] (both [[Ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[Partial differential equation|partial]]), [[Linear Algebra]] and [[Probability]]. [[Fourier Analysis]] and [[Z-transform|Z-Transforms]] are also subjects which are usually included in electrical engineering programs.

==Basic applications==
A number of electrical laws apply to all electrical networks.  These include
*[[Faraday's law of induction]]: Any change in the magnetic environment of a coil of wire will cause a voltage (emf) to be "induced" in the coil. 
*[[Gauss's law|Gauss's Law]]:  The total of the electric flux out of a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by the permittivity.
*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's current law|Kirchhoff's current law]]: the sum of all currents entering a node is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node or the sum of total current at a junction is zero
*[[Kirchhoff's circuit laws#Kirchhoff's voltage law|Kirchhoff's voltage law]]: the directed sum of the electrical potential differences around a circuit must be zero.
*[[Ohm's law]]: the voltage across a resistor is the product of its resistance and the current flowing through it.at constant temperature.
*[[Norton's theorem]]: any two-terminal collection of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to an ideal current source in parallel with a single resistor.
*[[Thevenin's theorem]]: any two-terminal combination of voltage sources and resistors is electrically equivalent to a single voltage source in series with a single resistor.
*[[Millman's Theorem|Millman's theorem]]: the voltage on the ends of branches in parallel is equal to the sum of the currents flowing in every branch divided by the total equivalent conductance.
* See also [[Analysis of resistive circuits]].

Circuit analysis is the study of methods to solve linear systems for an unknown variable.

*[[Circuit analysis]]

==Components==
There are many electronic components currently used and they all have their own uses and particular rules and methods for use.

*[[Electronic components]]

==Complex numbers==
If you apply a voltage across a capacitor, it 'charges up' by storing the electrical charge as an electrical field inside the device. This means that while the voltage across the capacitor remains initially small, a large current flows. Later, the current flow is smaller because the capacity is filled, and the voltage raises across the device.

A similar though opposite situation occurs in an inductor; the applied voltage remains high with low current as a magnetic field is generated, and later becomes small with high current when the magnetic field is at maximum.

The voltage and current of these two types of devices are therefore out of phase, they do not rise and fall together as simple resistor networks do. The mathematical model that matches this situation is that of complex numbers, using an imaginary component to describe the stored energy.

==Signal analysis==
* [[Fourier analysis]]. Deconstructing a [[Wave|periodic]] waveform into its constituent frequencies; see also: [[Fourier theorem]], [[Fourier transform]].
* [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem]].
*[[Information theory]]. Sets fundamental limits on how information can be transmitted or processed by any system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18518">'''Model-driven architecture''' ('''MDA''') is a [[software design]] approach for the development of [[software system]]s. It provides a set of guidelines for the structuring of specifications, which are expressed as [[model (abstract)|model]]s. Model-driven architecture is a kind of [[domain engineering]], and supports [[model-driven engineering]] of software systems. It was launched by the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) in 2001.&lt;ref name=proposal&gt;[http://www.omg.org/news/releases/pr2001/2001-03-08a.htm "OMG pursues new strategic direction to build on success of past efforts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924103531/http://www.omg.org/news/releases/pr2001/2001-03-08a.htm |date=2006-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Then, given a [[platform model]] corresponding to [[CORBA]], [[.NET Framework|.NET]], the Web, etc., the PIM is translated to one or more [[platform-specific model]]s (PSMs) that computers can run. This requires mappings and transformations and should be modeled too.

The OMG organization provides rough specifications rather than implementations, often as answers to [[Request for Proposal|Requests for Proposals]] (RFPs). Implementations come from private companies or open source groups.

=== Related standards ===
The MDA model is related to multiple standards, including the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), the [[Meta-Object Facility]] (MOF), [[XML Metadata Interchange]] (XMI), [[Enterprise Distributed Object Computing]] (EDOC), the [[Software Process Engineering Metamodel]] (SPEM), and the [[Common Warehouse Metamodel]] (CWM). Note that the term “architecture” in Model-driven architecture does not refer to the architecture of the system being modeled, but rather to the architecture of the various standards and model forms that serve as the technology basis for MDA.

[[Executable UML]] was the UML profile used when MDA was born. Now, the OMG is promoting [[Executable UML#fUML and ALF|fUML]], instead. (The action language for fUML is ALF.)

=== Trademark ===
The [[Object Management Group]] holds registered trademarks on the term Model Driven Architecture and its acronym MDA, as well as trademarks for terms such as: Model Based Application Development, Model Driven Application Development, Model Based Application Development, Model Based Programming, Model Driven Systems, and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omg.org/legal/tm_list.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model-driven architecture topics ==
=== MDA approach ===
OMG focuses Model-driven architecture on forward engineering, i.e. producing code from abstract, human-elaborated modelling diagrams (e.g. class diagrams){{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. OMG's ADTF (Analysis and Design Task Force) group leads this effort. With some humour, the group chose ADM (MDA backwards) to name the study of reverse engineering. ADM decodes to Architecture-Driven Modernization. The objective of ADM is to produce standards for model-based reverse engineering of legacy systems.&lt;ref&gt;adm website http://adm.omg.org&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge Discovery Metamodel]] (KDM) is the furthest along of these efforts, and describes information systems in terms of various assets (programs, specifications, data, test files, database schemas, etc.).

As the concepts and technologies used to realize designs and the concepts and technologies used to realize architectures have changed at their own pace, decoupling them allows system developers to choose from the best and most fitting in both domains. The design addresses the functional ([[use case]]) requirements while architecture provides the infrastructure through which non-functional requirements like scalability, reliability and performance are realized. MDA envisages that the platform independent model (PIM), which represents a conceptual design realizing the functional requirements, will survive changes in realization technologies and [[software architecture]]s.

Of particular importance to model-driven architecture is the notion of [[model transformation]]. A specific standard language for model transformation has been defined by [[Object Management Group|OMG]] called [[QVT]].

=== MDA tools ===
The OMG organization provides rough specifications rather than implementations, often as answers to [[Request for Proposal|Requests for Proposals]] (RFPs). The OMG documents the overall process in a document called the MDA Guide.

Basically, an MDA tool is a tool used to develop, interpret, compare, align, measure, verify, transform, etc. models or metamodels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|author=Bézivin, J, Gérard, S, Muller, P-A, and Rioux, L|title=MDA components: Challenges and Opportunities|version=In: Metamodelling for MDA|year=2003|url=http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/lina/atl/www/papers/MDAComponents-ChallengesOpportunities.V1.3.PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206191031/http://www.sciences.univ-nantes.fr/lina/atl/www/papers/MDAComponents-ChallengesOpportunities.V1.3.PDF|archivedate=2006-12-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following section "model" is interpreted as meaning any kind of model (e.g. a UML model) or metamodel (e.g. the CWM metamodel). In any MDA approach we have essentially two kinds of models: ''initial models'' are created manually by human agents while ''derived models'' are created automatically by programs. For example, an analyst may create a UML initial model from its observation of some loose business situation while a Java model may be automatically derived from this UML model by a [[Model transformation]] operation.

An MDA tool may be a tool used to check models for completeness, inconsistencies, or error and warning conditions. Also used to calculate metrics for the model.&lt;ref name="MonperrusJézéquel2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monperrus|first1=Martin|last2=Jézéquel|first2=Jean-Marc|last3=Champeau|first3=Joël|last4=Hoeltzener|first4=Brigitte|title=A Model-Driven Measurement Approach|year=2008|pages=505–519|issn=0302-9743|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-87875-9_36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tools perform more than one of the functions listed above. For example, some creation tools may also have transformation and test capabilities. There are other tools that are solely for creation, solely for graphical presentation, solely for transformation, etc.

Implementations of the OMG specifications come from private companies or [[open source]] groups. One important source of implementations for OMG specifications is the [[Eclipse Foundation]] (EF). Many implementations of OMG modeling standards may be found in the [[Eclipse Modeling Framework]] (EMF) or [[Graphical Modeling Framework]] (GMF), the Eclipse foundation is also developing other tools of various profiles as GMT. Eclipse's compliance to OMG specifications is often not strict. This is true for example for OMG's EMOF standard, which Eclipse approximates with its ECORE implementation. More examples may be found in the M2M project implementing the QVT standard or in the M2T project implementing the MOF2Text standard.

One should be careful not to confuse the ''List of MDA Tools'' and the [[List of UML tools]], the former being much broader. This distinction can be made more general by distinguishing 'variable metamodel tools' and 'fixed metamodel tools'. A UML CASE tool is typically a 'fixed metamodel tool' since it has been hard-wired to work only with a given version of the UML metamodel (e.g. UML 2.1). On the contrary, other tools have internal generic capabilities allowing them to adapt to arbitrary metamodels or to a particular kind of metamodels.

Usually MDA tools focus rudimentary architecture specification, although in some cases the tools are architecture-independent (or platform independent).

Simple examples of architecture specifications include:
* Selecting one of a number of supported [[reference architecture]]s like [[Java EE]] or [[Microsoft .NET]],
* Specifying the architecture at a finer level including the choice of presentation layer technology, business logic layer technology, persistence technology and persistence mapping technology (e.g. object-relational mapper).
* Metadata: information about data.

=== MDA concerns ===
Some key concepts that underpin the MDA approach (launched in 2001) were first elucidated by the [[Shlaer-Mellor]] method during the late 1980s. Indeed, a key absent technical standard of the MDA approach (that of an action language syntax for [[Executable UML]]) has been bridged by some vendors by adapting the original Shlaer-Mellor Action Language (modified for UML){{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. However, during this period the MDA approach has not gained mainstream industry acceptance; with the [[Gartner Group]] still identifying MDA as an "on the rise" technology in its 2006 "[[Hype cycle|Hype Cycle]]",&lt;ref name=gartnermda&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?ref=g_search&amp;id=494180&amp;subref=simplesearch "Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2006"] $495.00&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Forrester Research]] declaring MDA to be "D.O.A." in 2006.&lt;ref name=forrestermda&gt;[http://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,39156,00.html "MDA Is DOA, Partly Thanks To SOA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013004355/http://forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,39156,00.html |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential concerns that have been raised with the OMG MDA approach include:
* Incomplete Standards: The MDA approach is underpinned by a variety of technical standards, some of which are yet to be specified (e.g. an action semantic language for [[Executable UML|xtUML]]), or are yet to be implemented in a standard manner (e.g. a [[QVT]] transformation engine or a [[Platform-independent model|PIM]] with a virtual execution environment).&lt;ref name=mdanoaslsyntaxone&gt;[http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2003_01/column1 "UML - Unified or Universal Modeling Language? UML2, OCL, MOF, EDOC - The Emperor Has Too Many Clothes"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mdanoaslsyntaxtwo&gt;[http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/article.tss?l=MDA_Haywood "MDA: Nice Idea. Shame about the..."]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vendor Lock-in: Although MDA was conceived as an approach for achieving (technical) platform independence, current MDA vendors have been reluctant to engineer their MDA toolsets to be interoperable. Such an outcome could result in vendor lock-in for those pursuing an MDA approach.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* Idealistic: MDA is conceived as a forward engineering approach in which models that incorporate Action Language programming are transformed into implementation artifacts (e.g. executable code, database schema) in one direction via a fully or partially automated "generation" step. This aligns with OMG's vision that MDA should allow modelling of a problem domain's full complexity in UML (and related standards) with subsequent transformation to a complete (executable) application.&lt;ref name=eclipsemda&gt;[http://www.java-forum-stuttgart.de/jfs/2006/folien/A5_Schoenhage_Compuware.pdf "Bringing MDA to Eclipse, using a pragmatic approach"]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach does, however, imply that changes to implementation artifacts (e.g. database schema tuning) are not supported . This constitutes a problem in situations where such post-transformation "adapting" of implementation artifacts is seen to be necessary. Evidence that the full MDA approach may be too idealistic for some real world deployments has been seen in the rise of so-called "pragmatic MDA".&lt;ref name=forresterresponse&gt;[http://www.bptrends.com/publicationfiles/04-06-COL-MDA-ResponseToForrester-Frankel.pdf#search=%22%22pragmatic%20MDA%22%22 "A Response to Forrester"]&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatic MDA blends the literal standards from OMG's MDA with more traditional model driven mechanisms such as [[round-trip engineering]] that provides support for adapting implementation artifacts.
* Specialised Skillsets: Practitioners of MDA based software engineering are (as with other toolsets) required to have a high level of expertise in their field. Current expert MDA practitioners (often referred to as Modeller/Architects) are scarce relative to the availability of traditional developers.&lt;ref name=amblermda&gt;[http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/readyForMDA.htm "Are You Ready For the MDA?"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* OMG Track Record: The OMG consortium who sponsor the MDA approach (and own the MDA trademark) also introduced and sponsored the CORBA standard which itself failed to materialise as a widely utilised standard.&lt;ref name=corba&gt;[http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=396 "The Rise and Fall of CORBA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202033636/http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=396 |date=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Uncertain Value Proposition (UVP): As discussed, the vision of MDA allows for the specification of a system as an abstract model, which may be realized as a concrete implementation (program) for a particular computing platform (e.g. .NET). Thus an application that has been successfully developed via a pure MDA approach could theoretically be ported to a newer release .NET platform (or even a Java platform) in a deterministic manner &amp;ndash; although significant questions remain as to real-world practicalities during translation (such as user interface implementation). Whether this capability represents a significant value proposition remains a question for particular adopters. Regardless, adopters of MDA who are seeking value via an "alternative to programming" should be very careful when assessing this approach. The complexity of any given problem domain will always remain, and the programming of business logic needs to be undertaken in MDA as with any other approach. The difference with MDA is that the programming language used (e.g. xtUML) is more abstract (than, say, Java or C#) and exists interwoven with traditional UML artifacts (e.g. class diagrams). Whether programming in a language that is more abstract than mainstream [[Third-generation programming language|3GL]] languages will result in systems of better quality, cheaper cost or faster delivery, is a question that has yet to be adequately answered.
* MDA was recognized as a possible way to bring various independently developed standardized solutions together. For the simulation community, it was recommended as a business and industry based alternative to yet another US DoD mandated standard.&lt;ref name=mdasim&gt;[https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1011/1011.6671.pdf "Avoiding Another Green Elephant"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conferences ==
Among the various conferences on this topic we may mention [http://www.ecmda-fa.org/ ECMDA], the European Conference on MDA and also [[MoDELS]], former firmed as &lt;&lt;UML&gt;&gt; conference series (till 2004), the [http://mdaforum.soluta.net Italian Forum on MDA] in collaboration with the [[Object Management Group|OMG]]. There are also several conferences and workshops (at [[OOPSLA]], [[ECOOP]] mainly) focusing on more specific aspects of MDA like model transformation, model composition, and generation.

== Code generation controversy ==
&lt;!-- MDA isn't just about UML - this section needs to be rewritten --&gt;
[[Automatic programming|Code generation]] means that the user abstractly models solutions, which are connoted by some model data, and then an automated tool derives from the models parts or all of the [[source code]] for the software system. In some tools, the user can provide a skeleton of the program source code, in the form of a source code [[Template (programming)|template]] where predefined tokens are then replaced with program source code parts during the code generation process.

An often cited criticism is that the UML diagrams just lack the detail which is needed to contain the same information as is covered with the program source. Some developers even claim that "the Code ''is'' the design".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html by Jack W. Reeves&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bleading-edge.com/ Bleading-Edge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modular additions''' are usually side and second-story additions to homes that are pre-fabricated at the facilities. General characteristics of a [[modular home]] apply. For a second-story modular addition the existing house should have a sound structure as modular rooms are 30%+ heavier than the same stick-built. Modular additions are built in the facility, brought to the site and “dropped” by crane on the new location. It is necessary to have a general contractor to supervise the project as there is always some work to tie new rooms into an existing house.

Even though it is assumed that modular additions are less expensive than traditional stick built this is rarely true when compared by square footage. The buyer would generally get more wood and better insulation plus benefits of controlled environment but total cost of the contract would be about the same.

'''Pan evaporation''' is a measurement that combines or integrates the effects of several climate elements: temperature, humidity, rain fall, drought dispersion, solar radiation, and wind. Evaporation is greatest on hot, windy, dry, sunny days; and is greatly reduced when clouds block the sun and when air is cool, calm, and humid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Evaporation pan==
An '''evaporation pan''' is used to hold water during observations for the determination of the quantity of evaporation at a given location. Such pans are of varying sizes and shapes, the most commonly used being circular or square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/glossary.php?letter=e
  |title=NOAA Glossary:Evaporation Pan
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The best known of the pans are the "Class A" evaporation pan and the "Sunken Colorado Pan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/S2022E/s2022e07.htm
  |title=fao.org Chapter 3: Crop Water Needs
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, India and South Africa, a Symon's Pan (or sometimes Symon's Tank) is used. Often the evaporation pans are automated with water level sensors and a small weather station is located nearby.

== Standard methods ==
A variety of evaporation pans are used throughout the world. There are formulas for converting from one type of pan to another and to measures representative of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| quotes =| author =Bosman, HH| date =October 1990| year =| month =| title =Methods to Convert American Class A-Pan and Symon's Tank Evaporation to That of a Representative Environment| journal =[[Water SA]]| volume =16| issue =4| pages =227–236| issn =| pmid =| doi =| id =| url =http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9104314&amp;q=&amp;uid=790778876&amp;setcookie=yes| language =| format =| accessdate =| laysummary =| laysource =| laydate =| quote =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080407063141/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9104314&amp;q=&amp;uid=790778876&amp;setcookie=yes| archivedate =2008-04-07| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, research has been done about the installation practices of evaporation pans so that they can make more reliable and repeatable measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Class A evaporation pan===
In the United States, the [[National Weather Service]] has standardized its measurements on the '''Class A evaporation pan''', a cylinder with a diameter of 47.5 in (120.7&amp;nbsp;cm) that has a depth of 10 in (25&amp;nbsp;cm). The pan rests on a carefully leveled, wooden base and is often enclosed by a chain link fence to prevent animals drinking from it.  Evaporation is measured daily as the depth of water (in inches) evaporates from the pan. The measurement day begins with the pan filled to exactly two inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) from the pan top. At the end of 24 hours, the amount of water to refill the pan to exactly two inches from its top is measured.

If precipitation occurs in the 24-hour period, it is taken into account in calculating the evaporation. Sometimes precipitation is greater than evaporation, and measured increments of water must be dipped from the pan. Evaporation cannot be measured in a Class A pan when the pan's water surface is frozen.

The Class A Evaporation Pan is of limited use on days with rainfall events of &gt;30mm (203mm rain gauge) unless it is emptied more than once per 24hours. Analysis of the daily rainfall and evaporation readings in areas with regular heavy rainfall events shows that almost without fail, on days with rainfall in excess of 30mm (203mm Rain Gauge) the daily evaporation is spuriously higher than other days in the same month where conditions more receptive to evaporation prevailed.

The most common and obvious error is in daily rainfall events of &gt;55mm (203mm rain gauge) where the Class A Evaporation pan will likely overflow.

The less obvious, and therefore more concerning, is the influence of heavy or intense rainfall causing spuriously high daily evaporation totals without obvious overflow.

=== Sunken Colorado pan ===
The '''sunken Colorado pan''' is square, 1&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft) on a side and 0.5 m (18 in.) deep and made of unpainted galvanized iron.  As the name suggests, it is buried in the ground to within about 5&amp;nbsp;cm (2 in.) of its rim. Evaporation from a Sunken Colorado Pan can be compared with a Class A pan using conversion constants. The pan coefficient, on an annual basis, is about 0.8.&lt;ref&gt;

==Decreasing Trend of Pan Evaporation==
{{Further|Global dimming|Global warming}}

Over the last 50 or so years, pan evaporation has been carefully monitored.  For decades, pan evaporation measurements were not analyzed critically for long term trends. But in the 1990s scientists reported that the rate of evaporation was falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roderick, Michael L.  |author2=Graham D.

It is currently theorized that, all other things being equal,  as the [[global warming|global climate warms]] evaporation would increase proportionately and as a result, the [[hydrological cycle]] in its most general sense is bound to accelerate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intl.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/298/5597/1345?ck=nck CLIMATE CHANGE: Is the Hydrological Cycle Accelerating? - Ohmura* and Wild 298 (5597): 1345 - Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401105008/http://intl.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/298/5597/1345?ck=nck |date=2007-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The downward trend of pan evaporation has since also been linked to a phenomenon called [[global dimming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dimming_trans.shtml BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3310_sun.html NOVA | Transcripts | Dimming the Sun | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Wild et al. and Pinker et al. found that the "dimming" trend had reversed since about 1990 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=154 | title=Global Dimming may have a brighter future | accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories suggest that measurements have not taken the local environment into account. Since the local moisture level has increased in the local terrain, less water evaporates from the pan. This leads to false measurements and must be compensated for in the data analysis. Models accounting for additional local terrain moisture match global estimates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pages.jh.edu/news_info/news/home98/nov98/paradox.html | title=Environmental Engineers Unravel 'Evaporation Paradox' | accessdate=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lake Evaporation vs. Pan Evaporation==
Pan evaporation is used to estimate the evaporation from lakes.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evaporation from a natural body of water is usually at a lower rate because the body of water does not have metal sides that get hot with the sun, and while light penetration in a pan is essentially uniform, light penetration in natural bodies of water will decrease as depth increases.  Most textbooks suggest multiplying the pan evaporation by 0.75 to correct for this.[cite?]

==Relationship to Hydrological Cycle==
{{Further|Global dimming|Global warming}}
"It is generally agreed that the evaporation from pans has been decreasing for the past half century over many regions of the Earth. However, the significance of this negative trend, as regards terrestrial evaporation, is still somewhat controversial, and its implications for the global hydrologic cycle remain unclear. The controversy stems from the alternative views that these evaporative changes resulted, either from global radiative dimming, or from the complementary relationship between pan and terrestrial evaporation. Actually, these factors are not mutually exclusive but act concurrently."

{{Politics |Related}}

'''Political psychology''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field dedicated to understanding [[politics]], [[politician]]s and [[political behavior]] from a [[psychology|psychological]] perspective. The relationship between politics and psychology is considered bi-directional, with psychology being used as a lens for understanding politics and politics being used as a lens for understanding psychology. As an interdisciplinary field, political psychology borrows from a wide range of other disciplines, including: [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[economics]], [[philosophy]], [[Media (communication)|media]], [[journalism]] and [[history]].

Political psychology aims to understand interdependent relationships between individuals and contexts that are influenced by beliefs, motivation, perception, cognition, information processing, learning strategies, socialization and attitude formation. Political psychological theory and approaches have been applied in many contexts such as: leadership role; domestic and foreign policy making; behavior in ethnic violence, war and genocide; group dynamics and conflict; racist behavior; voting attitudes and motivation; voting and the role of the media; nationalism; and political extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition = 2nd |publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence political psychologists study the foundations, dynamics, and outcomes of political behavior using cognitive and social explanations.

==History and early influences==

===France===
Political psychology originated from Western Europe, France, where it was closely tied to the emergence of new disciplines and paradigms as well as to the precise social and political context in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., 'Outline of a cultural history of political psychology'. Chapter 1, pp. 3-22 in: Stone, W. &amp; Schaffner, P. (1988), The psychology of politics. New York: Springer (2nd ed.). More elaborate backgrounds in: Van Ginneken. J. (1992). Crowds, psychology and politics. New York: Cambridge University Press. And its sequel: Van Ginneken, J. (2007). Mass movements. Apeldoorn (Neth.): Spinhuis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The discipline political psychology was formally introduced during the Franco-Prussian war and the socialist revolution, stirred by the rise of the [[Paris Commune]] (1871).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "political psychology" was first introduced by the [[ethnologist]] Adolph Bastian in his book ''[[Man in History]]'' (1860). The philosopher [[Hippolyte Taine]] (1828–1893), a founder of the Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, applied Bastian's theories in his works ''[[The Origins of Contemporary France]]'' (1875–1893), to ideas on the founding and development of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. The head of Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, [[Emile Boutmy]] (1835–1906), was a famous explorer of social, political and geographical concepts of national interactions. He contributed various works on political psychology such as ''English People; A study of their Political Psychology'' (1901) and ''The American People; Elements of Their Political Psychology'' (1902).&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudmin |first=F. W. |title= G.B.Grundy's 1917 Proposal for Political Psychology: "A science shich has yet to be Created" |journal= ISPP News |year=2005 |volume=16 |pages=6–7 |url= http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/RudminGrundyBio6.pdf|accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contributor of [[Crowd psychology|crowd theory]] [[Gustave Le Bon]] (1841–1931) suggested that crowd activity subdued will and polluted rational thought which resulted in uncontrollable impulses and emotions. He suggested in his works ''Psychology of Socialism'' (1896) and ''Political Psychology and Social Defense'' (1910)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in the uncontrollable state of a crowd people were more vulnerable to submission and leadership, and suggested that embracing [[nationalism]] would remedy this.

===Italy===
Meanwhile in Italy, the [[Risorgimento]] (1870) instigated various social reforms and voting rights. The large division in social class during this period led lawyer [[Gaetano Mosca]] (1858–1914) to publish his work, ''The Ruling Class: Elements of Political Science'' (1896), which theorized the presence of the ruling and the ruled classes of all societies.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The psychology of Politics|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing| page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1828–1923), inspired by Mosca's concepts, contributed ''The Rise and Fall of the Elites'' (1901) and ''The Socialist System'' (1902–1903) to the discipline of political psychology, theorizing on the role of class and social systems. His work ''[[The Mind and Society]]'' (1916) offers a sociology [[treatise]].&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1"&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.9)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosca and Pareto's texts on the Italian elite contributed to the theories of Robert Michels (1875–1936). Michels was a German socialist fascinated by the distinction between the largely lower class run parliament in Germany and upper class run parliament in Italy. He wrote ''Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchic Tendencies of Modern Democracy'' (1911).&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1" /&gt;

===Austria===
A large psychoanalytical influence was contributed to the discipline of political psychology by [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939). His texts ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913) and ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1921) linked psychoanalysis with politics. Freud and [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|Bullitt]] (1967) developed the first psychobiographical explanation to how the personality characteristics of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] affected his decision making during World War I. [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897–1957), inspired by the effects of World War II, was interested in whether personality types varied according to epoch, culture and class. He described the bidirectional effect of group, society and the environment with personality. He combined Freudian and [[Marxist]] theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' (1933). He also edited ''The Journal for Political Psychology and Sexual Economy'' (1934–1938) which was the first journal to present political psychology in the principal of western language.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.11)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, novice political alterations and [[fascist]] control during World War II spurred research into authoritarianism from [[Frankfurt school]]. Philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] (1898–1979) opened up issues concerning freedom and authority in his book, ''[[Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory]]'' (1941), where he suggested groups compromise on individual rights. [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969) also investigated authoritarian individuals and anti-Semitism. His report ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) attempts to determine the personality type susceptible to following fascism and anti-democratic propaganda. Nazi movements during World War II also spurred controversial psychologists such as [[Walther Poppelreuter]] (1932) to lecture and write about political psychology that identified with Hitler. The psychologist [[Eric Jaensch]] (1883–1940) contributed the racist book ''The Anti-type'' (1933).

===United Kingdom===
At the turn of the century, [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] introduced disciplinary political psychology courses such as "The Sciences of the Man", along with the foundation of the Psychological society (1901) and the Sociological society (1904).&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford historian [[G. B. Grundy]] (1861–1948) noted political psychology (1917) as a sub-discipline of history. Motivated by social and political behavior during World War I, he deemed a new branch of historical science, "The Psychology of Men Acting in Masses".&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; He referred to science to instrument the clarification of mistaken beliefs about intention.&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; The intellectual [[Graham Wallas]] (1859–1932) implicated the significance of studying psychology in politics in  ''Human Nature in Politics'' (1908). Wallace emphasized the importance of enlightening politicians and the public about the psychological processes in order to raise awareness on exploitation while developing control over one's own psychological intellect. He suggested in ''[[Great Society (book)|Great Society]]'' (1917) that recognition of such processes could help to build a more functional humanity.

===United States===
Across the Atlantic the first American to be considered a political psychologist was [[Harold Lasswell]] (1902–1978) whose research was also spurred by a sociological fascination of World War I. His work ''Propaganda Technique in the World War'' (1927) discussed the use of applying psychological theories in order to enhance propaganda technique.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.19)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasswell moved to Europe shortly after where he started to tie Freudian and Adler personality theories to politics and published ''Psychopathology and Politics'' (1930). His major theories involved the motives of the politically active and the relation between propaganda and personality.

Another contributing factor to the development of Political Psychology was the introduction of psychometrics and "The Measurement of Attitude" by [[Thurstone]] and [[Chave]] (1929). The methodological revolution in social science gave quantitative grounds and therefore more credibility to Political Psychology. Research into political preference during campaigns was spurred by [[George Gallup]] (1901–1984), who founded the "American Institute of Public Opinion". The 1940s election in America drew a lot of attention in connection with the start of World War II. Gallup, Roper and Crossley instigated research into the chances of Roosevelt being re-elected. Lazarsfeld, Berelson and Gaudet (1944) also conducted a famous panel study "The People's Choice" on the 1940s election campaign. These studies drew attention to the possibility of measuring political techniques using psychological theories.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the US into World War II spiraled vast research into fields such as war technique, propaganda, group moral, psycho-biography and culture conflict to name a few, with the U.S. army and Navy recruiting young psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the discipline quickly developed and gained international accreditation.

McGuire identifies three broad phases in the development of political psychology, these three phases are:
1.The era of [[personality studies]] in the 1940s and 1950s dominated by psychoanalysis 
2.The era of [[political attitudes]] and voting behavior studies in the 1960s and 1970s characterized by the popularity of "rational man" assumptions
3.An era since the 1980s and 1990s, which has focused on [[political beliefs]], information processing and decision making, and has dealt in particular with international politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2013 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and politics==

The study of [[Personality psychology|personality]] in political psychology focuses on the effects of leadership personality on decision-making, and the consequences of mass personality on leadership boundaries. Key personality approaches utilized in political psychology are psychoanalytic theories, trait-based theories and motive-based theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A psychoanalytical approach===
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) made significant contributions to the study of personality in political psychology through his theories on the unconscious motives of behavior. Freud suggested that a leader's behavior and decision making skill were largely determined by the interaction in their personality of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#id|id]], [[Id, ego and super-ego#ego|ego]] and [[superego]], and their control of the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] and [[reality principle]]. The psychoanalytic approach has also been used extensively in psychobiographies of political leaders. Psychobiographies draw inferences from personal, social and political development, starting from childhood, to understand behavior patterns that can be implemented to predict decision-making motives and strategies.

===A trait-based approach===
Traits are personality characteristics that show to be stable over time and in different situations, creating predispositions to perceive and respond in particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press| page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] (1897-1967) realized the study of traits introducing central, secondary, cardinal and common traits. These four distinctions suggest that people demonstrate traits to varying degrees, and further that there is a difference between individual and common traits to be recognized within a society. [[Hans Eysenck]] (1916-1997) contributed three major traits, currently however [[Paul Costa Jr|Costa]] and [[Robert R. McCrae|McCrae]]'s (1992)  "Big Five" personality dimensions are the most recognized. These include; neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience and conscientiousness. Theories in political psychology induce that one's combination of these traits has implications for leadership style and capacity. For example, individuals who score highly on extroversion are demonstrated as having superior leadership skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Myers-Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment scale commonly used in the study of political personality and for job profiling.

===A motive-based approach===
In terms of political psychology [[motivation]] is viewed as goal-oriented behavior driven by a need for three things; [[Power (social and political)|power]], affiliation intimacy, and [[Goal#Achieving personal goals|achievement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories were grouped by Winter (1996) from Murray's (1938) twenty suggested common human goals. Need for power affects the style in which a leader performs. Winter and Stewart (1977) suggested that leaders high in power motivation and low in need of affiliation intimacy motivation make better presidents. Affiliation-motivated leaders alternatively tend to collaborate joint efforts in the absence of threat. Lastly, achievement motivation has demonstrated to not correspond with political success, especially if it is higher than power motivation (Winter, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.122)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation between a leader and those whom they are ruling needs to be consistent with success. Motives have been shown to be correlated more highly with situation and time since last goal-fulfillment, rather than consistent traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.132)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT) is commonly used for assessing motives. However, in the case of leadership assessment this test is more difficult to implement therefore more applicable tests are often used such as content analysis of speeches and interviews.

==Frameworks for assessing personality==

===The authoritarian personality===
The [[authoritarian personality]] is a syndrome theory that was developed by the researchers [[Adorno]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik|Frenkel-Brunswick]], [[Daniel Levinson|Levinson]] and [[Nevitt Sanford|Sanford]] (1950) at The University of California. The American Jewish Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jost, J.T., Sidanius, J.|year=2004 |title= Political Psychology: Key Readings (p.47)|edition=1st|publisher= London: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidized research and publishing on the theory since it revolved around ideas developed from World War II events. [[Adorno]] (1950) explained the authoritarian personality type from a psychoanalytic point of view suggesting it to be a result of highly controlled and conventional parenting. Adorno (1950) explained that individuals with an authoritarian personality type had been stunted in terms of developing an ability to control the sexual and aggressive id impulses. This resulted in a fear of them and thus a development of defense mechanisms to avoid confronting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.40)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian personality types are persons described as swinging between depending on yet resenting authority. The syndrome was theorized to encompass nine characteristics; conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, anti-intraception (an opposition to subjective or imaginative tendencies), superstition and stereotypy, power and toughness, destructiveness and cynicism, sex obsession, and projectivity. The authoritarian personality type is suggested to be; ethnocentric, ego-defensive, mentally rigid, conforming and conventional, adverse to the out of the ordinary, and as having conservative political views. The book ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) introduces several scales based on different authoritarian personality types. These are; the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] which measures from where and to what degree fascist attitudes develop, the anti-Semitism scale, the ethnocentrism scale and the politico economic conservatism scale. The F-scale however, is the only scale that is expected to measure implicit authoritarian personality tendencies.

[[Bob Altemeyer]] (1996) deconstructed the authoritarian personality using trait analysis. He developed a [[Right-wing Authoritarianism]] (RWA) scale based on the traits; authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. Altmeyer (1996) suggested that those who score high on the F-scale have a low ability for critical thinking and therefore are less able to contradict authority. Altmeyer's theories also incorporate the psychodynamic point of view, suggesting that authoritarian personality types were taught by their parents to believe that the world was a dangerous place and thus their impulses lead them to make impulsive, emotional and irrational decisions. The beliefs and behavior of an authoritarian are suggested to be easily manipulated by authority instead of being based on internal values.  Altmeyer also theorized that leaders with authoritarian personality types were more susceptible to the [[fundamental attribution error]]. There are many weaknesses associated with this syndrome and the F-scale. It may have been more relevant during the period in which it was produced, being shortly after World War II. The authoritarian personality is generally related to a fascist image however it is suggested to explain behavior of individuals in all political fields.

===Trait-based frameworks===
Trait-based frameworks, excluding the Freudian approach, were suggested by [[James David Barber|James Barber]] (1930–2004) in ''The Presidential Character'' (1972) who highlighted the importance of [[psychobiography]] in political personality analysis. Barber suggested that leadership personality comprised three dimensions; "character", "world view", and "style".&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.28)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barber also proposed that leadership typology followed a pattern leading from an individuals first political success and that it is includes two variables; the effort that a leader puts in and the personal satisfaction that the leader gains. This typology is fairly limited in its dimensions.

[[Etheredge]] (1978) proposed the importance of the traits; "dominance", "interpersonal trust", "self-esteem" and "introversion-extroversion", in leadership views and policy shaping. Etheredge found from studies on leaders during the Soviet Union, that those who scored highly on dominance were more likely to support the use of force during debate settlement. He found that the trait introversion can lead to a lack of co-operation, and that extroversion usually leads to cooperation and negotiation. Further he suggested that interpersonal trust and self-esteem were closely related to not advocating force.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28" /&gt;

[[Margaret Hermann]] (1976) introduced the [[Leader Trait Assessment]] (LTA) and advocated the development of the [[Profiler-Plus]]. The Profiler-Plus is a computer system used to code spontaneous interview answers for seven major characteristics; need for power, cognitive complexity, task-interpersonal emphasis, self-confidence, locus of control, distrust of others, and ethnocentrism. This method can profile large bodies of leadership related text whilst removing any subjective bias from content analysis. It is efficient and has high reliability.
Hermann and Preston (1994) suggested 5 distinct variables of leadership style; their involvement in policy making, their willingness to tolerate conflict, their level and reasons for motivation, their information managing strategies, and their conflict resolving strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.30)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach is the [[Operational-Code]] method introduced by [[Nathan Leites]] (1951) and restructured by [[Alexander George (philosopher)|Alexander George]] (1979). The code is based on five philosophical beliefs and five instrumental beliefs. A [[Verbs in Context]] (VIC) coding system employed through the Profiler-Plus computer program once again allows substantial bodies of written and spoken speech, interviews and writings to be analyzed subjectively.  The method attempts to be able to predict behavior thorough applying knowledge of various beliefs.

Although political behavior is governed and represented by a leader the consequential influence of the leader largely depends upon the context in which they are placed and in which type of political climate they are running. For this reason group behavior is also instrumental for understanding sociopolitical environments

==The political psychology of groups==

[[Group behavior]] is key in understanding the structure, stability, popularity and ability to make successful decisions of political parties. Individual behavior deviates substantially in a group setting therefore it is difficult to determine group behavior by looking solely at the individuals that comprise the group. Group form and stability is based upon several variables; size, structure, the purpose that the group serves, group development and influences upon a group.

===Group size===
Group size has various consequences. In smaller groups individuals are more committed (Patterson and Schaeffer, 1997) and there is a lower turnover rate (Widmeyer, Brawley and Carron, 1990).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.67)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large groups display greater levels of divergence (O'Dell, 1968) and less conformity (Olson and Caddell, 1994). Group performance also diminishes with size increase, due to decreased co-ordination and free-riding.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; The size of a [[political party]] or nation can therefore have consequential effects on their ability to co-ordinate and progress.

===Group structure===
The structure of a group is altered by member diversity, which largely affects its efficiency. Individual diversity with in a group has proven to demonstrate less communication and therefore to increase conflict (Maznevski, 1994).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; This has implications for political parties based in strongly colonial or multiracial nations.
Member diversity has consequences for; status, role allocation and role strain within a group, all of which can cause disagreement. Thus maintenance of group cohesion is key. Cohesion is affected by several factors; the amount of time members spend in the group, the amount that members like one another, the amount of reward that the group offers, the amount of external threat to the group and the level of warmth offered by leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.69)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors should be considered when attempting to form an efficient political group. President decision efficiency for example is affected by the degree to which members of the advisory group have a hierarchical status and by the roles that each member is assigned.

===Group function===
Studying the purpose for formation of a group, whether it is serving a "functional" purpose or an "interpersonal attraction" purpose (Mackie and Goethals, 1987), has implications for political popularity. Often people join groups in order to fulfill certain survival, interpersonal, informational and collective needs.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt;  A political party that provides; stability, clear information, offers power to individuals and satisfies a sense of affiliation, will gain popularity. [[William Schutz|Shutz's]] (1958) "[[Fundamental interpersonal relations orientation]]" theory suggests that groups satisfy the need for control, intimacy and inclusion. Groups also form due to natural attraction. Newcomb (1960)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that we are drawn to others close in socioeconomic status, beliefs, attitudes and physical appearance. Similarity in certain respects can thus be related to how much a person is attracted to joining one group over another.

===Group development===
[[Group development]] tends to happen in several stages; forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning (Tuckman, 1965). Group awareness of these stages is important in order for members to acknowledge that a process is taking place and that certain stages such as storming are part of progression and that they should not be discouraged or cause fear of instability. Awareness of group development also allows for models to be implemented in order to manipulate different stages. External influences upon a group will have different effects depending upon which stage the group is at in its course. This has implications for how open a group should be depending upon the stage of development it is at, and on its strength.
Consistency is also a key aspect in a group for success (Wood, 1994).

===The influence of conformity in groups===
The application of conformity is key for understanding group influence in political behaviour. Decision making within a group is largely influenced by conformity. It is theorized to occur based on two motives; [[normative social influence]] and [[informational social influence]] (Asch, 1955).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.74)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance of conformity is influenced by several factors; an increase in group size but only to a certain degree at which it plateaus, and degree of unanimity and commitment to the group. Therefore, the degree of popularity of a political group can be influenced by its existing size and the believed unanimity and commitment by the public of the already existing members. The degree by which the group conforms as a whole can also be influenced by the degree of individuation of its members.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74" /&gt;
Also, the conformity within political groups can be related to the term, 'political coalition.' Humans represent groups as if there was a special category of an individual. For example, for cognitive simplicity, ancestral groups anthropomorphize each other because they have similar thoughts, values, and a historical background.  Even though the member of a group may have an irrational or wrong argument about a political issue, there is a high possibility for the other members to conform to it because of the mere fact that they are in the same coalition. &lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen, “States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics,” International Security, Vol. 36, No. 2, Fall 2011, pp. 48-83&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of power in groups===
Power is another influential factor within a group or between separate groups. The "critical bases of power" developed by French and Raven (1959) allocates the following types of power as the most successful; reward power, coercive power, legitimate power, [[referent power]] and expert power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.76)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The way in which power is exerted upon a group can have repercussive outcomes for popularity. Referent power results in greater popularity of a political group or leader than coercive power (Shaw and Condelli, 1986).&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.77)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has implications for leaders to manipulate others to identify with them, rather than to enforce consequential punishment. However, if coercive power is enforced, success and a trusted leader (Friedland, 1976) are necessary in order for group conflict not to escalate.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt; Extrinsic punishment and reward are also suggested to detract from intrinsic motivation. A sense of freedom must be advocated to the group.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt;

===Decision-making in groups===
[[Decision-making]] is an important political process which influences the course of a country's policy. Group decision-making is largely influenced by three rules; "[[majority]]-wins rule", "[[truth]]-wins rule", and "first-shift rule". Decision-making is also coerced by [[conformity]]. [[Irrational]] decisions are generally made during emotional periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.83)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an unpopular political party may receive more votes during a period of actual or perceived economic or [[political instability]]. Controversial studies by George Marcus (2003) however imply that high levels of [[anxiety]] can actually cause an individual to analyze information more rationally and carefully, resulting in more well-informed and successful decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schildkraut |first=D. J. |title= All Politics is psychological: A Review of Political Psychology Syllabi |journal= Perspectives on Politics |date=December 2004 |volume=2 |pages=807–819 |url= http://ase.tufts.edu/polsci/faculty/schildkraut/Perspectives2004.pdf |accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= 10.1017/s1537592704040575|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychology of decision-making however must be analyzed in accordance with whether it is within a leadership context or a between group context. The implementation of successful decision-making is often enhanced by group decision-making (Hill, 1982) especially if the decision is important to the group and when the group has been working together for an extended period of time (Watson, Michaelson and Sharp, 1991). However groups can also hinder decision-making if a correct answer is not clear. Janis (1972) introduced the notion of [[Groupthink]] that advocates an increased chance of groups making faulty decisions under several conditions; strong group cohesion, isolation of group decision from public review, the presence of a directive leader in the group, and high stress levels.
[[Group polarization]] (Janis, 1972) suggests that group decision-making is often more extreme whether is it more risky or cautious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.84)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Groupthink" refers to "a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2015 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques to establish more effective decision making skills in political dimensions have been suggested. Hirt and Markman (1995) claim that implementing an individual in a group to find faults and to critique will enable the members to establish alternative view points. George (1980) suggested "multiple advocacy" which implements that a neutral person analyses the pros and cons of various advocate suggestions and thus makes an informed decision.

Applied psychology theories to improve productivity of political groups include implementing "[[team development]]" techniques, "quality circles" and autonomous work groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.81)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using psychology in the understanding of certain political behaviors==

===Evolution===

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] plays a significant role in understanding the state and people of how the current political regime came to be. It is an approach that focuses on the structure of human behavior claiming it’s dependence on the social and ecological environment. Developed through natural selection, the human brain functions to react appropriately to environmental challenges of coalitional conflict using psychological mechanisms and modifications. An example of political conflict would involve state aggression such as war. Psychological mechanisms work to digest what is taken in from internal and external information regarding the current habitat and project it in the most suited form of action such as acts of aggression, retrieval, dominance, and so forth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anthony C. Lopez |author2=Rose McDermott |author3=Michael Bang Petersen |authorlink1=States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |title= States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |volume=36 |issue=2 fall 2011 |pages=48-83 |publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting behavior===

In order to make inferences and predictions about behavior concerning voting decision, certain key public influences must be considered. These influences include the role of emotions, political socialization, [[political sophistication]], tolerance of diversity of political views and the media. The effect of these influences on [[voting behavior]] is best understood through theories on the formation of attitudes, beliefs, schema, knowledge structures and the practice of information processing. The degree to which voting decision is affected by internal processing systems of political information and external influences, alters the quality of making truly democratic decisions.

===Conflict===

The application of psychology for understanding conflict and extreme acts of violence can be understood in both individual and group terms. Political conflict is often a consequence of ethnic disparity and "ethnocentrism" Sumner (1906).

On an individual level participators in situations of conflict can either be perpetrators, bystanders or altruists. The behavior of perpetrators is often explained through the authoritarian personality type. Individual differences in levels of empathy have been used to explain whether an individual chooses to stand up to authority or ignore a conflict. Rotter's (1954) [[locus of control]] theory in personality psychology has also been used to determine individual differences in reaction to situations of conflict.

Group behavior during conflict often affects the actions of an individual. The [[bystander effect]] introduced by Darley and Latane (1968) demonstrates that group behavior causes individuals to monitor whether others think it is necessary to react in a situation and thus base their behavior on this judgment. They also found that individuals are more likely to diffuse responsibility in group situations. These theories can be applied to situations of conflict and genocide in which individuals remove personal responsibility and therefore justify their behavior. [[Social identity theory]] explains that during the Holocaust of World War II political leaders used the Jews as an out-group in order to increase in-group cohesion. This allowed for the perpetrators to depersonalize from the situation and to diffuse their responsibility. The out-groups were held in separate confines and dehumanized in order to aid the in-group to disengage themselves from relating.

Research by Dr. Dan Kahan has demonstrated that individuals are resistant to accepting new political views even if they are presented with evidence that challenges their views.  The research also demonstrated that if the individual was required to write a few sentences about experiences they enjoyed or spend a few moments affirming their self-worth, the individual was more likely to accept the new political position.&lt;ref&gt;Motivated Numeracy and Enlightened Self-Government. retrieved on August 25, 2014. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992&lt;/ref&gt;

Although somewhat unusual, [[evolutionary psychology]] can also explain conflicts in politics and the international society. A journal by Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott and Michael Bang Petersen uses this idea to give out hypothesis to explain political events. According to the authors, instincts and psychological characteristics developed through evolution is still existent with modern people. They suggest human being as "adaptation executers"; people designed through natural selection, and not "utility maximizers"; people who strive for utility in every moment. Though a group of people, perhaps those who are in the same political coalition, may seem as if they pursue a common utility maximization, it is difficult to generalize the theory of "utility maximizers" into a nation-view because people evolved in small groups. This approach helps scholars to explain seemingly irrational behaviors like aggressiveness in politics and international society because "irrational behavior" would be the result of a mismatch between the modern world and evolutionary psychology.

For example, according to evolutionary psychology, coalitional aggression is more commonly found with males. This is because of their [[psychological mechanism]] designed since ancestral times. During those times men had more to earn when winning wars compared to women (they had more chance of finding a mate, or even many mates). Also, the victorious men had more chance of reproduction which eventually led to the succession of aggressive, eager-to-war DNAs. As a result, the authors hypothesize that countries with more men will tend to show more aggressive politics thereby having more possibility of triggering conflicts within and especially among states.

Indeed some exceptions do exists in this theory as this is just a hypothesis. However it is viable enough to be a hypothesis to be tested to explain certain political events like war and crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen. "States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics"." International Security 36.2 (2011): 48-83. 20 Sept 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism===

On an individual level terrorism has been explained as a display of psychopathological personality disorders. Terrorists have demonstrated to show narcissistic personality traits (Lasch, 1979, Pearlstein, 1991). Post (2004) argues that narcissistic and borderline personality disorders are found in terrorists and that mechanisms such as [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] and [[externalization]] are used by terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.271)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Silke (2004) and Mastors and Deffenbaugh (2007) refute this view. Crenshaw (2004) showed that certain terrorist groups are actually careful in not enlisting those demonstrating pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.272)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[authoritarian personality]] theory has also been used as an explanation for terrorist behavior in individuals.

In terms of explaining reasons for which individuals join terrorist groups, motivational theories such as need for power and need for affiliation intimacy are suggested. Festinger (1954) explained that people often join groups in order to compare their own beliefs and attitudes. Joining a terrorist group could be a method to remedy individual uncertainty. Taylor and Louis (2004) explained that individuals strive for meaningful behavior. This can also be used to explain why terrorists look for such radical beliefs and demonstrations. Studies on children in northern Ireland by Field (1979) have shown that exposure to violence can lead to terrorist behavior later on. Implicating the effect of developing acceptable norms in groups. However this view has also been criticized (Taylor, 1998). Other theories suggest that goal frustration can result in aggression (Dollard, Doob. Miller, mower, and Sears, 1939)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.273)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aggression can lead to frustration (Borum, 2004).
Group settings can cause a social identity and terrorist behavior to manifest. Methods such as dehumanization allow individuals to detach more easily from moral responsibility, and group influence increase the chance that individuals will concede to conformity and compliance. Manipulations of social control and propaganda can also instrument terrorist involvement.

In fact, a strategic model has been proposed to examine the political motivations of terrorists. The strategic model, the dominant paradigm in terrorism studies, considers terrorists are rational actors who attack civilians for political ends. According to this view, terrorists are political utility maximizers. The strategic model rests on three core assumptions which are: (1)terrorists are motivated by relatively stable and consistent political preferences; (2)terrorists evaluate the expected political payoffs of their available options; and (3)terrorism is adopted when the expected political return is superior to those of alternative options. However, it turns out that terrorists' decision-making process does not fully conform to the strategic model. According to Abrahms, Max who is the author of "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and [[Counterterrorism]] Strategy." &lt;ref&gt;Abrahms, Max. "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and Counterterrorism Strategy." International Security, vol. 32 no. 4, 2008, pp. 78-105. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/237009&lt;/ref&gt;there are seven common tendencies that represent important empirical puzzles for the strategic model, going against the conventional thought that terrorists are rational actors.

'''Quantasomes''' are particles found in the [[thylakoid membrane]] of [[chloroplast]]s in which [[photosynthesis]] takes place. They are embedded in a paracrystalline array on the surface of thylakoid discs in chloroplasts. They are composed of lipids and proteins that include various photosynthetic pigments and redox carriers. For this reason they are considered to be photosynthetic units. They occur in 2 sizes: the smaller quantasome is thought to represent the site of photosystem I, the larger to represent the site of photosystem II.

Quantasomes were first identified by [[Roderic B. Park]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="Smith-1977"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft796nb4n2&amp;chunk.id=d0e5234&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=0&amp;brand=eschol&amp;query=quantasome | title = Chapter 4 — Chloroplasts—Structure and Photosynthesis | work = The Molecular Biology of Plant Cells | publisher = [[University of California Press]] | year = 1977 | first = H. | last = Smith | lccn = 77-73503 | isbn = 0-520-03465-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Park-1962"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed039p424 | title = Advances in photosynthesis | first = Roderic B. | last = Park | date = August 1962 | journal = [[Journal of Chemical Education]] | volume = 39 | number = 8 | pages = 424 | doi = 10.1021/ed039p424 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raul Hilberg''' (June 2, 1926 – August 4, 2007) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]]-born Jewish-American [[Political Science|political scientist]] and [[historian]]. He was widely considered to be the world's [[wiktionary:preeminent|preeminent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Joffe | first = Lawrence | title = Obituary: Raul Hilberg | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 2007-09-25 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/25/guardianobituaries.obituaries | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wyman | first = David | author-link = David Wyman | title = Managing the Death Machine | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 1985-08-11 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/11/books/managing-the-death-machine.html | accessdate =2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Woo | first = Elaine | title = Raul Hilberg, 81; scholar was an authority on the Holocaust | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = 2007-08-07 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/07/local/me-hilberg7 | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholar of the [[Nazi holocaust|Holocaust]], and his three-volume, 1,273-page ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', is regarded as a seminal study of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Final Solution]].

== Life and career ==
Hilberg was born in [[Vienna]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family from [[Polish people|Poland]] and [[Romanian people|Romania]].

Hilberg was very much a loner, pursuing solitary hobbies such as geography, music and [[train spotting]].&lt;ref name=popper&gt;Popper, Nathaniel (March&amp;nbsp;31, 2010). "[https://www.thenation.com/article/conscious-pariah/ A Conscious Pariah]" [on Raul Hilberg]. ''[[The Nation]]''. Retrieved 2016-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his parents attended [[synagogue]] on occasion, he personally found the irrationality of religion repellent and developed an allergy to it. He did however attend a [[Zionism|Zionist]] school in Vienna, which inculcated the necessity of defending against, rather than surrendering to, the rising menace of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=popper /&gt; Following the March 1938 [[Anschluss]], his family was evicted from their home at gunpoint and his father was arrested by the Nazis, but he was later released because of his service record as a combatant during [[World War I]]. One year later, on April 1, 1939, at age 13, Hilberg fled Austria with his family; after reaching France, they embarked on a ship bound for [[Cuba]]. Following a four-month stay in Cuba, his family arrived in the United States on September 1, 1939, the day the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Raul Hilberg | url = http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070806/OBITUARIES/708060352/1010/OBITUARIES | date = 2007-08-06 | newspaper = Rutland Herald | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing war in Europe, 26 members of Hilberg's family were killed in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Luc Ferry]] and S.Passquier, interview with Hilberg, 'Les fonctionnaires du génocide', in ''L'Express international'', May 27, 1988 pp.50-58, Cited Gie Van den Berghe, '[http://www.journalbelgianhistory.be/en/system/files/article_pdf/BTNG-RBHC%2C%2021%2C%201990%2C%201-2%2C%20pp%20110-124.pdf The Incompleteness of a Masterpiece: Raul Hilberg and the Destruction of European Jews]', [[BTNG-RBHC]], 1990, 1-2 pp.110-124 p.110 n.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hilbergs settled in [[Brooklyn, New York]], where Raul attended [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] and [[Brooklyn College]]. He intended to make a career in [[chemistry]], but he found that it did not suit him, and he left his studies to work in a factory. Having reached draft age, he was then called up for military service. As early as 1942, Hilberg, after reading scattered reports of what would later become known as the Nazi genocide, went so far as to ring [[Stephen Wise]] and ask him what he planned to do with regard to "the complete annihilation of European Jewry". According to Hilberg, Wise hung up.&lt;ref name=popper /&gt;

Hilberg served first in the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)]] during [[World War II]], but, given his native fluency and academic interests, he was soon attached to the ''War Documentation Department'', charged with examining archives throughout Europe. While quartered in the [[Brown House, Munich, Germany|Braunes Haus]], he stumbled upon Hitler's crated private library in Munich. This discovery prompted Hilberg's research into the Holocaust, a term which he personally disliked,&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2217692.ece "Raul Hilberg"], ''The Times'', (London), August 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; though in later years he himself used it.&lt;ref&gt;In a recent lecture in Vienna he is on record as saying,'We know perhaps 20 per cent about the Holocaust,' Times Obituary ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic career ===
After returning to civilian life, Hilberg chose to study [[political science]], earning his B.A. at [[Brooklyn College]] in 1948. He was deeply impressed by the importance of [[elite]]s and [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] while attending [[Hans Rosenberg]]'s lectures on the [[Prussia]]n [[civil service]]. At one particular point in Rosenberg's course, Hilberg was taken aback by a remark his teacher dropped:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most wicked atrocities perpetrated on a civilian population in modern times occurred during the Napoleonic occupation of Spain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The young Hilberg interrupted the lecture to ask why the recent murder of 6 million Jews did not figure in Rosenberg's assessment. Rosenberg replied that it was a complicated matter, but that the lectures only dealt with history down to 1930, adding, "History doesn't reach down into the present age." Hilberg was amazed by this highly educated, German-Jewish emigrant passing over the [[genocide]] of European Jews in order to expound on [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Peninsular War|the occupation of Spain]]. The episode served to strengthen his interest in the subject.&lt;ref name=GA&gt;[[:de:wiki|Götz Aly]], [http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/startseite/article8kag6_1.445521.html "Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg"], in [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], 10 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilberg went on to first complete an M.A. (1950), and then a Ph.D (1955), at [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;[[Associated Press]], [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/06/america/NA-GEN-US-Obit-Hilberg.php "Holocaust Scholar Raul Hilberg dies at 81"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', August 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; where he entered the graduate program in Public Law and Government. Meanwhile, in 1951, he obtained a temporary appointment to work on the ''War Documentation Project'' under the direction of [[Fritz T. Epstein]].

Hilberg was undecided under whom he should carry out his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] research. Having attended a course on [[International Law]], he was also attracted to the lectures of [[Salo Baron]], the leading authority on Jewish [[historiography]] at the time, with particular expertise in the field of laws pertaining to the Jewish people. According to Hilberg, to attend Baron's lectures was to enjoy the rare opportunity of observing "a walking library, a monument of incredible erudition", active before his classroom of students. Baron asked Hilberg whether he was interested in working under him on the annihilation of Europe's Jewish population. Hilberg demurred on the grounds that his interest lay in the ''perpetrators,'' and thus he would not begin with the Jews who were their victims, but rather with what was done to them.&lt;ref name=GA/&gt;

Hilberg decided to write the greater part of his Ph.D. under the supervision of [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]], the author of an influential wartime analysis of the [[Nazi Germany|German totalitarian state]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Leopold Neumann]], [[Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism|Behemoth: ''The Structure and Practice of National Socialism, 1933 - 1944'',]] Octagon Books, New York 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann was initially reluctant to take Hilberg on as his doctoral student. He had already read Hilberg's master's thesis, and found, as both a deeply patriotic German and a Jew, that certain themes sketched there were unbearably painful. In particular he had asked that the section on Jewish cooperation be removed, to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;"«Streichen Sie das!» – «Stimmt das nicht?», entgegnete ich. Darauf er: «Nein, too much to take – das ist zu viel." Götz Aly, "Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg", ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann nonetheless relented, warning his student, however, that such a dissertation was professionally imprudent and might well prove to be his academic funeral.&lt;ref name=popper /&gt; Undeterred by the prospect, Hilberg pressed on without regard for the possible consequences.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Douglas Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/us/07hilberg.html "Raul Hilberg: Historian Who Wrote of the Holocaust as a Bureaucracy, Dies"], ''The New York Times'', August 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann himself contacted [[Nuremberg Tribunal|Nuremberg]] prosecutor [[Telford Taylor]] directly, to facilitate Hilberg's access to the appropriate archives. After Neumann's death in a traffic accident in 1954, Hilberg completed his doctoral requirement under the supervision of Professor [[William T. R. Fox]]. His dissertation won him the university's prestigious Clark F. Ansley Award in 1955, which carried with it the right to have his thesis published by his [[alma mater]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J.Berger, ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach,'' Aldine Transaction, 2002 p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught the first college-level course in the United States dedicated to the Holocaust, when the subject was finally introduced into his university's curriculum in 1974.&lt;ref name=popper /&gt;

Hilberg obtained his first academic position at the [[University of Vermont]] in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], in 1955, and took up residence there in January 1956. Most of his teaching career was spent at that university, where he was a member of the Department of [[political science|Political Science]]. He was appointed [[emeritus professor]] upon his retirement in 1991. In 2006, the university established the Raul Hilberg Distinguished Professorship of Holocaust Studies. Each year the University of Vermont's Carolyn and Leonard Miller Center for Holocaust Studies hosts the Raul Hilberg Memorial Lecture, which is made possible through a generous gift from Jerold D. Jacobson, Esquire, of New York City, UVM Class of 1962.[http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmchs/]

Hilberg was appointed to the President's Commission on the Holocaust by [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1979. He later served for many years on its successor, the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which is the governing body for the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].&lt;ref name=Berenbaum&gt;[[Michael Berenbaum|Berenbaum, Michael]] (August&amp;nbsp;8, 2007).

The American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; Their Descendants. Retrieved 2016-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his death, the Museum established the Raul Hilberg Fellowship, intended to support the development of new generations of Holocaust scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/memoriam/detail.php?content=hilberg |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120718203822/http://www.ushmm.org/memoriam/detail.php?content=hilberg |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 July 2012 |title=In Memoriam: Raul Hilberg (1926-2007) |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=19 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his seminal and profound services to the historiography of the Holocaust, he was honored with Germany's [[Bundesverdienstkreuz|Order of Merit]], the highest recognition that can be paid to a non-German.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In 2002, he was awarded the [[Geschwister-Scholl-Preis]] for ''Die Quellen des Holocaust'' (Sources of the Holocaust). He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal life ===
Hilberg had two children, David and Deborah, by his first wife, Christine Hemenway. After his divorce, in 1980 he married Gwendolyn Montgomery. Deborah moved to Israel when she was 18, assumed dual citizenship, and became a specialist  teacher of children with [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]]. She has written memorably of her father's approach to rearing in an article composed on the occasion of the publication of the Hebrew translation of his masterpiece, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Hilberg, [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/my-father-the-holocaust-scholar-the-man-whose-message-israelis-wouldn-t-hear.premium-1.483037 My father, the Holocaust scholar; the man whose message Israelis wouldn't hear,'] at [[Haaretz]] 6 December 2012
&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilberg was not religious, and he considered himself an [[atheism|atheist]]. In his autobiographical reflections he stated, "The fact is that I have had no God."&lt;ref&gt;Raul Hilberg, ''The Politics of Memory: The Journey of a Holocaust Historian,'' Chicago: Ivan R. Dee; 1996, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 interview that addressed the issue of [[Holocaust denial]], he said, "I am an atheist. But there is ultimately, if you don't want to surrender to nihilism entirely, the matter of a [historical] record."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,4150203-101750,00.html "The war on truth"], by DD Guttenplan, ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 12, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; After his second wife's autonomous decision, 12 years into their marriage, to convert from [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalianism]] to [[Judaism]], in 1993, Hilberg began quietly to attend services at [[Ohavi Zedek]], a Conservative synagogue in Burlington.  What he most esteemed, and identified with in his own tradition, was the ideal of the Jew as 'pariah'. As he put it in a 1965 essay, "Jews are iconoclasts. They will not worship idols... The Jews are the conscience of the world. They are the father figures, stern, critical, and forbidding."&lt;ref name=popper /&gt;

Hilberg was the only scholar interviewed for [[Claude Lanzmann]]'s ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', and according to Guy Austin he was "a key influence on Lanzmann" in depicting the logistics of the genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Guy.

== ''The Destruction of the European Jews'' ==
{{main|The Destruction of the European Jews}}

Hilberg is best known for his influential study of the Holocaust, ''The Destruction of the European Jews''. His approach assumed that the event of the Shoah was not "unique". He said in a late interview:&lt;blockquote&gt;'For me the Holocaust was a vast, single event,  but I am never going to use the word ''unique'', because I recognize that when one starts breaking it into pieces, which is my trade, one finds completely recognizable, ordinary ingredients.'&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brown, 'A Holocaust Historian and His "Thirty-year War": Hilberg's Controversial Persona,' in Adam Brown, [https://books.google.it/books?id=wXoKAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 Judging 'Privileged' Jews: Holocaust Ethics, Representation, and the 'Grey Zone','] Berghahn Books, 2013 pp.94-108, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;His final doctoral supervisor, Professor Fox, worried that the original study was far too long. Hilberg therefore suggested submitting a mere quarter of the research he had written up, and his proposal was accepted. His PhD dissertation was awarded the prestigious Clark F. Ansley prize, which entitled it to be published by [[Columbia University Press]] in a print run of 850 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Berger, ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach,'' Aldine Transaction, 2002, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hilberg was firm in desiring that the whole work be published, not just the doctoral version. To obtain this, two opinions in favor of full publication were required. [[Yad Vashem]] as early as 1958, declined to participate in its projected publication, fearing that it would encounter "hostile criticism".&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brown, ibid.p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was duly submitted to two additional academic authorities in the field, but both judgments were negative, viewing Hilberg's work as [[polemic]]al: one rejected it as anti-German, the other as anti-Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Götz Aly, 'Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg ', ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Struggle for publication ===

Hilberg, unwilling to compromise, submitted the complete manuscript to several major publishing houses over the following six years, without luck. [[Princeton University Press]] turned down the manuscript, on [[Hannah Arendt]]'s advice, after quickly vetting it in a mere two weeks. After successive rejections from five prominent publishers, it finally went to press in 1961 under a minor imprint, the Chicago-based publisher, [[Times Books|Quadrangle Books]]. By good fortune, a wealthy patron, Frank Petschek, a [[List of Czech and Slovak Jews|German-Czech Jew]] whose family coal business had suffered from the Nazi [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] program,&lt;ref&gt;Harold James, 'Schwere moralische Schuld,', in ''Die Zeit'' September, 1995 {{cite web |url=http://images.zeit.de/text/1995/09/Schwere_moralische_Schuld |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612203909/http://images.zeit.de/text/1995/09/Schwere_moralische_Schuld |archivedate=2008-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; laid out $15,000, a substantial sum at the time, to cover the costs of a print run of 5,500 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;Götz Aly, 'Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg ', ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; of which some 1,300 copies were set aside for distribution to libraries.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Resistance to Hilberg's work, the difficulties he encountered in finding a U.S. editor, and subsequent delays with the German edition, owed much to the [[Cold War]] atmosphere of the times.  [[Norman Finkelstein]] observed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is hard now to remember that the Nazi holocaust was once a taboo subject. During the early years of the Cold War, mention of the Nazi holocaust was seen as undermining the critical U.S.-West German alliance. It was airing the dirty laundry of the barely de-Nazified West German elites and thereby playing into the hands of the Soviet Union, which didn't tire of remembering the crimes of the West German "revanchists."&lt;ref name=CP&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein]], [http://www.counterpunch.org/finkelstein08222007.html "Remembering Raul Hilberg"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915040640/http://www.counterpunch.org/finkelstein08222007.html |date=2007-09-15 }}, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', August 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German rights to the book were acquired by the German publishing firm, Droemer Knaur, in 1963. Droemer Knaur, however, after dithering over it for two years, decided against publication, due to the work's documentation of certain episodes of cooperation by Jewish authorities with the executors of the Holocaust — material which the editors said would only play into the hands of the [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[right wing]] in Germany. Hilberg dismissed this fear as "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Götz Aly, 'Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg ', ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Some two decades were to pass before it finally came out in a German edition in 1982, under the imprint of a Berlin publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;Raul Hilberg,''Die Vernichtung der europäischen Juden,'' ed. Ulf Wolter, tr. Christian Seeger, Olle &amp; Wolter, Berlin 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Hilberg, a lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voter,&lt;ref name=neumann&gt;{{Citation|last=Neumann |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Neumann |title=In Memoriam: Raul Hilberg |newspaper=[[CounterPunch]] |date=2007-08-15 |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann08152007.html |accessdate=2010-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822060728/http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann08152007.html |archivedate=2009-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; seemed to be somewhat bemused by the prospect of being published under such an imprint, and asked its director, Ulf Wolter, what on earth his massive treatise on the Holocaust had in common with some of the firm's staple themes, [[socialism]] and [[women's rights]]. Wolter replied succinctly: "Injustice!"&lt;ref&gt;Götz Aly, 'Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg ', ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter of July 14, 1982 Hilberg had written to Mr. Wolter/Olle &amp; Wolter, "Everything you said to me during this brief visit has impressed me very much and has given me a good feeling about our joint venture. I am glad that you are my publisher in Germany." He spoke about a "second edition" of his work, "solid enough for the next century".

=== Approach and structure of book ===
''The Destruction of the European Jews'' provided, in [[Hannah Arendt]]'s words, "the first clear description of (the) incredibly complicated machinery of destruction" set up under Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt,''Eichmann in Jerusalem''(1963) rev.ed.1964 p.71&lt;/ref&gt; For Hilberg there was deep irony in the judgment since Arendt, asked to give an opinion of his manuscript in 1959, had advised against publication.&lt;ref name=popper /&gt; Her judgement influenced the rejection slip he received from Princeton University Press following its submission, thus effectively denying him the prestigious auspices of a mainstream academic publishing house.

With a terse lucidity that ranged, with unsparing meticulousness, over the huge archives of Nazism, Hilberg delineated the history of the mechanisms, political, legal, administrative and organizational, whereby the Holocaust was perpetrated, as it was seen through German eyes, often by the anonymous clerks whose unquestioning dedication to their duties was central to the efficacy of the industrial project of genocide. To that end, Hilberg refrained from laying emphasis on the suffering of Jews, the victims, or their lives in the concentration camps. The Nazi program entailed the destruction of all peoples whose existence was deemed incompatible with the world-historical destiny of a pure master race – and to accomplish this project, they had to develop techniques, muster resources, make bureaucratic decisions, organize fields and camps of extermination and recruit cadres capable of executing the ''[[Final Solution]]''. It was enough to chase down each intricate strand of communication over how to conduct the operation efficiently through the enormous archival papertrail to show how this took place. Thus his discourse probed the bureaucratic means for implementing genocide, in order to let the implicit horror of the process speak for itself.&lt;ref&gt;Raul Hilberg, ''The Destruction of the European Jews'' (1961) 1973 Preface p.v&lt;/ref&gt; In this he differed radically from those who had focused heavily on final responsibilities, as for example in the case of predecessor [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s groundbreaking history of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Reitlinger]],''The Final Solution'',1953&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this layered departmentalized structure of the bureaucracy overseeing the intricate policies of classifying, mustering and deporting victims, individual functionaries saw their roles as distinct from the actual 'perpetration' of the Holocaust. Thus,'(f)or these reasons, an administrator, clerk or uniformed guard never referred to himself as a perpetrator.'&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Hilberg made it clear, however, that such functionaries were quite aware of their involvement in what was a process of destruction.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Hilberg's minute documentation thus constructed a functional analysis of the machinery of genocide, while leaving unaddressed any questions of historical antisemitism, and possible structural elements in Germany's historical-social tradition which might have conduced to the unparalleled industrialization of the European Jewish Catastrophe by that country. [[Yehuda Bauer]], a lifelong adversary and friend of Hilberg, who often clashed polemically with the man he considered 'without fault' over what Bauer saw as the latter's failure to deal with the complex dilemmas of Jews caught up in this machinery, recalls often prodding Hilberg on his exclusive focus on the ''how'' of the Holocaust rather than the ''why''. According to Bauer, Hilberg "did not ask the big questions for fear that the answers would be too little"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bauer  | first = Yehuda  | author-link = Yehuda Bauer  | title = A human being without fault  | newspaper = [[Haaretz]]  | date = 2007-10-02  | url = https://www.haaretz.com/1.4978625 | accessdate = 2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, as Hilberg himself says interviewed in Lanzmann's film, "I have never begun by asking the big questions, because I was always afraid that I would come up with small answers."

Hilberg's empirical, descriptive approach to the Holocaust, though it exercised a not fully acknowledged but pervasive influence on the far better-known work of [[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg counted up to 80 passages in Arendt's book taken verbatim or indirectly from his own work. In reviewing her book, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] concluded that "behind the whole of Miss Arendt's book stands the overshadowing bulk of Mr. Hilberg's". See [https://www.thenation.com/article/conscious-pariah/ Nathaniel Popper, "A Conscious Pariah"], in [[The Nation]], March 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; in turn aroused considerable controversy, not least because of its details concerning the cooperation of Jewish councils in the actual procedures of evacuation to the camps.

=== Critical reception ===
At the time, most historians of the phenomenon subscribed to what would today be called the extreme intentionalist position, where sometime early in his career, Hitler developed a master plan for the [[genocide]] of the Jewish people and that everything that happened was the unfolding of the plan. This clashed with the lesson Hilberg had absorbed under Neumann, whose ''Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism'' (1942) described the Nazi regime as a virtually stateless political order characterised by chronic bureaucratic infighting and turf disputes. The task Hilberg set for himself was to analyse the way the overall policies of genocide were engineered within the otherwise conflictual politics of Nazi factions. It helped that the Americans classifying the huge amount of Nazi documents used, precisely, the categories his future mentor Neumann had employed in his ''Behemoth'' study.&lt;ref name = neumann/&gt;

Hilberg came to be considered as the foremost representative of what a later generation has called the [[Functionalism versus intentionalism|functionalist]] school of Holocaust [[historiography]], of which [[Christopher Browning]], whose own life was changed by reading Hilberg's book,&lt;ref&gt;'He read it during a long convalescence from [[mononucleosis]], and it changed his life. "Some people have religious conversion experiences," Browning said at a memorial service for Hilberg; "upon reading Hilberg I had a life-changing academic conversion experience".' Cited [http://www.thenation.com/article/conscious-pariah Nathaniel Popper, 'A Conscious Pariah: On Raul Hilberg,'] April 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a prominent member. The debate is that Intentionalists see "the Holocaust as Hitler's determined and premeditated plan, which he implemented as the opportunity arose",&lt;ref name="Indiana University Press"&gt;{{cite book| page=4 |title=The Holocaust and History: The Known, the Unknown, the Disputed, and the Reexamined | editor1-last=Berenbaum |editor1-first= Michael | editor2-last= Peck |editor2-first=Abraham J. |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana | year=1998 | isbn = 0-253-33374-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while functionalists see "the Final Solution as an evolution that occurred when other plans proved untenable".&lt;ref name="Indiana University Press"/&gt; Intentionalists argue that the initiative for the Holocaust came from above, while functionalists contend it came from lower ranks within the bureaucracy.

It has often been observed that Hilberg's ''magnum opus'' begins with an intentionalist thesis but gradually shifts towards a functionalist position. At the time, this approach raised a few eyebrows but only later did it actually attract pointed academic discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page=24 |chapter= The Holocaust: Where We Are, Where We Need to Go| last=Jäckel |first=Eberhard |title=The Holocaust and History: The Known, the Unknown, the Disputed, and the Reexamined | editor1-last=Berenbaum |editor1-first= Michael | editor2-last= Peck |editor2-first=Abraham J. |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana | year=1998 | isbn = 0-253-33374-1| quote=While in the 1960s and 1970s the stream of historical publications grew steadily, there was still almost no scholarly debate on the Holocaust.  Hilberg certainly had sparked a stormy controversy, which was particularly vehement in Israel but his interpretation, derived from Franz Neumann, was not discussed profoundly by his fellow historians}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further move towards a functionalist interpretation occurred in the revised 1985 edition, in which Hitler is portrayed as a remote figure hardly involved in the machinery of destruction. The terms "functionalist" and "intentionalist" were coined in 1981 by [[Timothy Mason]] but the debate goes back to 1969 with the publication of [[Martin Broszat]]'s ''The Hitler State'' in 1969 and [[Karl Schleunes]]'s ''The Twisted Road to Auschwitz'' in 1970. Since most of the early functionalist historians were West German, it was often enough for intentionalist historians, especially for those outside Germany, to note that men such as Broszat and [[Hans Mommsen]] had spent their adolescence in the [[Hitler Youth]] and then to say that their work was an [[apologia]] for [[Nazism|National Socialism]]. Hilberg was Jewish and an Austrian who had fled to the United States to escape the Nazis and had no Nazi sympathies, which helps to explain the vehemence of the attacks by intentionalist historians that greeted the revised edition of ''The Destruction of the European Jews'' in 1985. &lt;!--Although I can see what's being said here, it's not clear to someone not familiar with these terms why intentionalists could attack the early functionalists as apologists for National Socialism. [It's because intentionalists are part of the propaganda of zionism].--&gt;

Hilberg's understanding of the relationship between the leadership of the [[Third Reich]] and the implementers of the genocide evolved from an interpretation based on orders to the [[RSHA]] originating with [[Adolf Hitler]] and proclaimed by [[Hermann Göring]], to a thesis consistent with [[Christopher Browning]]'s ''The Origins of the Final Solution'', an account in which initiatives were undertaken by mid-level officials in response to general orders from senior ones. Such initiatives were broadened by mandates from senior officials and propagated by increasingly informal channels. The experience gained in fulfilling the initiatives fed an understanding in the bureaucracy that radical goals were attainable, progressively reducing the need for direction. As Hilberg put it in a late interview:

{{quote|As the Nazi regime developed over the years, the whole structure of decision-making was changed. At first there were laws. Then there were decrees implementing laws. Then a law was made saying, "There shall be no laws." Then there were orders and directives that were written down, but still published in ministerial gazettes. Then there was government by announcement; orders appeared in newspapers. Then there were the quiet orders, the orders that were not published, that were within the bureaucracy, that were oral. Finally, there were no orders at all. Everybody knew what he had to do.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Schweber, Debbie Findling, [https://books.google.it/books?id=mco3ldVWNL8C&amp;pg=PT185  ''Teaching the Holocaust,''] Torah Aura Productions  2007 p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In earlier editions of ''Destruction'', in fact, Hilberg discussed an "order" given by Hitler to have Jews killed, while more recent editions do not refer to a direct command. Hilberg later commented that he "made this change in the interest of precision about the evidence [...]." Notwithstanding Hilberg's focus on bureaucratic momentum as an indispensable force behind the Holocaust, he maintained that extermination of Jews was one of Hitler's aims: "The primary notion in Germany is that Hitler did it. As it happens, this is also my notion, but I'm not wedded to it" (qtd. in Guttenplan, p.&amp;nbsp;303).

This contradicts the thesis advanced by [[Daniel Goldhagen]] that the ferocity of German [[anti-Semitism]] is sufficient as an explanation for the Holocaust; Hilberg noted that anti-Semitism was more virulent in Eastern Europe than in the [[Third Reich]] itself. Hilberg criticized Goldhagen's scholarship, which he called poor ("his scholarly standard is at the level of 1946") and he was even harsher concerning the lack of primary source or secondary literature competence at Harvard by those who oversaw the research for Goldhagen's book. Hilberg said, "This is the only reason why Goldhagen could obtain a PhD in political science at Harvard. There was nobody on the faculty who could have checked his work." This remark has been echoed by Yehuda Bauer.

What is most contentious about Hilberg's work, the controversial implications of which influenced the decision by Israeli authorities to deny him access to the [[Yad Vashem]]'s archives,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; was his assessment that elements of Jewish society, such as the ''[[Judenräte]]'' (Jewish Councils), were complicit in the genocide.&lt;ref&gt;"The Germans controlled the Jewish leadership, and that leadership in turn controlled the Jewish community. This system was foolproof. Truly, the Jewish communal organizations had become a self-destructive machine." Raul Hilberg, ''The Destruction of the European Jews,'' (1961) 1973 pp 122-125, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In Amsterdam as in Warsaw, in Berlin as in Budapest, Jewish officials could be trusted to compile the lists of persons and of their property, to secure money from the deportees to defray the expenses of their deportation and extermination, to keep track of vacated apartments, to supply police forces to help seize Jews and get them on trains, until, as a last gesture, they handed over the assets of the Jewish community in good order for final confiscation." [[Hannah Arendt]], ''Eichmann in Jerusalem'' (1963) 1964 p.118&lt;/ref&gt; and that this was partly rooted in long-standing attitudes of European Jews, rather than attempts at survival or exploitation. In his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had to examine the Jewish tradition of trusting God, princes, laws and contracts [...] Ultimately I had to ponder the Jewish calculation that the persecutor would not destroy what he could economically exploit. It was precisely this Jewish strategy that dictated accommodation and precluded resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Raul Hilberg, ''The politics of memory'', pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This part of his work was criticized harshly by many Jews as impious, and a defamation of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Berger, [https://books.google.it/books?id=WRFG-HKoBgEC&amp;pg=PA153  ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach,''] Aldine de Gruyter, New York 2002 p.153.&lt;/ref&gt; His master's thesis sponsor persuaded him to remove this idea from his thesis, though he was determined to restore it. Even his father, on reading his manuscript, was disconcerted.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brown, ibid. p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of his approach, and the sharp criticism it aroused in certain quarters, was such, as he records in the same book, that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has taken me some time to absorb what I should always have known, that in my whole approach to the study of the destruction of the Jews I was pitting myself against the main current of Jewish thought [...] that in my research and writing I was pursuing not merely another direction but one which was the exact opposite of a signal that pulsated endlessly through the Jewish community [...] The philistines in my field are everywhere. I am surrounded by the commonplace, platitudes, and clichés.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brown p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Repatriation''' is the process of returning an asset, an item of symbolic value or a person{{snd}}voluntarily or forcibly{{snd}}to its owner or their place of origin or citizenship. The term may refer to non-human entities, such as converting a foreign currency into the currency of one's own country, as well as to the process of returning [[military personnel]] to their place of origin following a [[war]]. It also applies to diplomatic envoys, international officials as well as [[expatriates]] and [[Human migration|migrants]] in time of international crisis. For [[refugees]], [[asylum seekers]] and [[Illegal immigration|illegal migrants]], repatriation can mean either [[voluntary return]] or [[deportation]].

==Repatriation of humans==

===Overview and clarification of terms===

====Voluntary return vs. forced return====
[[Voluntary return]] is the return of eligible persons, such as refugees, to their [[country of origin]] or citizenship on the basis of freely expressed willingness to such return. Voluntary return, unlike expulsion and deportation, which are actions of sovereign states, is defined as a personal right under specific conditions described in various international instruments, such as the [[OAU Convention]], along with customary international law.

Some countries offer financial support to refugees and immigrants in order to facilitate the process of starting a new life in their country of origin. Examples of 21st century voluntary return include the Danish government, which began in 2009, offering £12,000 each to immigrants to return,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/6533845/Denmark-offers-immigrants-12000-to-return-home.html "Denmark offers immigrants £12,000 to return home"], The Telegraph. November 10, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland offering around 6,500 Francs, targeted for business startups upon returning home,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nigeriaworld.com/feature/publication/ubochi/112809.html "Switzerland and Nigerians Abroad"], Temple Chima Ubochi. ''Nigeria World''. November 28, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; as well Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/15/ireland-pay-immigrants-go-home "Irish government to pay immigrants to go home"], Henry McDonald. ''The Guardian''. November 14, 2009. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Germany in 2016 allocated €150 million over three years for migrants willing to return,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-to-pay-for-migrants-to-go-home-gerd-muller/ "Germany to pay for migrants to go home"], Cynthia Kroet. Politico EU. December 9, 2016. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swedish government began offering £3,500 each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.onenewsnow.com/culture/2016/08/29/thousands-of-migrants-paid-by-swedish-govt-to-leave "Thousands of migrants paid by Swedish gov't to leave"], Michael F. Haverluck. One News Now. August 29, 2016. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 544 Nigerians returned home from Switzerland in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/directdemocracy/returning-asylum-seekers_a-fresh-start-in-nigeria--brought-to-you-by-switzerland/38687662 "A fresh start in Nigeria, brought to you by Switzerland"], Veronica DeVore. Swiss Info. June 6, 2014. Retrieved 9 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This financial support may also be considered as residency buyouts.

Two countries may have a re-admission agreement, which establishes procedures, on a reciprocal basis, for one state to return irregular non-nationals to their country of origin or a country through which they have transited.&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/&gt; [[Illegal immigrant]]s are frequently repatriated as a matter of government policy. Repatriation measures of [[voluntary return]], with financial assistance, as well as measures of [[deportation]] are used in many countries.

As repatriation can be voluntary or forced the term is also used as a euphemism for deportation. Involuntary or forced repatriation is the return of refugees, prisoners of war, or civil detainees to their country of origin under circumstances that leave no other viable alternatives. According to contemporary international law, prisoners of war, civil detainees, or refugees refusing repatriation, particularly if motivated by fears of political persecution in their own country, should be protected from [[refoulement]] and given, if possible, temporary or permanent [[Political asylum|asylum]].&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"&gt;Perruchoud, Richard and Jillyanne Redpath-Cross (eds.), Glossary on Migration, Second Edition, International Organisation for Migration, International Migration Law, No. 25, Geneva, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The forced return of people to countries where they would face persecution is more specifically known as [[refoulement]], which is against international law.

====Repatriation vs. return====
While repatriation necessarily brings an individual to his or her territory of origin or citizenship, a return potentially includes bringing the person back to the point of departure. This could be to a third country, including a country of transit, which is a country the person has traveled through to get to the country of destination. A return could also be within the territorial boundaries of a country, as in the case of returning [[internally displaced persons]] and demobilized combatants.

===Types of human repatriation===

====Medical repatriation====
Repatriation is linked with health care due to the costs and resources associated with providing medical treatment to travelers and immigrants pursuing citizenship. For example, if someone is in the United States with a visa and becomes ill, the insurance that the visa holder has in his or her native country may not apply in the United States, especially if it is a country with universal health care coverage. This scenario forces hospitals to choose one of three options:  
* Limit their services to emergency care only (as per the [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]])  
* Offer charity care free of charge or at a reduced rate  
* Repatriate the patient back to his or her native country where he or she will be covered according to that country's policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wack|first=Kevin J.|author2=Toby Schonfeld |title=Patient Autonomy and the  Unfortunate Choice between Repatriation and Suboptimal Treatment|journal=American Journal of Bioethics|year=2012|volume=12|issue=9|pages=6–7|doi=10.1080/15265161.2012.692444}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Determining which option is the most ethical is often very challenging for hospital administrators.

In some cases, a traveler's personal insurance company is required to repatriate the patient for medical treatment. The method of repatriation could be via regular flight, by ground, or by air ambulance. Medical repatriation is different from the act of [[medical evacuation]].

====Post–World War II====
In the 20th century, following all European wars, several repatriation commissions were created to supervise the return of war refugees, [[displaced person]]s, and [[prisoners of war]] to their country of origin. Repatriation [[hospital]]s were established in some countries to care for the ongoing medical and health requirements of returned military personnel. In the [[Soviet Union]], the refugees seen as traitors for surrendering were often killed or sent to [[Siberia]]n concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fields|first1=Paul|title=Ostarbeiters|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/zvezda/2005/6/po8.html|website=Coffee Lounge|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues surrounding repatriation have been some of the most heatedly debated political topics of the 20th and 21st centuries. Many [[Operation Keelhaul|forced back to the Soviet Union by Allied forces]] in [[World War II]] still hold this forced migration against the [[United States of America]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The term ''repatriation'' was often used by Communist governments to describe the large-scale state-sponsored [[ethnic cleansing]] actions and [[Population transfer|expulsion]] of national groups. [[Poland|Poles]] born in territories that were annexed by the Soviet Union,  although deported to the State of Poland, were settled in the annexed former [[Germany|German]] territories (referred to in Polish as the [[Regained Territories]]). In the process they were told that they had returned to their Motherland.

====Battlefield casualties====
The [[Korean War]] marked the first time that the United States or any nation began returning the bodies of battlefield casualties as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=Sledge&gt;{{cite book |last=Sledge |first=Michael |title=Soldier Dead: How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen |orig-year=First published 2005 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780231509374 |pages=78–80 |oclc= 60527603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Operation Glory]], which followed the [[Korean Armistice Agreement]], thousands of remains were exchanged by both sides.&lt;ref name=Sledge /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not all remains from the Korean War were returned to the home countries. Some 2,300 casualties are buried at the [[United Nations Memorial Cemetery]] in [[Busan, South Korea]].&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of immediately recovering casualties continued for United States during the [[Vietnam War casualties|Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=Sledge /&gt;

===Repatriation laws===
{{See also|Right of Return}}
Repatriation laws give non-citizen foreigners who are part of the titular [[Ethnic majority|majority group]] the opportunity to immigrate and receive [[citizenship]]. Repatriation of their titular diaspora is practiced by most [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic nation]] states. Repatriation laws have been created in many countries to enable [[diaspora]]s to immigrate ("return") to their "kin-state". This is sometimes known as the exercise of the [[right of return]]. Repatriation laws give members of the diaspora the right to immigrate to their kin-state and they serve to maintain close ties between the state and its diaspora and gives preferential treatment to diaspora immigrants.

Most countries in central and eastern Europe as well as [[Armenia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Turkey]] have longstanding repatriation legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|title=Democratic Norms, Diasporas, and Israel’s Law of Return|last2=Rubinstein|first2=Amnon|authorlink2=Amnon Rubinstein|format=PDF|first1=Alexander|last1=Yakobson|authorlink1=Alexander Yakobson|work=ajc.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126182841/http://www.ajc.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/YakobsonRubinstein2005.pdf|archivedate=2010-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Norway]] and [[Serbia]] also have repatriation laws for their diaspora populations. The number of countries with repatriation laws has mushroomed since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of Soviet communism]] and most independent nations that were [[Post-Soviet states|once part of the communist domain]] in [[Europe]] have since legislated repatriation laws. Many other countries such as [[Jordan]] and [[Sweden]] have (or have had) generous immigration policies with regard to the nation's [[diaspora]] without having formally enacted repatriation laws. Such states can be described as practicing ''common law repatriation''.

In comparison, one of the central tenets of the [[Rastafari movement]] is the desirability of the repatriation of [[black people]] from the [[Americas]] and elsewhere back to [[Africa]]. While [[Ethiopia]] specifically has land available in [[Shashamane]] to encourage this project, black people who are citizens of countries outside Africa do not have the [[right of return]] to Africa, although as individuals they are free to try to [[emigration|emigrate]].

===Psychological aspects===
Repatriation is often the "forgotten" phase of the [[expatriation]] cycle; the emphasis for support is mostly on the actual period abroad.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} However, many repatriates report experiencing difficulties on return: one is no longer special, practical problems arise, new knowledge gained is no longer useful, etc. These difficulties are highly influenced by a number of factors including [[Personal development|self-management]], [[Marriage|spouse's]] adjustment, time spent abroad and skill utilisation. What is crucial is that every individual perceives these factors in a different way. Reintegration is a process of re-inclusion or re-incorporation of a person into a group or a process, and may contribute to overcoming repatriation.&lt;ref name="Perruchoud 2011"/&gt;

Direct managers and [[Human resources|HR]] staff often notice the difficulties a repatriate experiences, but they are not always able to act on it. Budget shortcomings and time constraints are frequently cited as reasons why it fails to be an agenda priority. Solutions for repatriation difficulties do not have to be expensive and can lead to great benefits for the company.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Basic support can consist, for example, of good communication in advance, during and after the international assignment, or a mentor program to assist the repatriate. The expatriate and his/her family should feel understood by his or her company. Support can increase job satisfaction, thereby protecting the investment made by the company.&lt;ref&gt;Ripmeester, N. “Handle with care”, ''Graduate Recruiter'', Issue 22 (February) 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repatriation of non-human entities==

===Human remains===
[[Repatriation and reburial of human remains|Return of human remains]] to their nation of origin. In the United States, Native Americans' human remains are uncovered and removed from their burial sites in the construction/land development process or as part of archaeological excavations. The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA) of 1990 established the process whereby federally recognized Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations can request that federal agencies and institutions receiving federal funds return culturally affiliated human remains.  The NAGPRA also sets forth provisions that allow for the disposition of Native American human remains found on federal lands to the affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization.  NAGPRA does not apply to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which is covered under the repatriation provisions of the [[National Museum of the American Indian Act]] of 1989. In previous eras it was common for [[United Kingdom|British]] [[colony|colonial]] authorities to collect heads and other body parts of indigenous peoples such as [[Indigenous Australians]] and [[Māori people|Māori]] for display in British museums. The repatriation of these body parts is currently ongoing.  For an example of a successful body part repatriation, see [[Yagan]]. Another example can be seen through the dedicated work of the Karanga Aotearoa Repatriation Programme, established in partnership between Māori and the New Zealand government in 2003.  This programme is administered by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa (Te Papa), and since 2003 has repatriated over 350 Māori and Moriori ancestral remains to Aotearoa New Zealand. Article 12 of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] affirms that indigenous peoples have the right to repatriate their human remains. The declaration was passed in September 2007 with the support of 143 countries. The four opposing countries—Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States—subsequently endorsed the declaration.

=== Cultural artifacts===
Cultural or [[art repatriation]] is the return of cultural objects or works of art to their country of origin (usually referring to ancient art), or (for looted material) its former owners (or their heirs).

=== Economic repatriation===
Economic repatriation refers to economic measures taken by a country to reduce foreign capital investment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Repatriation of currency===
Repatriation of currency is when foreign currency is converted back to the currency of the home country. An example would be an American converting British pounds back to U.S. dollars. Repatriation also refers to the payment of a dividend by a foreign corporation to a U.S. corporation. This happens often where the foreign corporation is considered a "controlled foreign corporation" (CFC), which means that more than 50% of the foreign corporation is owned by U.S. shareholders. Generally, foreign direct investment in CFC's are not taxed until a dividend is paid to the controlling U.S. parent company, and is thus repatriated. The foreign direct investment income of the CFC is taxed only by the country where it is incorporated until repatriation. At that time, income is subject to the (typically higher) U.S. tax rate minus the Foreign Tax Credits. (FN: See IRC 951-965) There are currently hundreds of billions of dollars of Foreign direct investment in CFC's because of the disincentive to repatriate those earnings. (See Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Economic Accounts, Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts for the United States, available at the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/ni_FedBeaSna/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=1&amp;FirstYear=1999&amp;LastYear=2006&amp;Freq=Year|title=U.S. Department of Commerce.

The ''Reproductive Suppression Model'' argues that "females can optimize their lifetime [[reproductive success]] by suppressing reproduction when future [physical or social] conditions for the survival of offspring are likely to be greatly improved over present ones".&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; When intragroup competition (competition between individuals belonging to the same group) is high it may be beneficial to suppress the reproduction of others, and for subordinate females to suppress their own reproduction until a later time when social competition is reduced. This leads to reproductive skew within a social group, with some individuals having more offspring than others. The cost of reproductive suppression to the individual is lowest at the earliest stages of a reproductive event and reproductive suppression is often easiest to induce at the pre-ovulatory or earliest stages of pregnancy in mammals, and greatest after a birth. Therefore, [[Neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] cues for assessing reproductive success should evolve to be reliable at early stages in the ovulatory cycle.
Reproductive suppression occurs in its most extreme form in eusocial insects such as termites, hornets and bees and the mammalian [[naked mole rat]] which depend on a complex division of labor within the group for survival and in which specific genes, epigenetics and other factors are known to determine whether individuals will permanently be unable to breed or able to reach reproductive maturity under particular social conditions,&lt;ref name=ref4&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Korb | first1 = J. | last2 = Weil | first2 = T. | last3 = Hoffman | first3 = K. | last4 = Foster | first4 = K.R. | last5 = Rehli | first5 = M. | year = 2009 | title = A gene necessary for reproductive suppression in termites | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5928| page = 758 | doi=10.1126/science.1170660 | pmid=19423819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jarosch | first1 = A. | last2 = Stole | first2 = E. | last3 = Crewe | last4 = Moritz | first4 = R.F.A. | year = 2011 | title = Alternative splicing of a single transcription factor drives selfish reproductive behavior in honeybee workers (''Apis mellifera'') | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 108 | issue = 37| pages = 15282–15287 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1109343108| pmid = 21896748 | pmc = 3174643 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Faulkes | first1 = C.G. | last2 = Bennet | first2 = N.C. | year = 2001 | title = Family values: group dynamics and social control of reproduction in African mole-rates | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 184–190 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02116-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooperatively breeding fish, birds and mammals in which a [[breeding pair]] depends on helpers whose reproduction is suppressed for the survival of their own offspring.&lt;ref name=ref7&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koenig | first1 = W.D. | last2 = Mumme | first2 = R.L. | last3 = Stanback | last4 = Pitelka | first4 = F.A. | year = 1995 | title = Patterns and consequences of egg destruction among joint-nesting acorn woodpeckers | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 607–621 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80123-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref8&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hradecky | first1 = P | year = 1985 | title = Possible pheromonal regulation of reproduction in wild carnivores | doi = 10.1007/BF00988206 | pmid = 24309850 | journal = Journal of Chemical Ecology | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 241–250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref9&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Creel | first1 = S.R. | last2 = Creel | first2 = N.M. | year = 1991 | title = Energetics, reproductive suppression and obligate communal breeding in carnivores | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 263–270 | doi=10.1007/bf00175099}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref10&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doolan | first1 = S.P. | last2 = MacDonald | first2 = D.W. | year = 1997 | title = Band structure and failures of reproductive suppression in a cooperatively breeding carnivore, the slender-tailed meerkat (''Suricata suricatta'') | url = | journal = Behaviour | volume = 134 | issue = 11| pages = 827–848 | doi=10.1163/156853997x00179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref11&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garber | first1 = P.A. | year = 1997 | title = One for all and breeding for one: cooperation and competition as a tamarin reproductive strategy | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 187–199 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6505(1997)5:6&lt;187::aid-evan1&gt;3.0.co;2-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref12&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clutton-Brock | first1 = T.H. | last2 = Brotherton | first2 = P.N.M. | last3 = Smith | first3 = R.

==Pre-fertilization mechanisms of reproductive suppression==

===Environmental cues===

====Food shortages (resource availability)====
Female mammals experience delays in the onset of puberty or increase their interbirth intervals in response to environmental conditions that are associated with low abundance and poor quality of foods. Nutritional stress is apparently linked to the female endocrine system and ovulatory [[Pheromone|pheromonal]] cycle. For example, [[Orangutan]]s (''Pongo pygmaeus'') experience high [[ketone]] (due to fat burning) and low [[estrogen]] levels during times of low food availability and poor food quality, but low ketone and high estrogen levels that stimulates onset of the ovulation during the fruit masting seasons that occurs about every four years on Sumatra.&lt;ref name=ref18&gt;Knott, Cheryl 1998 Orangutans in the wild. National Geographic August 1998. http://www.timlaman.com/#/national-geographic-articles/98Aug-Orangutans&lt;/ref&gt;[18]  Since adult female orangutans are solitary, interference by other females can be ruled out as influencing their temporary reproductive suppression and facultatively long interbirth intervals.  [[Polygynandrous]] [[yellow baboon]]s (''Papio cynocephalus'') in Kenya were far less likely to ovulate or conceive during periods of drought or extreme heat, especially if they live in large groups, resulting in longer interbirth intervals during periods of nutritional and thermal stress.&lt;ref name=ref19&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beehner | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Onderdonk | first2 = D.A. | last3 = Alberts | first3 = S.C. | last4 = Altmann | first4 = J. | year = 2006 | title = The ecology of conception and pregnancy failure in wild baboons | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 741–750 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arl006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref20&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beehner | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Lu | first2 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Reproductive suppression in female primates: a review | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 226–238 | doi=10.1002/evan.21369| pmid = 24166923 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High population density====
High population density is one of the environmental factors that can lead to reproductive suppression. When population density is high, subordinate individuals may experience reproductive suppression that they would not have experiences otherwise. For example, when high numbers of yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) females are simultaneously in estrous at Mikumi National Park, Tanzania dominant females form coalitions that attack subordinate females, leading to a disruption in their reproductive cycle and failure to conceive.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; This places constraints on the number of offspring born in a single generation. Since infant mortality in Amboseli yellow baboons depends in part on the number and ages of other infants born into the group, pre-ovulatory females that are most susceptible to stress-induced delay or inhibition of ovulation are the most frequent targets of female coalition attacks. Female attackers are often in advanced stages of pregnancy, and have the most to lose if the number of infants in the group reaches an unsustainable level. A similar study of [[Chacma baboon]]s (''Papio ursinus'') noted high levels of female-female aggression around the mating season when the number of ovulating females was high (indicated by sexual swellings) and that aggression directed toward suppressing the mating opportunities of ovulating females.&lt;ref name=ref21&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huchard | first1 = E. | last2 = Cowlishaw | first2 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Female-female aggression around mating: an extra cost of sociality in a multimale primate society | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 1003–1011 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arr083}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among [[elephant seal]]s (Mirounga) high neonatal mortality occurs when the number of pups born in a season is high, with deaths resulting from injury and starvation.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; To counteract loss of their pups elephant seals conceive next year's offspring immediately after giving birth to this year's young, but delay implantation for 4 months. Female striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) in monogamous social groups do not experience reproductive suppression, but those living in communally breeding groups with high population density and large numbers of old breeding females do.&lt;ref name=ref16 /&gt;

===Social cues===

====Stress induced by aggression from dominant to subordinate individuals====
Chronic physiological stress resulting from aggression by dominant toward subordinate individuals is thought to be a major cause of delayed maturation and suppressed ovulation in subordinate individuals of a wide range of species.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref22&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowman | first1 = L. | last2 = Dilley | first2 = S.R. | last3 = Keverne | first3 = E.B. | year = 1978 | title = Suppression of oestrogen-induced LH surges by social subordination in talapoin monkeys | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 275 | issue = 5675| pages = 56–58 | doi=10.1038/275056a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref23&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnold | first1 = W. | last2 = Dittami | first2 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Reproductive suppression in male alpine marmots | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 53–66 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1996.0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref24&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hacklander | first1 = K. | last2 = Mostl | first2 = E | last3 = Arnold | first3 = W. | year = 2003 | title = Reproductive suppression in female Alpine marmots (Marmota marmot) | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 65 | issue = 6| pages = 1133–1140 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to stress the HPA axis (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis) is activated, producing high concentrations of circulating adrenal glucocorticoids (GC) which, when chronically present, negatively influence an animal's health and can lead to reproductive suppression in male [[marmot]]s (''Marmota marmota''), and blocks of ovulatory cycles of female talapoin monkeys (''Miopithecus talapoin''), meerkats (''Suricata suricatta'') and marmots.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref22 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref23 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref24 /&gt;

In [[cooperative breeding|cooperatively breeding]] meerkats (Suricata suricatta) the dominant breeding female is the oldest and heaviest female who is highly aggressive toward subordinate females during the [[breeding season]] and temporarily evicts subordinate females from the group.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt; Evicted subordinates suffer repeated attacks during the later stages of the breeding female's pregnancy and showed GC levels two times higher than normal. Approximately 3 days after their birth, subordinate females return to the group to help rear the breeding female's pups, at which time the dominant female is no longer aggressive toward them. By inducing the stress response in subordinates the breeding female disrupts the ovulatory cycle and prevents mating of the subordinate females, or causes the pregnancies of subordinates to fail if they do occur. If her social group is small the breeding female evicts all subordinate females, but if it is large she targets older females, pregnant females and non-kin.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt;

However, reproductive suppression through stress does not apply to many species including orangutans for which subordinate males have lower GC levels than dominant ones,&lt;ref name=ref25&gt;Maggioncalda, A.N. &amp; Sapolsky, R.M.

====Pheromonal suppression by breeding female====
Pheromonal suppression of subordinate male and female reproduction is implicated as the mechanism by which dominant breeding pairs suppress the reproduction of non-breeders in communally and cooperatively breeding species, especially in the absence of stress as an explanation.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt; Wolves (''Canis lupus''), coyotes (''Canis latrons'') and hunting dogs ''(Lycaon pictus'') live in packs with a dominant breeding pair that does most of the territorial urine [[scent marking]] in the group. During the breeding season the dominant male urinates over the dominant female's urine, possibly to hide the female's reproductive status from other males. Pheromones in urine are implicated as a possible mechanism to shut down the subordinate's reproductive cycle. Only the dominant pair mate and have young, producing one litter per year. Subordinate females either do not exhibit estrous hormonal changes or they occur irregularly. Occasionally a subordinate animal leaves the pack and forms a new mating pair when it then exhibits of the territorial urine marking and mating behavior that was suppressed when living in the presence of the dominant breeding pair.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;

Yellow, banded and dwarf mongooses live in families similar to wolf packs with scent marking  done almost exclusively by the dominant pair. Dwarf mongooses show synchronous estrous but only the dominant female regularly gives birth.  Subordinate females do not conceive or abort early, but do lactate after the dominant female gives birth and participate in communal nursing. When the subordinate females leave the parental pack they will become fully reproductively active in new groups they help establish. In captivity more than one dwarf mongoose in a group can give birth but the young of subordinates do not survive. However, if the size of their cage is increased and density is lower, reproductive activity of subordinates resumes. As in wolves, pheromonal control over the reproductive cycle of the mongoose is implicated as the mechanism for reproductive suppression.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;
The house mouse (''Mus musculus'') is territorial with a single dominant male marking its territorial boundary with urine while subordinate males do not urine mark.&lt;ref name=ref30&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bronson | first1 = F.H. | year = 1979 | title = The reproductive ecology of the house mouse | url = | journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 265–299 | doi=10.1086/411295}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female's rate of urine marking is elevated in response to a dominant male's urine marking, and his urine contains pheromones that accelerate her ovulation.  The presence of a dominant adult male and his urine are crucial for young females to initiate puberty.  Females isolated from males often do not experience puberty or have unstable ovulatory cycles. Contact with the urine of a dominant female signals a young prepubescent female to delay the onset of puberty. When housed with only an adult male, female mice reach puberty within 25 days, but puberty will not occur until 40–50 days if they are housed with adult females. Being grouped with other females suppresses the young female's serum LH and prolactin. Exposure to the male elevates their LH levels followed by increased serum estradiol. Female mice have a short ovulatory cycle when housed with males and a long cycle when housed with only other females.&lt;ref name=ref30 /&gt;

Queen pheromones are among the most important chemical messages regulating insect societies but are yet to be isolated.&lt;ref name="ref31"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holman | first1 = L. | last2 = Lanfear | first2 = R. | last3 = d'Ettorre | first3 = P. | year = 2013 | title = The evolution of queen pheromones in the ant genus Lasius | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 26 | issue = 7| pages = 1549–1558 | doi=10.1111/jeb.12162| pmid = 23662630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  in natural colonies of the Saxon wasp, ''Dolichovespula saxonica'', queens emit reliable chemical cues of their true fertility, but as the queen's signals decrease incidences of worker reproduction increases.&lt;ref name="ref32"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Zweden | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Bonckaert | first2 = W. | last3 = Wenseleers | first3 = T. | last4 = d'Ettorre | first4 = P | year = 2013 | title = Queen signaling in social wasps | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 68 | issue = 4| pages = 976–986 | doi=10.1111/evo.12314| pmid = 24219699 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonies of ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', the queen can control oogenesis and worker egg laying by regulating concentrations of juvenile hormone (JH) in workers. This is likely achieved through queen pheromones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roseler, P. F.  | year= 1977 | title = Juvenile hormone control of oogenesis in bumblebee workers, ''B. terrestris'' | journal = Journal of Insect Physiology | volume = 23 | issue= 8 | pages = 985–992 | doi=10.1016/0022-1910(77)90126-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social self-inhibition hypothesis====
Game theory is employed to suggest that subordinates suppress their own reproduction to avoid the social cost imposed on them if they reproduce, including expulsion from the group and infanticide against their progeny by dominant breeding individuals.&lt;ref name=ref28 /&gt; Forced dispersal from the group may be extremely dangerous, involving high levels of predation and difficulty finding food and sleeping sites.  In the absence of stress or pheromones as a mechanism, a "self-inhibition"model was proposed that suggests subordinates can choose to inhibit their own reproduction in cooperatively breeding groups in order to remain flexible and share in the group's productivity. When group members are closely related, independent breeding opportunities are poor, and detection of mating and pregnancy is high, subordinates choose to suppress their own reproduction.&lt;ref name=ref28 /&gt;
The self-inhibition model has been applied to female common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). When they are introduced into a new group, female marmosets are immediately subordinate, experience a drop in chrorionic gonadotrophin (CG) and within the first four days and stops ovulating.&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref33&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abbott | first1 = D.H. | last2 = Saltzman | first2 = W. | last3 = Schultz-Darken | first3 = N.J. | last4 = Smith | first4 = T.E. | year = 1997 | title = Specific neuroendocrine mechanisms not involving generalized stress mediate social regulation of female reproduction in cooperatively breeding marmoset mankeys | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 219–238 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1997.tb51923.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subordinate female ovaries are smaller than dominants and secrete little estrogen.&lt;ref name=ref33 /&gt; Older female marmosets are less subject to ovulatory self-restraint and the scent of an unfamiliar dominant female does not affect their ovulation. However, continued exposure to the dominant female may represent a social, rather than biological, cue that causes the subordinates to shut down their ovulation.&lt;ref name=ref33 /&gt;

===Mate guarding===
[[File:Yellow mongoose 1.jpg|thumb|Yellow mongoose 1]]
Limiting access to reproductive partners through mate guarding is a form of reproductive suppression. In the banded mongoose (Mungus mungo) the oldest males have the most offspring. Yet mating in this species is highly promiscuous.&lt;ref name=ref34&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nichols | first1 = H.J. | last2 = Amos | first2 = W. | last3 = Cant | first3 = M.A. | last4 = Bell | first4 = M.B.V. | last5 = Hodge | first5 = S.J. | year = 2010 | title = Top males gain high reproductive success by guarding more successful females in a cooperatively breeding mongoose | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 80 | issue = 4| pages = 649–657 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.06.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older males increase their reproductive success by mate guarding the oldest most fertile females since they cannot guard all the females in the group.&lt;ref name=ref34 /&gt; Therefore, successfully breeding older males are highly selective in their mate guarding and exert mate selection. Mate guarding is also a mechanism of reproductive suppression of subordinates in mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) in which males over the age of 8 mate-guard, with alpha males performing 94% of the mate-guarding and being responsible for siring 69% of the offspring.&lt;ref name=ref35&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Setchell | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Charpentier | first2 = M. | last3 = Wickings | first3 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Mate guarding and paternity in mandrills: factors influencing alpha male monopoly | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 70 | issue = 5| pages = 1105–1120 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.02.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic determinism of reproductive despotism - eusocial insects and the naked mole rat with suppression at birth===
[[Eusociality|Also known as eusociality]]Ovary activation in honeybee workers is inhibited by pheromones from the queen.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt; In the Cape honeybee social parasites that are of the worker caste enter the colony and kill the resident queen, activate their own ovaries and parthenogenetically produce diploid female offspring (thelytoky) – behaviors that are all linked to a single locus on chromosome 13.  The parasites produced queen-like  pheromones falsely signally the presence of a queen suppressing the reproduction of worker's native to the colony and policing or destroying these eggs.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt; Alternative slicing of a gene homologous to the gemini transcription factor of Drosophila controls worker sterility. Knocking out an exon resulted in rapid worker ovary activation. A 9 nucleotide deletion from the normal altruistic worker genome may turn a honeybee into a parasite.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt;
As for many eusocial insects, termite workers are totipotent and rarely produce offspring although they are capable of reproduction when the breeding pair dies. Researchers hypothesized that the gene Neofem2, which is involved in cockroach communication, plays a critical role in queen-worker communication. They experimentally took the king or queen out of the colony. Some workers displayed pre-mating head butting behavior and can go on to become reproductive while others did not. However, when the Neofem2 gene was suppressed butting behavior did not occur, indicating that the gene is essential in allowing the queen to suppress worker reproduction.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt; Neofem2 may play a role in cockroach egg pheromones.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;

Helping to rear the dominant females young may be the only way they can ensure an individual's survival.

==Post-fertilization mechanisms==

===Destruction of eggs including worker policing===
Destroying eggs such that only one female's eggs survive is documented in cooperatively breeding birds such as acorn woodpeckers (''Melanerpes formicivorus'').&lt;ref name=ref7 /&gt; About 25% of acorn woodpecker groups contain two or more joint-nesting females that cooperate to raise young, but cooperative female destroy each other's eggs prior to laying their own. These eggs are eaten by other members of the group, including the mother.
In Cape honeybees (''Apis mellifera capensis'') the multiple mating of the queen and existence of half-siblings creates sub-families within the colony. Sometimes the queen fails to control worker reproduction. In response workers remove eggs laid by other workers leading to less than 1% of offspring being worker laid.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt; Worker Policing of worker eggs occurs in the European hornet (Vespa crabo) honeybees and wasps.&lt;ref name=ref36&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = K.R. | last2 = Gulliver | first2 = J. | last3 = Ratneiks | first3 = F.L.W. | year = 2002 | title = Worker policing in the European hornet Vespa crabro | url = | journal = Insectes Soc. | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 41–44 | doi=10.1007/s00040-002-8277-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref37&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = K.R. | last2 = Ratnieks | first2 = F.L.W. | year = 2001 | title = Convergent evolution of worker policing by egg eating in the honeybee and common wasp | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 268 | issue = 1463| pages = 169–174 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2000.1346| pmc = 1088587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spontaneous abortion===
Social stress and resource limitation can lead to high rates of spontaneous abortion as a mechanism of reproductive suppression. Meerkats subordinate females that have conceived prior to being evicted from the group by the breeding female during the breeding season fail to carry their pregnancies as a result of increased stress (higher GC levels) and reduced access to food and other resources.&lt;ref name=ref12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt; Evicted females regularly copulate with males from neighboring groups Subordinate females have low conception rates and increased abortion rates in response to low food availability and high predation risk.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt; Dwarf mongooses show synchronous estrous but only the dominant female regularly bears young. If subordinate females do manage to conceive they abort the pregnancy.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;

===Infanticide in cooperatively breeding species of subordinate offspring by the breeding female===
[[Infanticide (zoology)|Infanticide]] is a mechanism of reproductive success that occurs in many species. Alpha female dwarf mongooses and African wild dogs kill offpring other than their own, but alpha males do not use infanticide to enforce reproductive suppression.&lt;ref name=ref27 /&gt; This may occur because the breeding alpha may have sired a rare subordinate's offspring. Subordinate females time their rare pregnancies such that they give birth several days after the alpha female to reduce the risk of infanticide.
Pregnant suborordinate meerkats are known to kill the pups of the dominant breeding female.&lt;ref name=ref14 /&gt; No dominant female pups have ever been observed killed after their 4th day of life. Evicted subordinate females are kept out for 3 days after the breeding female gave birth.
Eight infanticides involving the killing of a subordinate female's offspring by the breeding female have been observed in wild common marmosets, as well as two instances of infanticide in which the subordinate female bred and then killed the  breeding female's babies.&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;  Infanticidal marmoset females are often in the last trimester of pregnancy, but postpartum females don't commit infanticide.

===Brood parasitism and quasi-parasitism in birds===
[[File:Senegal Coucal -Centropus senegalensis -on tree.jpg|thumb|Senegal Coucal - ''Centropus senegalensis'' - on tree]]
[[Brood parasite|Brood parasitism]] is the process by which a female lays her eggs in a conspecific female's nest. Parasitic female moorhens (Gallinula chloropus) are known to lay one to six eggs in their neighbor's nests.&lt;ref name=ref40&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McRae | first1 = S. B. | last2 = Burke | first2 = T. | year = 1996 | title = Intraspecific brood parasitism in the moorhen: parentage and parasite-host relationships determined by DNA fingerprinting | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 115–129 | doi=10.1007/s002650050224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases the male paired with the conspecific female has been involved in extra-pair copulations with the parasitic mother. This causes maternity uncertainty for the female as not all species can readily identify their own eggs from another's, which imposes fitness costs of raising an offspring that is not her own. In some cases females will lay eggs in another's nest that were conceived by another male entirely. This process is known as quasi-parasitism and induces fitness costs on both the male and female of the parasitized nest who cannot be certain of paternity or maternity. This is a problem for white-fronted bee-eaters (Merops bullockoides), where it has been found through analysis of enzyme polymorphisms that approximately 9–12% of offspring are unrelated to one parent or none.&lt;ref name=ref41&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wrege | first1 = P. H. | last2 = Emlen | first2 = S. T. | year = 1987 | title = Biochemical determination of parental uncertainty in white-fronted bee-eaters | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 153–160 | doi=10.1007/bf00299728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive strategy of brood-parasitism is not only an intraspecies problem, as parasitic mothers will use the nests of one to 240 different host species.&lt;ref name=ref42&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lanyon | first1 = S. M. | year = 1992 | title = Interspecific brood parasitism in blackbirds (''Icterinae''): A phylogenetic perspective | url = | journal = Science | volume = 255 | issue = 5040| pages = 77–79 | doi=10.1126/science.1553533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fitness costs that these interactions impose strains on host parents to displace time, effort, and resources into offspring that are not their own, and are believed to reduce the hosts reproductive success by up to 50%.&lt;ref name=ref43&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Langmore | first1 = N. E. | last2 = Hunt | first2 = S. | last3 = Kilner | first3 = R. M. | year = 2003 | title = Escalation of a coevolutionary arms race through host rejection of brood parasitic young | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 422 | issue = 6928| pages = 157–160 | doi=10.1038/nature01460 | pmid=12634784}}&lt;/ref&gt; But time lost is not the greatest cost to some host species. Hosts that raise Cuculus and Chrysococcyx cuckoos lose all their offspring as the cuckoos kill them with mandibular hooks.&lt;ref name=ref44&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = N. B. | last2 = Bourke | first2 = A. F. | last3 = de L Brooke | first3 = M. | year = 1989 | title = Cuckoos and parasitic ants: interspecific brood parasitism as an evolutionary arms race | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 4 | issue = 9| pages = 274–278 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(89)90202-4| pmid = 21227369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some other species do not directly kill a hosts' young, they often kill them indirectly through competition for food leading to eventual starvation.&lt;ref name=ref44 /&gt; 
Why then do host species tolerate parasitic offspring? Several hypotheses have been tested to answer this question. One theory known as the quasi-parasitism hypothesis suggested that parasitic females were exchanging extra-pair copulations with host males for access to lay their eggs in the nest. This theory was denounced by DNA fingerprinting revealing that many offspring were sired by only the parasitic mother's mate and not the mate of the host female.&lt;ref name=ref40 /&gt; Another theory was that this interaction fell under kin selection, and that perhaps the parasites and hosts were closely related and there was an inclusive fitness benefit to hosts. While this theory has not been completely denounced in some species like moorhens, it does not fully explain why then interspecific parasitism perseveres.&lt;ref name=ref40 /&gt; The most widely accepted hypothesis is that hosts are deceived and cannot differentiate their own eggs or offspring. The deception model explains a coevolutionary arms race between hosts and parasites that has led to further adaptations in deception and host parasitism defense strategies. Parasitic cuckoos have developed a system for potentially successful parasitism by quickly laying a small mimetic egg during the hosts' laying period.&lt;ref name=ref44 /&gt; Some parasitic mothers go as far to eject the eggs of hosts before laying their own eggs in the nest, which has been suggested to increase the efficiency of which their eggs are incubated and raised, all the while providing them with a meal in the process.&lt;ref name=ref44 /&gt; Brood parasitism has been shown to be a coevolutionary arms race between hosts and parasites with new adaptations of egg recognition being selected for in hosts, and new strategies of trickery and deception being selected for in parasites to exploit hosts.&lt;ref name=ref43 /&gt;

The '''Royal Society of the Humanities at Uppsala''' (''Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskaps-Samfundet i Uppsala'') is a Swedish Royal academy for the study of the humanities.

==Founding==
The society was founded in 1889 by a donation from tannery factory owner [[Jacob Westin]] in Stockholm who gave SEK 50,000 in his will dated 1878 to form a scientific community to further the study of philosophy, philology and history sciences. Westin also donated a large collection of books and manuscripts to [[Uppsala University]] library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khvsu.se/historik/ Kort historik.] Kungl. Humanistiska Vetenskaps-Samfundet i Uppsala. Retrieved 8 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society's statutes were ratified by the Swedish king on 28 March 1896.{{citation required|date=November 2015}}

==Prizes==
The society annually awards a prize to two doctoral dissertations, known as the Westinska prize.

In [[anatomy|anatomical]] contexts, '''salpinx''' is used to refer to a type of tube. Per [[Terminologia Anatomica]], the Latin term "tuba" is usually used to describe most tubes (after the [[Roman tuba]], not the modern [[Tuba]]), but the term "salpinges" and its adjectival derivatives are still sometimes used to describe the following two "tubes":&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|seven/000094332|Salpinx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Fallopian tube]] (as in [[mesosalpinx]], [[salpingitis]] and [[hydrosalpinx]])
* [[Eustachian tube]] (as in [[salpingopalatine fold]], [[salpingopharyngeal fold]], and [[salpingopharyngeus muscle]])

The glowing side is the atmosphere lit up by the Sun's light energy and the oval of light is the aurora. During a substorm the auroral oval brightens in a localized area and then suddenly breaks into many different forms that expand both toward Earth's pole and equator.

[[File:Several NASA Spacecraft Track Energy Through Space.ogv|thumb|Short video featuring commentary by David Sibeck, project scientist for the THEMIS mission, discussing a visualization of [[magnetic reconnection|reconnection]] fronts.]]

A '''substorm''', sometimes referred to as a '''magnetospheric substorm''' or an '''auroral substorm''', is a brief disturbance in the [[Earth's magnetosphere]] that causes energy to be released from the "[[magnetotail|tail]]" of the magnetosphere and injected into the high latitude ionosphere. Visually, a substorm is seen as a sudden brightening and increased movement of [[aurora (astronomy)|auroral arcs]]. Substorms were first described in qualitative terms by [[Kristian Birkeland]]&lt;ref name=NAPE &gt;{{cite book |last=Birkeland |first=Kristian |title=The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902-1903 |date=1908 (section 1), 1913 (section 2) |publisher=H. Aschehoug &amp; Co. |location=New York and Christiania (now Oslo) |url=https://archive.org/details/norwegianaurorap01chririch}} out-of-print, full text online&lt;/ref&gt; which he called polar elementary storms. [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] used the term substorm about 1960 which is now the standard term. The morphology of aurora during a substorm was first described by [[Syun-Ichi Akasofu]] in 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the dispersionless injection boundary associated with substorms | author = Sarris, T. | author2 = Li, X. | last-author-amp = yes | journal = Annales Geophysicae | volume = 23 | pages = 877–884 | date = 30 March 2005 | url = http://lasp.colorado.edu/~lix/paper/AG/Sarris.Li.AG05.pdf|bibcode = 2005AnGeo..23..877S |doi = 10.5194/angeo-23-877-2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The development of the auroral substorm | author = Akasofu, S.-I. | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | date = April 1964 | pages = 273–282 | doi = 10.1016/0032-0633(64)90151-5 |bibcode = 1964P&amp;SS...12..273A }}&lt;/ref&gt; using data collected during the [[International Geophysical Year]].

Geophysical Union|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-87590-030-5|pages=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; are distinct from [[geomagnetic storm]]s in that the latter take place over a period of several days, are observable from anywhere on Earth, inject a large number of [[ion]]s into the [[outer radiation belt]], and occur once or twice a month during the maximum of the solar cycle and a few times a year during solar minimum. Substorms, on the other hand, take place over a period of a few hours, are observable primarily at the [[polar regions]], do not inject many particles into the radiation belt, and are relatively frequent — often occurring only a few hours apart from each other. Substorms can be more intense and occur more frequently during a geomagnetic storm when one substorm may start before the previous one has completed. The source of the magnetic disturbances observed at the Earth's surface during geomagnetic storms is the [[ring current]], whereas the sources of magnetic disturbances observed on the ground during substorms are electric currents in the [[ionosphere]] at high latitudes.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite web | title = Substorms | url = http://www.phy6.org/Education/wsubstrm.html | author = Stern, David P. | author2 = Peredo, Mauricio | last-author-amp = yes | date = 25 November 2001 | accessdate = 21 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substorms can cause magnetic field disturbances in the [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral zones]] up to a magnitude of 1000&amp;nbsp;[[Tesla (unit)|nT]], roughly 2% of the total magnetic field strength in that region. The disturbance is much greater in space, as some [[geosynchronous]] satellites have registered the magnetic field dropping to half of its normal strength during a substorm. The most visible indication of a substorm is an increase in the intensity and size of [[Aurora (astronomy)|polar auroras]].&lt;ref name="Stern"/&gt; Substorms can be divided into three phases: the growth phase, the expansion phase, and the recovery phase.&lt;ref name="image"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pluto.space.swri.edu/image/glossary/substorm.html | title = Substorm | publisher = Southwest Research Institute | accessdate = 24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the THEMIS satellite mission observed the dynamics of rapidly developing substorms, confirming the existence of giant magnetic ropes and witnessed small explosions in the outskirts of Earth's magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;''NASA Spacecraft Make New Discoveries About Northern Lights'' http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/northern_lights.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tatoeba.org''' is a free [[collaboration|collaborative]] online [[database]] of example sentences geared towards [[Second-language acquisition|foreign language learners]].  Its name comes from the Japanese term "tatoeba" (例えば　''tatoeba''), meaning "for example".  Unlike other [[Dictionary#Online dictionaries|online dictionaries]], which focus on words, '''Tatoeba''' focuses on translation of [[complete sentence]]s.  In addition, the structure of the database and interface emphasize [[one-to-many (data model)|one-to-many relationships]]. Not only can a sentence have multiple translations within a single language, but its translations into all languages are readily visible, as are indirect translations that involve a chain of stepwise links from one language to another.

==The aim of the project==
The aim of the Tatoeba Project is to create a database of sentences and translations that can be used by anyone developing a language learning [[application software|application]]. The idea is that the project creates the data, so [[programmer]]s can just focus on [[Computer programming|coding]] the application.

The data collected by the project is freely available under a [[Creative_Commons_license#Types_of_licenses|Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)]] license.

==Content==
As of November 2017, the Tatoeba Corpus has over 6,000,000 sentences in 319 languages. The top 21 languages make up 90% of the corpus. Eighty-five of these languages have over 1,000 sentences. The top 13 languages have over 100,000 sentences each. The [[User interface|interface]] is available in 25 different languages. 

Tatoeba.org is also the current home of the Tanaka Corpus, a public-domain series of about 150,000 English-Japanese sentence pairs compiled by Hyogo University professor Yasuhito Tanaka first released in 2001, and where it is undergoing its latest revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/Tanaka_Corpus |title=Tanaka Corpus |date=3 February 2011 |work=EDRDG Wiki |publisher=Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/wwwjdicinf.html#examp_tags |title=WWWJDIC – Information |date=2 March 2011 |last=Breen |first=Jim |work=WWWJDIC |publisher=Monash University |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual statistic of all languages are found at [https://tatoeba.org/epo/stats/sentences_by_language]

==History==

Tatoeba was founded by Trang Ho in 2006. She originally hosted the project on Sourceforge under the project name "multilangdict".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/multilangdict/|title=Trang's dictionary project|work=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interface==
Users, even those who are not registered, can search for words in any language to retrieve sentences that use them.  Each sentence in the Tatoeba database is displayed next to its translations in other languages; direct and indirect translations are differentiated.  Sentences are [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] for content such as subject matter, [[dialect]], or [[vulgarity]]; they also each have individual comment threads to facilitate feedback and corrections from other users and cultural notes. As of early 2016, more than 200,000 sentences in 19 languages had audio readings. Sentences can also be browsed by language, tag, or audio.

Registered users can add new sentences or translate or proofread existing ones, even if their target language is not their native tongue. However, it is preferred that users translate into their native or "strongest" language and add sentences from their native language rather than translating into or adding from their target language.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wiki.tatoeba.org/articles/show/quick-start&lt;/ref&gt;  Translations are linked to the original sentence automatically.  Users can freely edit their own sentences, "adopt" and correct sentences without an owner, and comment on others' sentences.  Advanced contributors, a rank above ordinary contributors, can tag, link, and unlink sentences. Corpus maintainers, a rank above advanced contributors, can untag and delete sentences. They can also modify owned sentences, though they typically do so only if the owner fails to respond to a request to make the change.

==Database structure==
[[File:Grafeo.JPG|thumb|300px|right|A simplified [[diagram]] of Tatoeba's underlying data structure.]]
Tatoeba's basic [[data structure]] is a series of [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] and links.  Each sentence is a node; each link bridges two sentences with the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.tatoeba.org/2010/02/how-to-be-good-contributor-in-tatoeba.html |title=How to be a good contributor in Tatoeba |work=Tatoeba Project Blog |last=Ho |first=Trang |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''thermal vacuum chamber''' is a [[vacuum chamber]] in which the [[Radiation|radiative]] thermal environment is controlled.

Typically the thermal environment is achieved by passing [[liquid]]s or [[fluid]]s through thermal shrouds for cold [[temperature]]s or through the application of thermal [[Lamp (fixture)|lamps]] for high [[temperature]]s.

Thermal vacuum chambers are frequently used for testing [[spacecraft]] or parts thereof under a simulated [[Outer space|space]] environment.

The '''University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies''' ('''UTIAS''', {{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|t|aɪ|ə|s}} {{respell|yoo|TY|əs}}) is an advanced research facility for [[aeronautics]] and [[aerospace engineering]], located in the [[Downsview]] district of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Established in 1949 by founding Director Gordon N. Patterson, the institute is managed by the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering]] and mainly receives funding from governmental agencies such as the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]], the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] and the [[Canadian space agency|Canadian Space Agency]]. Notable international sponsors include the [[European Space Agency]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], [[Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik]], [[NASA Ames Research Center]] and the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]].

==History==

In 1970, the institute was involved in the emergency rescue of the [[Apollo 13]] astronauts, after the mission was aborted by a major accident en route to the Moon. UTIAS was contacted for assistance due to its expertise in shockwaves and aerospace dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=220 |title=An Account of UTIAS Involvement in the Rescue of Apollo 13 |last=Sullivan |first=Phil |publisher=University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers and scientists at UTIAS calculated the amount of pressure needed to separate the [[Lunar Module]] from the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] without damaging the hatch, allowing the crew to survive the re-entry to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casmuseum.org/common/PDF/pressreleases/CASM_Apollo_13_Release_2010.pdf |title=Canadians celebrate Canada's contribution to the safe return of the Apollo 13 astronauts on 40th anniversary of original space mission |publisher=[[Canadian Air and Space Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the 40th anniversary of the incident in 2010, lunar module pilot [[Fred Haise]] wrote a letter thanking the UTIAS team for its contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiac.ca/success-stories/utias-bringing-apollo-13-home.aspx |title=UTIAS - Bringing Apollo 13 Home |publisher=Aerospace Industries Association of Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523072844/http://www.aiac.ca/success-stories/utias-bringing-apollo-13-home.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=October 2013}} the institute has produced the world's first [[microwave]]-powered aircraft, the world's first engine-powered [[ornithopter]] (both inventions of [[James DeLaurier]]), and Canada's first [[space telescope]], [[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]].  The major expertise areas represented are [[aerospace engineering|aircraft design]], particularly at [[subsonic flight|subsonic]] speeds, [[flight simulation]], space [[mechatronics]] and [[robotics]], [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellite]] technology, [[computational fluid dynamics]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. The institute's partners in the aerospace industry include [[Bombardier Aerospace]], [[MD Robotics]] (formerly [[Spar Aerospace]]) and [[General Atomics]]. It operates the [[Canadian Advanced Nanospace eXperiment Program]] for the study and testing of nanosatellite technology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
