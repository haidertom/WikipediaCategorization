'''Adjustable speed drive''' (ASD) or '''variable-speed drive''' (VSD) describes equipment used to control the speed of machinery. Many industrial processes such as assembly lines must operate at different speeds for different products.  Where process conditions demand adjustment of flow from a pump or fan, varying the speed of the drive may save energy compared with other techniques for flow control.

Where speeds may be selected from several different pre-set ranges, usually the drive is said to be adjustable speed. If the output speed can be changed without steps over a range, the drive is usually referred to as ''variable speed''.

Adjustable and variable speed drives may be purely mechanical (termed ''[[variator]]s''), electromechanical, hydraulic, or electronic.

==Electric motors ==
{{see also|Induction motor|synchronous machine}}
AC electric motors can be run in fixed-speed operation determined by the number of stator pole pairs in the motor and the [[utility frequency|frequency]] of the alternating current supply. AC motors can be made for "pole changing" operation, reconnecting the stator winding to vary the number of poles so that two, sometimes three, speeds are obtained.  For example a machine with 8 physical pairs of poles, could be connected to allow running with either 4 or 8 pole pairs,  giving two speeds - at 60 Hz, these would be 1800 RPM and 900 RPM. If speed changes are rare, the motor may be initially connected for one speed then re-wired for the other speed as process conditions change, or, magnetic contactors can be used to switch between the two speeds as process needs fluctuate.  Connections for more than three speeds are uneconomic.

The number of such fixed-speed-operation speeds is constrained by cost as number of pole pairs increases.  If many different speeds or continuously variable speeds are required, other methods are required.

Direct-current motors allow for changes of speed by adjusting the shunt field current.  Another way of changing speed of a direct current motor is to change the voltage applied to the armature.

An adjustable speed drive might consist of an electric motor and [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] that is used to adjust the motor's operating speed. The combination of a constant-speed motor and a continuously adjustable mechanical speed-changing device might also be called an adjustable speed drive. Power electronics based variable frequency drives are rapidly making older technology redundant.

==Reasons for using adjustable speed drives==
[[Process control]] and [[energy conservation]] are the two primary reasons for using an adjustable speed drive. Historically, adjustable speed drives were developed for process control, but energy conservation has emerged as an equally important objective.

===Acceleration control===
[[Image:Fan Pump and Motors.jpg|thumb|right]]
An adjustable speed drive can often provide smoother operation compared to an alternative fixed speed mode of operation. For example, in a sewage lift station sewage usually flows through sewer pipes under the force of gravity to a wet well location. From there it is pumped up to a treatment process. When fixed speed pumps are used, the pumps are set to start when the level of the liquid in the wet well reaches some high point and stop when the level has been reduced to a low point. Cycling the pumps on and off results in frequent high surges of electric current to start the motors that results in electromagnetic and thermal stresses in the motors and power control equipment, the pumps and pipes are subjected to mechanical and hydraulic stresses, and the sewage treatment process is forced to accommodate surges in the flow of sewage through the process. When adjustable speed drives are used, the pumps operate continuously at a speed that increases as the wet well level increases. This matches the outflow to the average inflow and provides a much smoother operation of the process.

===Saving energy by using efficient adjustable speed drives===
Fans and pumps consume a large part of the energy used by industrial electrical motors. Where fans and pumps serve a varying process load, a simple way to vary the delivered quantity of fluid is with a damper or valve in the outlet of the fan or pump, which by its increased pressure drop, reduces the flow in the process. However, this additional pressure drop represents energy loss. Sometimes it is economically practical to put in some device that recovers this otherwise lost energy. With a variable speed drive on the pump or fan, the supply can be adjusted to match demand and no extra loss is introduced. 

For example, when a fan is driven directly by a fixed-speed motor, the airflow is designed for the maximum demand of the system, and so will usually be higher than it needs to be. Airflow can be regulated using a [[damper (architecture)|damper]] but it is more efficient to directly regulate fan motor speed. Following the [[affinity laws]], for 50% of the airflow, the variable-speed motor consumes about 20% of the input power (Amps).  The fixed-speed motor still consumes about 85% of the input power at half the flow.

==Types of adjustable speed drives==
Some prime movers ([[internal combustion engine]]s, reciprocating or turbine steam engines, water wheels, and others) have a range of operating speeds which can be varied continuously (by adjusting fuel rate or similar means). However, efficiency may be low at extremes of the speed range, and there may be system reasons why the prime mover speed cannot be maintained at very low or very high speeds. 

Before electric motors were invented, mechanical speed changers were used to control the mechanical power provided by water wheels and steam engines. When electric motors came into use, means of controlling their speed were developed almost immediately. Today, various types of mechanical drives, hydraulic drives and electric drives compete with one another in the industrial drives market.

===Mechanical adjustable speed drives===
There are two types of mechanical drives, variable pitch drives and traction drives.

Variable pitch drives are pulley and belt drives in which the pitch diameter of one or both pulleys can be adjusted.

[[Traction drives]] transmit power through metal rollers running against mating metal rollers. The input/output speed ratio is adjusted by moving the rollers to change the
diameters of the contact path. Many different roller shapes and mechanical designs have been used.

===Hydraulic adjustable speed drives===
There are three types of hydraulic drives, those are: hydrostatic drives, hydrodynamic drives and hydroviscous drives.

A [[Transmission (mechanics)#Hydrostatic|hydrostatic drive]] consists of a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor. Since positive displacement pumps and motors are used, one revolution of the pump or motor corresponds to a set volume of fluid flow that is determined by the displacement regardless of speed or [[torque]]. Speed is regulated by regulating the fluid flow with a valve or by changing the displacement of the pump or motor. Many different design variations have been used. A [[axial piston pump|swash plate]] drive employs an [[axial piston pump]] and/or motor in which the swash plate angle can be changed to adjust the displacement and thus adjust the speed.

Hydrodynamic drives or [[fluid coupling]]s use oil to transmit torque between an impeller on the constant-speed input shaft and a rotor on the adjustable-speed output shaft. The [[torque converter]] in the automatic transmission of a car is a hydrodynamic drive.

A hydroviscous drive consists of one or more discs connected to the input shaft pressed against a similar disc or discs connected to the output shaft. Torque is transmitted from the input shaft to the output shaft through an oil film between the discs. The transmitted torque is proportional to the pressure exerted by a hydraulic cylinder that presses the discs together. This effect may be used as a [[clutch]], such at the [[Hele-Shaw clutch]], or as a variable-speed drive, such as the [[Beier variable-ratio gear]].

===Continuously variable transmission (CVT)===
{{main|Continuously variable transmission}}
Mechanical and hydraulic adjustable speed drives are usually called [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]] or [[continuously variable transmission]]s  when they are used in vehicles, farm equipment and some other types of equipment.

===Electric adjustable speed drives===

====Types of control====
Control can mean either manually adjustable - by means of a [[potentiometer]] or linear [[hall effect]] device, (which is more resistant to dust and grease) or it can also be automatically controlled for example by using a rotational detector such as a [[Gray code]]  optical encoder.

====Types of  drives====
There are three general categories of electric drives: [[DC motor]] drives, [[eddy current]] drives and [[Electric motor|AC motor]] drives. Each of these general types can be further divided into numerous variations. Electric drives generally include both an electric motor and a speed control unit or system. The term ''drive'' is often applied to the controller without the motor. In the early days of electric drive technology, electromechanical control systems were used. Later, electronic controllers were designed using various types of vacuum tubes. As suitable solid state electronic components became available, new controller designs incorporated the latest electronic technology.

====DC drives====
DC drives are [[DC motor]] speed control systems. Since the speed of a DC motor is directly proportional to armature voltage and inversely proportional to motor flux (which is a function of field current), either armature voltage or field current can be used to control speed. Several types of DC motors are described in the [[electric motor]] article. The electric motor article also describes electronic speed controls used with various types of DC motors.

====Eddy current drives====
An [[eddy current]] drive (sometimes called a Dynamatic drive, after one of the most common brand names) consists of a fixed speed motor (generally an [[induction motor]]) and an eddy current clutch. The clutch contains a fixed speed rotor and an adjustable speed rotor separated by a small air gap. A direct current in a field coil produces a magnetic field that determines the [[torque]] transmitted from the input rotor to the output rotor. The controller provides closed loop speed regulation by varying clutch current, only allowing the clutch to transmit enough torque to operate at the desired speed. Speed feedback is typically provided via an integral AC tachometer.

Eddy current drives are slip-controlled systems the slip energy of which is necessarily all dissipated as heat. Such drives are therefore generally less efficient than [[AC/AC converter|AC/DC-AC conversion]] based drives. The motor develops the torque required by the load and operates at full speed. The output shaft transmits the same torque to the load, but turns at a slower speed. Since power is proportional to torque multiplied by speed, the input power is proportional to motor speed times operating torque while the output power is output speed times operating torque. The difference between the motor speed and the output speed is called the ''slip speed''. Power proportional to the slip speed times operating torque is dissipated as heat in the clutch. While it has been surpassed by the variable-frequency drive in most variable-speed applications, the eddy current clutch is still often used to couple motors to high-inertia loads that are frequently stopped and started, such as stamping presses, conveyors, hoisting machinery, and some larger machine tools, allowing gradual starting, with less maintenance than a mechanical clutch or hydraulic transmission.

====AC drives====
AC drives are [[Electric motor|AC motor]] speed control systems.

A '''slip-controlled wound-rotor [[induction motor]] (WRIM) drive''' controls speed by varying motor slip via rotor slip rings either by electronically recovering slip power fed back to the stator bus or by varying the resistance of external resistors in the rotor circuit. Along with eddy current drives, resistance-based WRIM drives have lost popularity because they are less efficient than [[AC/AC converter|AC/DC-AC]]-based WRIM drives and are used only in special situations.

Slip energy recovery systems return energy to the WRIM's stator bus, converting slip energy and feeding it back to the stator supply. Such recovered energy would otherwise be wasted as heat in resistance-based WRIM drives. Slip energy recovery variable-speed drives are used in such applications as large pumps and fans, wind turbines, shipboard propulsion systems, large hydro-pumps/generators and utility energy storage flywheels. Early slip energy recovery systems using electromechanical components for [[AC/AC converter|AC/DC-AC]] conversion (i.e., consisting of rectifier, DC motor and AC generator) are termed ''Kramer drives'', more recent systems using [[variable-frequency drive]]s (VFDs) being referred to as ''static Kramer drives''.

In general, a [[variable-frequency drive|VFD]] in its most basic configuration controls the speed of an [[induction motor|induction]] or [[synchronous machine|synchronous]] motor by adjusting the frequency of the power supplied to the motor. [[Image:AF Drive V Hz Etc.png|240px|right]]

When changing [[variable-frequency drive|VFD]] frequency in standard low-performance variable-torque applications using Volt-per-Hertz (V/Hz) control, the AC motor's voltage-to-frequency ratio can be maintained constant, and its power can be varied, between the minimum and maximum operating frequencies up to a base frequency. Constant voltage operation above base frequency, and therefore with reduced V/Hz ratio, provides reduced torque and constant power capability.

Regenerative AC drives are a type of AC drive which have the capacity to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the motor speed (an overhauling load) and return it to the power system.

The [[variable-frequency drive|VFD]] article provides additional information on electronic speed controls used with various types of AC motors.

'''Age-related mobility disability''' is a self-reported inability to walk due to impairments, limited mobility, [[dexterity]] or [[Endurance|stamina]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ward, Rachel E. et al. “Sensory and Motor Peripheral Nerve Function and Incident Mobility Disability.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 62.12 (2014): 2273–2279. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found mostly in older adults with decreased strength in lower extremities.&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"&gt;Guralnik, Jack M., et al. "Lower extremity function and subsequent disability consistency across studies, predictive models, and value of gait speed alone compared with the Short Physical Performance Battery." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 55.4 (2000): M221-M231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]], the population of older adults is expected to increase in the United States by 2030 due to the aging population of the [[baby boomer]] generation; this will increase the population of mobility [[disabled]] individuals in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Feasley, Jill C., ed. Health outcomes for older people: Questions for the coming decade. National Academies, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the importance of being able to predict disability due to inability to walk at an early stage, which will eventually decrease health care costs. Aging cause a decrease in physical strength and in lower extremities which ultimately leads to decrease in functional mobility,&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"/&gt;  in turn leading to disability which is shown to be common in women due to differences in distribution of resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Zunzunegui, M. V., et al. "The mobility gap between older men and women: the embodiment of gender." Archives of gerontology and geriatrics 61.2 (2015): 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The early detection of mobility disabilities will help clinicians and patients in determining the early management of the conditions which could be associated with the future disability. Mobility disabilites are not restricted to older and [[hospitalized]] individuals; such disabilities have been reported in young and non-hospitalized individuals as well due to decreased functional mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Iezzoni, Lisa I et al. “Mobility Difficulties Are Not Only a Problem of Old Age.” Journal of General Internal Medicine 16.4 (2001): 235–243. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the rate of disability causes loss of functional independence &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Hirvensalo, Mirja, Taina Rantanen, and Eino Heikkinen. "Mobility difficulties and physical activity as predictors of mortality and loss of independence in the community‐living older population." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 48.5 (2000): 493-498.&lt;/ref&gt; and increases the risk of future [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuben, David B., et al. "Value of functional status as a predictor of mortality: results of a prospective study." The American journal of medicine 93.6 (1992): 663-669., Manton, Kenneth G. "A longitudinal study of functional change and mortality in the United States." Journal of Gerontology 43.5 (1988): S153-S161., Khokhar, Shafiq R., et al. "Persistent mobility deficit in the absence of deficits in activities of daily living: a risk factor for mortality." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 49.11 (2001): 1539-1543.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- As we have come across the importance of early detection of disability due to inability to walk, the question arises, in which conditions a person has decreased functional mobility or is disabled.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} --&gt;

==Definition==

There are many definitions that contribute in providing the meaning of mobility disability, it is stated as the “self-reports of a lot of difficulties or inability to walk a quarter section|quarter of a mile” &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; without sitting and within time limit of fifteen minutes &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254., Vestergaard, Sonja et al. “Stopping to Rest during a 400-Meter Walk and Incident Mobility Disability in Older Persons with Functional Limitations.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 57.2 (2009): 260–265. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Marsh, Anthony P. et al. “Muscle Strength and BMI as Predictors of Major Mobility Disability in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P).” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 66A.12 (2011): 1376–1383. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to walk within this time frame results in the use of [[mobility aid]] devices such as [[mobility scooter]], [[wheelchair]], [[crutches]] or a [[walker (mobility)|walker]] which will eventually help in the community [[ambulation]]. Another term that is coined to define mobility disabilities based on performance is “performance based mobility disability”.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Noreen et al. “Performance-Based Measures of Physical Function as Mortality Predictors: Incremental Value beyond Self-Reports.” Demographic research 30.7 (2014): 227–252. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the inability to increase your walking speed more than 0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;Tinetti, Mary E., et al. "Shared risk factors for falls, incontinence, and functional dependence: unifying the approach to geriatric syndromes." Jama 273.17 (1995): 1348-1353., Rantanen, Taina, et al. "Coimpairments: strength and balance as predictors of severe walking disability." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 54.4 (1999): M172-M176., Melzer, David et al. “The Apolipoprotein E e4 Polymorphism Is Strongly Associated With Poor Mobility Performance Test Results But Not Self-Reported Limitation in Older People.” The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 60.10 (2005): 1319–1323. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual is unable to walk at &gt;0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, he or she is considered severely disabled and would require a [[mobility device]] to walk in community.

==Risk factors==

There are number of factors that could be associated with [[mobility disability]], but according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], “[[stroke]] is found to be the leading cause of [[mobility disability]], in turn reducing functional mobility in more than half of the [[stroke]] survivors above 65 years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;Mozaffarian, Dariush, et al. "Executive summary: Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2016 update: A report from the American Heart Association." Circulation 133.4 (2016): 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==

There are several measurement scales designed to detect mobility disabilities. The measures that can detect mobility disabilities are classified into two categories, [[self-reported]] measures and performance measures. There is a need to differentiate between these measures based on their ability to detect mobility disabilities, such as differences in their reliability and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].

===Self-reported measures===

Several [[qualitative research]] studies use [[survey (human research)]], [[questionnaires]] and [[self-reported]] scales to detect a decrease in functional mobility or to predict future [[mobility disability]] in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Pruitt, Leslie A. et al. “Use of Accelerometry to Measure Physical Activity in Older Adults at Risk for Mobility Disability.” Journal of aging and physical activity 16.4 (2008): 416–434. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of these [[qualitative research]] scales are easier [[data acquisition]] and can be performed on the larger population. Although there is difference in [[perception]] of condition between subjects (gender difference), type of [[chronic conditions]] and age-related changes such as memory and reasoning, all of which can affect the information and scores of the individual, still [[self-reported]] measures have been used extensively in behavioral and [[correlation]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Baranowski, Tom. "Validity and reliability of self-report measures of physical activity: an information-processing perspective." Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport 59.4 (1988): 314-327.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used [[self-reported]] measures to detect [[mobility disability]] are [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale], [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel index]], [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale]. 
Based on reliability and validity of these scales, [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale] has proven to have excellent [[test-retest reliability]] and [[construct validity]], however, if it can predict future mobility disability in older adults is yet to be found. In contrast, [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel Index]] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale] proved important to predict future [[mobility disability]] based on the activities involved in these [[questionnaire]] scales.

===Performance-based measures===

Mobility disabilities due to age-related [[musculoskeletal]] pain or increase in [[chronic condition|chronic]] conditions are easier to detect by performance measures.  Some commonly used performance measures to detect mobility disabilities are the 400-meter walking test, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.1790010108/pdf 5-minute walk test ], [[walking speed]],  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test]. 
Among these measures, [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400-meter walk test] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] has been proven to be strong predictors of [[mobility disability]] in older adults. In addition to prediction, there is moderate to excellent [[correlation]] between these two tests.&lt;ref&gt;Vasunilashorn, Sarinnapha et al. “Use of the Short Physical Performance Battery Score to Predict Loss of Ability to Walk 400 Meters: Analysis From the InCHIANTI Study.” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 64A.2 (2009): 223–229. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based on reliability and validity of measurement scales to predict [[mobility disability]], [[self-reported]] measures such as [[Barthel index]], and [[performance]] measures such as [http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400 m walk test] and  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] are strongly associated with prediction of mobility disability in older adults.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17061">The '''approximate number system''' ('''ANS''') is a cognitive system that supports the estimation of the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of a group without relying on language or symbols.  The ANS is credited with the non-symbolic representation of all numbers greater than four, with lesser values being carried out by the [[parallel individuation system]], or object tracking system.&lt;ref name="Piazza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M.|title=Neurocognitive start-up tools for symbolic number representations|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=14|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.008|pages=542–551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in early infancy, the ANS allows an individual to detect differences in magnitude between groups.  The precision of the ANS improves throughout childhood development and reaches a final adult level of approximately 15% accuracy, meaning an adult could distinguish 100 items versus 115 items without counting.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sousa|first=David|title=Mind, Brain, and Education: Neuroscience Implications for the Classroom|year=2010|publisher=Solution Tree Press|isbn=9781935249634}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ANS plays a crucial role in development of other numerical abilities, such as the concept of exact number and simple arithmetic.

==History==

===Piaget's theory===
[[Jean Piaget]] was a Swiss [[developmental psychologist]] who devoted much of his life to studying how children learn.  A book summarizing his theories on number cognition, ''The Child's Conception of Number'', was published in 1952.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Piaget's work supported the viewpoint that children do not have a stable representation of number until the age of six or seven.  His theories indicate that mathematical knowledge is slowly gained and during infancy any concept of sets, objects, or calculation is absent.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

===Challenging the Piagetian viewpoint===
Piaget's ideas pertaining to the absence of [[Numerical cognition|mathematical cognition]] at birth have been steadily challenged.  The work of [[Rochel Gelman]] and [[C. Randy Gallistel]] among others in the 1970s suggested that preschoolers have intuitive understanding of the quantity of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and its conservation under non cardinality-related changes, expressing surprise when objects disappear without an apparent cause.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

===Current theory===
Beginning as infants, people have an innate sense of approximate number that depends on the ratio between sets of objects.&lt;ref name="cantlon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantlon|first=JF|title=Functional Imaging of Numerical Processing in Adults and 4-y-old Children|journal=PLoS Biology|year=2006|volume=4|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040125|pmid=16594732|pmc=1431577|pages=e125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout life the ANS becomes more developed, and people are able to distinguish between groups having smaller differences in magnitude.&lt;ref name="hyde2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=DC|title=Near-infrared spectroscopy shows right parietal specialization for number in pre-verbal infants.|journal=NeuroImage|year=2010|volume=53|issue=2|pages=647–652|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.06.030|pmid=20561591|pmc=2930081}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio of distinction is defined by [[Weber–Fechner law|Weber's law]], which relates the different intensities of a [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory stimulus]] that is being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pessoa|first=L|author2=Desimone R.|title=From Humble Neural Beginnings Comes Knowledge of Numbers|journal=Neuron|year=2003|volume=37|issue=1|pages=4–6|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)01179-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of the ANS, as the ratio between the magnitudes increases, the ability to discriminate between the two quantities increases.

Today, some theorize that the ANS lays the foundation for higher-level arithmetical concepts.  Research has shown that the same areas of the brain are active during non-symbolic number tasks in infants and both non-symbolic and more sophisticated symbolic number tasks in adults.&lt;ref name="Piazza3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M|title=A magnitude code common to numerosity and number symbols in human intraparietal cortex.|journal=Neuron|year=2007|volume=53|issue=2|pages=293–305|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These results could suggest that the ANS contributes over time to the development of higher-level numerical skills that activate the same part of the brain.

However, longitudinal studies do not necessarily find that non-symbolic abilities predict later symbolic abilities. Conversely, early symbolic number abilities have been found to predict later non-symbolic abilities, not vice versa as predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Symbolic Number Abilities Predict Later Approximate Number System Acuity in Preschool Children|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0091839|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-03-17|pmc = 3956743|pmid = 24637785|pages = e91839|volume = 9|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0091839|first = Christophe|last = Mussolin|first2 = Julie|last2 = Nys|first3 = Alain|last3 = Content|first4 = Jacqueline|last4 = Leybaert}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adults for example, non-symbolic number abilities do not always explain mathematics achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Non-verbal number acuity correlates with symbolic mathematics achievement: but only in children|journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date = 2011-12-01|issn = 1531-5320|pmid = 21898191|pages = 1222–1229|volume = 18|issue = 6|doi = 10.3758/s13423-011-0154-1|first = Matthew|last = Inglis|first2 = Nina|last2 = Attridge|first3 = Sophie|last3 = Batchelor|first4 = Camilla|last4 = Gilmore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological basis==
Brain imaging studies have identified the [[parietal lobe]] as being a key brain region for numerical cognition.&lt;ref name="Dehaene"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dehaene|first=S|title=Three parietal circuits for number processing.|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=2003|volume=20|issue=3|pages=487–506|doi=10.1080/02643290244000239|pmid=20957581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically within this lobe is the [[intraparietal sulcus]] which is "active whenever we think about a number, whether spoken or written, as a word or as an [[Arabic numerals|Arabic digit]], or even when we inspect a set of objects and think about its cardinality".&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  When comparing groups of objects, activation of the intraparietal sulcus is greater when the difference between groups is numerical rather than an alternative factor, such as differences in shape or size.&lt;ref name="cantlon" /&gt;  This indicates that the intraparietal sulcus plays an active role when the ANS is employed to approximate magnitude.

Parietal lobe brain activity seen in adults is also observed during infancy during non-verbal numerical tasks, suggesting that the ANS is present very early in life.&lt;ref name="hyde2" /&gt;     A neuroimaging technique, [[fNIR|functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy]], was performed on infants revealing that the parietal lobe is specialized for number representation before the development of language.&lt;ref name="hyde2" /&gt;     This indicates that numerical cognition may be initially reserved to the right hemisphere of the brain and becomes bilateral through experience and the development of complex number representation.

It has been shown that the intraparietal sulcus is activated independently of the type of task being performed with the number.  The intensity of activation is dependent on the difficulty of the task, with the intraparietal sulcus showing more intense activation when the task is more difficult.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  In addition, studies in monkeys have shown that individual [[neuron]]s can fire preferentially to certain numbers over others.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  For example, a neuron could fire at maximum level every time a group of four objects is seen, but will fire less to a group three or five objects.

==Pathology==

===Damage to intraparietal sulcus===
Damage done to parietal lobe, specifically in the left hemisphere, can produce difficulties in counting and other simple arithmetic.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Damage directly to the intraparietal sulcus has been shown to cause [[acalculia]], a severe disorder in mathematical cognition.&lt;ref name="cantlon" /&gt;  Symptoms vary based the location of damage, but can include the inability to perform simple calculations or to decide that one number is larger than another.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; [[Gerstmann syndrome]], a disease resulting in lesions in the left parietal and [[temporal lobe]]s, results in acalculia symptoms and further confirms the importance of the parietal region in the ANS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashkenazi|first=S|title=Basic Numerical Processing in Left Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS) Acalculia.|journal=Cortex|year=2008|volume=44|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.08.008|pages=439–448|pmid=18387576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental delays===
A syndrome known as [[dyscalculia]] is seen in individuals who have unexpected difficulty understanding numbers and arithmetic despite adequate education and social environments.&lt;ref name="molko"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Molko|first=N|title=Functional and structural alterations of the intraparietal sulcus in a developmental dyscalculia of genetic origin|journal=Neuron|year=2003|volume=40|issue=4|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00670-6|pages=847–858}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This syndrome can manifest in several different ways from the inability to assign a quantity to Arabic numerals to difficulty with times tables.  Dyscalculia can result in children falling significantly behind in school, regardless of having normal intelligence levels.

In some instances, such as [[Turner syndrome]], the onset of dyscalculia is genetic.  Morphological studies have revealed abnormal lengths and depths of the right intraparietal sulcus in individuals suffering from Turner syndrome.&lt;ref name="molko" /&gt;  Brain imaging in children exhibiting symptoms of dyscalculia show less [[gray matter]] or less activation in the intraparietal regions stimulated normally during mathematical tasks.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Additionally, impaired ANS acuity has been shown to differentiate children with dyscalculia from their normally-developing peers with low maths achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazzocco|first=M.M.M.|author2=Feigenson, L.|author3=Halberda, J.|title=Impaired Acuity of the Approximate Number System Underlies Mathematical Learning Disability(Dyscalculia)|journal=Child Development|year=2011|volume=82|issue=4|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01608.x|pages=1224–1237|pmid=21679173|pmc=4411632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further research and theories==

===Impact of the visual cortex===
The intraparietal region relies on several other brain systems to accurately perceive numbers.  When using the ANS we must view the sets of objects in order to evaluate their magnitude.  The [[primary visual cortex]] is responsible for disregarding irrelevant information, such as the size or shape of the objects.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Certain visual cues can sometimes affect how the ANS functions.

Arranging the items differently can alter the effectiveness of the ANS.  One arrangement proven to influence the ANS is visual nesting, or placing the objects within one another.  This configuration affects the ability to distinguish each item and add them together at the same time.  The difficulty results in underestimation of the magnitude present in the set or a longer amount of time needed to perform an estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chesney|first=DL|title=Visual Nesting Impacts Approximate Number System Estimation|journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|year=2012|volume=74|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another visual representation that affects the ANS is the [[Spatial-numerical association of response codes|spatial-numerical association response code]], or the SNARC effect.  The SNARC effect details the tendency of larger numbers to be responded to faster by the right hand and lower numbers by the left hand, suggesting that the magnitude of a number is linked to a spatial representation.&lt;ref name= "ren"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ren|first=P|title=Size matters: non-numerical magnitude affects the spatial coding of response|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2011|volume=6|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023553|pages=e23553|pmid=21853151|pmc=3154948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dehaene and other researchers believe this effect is caused by the presence of a “mental number line” in which small numbers appear on the left and increase as you move right.&lt;ref name="ren" /&gt;  The SNARC effect indicates that the ANS works more effectively and accurately if the larger set of objects is on the right and the smaller on the left.

===Development and mathematical performance===
Although the ANS is present in infancy before any numerical education, research has shown a link between people's mathematical abilities and the accuracy in which they approximate the magnitude of a set.  This correlation is supported by several studies in which school-aged children's ANS abilities are compared to their mathematical achievements.  At this point the children have received training in other mathematical concepts, such as exact number and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halberda|first=J|title=Individual differences in non-verbal number acuity correlate with maths achievement|journal=Nature|year=2008|volume=455|issue=7213|doi=10.1038/nature07246|pmid=18776888|pages=665–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More surprisingly, ANS precision before any formal education accurately predicts better math performance.  A study involving 3-5 year old children revealed that ANS acuity corresponds to better mathematical cognition while remaining independent of factors that may interfere, such as reading ability and the use of Arabic numerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libertus|first=ME|title=Preschool acuity of the approximate number system correlates with school math ability|journal=Developmental Science|year=2011|volume=14|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01080.x|pages=1292–1300|pmc=3338171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ANS in animals===
{{Main|Number sense in animals}}
Many species of animals exhibit the ability to assess and compare magnitude.  This skill is believed to be a product of the ANS.  Research has revealed this capability in both vertebrate and non-vertebrate animals including birds, mammals, fish, and even insects.&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In primates, implications of the ANS have been steadily observed through research.  One study involving lemurs showed that they were able to distinguish groups of objects based only on numerical differences, suggesting that humans and other primates utilize a similar numerical processing mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merritt|first=Dustin|title=Numerical rule-learning in ring-tailed Lemurs (Lemur catta) |journal=Frontiers in Psychology|year=2011|volume=2|issue=23|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study comparing students to guppies, both the fish and students performed the numerical task almost identically.&lt;ref name="agrillo" /&gt;    The ability for the test groups to distinguish large numbers was dependent on the ratio between them, suggesting the ANS was involved.  Such results seen when testing guppies indicate that the ANS may have been evolutionarily passed down through many species.&lt;ref name="agrillo" /&gt;

==Applications in society==

===Implications for the classroom===
Understanding how the ANS affects students' learning could be beneficial for teachers and parents.  The following tactics have been suggested by neuroscientists to utilize the ANS in school:&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;
*Counting or abacus games
*Simple board games
*Computer-based number association games
*Teacher sensitivity and different teaching methods for different learners
Such tools are most helpful in training the number system when the child is at an earlier age.  Children coming from a disadvantaged background with risk of arithmetic problems are especially impressionable by these tactics.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

Several kinds of '''archaeological remnants of the Jerusalem Temple''' exist, both for the Temple that stood before the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Babylonia]] in 586 BCE, and for the rebuilt Temple that stood until  destruction by [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in the year 70.

==First Temple==

The term [[First Temple]] is customarily used to describe the Temple of the Biblical period, which is thought to have been destroyed by the Babylonian conquest. It is described in the Bible as having been built by King [[Solomon]], and is understood to have been constructed with its [[Holy of Holies]] centered on a stone hilltop now known as the [[Foundation Stone]] which had been a traditional focus of worship in Jerusalem. 

==Archaeology==
Because of the religious and political sensitivities involved, no archaeological excavations and only limited surface surveys of the Temple Mount have been conducted since [[Charles Warren]]'s expedition of 1867–70.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Charles |last=Warren |authorlink=Charles Warren |url=https://archive.org/details/undergroundjerus00warruoft |title=Underground Jerusalem: An Account of Some of the Principal Difficulties Encountered in Its Exploration and the Results Obtained.

* An [[ostracon]] (excavated prior to 1981), sometimes referred to as the [[House of Yahweh ostracon]], was discovered at [[Tel Arad]], dated to 6th century BCE which mentions a temple which is probably the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521227179 |page=397 |author=T.

* A thumb-sized [[ivory pomegranate]] (which came to light in 1979) measuring {{convert|44|mm|in}} in height, and bearing an ancient Hebrew inscription "Sacred donation for the priests in the House of ---h,]", was believed to have adorned a sceptre used by the [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] in Solomon's Temple. It was considered the most important item of biblical antiquities in the [[Israel Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Myre |first=Greg |date=December 30, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/30/international/middleeast/30mideast.html |title=Israel Indicts 4 in 'Brother of Jesus' Hoax and Other Forgeries |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2004, the Israel Antiquities Authority reported the inscription to be a [[forgery]], though the ivory pomegranate itself was dated to the 14th or 13th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4123595.stm |title=Ivory pomegranate 'not Solomon's{{'-}} |publisher=BBC News |date=December 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the report's claim that three incised letters in the inscription stopped short of an ancient break, as they would have if carved after the ancient break was made. Since then, it has been proven that one of the letters was indeed carved prior to the ancient break, and the status of the other two letters are in question. Some paleographers and others have continued to insist that the inscription is ancient, some dispute this so the authenticity of this writing is still the object of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shanks |first=Hershel |title=Fudging with Forgeries |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review |date=November–December 2011 |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=56–58 |authorlink=Hershel Shanks |issn=0098-9444}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another artifact, the [[Jehoash Inscription]], which first came to notice in 2003, contains a 15-line description of King Jehoash's ninth-century BCE restoration of the Temple. Its authenticity was called into question by a report by the Israel Antiquities Authority, which said that the surface patina contained microfossils of [[foraminifera]]. As these fossils do not dissolve in water, they cannot occur in a calcium carbonate patina, leading initial investigators to conclude that the patina must be an artificial chemical mix applied to the stone by forgers.  As of late 2012, the academic community is split on whether the tablet is authentic or not. Commenting on a 2012 report by geologists arguing for the authenticity of the inscription, in October 2012, [[Hershel Shanks]] (who believes the inscription is genuine) wrote the current situation was that most Hebrew language scholars believe that the inscription is a forgery and geologists that it is genuine, and thus "Because we rely on experts, and because there is an apparently irresolvable conflict of experts in this case, [[Biblical Archaeology Review|BAR]] has taken no position with respect to the authenticity of the Jehoash Inscription."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shanks |first=Hershel |authorlink=Hershel Shanks |title=Authentic or Forged?

* By 2006, the [[Temple Mount Sifting Project]] had recovered numerous artifacts dating from the 8th to 7th centuries BCE from soil removed in 1999 by the Islamic Religious Trust (Waqf) from the [[Solomon's Stables]] area of the Temple Mount. These include stone weights for weighing silver and a First Temple period [[bulla (seal)|bulla]], or seal impression, containing ancient Hebrew writing which includes the name ''Netanyahu ben Yaush.'' Netanyahu is a name mentioned several times in the Book of Jeremiah while the name Yaush appears in the [[Lachish letters]]. However, the combination of names was unknown to scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_eng.aspx?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1350 |title=Building Remains From The Time Of The First Temple Were Exposed West Of The Temple Mount |publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority |date=March 13, 2008 |quote=a personal Hebrew seal made of a semi-precious stone that was apparently inlaid in a ring. The scarab-like seal is elliptical and measures c. {{convert|1.1|cm|1|abbr=on}} x {{convert|1.4|cm|1|abbr=on}}. The surface of the seal is divided into three strips separated by a double line: in the upper strip is a chain decoration in which there are four pomegranates and in the two bottom strips is the name of the owner of the seal, engraved in ancient Hebrew script. It reads: לנתניהו בן יאש ([belonging] to Netanyahu ben Yaush). The two names are known in the treasury of biblical names: the name נתניהו (Netanyahu) is mentioned a number of times in the Bible (in the Book of Jeremiah and in Chronicles) and the name יאש (Yaush) appears in the Lachish letters. The name Yaush, like the name יאשיהו (Yoshiyahu) is, in the opinion of Professor Shmuel Ahituv, derived from the root או"ש which means “he gave a present” (based on Arabic and Ugaritic). It is customary to assume that the owners of personal seals were people that held senior governmental positions. It should nevertheless be emphasized that this combination of names – נתניהו בן יאוש (Netanyahu ben Yaush) – was unknown until now. |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shragai |first=Nadav |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=776621 |title=Temple Mount dirt uncovers First Temple artifacts |work=[[Haaretz]] |date=October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2007, artifacts dating to the 8th to 6th centuries BCE were described as being possibly the first physical evidence of human activity at the Temple Mount during the First Temple period. The findings included animal bones; ceramic bowl rims, bases, and body sherds; the base of a juglet used to pour oil; the handle of a small juglet; and the rim of a storage jar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org.il/news40.html |title=Temple Mount First Temple Period Discoveries |publisher=The Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority |accessdate=2009-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Milstein |first=Mati |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/10/071023-jerusalem-artifacts.html |title=Solomon's Temple Artifacts Found by Muslim Workers |work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic News]] |date=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving evidence of the Second Temple==

The term "[[Second Temple]]" describes the temple described in the Bible as having been built after the accession of [[Cyrus the Great]] to the throne of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 559 BCE made the re-establishment of the city of Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple possible.&lt;ref name="Albright 1963"&gt;{{cite book|title = The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey|last = Albright|first = William|authorlink = William F. Albright|year = 1963|publisher = Harpercollins College Div|isbn = 0-06-130102-7|url = https://www.amazon.com/Biblical-Period-Abraham-Ezra-Historical/dp/0061301027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical evidence for the existence of this Temple is extensive. Consecrated in 516 BCE&lt;ref name=MagnessArchaeology/&gt; by the [[Babylonian captivity|exiles]] returning from [[Babylon]] under [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]], it is contained within a far grander edifice. This edifice of the ancient Temple Mount was expanded at least twice more, once under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] and then under [[Herod the Great]], who turned it into one of the largest built structures in the ancient world.&lt;ref name=MagnessArchaeology&gt;''The Archaeology of the Holy Land: From the Destruction of Solomon's Temple to the Muslim Conquest,'' [[Jodi Magness]], Cambridge University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|1139510207}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasmonean expansion===

The [[Hasmonean dynasty]] expanded the 500 cubit square Temple platform toward the south; distinctive Hasmonean ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, Kathleen Ritmeyer, ''Jerusalem; The Temple Mount,'' Carta, Jerusalem, 2015, {{ISBN|9789652208552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herodian expansion===

The massive Herodian expansion produced the Temple of Jesus' time.

====Inscriptions====

The [[Trumpeting Place inscription]] and the [[Temple Warning inscription]] are surviving pieces of the Herodian expansion of the Temple Mount. Both inscribed stones are on display in the [[Israel Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Archaeology in the Israel Museum," eds. Michal Dayagi-Mendels, Silvia Rosenberg, The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2010, p. 111, 112.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jerusalem Temple Warning Inscription.jpg|thumb|Jerusalem Temple Warning Inscription]]
During Temple times, entry to the Mount was limited by a complex set of [[Tumah|purity laws]]. Those who were not of the Jewish nation were prohibited from entering the inner court of the Temple. A hewn stone measuring 60 x 90&amp;nbsp;cm. and engraved with Greek uncials was discovered in 1871 near a court on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem in which it outlined this prohibition:
:ΜΗΟΕΝΑΑΛΛΟΓΕΝΗΕΙΣΠΟ
:ΡΕΥΕΣΟΑΙΕΝΤΟΣΤΟΥΠΕ
:ΡΙΤΟΙΕΡΟΝΤΡΥΦΑΚΤΟΥΚΑΙ
:ΠΕΡΙΒΟΛΟΥΟΣΔΑΝΛΗ
:ΦΘΗΕΑΥΤΩΙΑΙΤΙΟΣΕΣ
:ΤΑΙΔΙΑΤΟΕΞΑΚΟΛΟΥ
:ΘΕΙΝΘΑΝΑΤΟΝ
Translation: "Let no foreigner enter within the parapet and the partition which surrounds the Temple precincts. Anyone caught [violating] will be held accountable for his ensuing death." Today, the stone is preserved in [[Museum of Antiquities, Istanbul|Istanbul's Museum of Antiquities]].

====Walls====

Enormous Herodian lower courses of the massive northern, [[Eastern Wall|Eastern]], [[Southern Wall|Southern]] and [[Western Wall]]s survive.

====Structures beneath the Temple platform====

[[Solomon's Stables]] is a name given in later centuries to an enormous, underground vaulted support structure erected by Herodian engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Soucek, "The Temple of Solomon in Islamic Legend and Art." In ''The Temple of Solomon: Archaeological Fact and Medieval Tradition in Christian, Islamic and Jewish Art''. Edited by Joseph Gutmann. Missoula, MT: Scholars Press,1976, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paving stones====

Swaths of Herodian paving survive ''in situ'' on the Temple Mount is several places.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

==Structures of undetermined antiquity==

The [[Well of Souls]] beneath the Foundation Stone, understood to be extremely ancient, has never been opened to examination by archaeologists by the [[waqf]].

'''BHDL''' is method of correct design of digital circuit. It combines the advantages of [[VHDL]], the well-known language of circuit design, with the power of [[B method]] that guarantees the correct design (w.r.t. a [[formal specification]]). This allows avoiding the design test since it is ”correct by proven construction”.
==Relation between VHDL and B method==
The relation between the abstract machine and the refinement in [[B method]] in a B project seems like the Entity-Architecture relation in a [[VHDL]] project. In BHDL, from an enriched [[VHDL]] notation, the main structure is captured and communicated to the main formal model in order to prove the consistency of the structure and the coherence in relation to the abstract architecture and with the other components of the system.
From the graphical tool, VGUI, the main structure of the system is created. Then, two different notations are generated [[VHDL]] and B. The produced [[B method]] code contains the main features of [[VHDL]] one. After that, design may be separated in relation to the techno-logic choices. For more flexibility, designer may write directly the enriched [[VHDL]] notation.

'''Behavioral modernity'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ravi_Korisettar/publication/263296077_Early_Human_Behaviour_in_Global_Context/links/02e7e53a7f3375f168000000/Early-Human-Behaviour-in-Global-Context.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a suite of behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes current ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from other [[anatomically modern human]]s, [[Hominini|hominins]], and [[primate]]s. Although often debated, most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking, planning depth, [[symbol]]ic behavior (e.g., art, ornamentation, music), exploitation of large [[Game (hunting)|game]], and blade technology, among others.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McBrearty|first1=Sally|last2=Brooks|first2=Allison|date=2000|title=The revolution that wasn’t: a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=39|pages=453–563|doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0435|pmid=11102266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henshilwood|first1=Christopher|last2=Marean|first2=Curtis|date=2003|title=The Origin of Modern Human Behavior: Critique of the Models and Their Test Implications|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=44|issue=5|pages=627–651|doi=10.1086/377665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically. Some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation, social norms, language, and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin.&lt;ref name="Hill et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hill|first1=Kim|title=The Emergence of Human Uniqueness: Characters Underlying Behavioral Modernity|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=2009|volume=18|pages=187–200|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1002/evan.20224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, R. G. 1999. ''The human career: human biological and cultural origins.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the development of these modern behavioral traits, in combination with the climatic conditions of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], was largely responsible for the human replacement of [[Neanderthal]]s and the peopling of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Errico 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Errico|first1=F|title=Neanderthal Acculturation in Western Europe?

Arising from differences in the archaeological record, a debate continues as to whether anatomically modern humans were behaviorally modern as well. There are many theories on the evolution of behavioral modernity. These generally fall into two camps: gradualist and cognitive approaches. The Later Upper Paleolithic Model refers to the idea that modern human behavior arose through cognitive, genetic changes abruptly around 40,000–50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Klein |first=Richard |title=Anatomy, behavior, and modern human origins |journal=Journal of World Prehistory |date=1995 |volume=9 |pages=167–198 |doi=10.1007/bf02221838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other models focus on how modern human behavior may have arisen through gradual steps; the archaeological signatures of such behavior only appearing through demographic or subsistence-based changes.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marean et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marean|first1=Curtis|title=Early human use of marine resources and pigment in South Africa during the Middle Pleistocene|journal=Nature|date=2007|volume=449|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1038/nature06204|pages=905–908|pmid=17943129|bibcode=2007Natur.449..905M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Powell et al 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=Adam|title=Late Pleistocene Demography and the Appearance of Modern Human Behavior|journal=Science|date=2009|volume=324|pages=1298–1301|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1170165|bibcode=2009Sci...324.1298P|pmid=19498164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Premo Kuhn 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Premo|first1=Luke|last2=Kuhn|first2=Steve|title=Modeling Effects of Local Extinctions on Culture Change and Diversity in the Paleolithic|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2010|volume=5|issue=12|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0015582|pages=e15582|pmid=21179418|pmc=3003693|bibcode=2010PLoSO...515582P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

To classify what traits should be included in modern human behavior, it is necessary to define behaviors that are universal among living human groups. Some examples of these [[human universals]] are abstract thought, planning, trade, cooperative labor, body decoration, control and use of fire. Along with these traits, humans possess much reliance on social learning.&lt;ref name="Culture and the Evo Process"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyd|first1=Robert|last2=Richerson|first2=Peter|title=Culture and the Evolutionary Process|date=1988|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226069333|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakahashi 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakahashi|first1=Wataru|title=Evolution of improvement and cumulative culture|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=2013|volume=83|pages=30–38|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2012.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cumulative cultural change or cultural "ratchet" separates human culture from [[social learning in animals]]. As well, a reliance on social learning may be responsible in part for humans' rapid adaptation to many environments outside of [[Africa]].
Since cultural universals are found in all cultures including some of the most isolated indigenous groups, these traits must have evolved or have been invented in Africa prior to the exodus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/15/science/early-voices-the-leap-to-language-510769.html?sec=health&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=leap to language |publisher=New York Times |date=2003-07-15 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Buller | first = David| title = Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature|page=468| publisher = PMIT Press| year = 2005| isbn = 0-262-02579-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/history/070618_morocco_beads.html |title=80,000-year-old Beads Shed Light on Early Culture |publisher=Livescience.com |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/BF/bf02/klein/bf02e3.html |title=three distinct human populations |publisher=Accessexcellence.org |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologically, a number of empirical traits have been used as indicators of modern human behavior. While these are often debated&lt;ref name="Shea 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shea|first1=John|title=Homo sapiens Is as Homo sapiens Was|journal=Current Anthropology|date=2011|volume=52|issue=1|pages=1–35|doi=10.1086/658067}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few are generally agreed upon.

=== Critiques ===

Several critiques have been placed against the traditional concept of behavioral modernity, both methodologically and philosophically.&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shea 2011" /&gt; Shea (2011) outlines a variety of problems with this concept, arguing instead for "behavioral variability", which, according to the author, better describes the archaeological record. The use of trait lists, according to Shea (2011), runs the risk of taphonomic bias, where some sites may yield more artifacts than others despite similar populations; as well, trait lists can be ambiguous in how behaviors may be empirically recognized in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Shea 2011" /&gt; Shea (2011) in particular cautions that population pressure, cultural change, or optimality models, like those in [[human behavioral ecology]], might better predict changes in tool types or subsistence strategies than a change from "archaic" to "modern" behavior.&lt;ref name="Shea 2011" /&gt; Some researchers argue that a greater emphasis should be placed on identifying only those artifacts which are unquestionably, or purely, symbolic as a metric for modern human behavior.&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;

== Theories and models ==
{{Human timeline}}

===Late Upper Paleolithic Model or "Revolution"===

The Late Upper Paleolithic Model, or Upper Paleolithic Revolution, refers to the idea that, though [[anatomically modern humans]] first appear around 150,000 years ago, they were not cognitively or behaviorally "modern" until around 50,000 years ago, leading to their expansion into Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffecker 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffecker|first1=John|title=The spread of modern humans in Europe|journal=PNAS|date=2009|volume=106|issue=38|pages=16040–16045|doi=10.1073/pnas.0903446106|pmid=19571003|pmc=2752585|bibcode=2009PNAS..10616040H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattersall 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tattersall|first1=Ian|title=Human origins: Out of Africa|journal=PNAS|date=2009|volume=106|issue=38|pages=16018–16021|doi=10.1073/pnas.0903207106|bibcode=2009PNAS..10616018T|pmc=2752574}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors note that traits used as a metric for behavioral modernity do not appear as a package until around 40–50,000 years ago. Klein (1995) specifically describes evidence of fishing, bone shaped as a tool, hearths, significant artifact diversity, and elaborate graves are all absent before this point.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt; Although assemblages before 50,000 years ago show some diversity the only distinctly modern tool assemblages appear in Europe at 48,000.&lt;ref name="Hoffecker 2009" /&gt; According to these authors, art only becomes common beyond this switching point, signifying a change from archaic to modern humans.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt; Most researchers argue that a neurological or genetic change, perhaps one enabling complex language, such as [[FOXP2]], caused this revolutionary change in our species.&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tattersall 2009" /&gt;

===Alternative models===
Contrasted with this view of a spontaneous leap in cognition among ancient humans, some authors like [[Alison S. Brooks]], primarily working in African archaeology, point to the gradual accumulation of "modern" behaviors, starting well before the 50,000 year benchmark of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution models.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foley Lahr 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foley|first1=Robert|last2=Lahr|first2=Marta|title=Mode 3 Technologies and the Evolution of Modern Humans|journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal|date=1997|volume=7|issue=1|pages=3–36|doi=10.1017/s0959774300001451}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howiesons Poort]], [[Blombos]], and other South African archaeological sites, for example, show evidence of marine resource acquisition, trade, and abstract ornamentation at least by 80,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marean et al 2007"/&gt; Given evidence from Africa and the Middle East, a variety of hypotheses have been put forth to describe an earlier, gradual transition from simple to more complex human behavior. Some authors have pushed back the appearance of fully modern behavior to around 80,000 years ago in order to incorporate the South African data.&lt;ref name="Foley Lahr 1997"/&gt;

Others focus on the slow accumulation of different technologies and behaviors across time. These researchers&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henshilwood Marean 2003" /&gt; describe how anatomically modern humans could have been cognitively the same and what we define as behavioral modernity is just the result of thousands of years of cultural adaptation and learning. D'Errico and others have looked at [[Neanderthal]] culture rather than early human behavior for clues into behavioral modernity.&lt;ref name="D'Errico 1998" /&gt; Noting that Neanderthal assemblages often portray traits similar to those listed for modern human behavior, researchers stress that the foundations for behavioral modernity may in fact lie deeper in our hominin ancestors.&lt;ref name="D'Errico 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D'Errico|first1=Francesco|title=The Invisible Frontier A Multiple Species Model for the Origin of Behavioral Modernity|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=2003|volume=12|doi=10.1002/evan.10113|pages=188–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; If both modern humans and Neanderthals express abstract art and complex tools then "modern human behavior" cannot be a derived trait for our species. They argue that the original "human revolution" theory reflects a profound Eurocentric bias. Recent archaeological evidence, they argue, proves that humans evolving in Africa some 300,000 or even 400,000 years ago were already becoming cognitively and behaviourally "modern". These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the "human revolution" model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviours in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World.

Between these extremes is the view – currently supported by archaeologists Chris Henshilwood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

Red ochre, body painting, and language: interpreting the Blombos ochre. In R. Botha and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 62-92.&lt;/ref&gt; and others – that there was indeed some kind of 'human revolution' but that it occurred in Africa and spanned tens of thousands of years. The term "revolution" in this context would mean not a sudden mutation but a historical development along the lines of "the industrial revolution" or "the Neolithic revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Mellars, P. A., K. Boyle, O. Bar-Yosef and C. Stringer (eds), 2007. ''Rethinking the Human Revolution: new behavioural and biological perspectives on the origin and dispersal of modern humans.'' Cambridge: McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it was a relatively accelerated process, too rapid for ordinary Darwinian "descent with modification" yet too gradual to be attributed to a single genetic or other sudden event. These archaeologists point in particular to the relatively explosive emergence of ochre crayons and shell necklaces apparently used for cosmetic purposes. These archaeologists see symbolic organisation of human social life as the key transition in modern human evolution. Recently discovered at sites such as Blombos Cave and Pinnacle Point, South Africa, pierced shells, pigments and other striking signs of personal ornamentation have been dated within a time-window of 70,000–160,000 years ago in the African Middle Stone Age, suggesting that the emergence of ''Homo sapiens'' coincided, after all, with the transition to modern cognition and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Henshilwood, C. S. and B. Dubreuil 2009. Reading the artifacts: gleaning language skills from the Middle Stone Age in southern Africa. In R. Botha and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp.  41-61.&lt;/ref&gt; While viewing the emergence of language as a 'revolutionary' development, this school of thought generally attributes it to cumulative social, cognitive and cultural evolutionary processes as opposed to a single genetic mutation.&lt;ref&gt;Botha, R. and C. Knight (eds), ''The Cradle of Language.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further view, taken by archaeologists such as Francesco D'Errico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'Errico | first1 = F | year = 2003 | title = The invisible frontier: a multiple species model for the origin of behavioral modernity | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 188–202 | doi=10.1002/evan.10113}}&lt;/ref&gt; and João Zilhão,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zilhão | first1 = J | year = 2006 | title = Neandertals and moderns mixed, and it matters | url = | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 183–195 | doi=10.1002/evan.20110}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a multi-species perspective arguing that evidence for symbolic culture in the form of utilised pigments and pierced shells are also found in Neanderthal sites, independently of any "modern" human influence.

Cultural evolutionary models may also shed light on why although evidence of behavioral modernity exists before 50,000 years ago it is not expressed consistently until that point. With small population sizes, human groups would have been affected by demographic and cultural evolutionary forces that may not have allowed for complex cultural traits.&lt;ref name="Powell et al 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Premo Kuhn 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Culture and the Evo Process" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakahashi 2013" /&gt; According to some authors&lt;ref name="Powell et al 2009" /&gt; until population density became significantly high, [[complex traits]] could not have been maintained effectively. It is worth noting that some genetic evidence supports a dramatic increase in population size before human migration out of Africa.&lt;ref name="Tattersall 2009" /&gt; High local extinction rates within a population also can significantly decrease the amount of diversity in neutral cultural traits, regardless of cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="Premo Kuhn 2010" /&gt;

Highly speculatively, [[bicameral mind]] theory argues for an additional, and cultural rather than genetic, shift from selfless to self-perceiving forms of human cognition and behavior very late in human history, in the [[Bronze Age]].  This is based on a literary analysis of Bronze Age texts which claims to show the first appearances of the concept of [[self]] around this time, replacing the voices of [[gods]] as the primary form of recorded human cognition.  This non-mainstream theory is not widely accepted but does receive serious academic interest from time to time.

== Archaeological evidence ==

=== Africa ===
Before the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa theory]] was generally accepted, there was no consensus on where the human species evolved and, consequently, where modern human behavior arose. Now, however, African archaeology has become extremely important in discovering the origins of humanity. Since human expansion into Europe around 48,000 years ago is generally accepted as already "modern",&lt;ref name="Hoffecker 2009" /&gt; the question becomes whether behavioral modernity appeared in Africa well before 50,000 years ago, as a late Upper Paleolithic "revolution" which prompted migration out of Africa, or arose outside Africa and diffused back.

A variety of evidence of abstract imagery, widened subsistence strategies, and other "modern" behaviors have been discovered in Africa, especially South and North Africa. The [[Blombos Cave]] site in South Africa, for example, is famous for rectangular slabs of [[ochre]] engraved with [[geometric]] designs. Using multiple dating techniques, the site was confirmed to be around 77,000 years old.&lt;ref name="Henshilwood 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henshilwood|first1=Christopher|title=Emergence of Modern Human Behavior: Middle Stone Age Engravings from South Africa|journal=Science|date=2002|volume=295|issue=5558|pages=1278–1280|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1067575|pmid=11786608|bibcode=2002Sci...295.1278H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beads and other personal ornamentation have been found from Morocco which might be as much as 130,000 years old; as well, the Cave of Hearths in South Africa has yielded a number of beads significantly before 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;

Expanding subsistence strategies beyond big-game hunting and the consequential diversity in tool types has been noted as signs of behavioral modernity. A number of South African sites have shown an early reliance on aquatic resources from fish to shellfish. [[Pinnacle Point]], in particular, shows exploitation of marine resources as early as 120,000 years ago, perhaps in response to more arid conditions inland.&lt;ref name="Marean et al 2007" /&gt; Establishing a reliance on predictable shellfish deposits, for example, could reduce mobility and facilitate complex social systems and symbolic behavior. Blombos Cave and Site 440 in Sudan both show evidence of fishing as well. Taphonomic change in fish skeletons from Blombos Cave have been interpreted as capture of live fish, clearly an intentional human behavior.&lt;ref name="McBrearty Brooks 2000" /&gt;

Humans in North Africa ([[Nazlet Sabaha]], [[Egypt]]) are known to have dabbled in [[chert]] [[mining]], as early as ~100,000 years ago, for the construction of [[stone tool]]s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.promine.com/blog/5-oldest-mines-in-the-world-a-casual-survey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Records2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guinness World Records|title=Guinness World Records 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f896CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27|date=10 September 2015|publisher=Guinness World Records|isbn=978-1-910561-03-4|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
While traditionally described as evidence for the later Upper Paleolithic Model,&lt;ref name="Klein 1995" /&gt; European archaeology has shown that the issue is more complex. A variety of stone tool technologies are present at the time of human expansion into Europe and show evidence of modern behavior. Despite the problems of conflating specific tools with cultural groups, the [[Aurignacian]] tool complex, for example, is generally taken as a purely modern human signature.&lt;ref name="Joris Street 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joris|first1=Olaf|last2=Street|first2=Martin|title=At the end of the 14C time scaledthe Middle to Upper Paleolithic record of western Eurasia|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2008|volume=55|pages=782–802|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.04.002|pmid=18930513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anikovich 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anikovich|first1=M.|title=Early Upper Paleolithic in Eastern Europe and Implications for the Dispersal of Modern Humans|journal=Science|date=2007|volume=315|issue=5809|pages=223–226|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1126/science.1133376|pmid=17218523|bibcode=2007Sci...315..223A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of "transitional" complexes, like "proto-Aurignacian", have been taken as evidence of human groups progressing through "steps of innovation".&lt;ref name="Joris Street 2008"/&gt; If, as this might suggest, human groups were already migrating into eastern Europe around 40,000 years and only afterward show evidence of behavioral modernity, then either the cognitive change must have diffused back into Africa or was already present before migration.

In light of a growing body of evidence of Neanderthal culture and tool complexes some researchers have put forth a "multiple species model" for behavioral modernity.&lt;ref name="D'Errico 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Errico 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abadia 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abadia|first1=Oscar Moro|last2=Gonzalez Morales|first2=Manuel R.|title=REDEFINING NEANDERTHALS AND ART: AN ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE MULTIPLE SPECIES MODEL FOR THE ORIGIN OF BEHAVIOURAL MODERNITY|journal=Oxford Journal of Archaeology|date=2010|volume=29|issue=3|pages=229–243|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0092.2010.00346.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neanderthals were often cited as being an evolutionary dead-end, apish cousins who were less advanced than their human contemporaries. Personal ornaments were relegated as trinkets or poor imitations compared to the cave art produced by ''H. sapiens''. Despite this, European evidence has shown a variety of personal ornaments and artistic artifacts produced by Neanderthals; for example, the Neanderthal site of [[Grotte du Renne]] has produced grooved bear, wolf, and fox incisors, ochre and other symbolic artifacts.&lt;ref name="Abadia 2010" /&gt; Although burials are few and controversial, there has been circumstantial evidence of Neanderthal ritual burials.&lt;ref name="D'Errico 2003" /&gt; There are two options to describe this symbolic behavior among Neanderthals: they copied cultural traits from arriving modern humans or they had their own cultural traditions comparative with behavioral modernity. If they just copied cultural traditions, which is debated by several authors,&lt;ref name="D'Errico 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Errico 2003" /&gt; they still possessed the capacity for complex culture described by behavioral modernity. As discussed above, if Neanderthals also were "behaviorally modern" then it cannot be a species-specific derived trait.

=== Asia ===
Most debates surrounding behavioral modernity have been focused on Africa or Europe but an increasing amount of focus has been placed on East Asia. This region offers a unique opportunity to test hypotheses of multi-regionalism, replacement, and demographic effects.&lt;ref name="Norton Jin 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Christopher|last2=Jin|first2=Jennie|title=The Evolution of Modern Human Behavior in East Asia: Current Perspectives|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=2009|volume=18|pages=247–260|doi=10.1002/evan.20235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Europe, where initial migration occurred around 50,000 years ago, human remains have been dated in China to around 100,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Liu et al. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Wu|title=Human remains from Zhirendong, South China, and modern human emergence in East Asia|journal=PNAS|date=2010|volume=107|issue=45|pages=19201–19206|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1073/pnas.1014386107|pmid=20974952|pmc=2984215|bibcode=2010PNAS..10719201L}}&lt;/ref&gt; This early evidence of human expansion calls into question behavioral modernity as an impetus for migration.

Stone tool technology is particularly of interest in East Asia. Following [[Homo erectus]] migrations out of Africa, [[Acheulean]] technology never seems to appear beyond present-day India and into China. Analogously, Mode 3, or [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] technology, is not apparent in China following later hominin dispersals.&lt;ref name="Norton Bae 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Christopher|last2=Bae|first2=K.|title=The Movius Line sensu lato (Norton et al. 2006) further assessed and defined|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2008|volume=55|pages=1148–1150|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of more advanced technology has been explained by serial founder effects and low population densities out of Africa.&lt;ref name="Lycett Norton 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lycett|first1=Stephen|last2=Norton|first2=Christopher|title=A demographic model for Palaeolithic technological evolution: The case of East Asia and the Movius Line|journal=Quaternary International|date=2010|volume=211|pages=55–65|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2008.12.001|bibcode=2010QuInt.211...55L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although tool complexes comparative to Europe are missing or fragmentary, other archaeological evidence shows behavioral modernity. For example, the peopling of the Japanese archipelago offers an opportunity to investigate the early use of watercraft. Although one site, Kanedori in Honshu, does suggest the use of watercraft as early as 84,000 years ago, there is no other evidence of hominins in Japan until 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Norton Jin 2009" /&gt;

The [[Zhoukoudian]] cave system near Beijing has been excavated since the 1930s and has yielded precious data on early human behavior in East Asia. Although disputed, there is evidence of possible human burials and interred remains in the cave dated to around 34-20,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Norton Jin 2009" /&gt; These remains have associated personal ornaments in the form of beads and worked shell, suggesting symbolic behavior. Along with possible burials, numerous other symbolic objects like punctured animal teeth and beads, some dyed in red [[ochre]], have all been found at Zhoukoudian.&lt;ref name="Norton Jin 2009" /&gt; Although fragmentary, the archaeological record of eastern Asia shows evidence of behavioral modernity before 50,000 years ago but, like the African record, it is not fully apparent until that time.

[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|303px|As the temperature of a black body decreases, its intensity also decreases and it moves to longer wavelengths. Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]

A '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical body]] that absorbs all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or angle of incidence.  A '''white body''' is one with a "rough surface [that] reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[Frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.

An ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:&lt;ref name=Massoud/&gt;
#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.
#It is a diffuse emitter: the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.

An approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large enclosure. Any light entering the hole is reflected within the internal surface of the body indefinitely or absorbed within the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. The radiation confined in such an enclosure may or may not be in thermal equilibrium, depending upon the nature of the walls and the other contents of the enclosure.&lt;ref name=Landsberg/&gt;&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 44"&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, §52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real materials emit energy at a fraction—called the [[emissivity]]—of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&amp;epsilon;'' {{=}} 1.0}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.&lt;ref name=emissivity/&gt;&lt;ref name=gray_body/&gt;
Construction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.&lt;ref name=Chun/&gt;

In [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.

==Definition==
The idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:
{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.&lt;ref name=Kirchhoff/&gt;}}

A more modern definition drops the reference to "infinitely small thicknesses":&lt;ref name=infinitesimal/&gt;
{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt;}}

==Idealizations==
This section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.

[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]

===Cavity with a hole===
A widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt;  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface — in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is longer than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.&lt;ref name=Zee/&gt;

Suppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.&lt;ref name=Zee/&gt; See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.

At any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,&lt;ref name="Adkins"/&gt; although the time it takes to do so may be very long.&lt;ref name=Batrouni/&gt; Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.&lt;ref name=Landsberg/&gt;&lt;ref name="Planck 1914 44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; Radiation entering the cavity will be "[[H-theorem|thermalized]]"; by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]]. The time taken for thermalization is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas.  At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct [[Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian|photon–photon interactions]]&lt;ref name=Karplus&gt;Robert Karplus* and Maurice Neuman ,"The Scattering of Light by Light", Phys. Rev. 83, 776–784 (1951)&lt;/ref&gt; are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter.&lt;ref name=Bergmann/&gt; Photons are an example of an interacting [[boson]] gas,&lt;ref name=boson/&gt; and as described by the [[H-theorem]],&lt;ref name=Tolman/&gt; under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.

===Transmission, absorption, and reflection===
A body's behavior with regard to thermal radiation is characterized by its transmission τ, absorption α, and reflection ρ.
 
The boundary of a body forms an interface with its surroundings, and this interface may be rough or smooth. A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.&lt;ref name=Tipler/&gt; A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:

An opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.&lt;ref name=Kaviany/&gt;&lt;ref name=Venkanna/&gt; That is, τ=0 and α+ρ=1

A transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, τ=1 and α=ρ=0.

A gray body is one where α, ρ and τ are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which α is temperature and wavelength independent.

A white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: τ=0, α=0, and ρ=1.

For a black body, τ=0, α=1, and ρ=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===

Kirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon scattering to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9–10, §10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirchhoff 1860c"&gt;{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Realizations==
A realization of a black body is a real world, physical embodiment. Here are a few.

===Cavity with a hole===

In 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.&lt;ref name=Rechenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Hohlraum]].

===Near-black materials===
There is interest in blackbody-like materials for [[camouflage]] and [[radar-absorbent material]]s for radar invisibility.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quinn/&gt; They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable.&lt;ref name=Mizuno/&gt; They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.

It has long been known that a [[lamp-black]] coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.&lt;ref name=Chun/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yang/&gt; In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]]. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.&lt;ref name=Mizuno/&gt;

Other examples of nearly perfect black materials are [[super black]], prepared by chemically etching a [[nickel]]–[[phosphorus]] [[alloy]],&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; and [[vantablack]] made of carbon nanotubes; both absorb 99.9% of light or more.

===Stars and planets===
{{For| more about the UBV color index|Photometric system}}

[[File:Idealized photosphere.png|thumb|An idealized view of the cross-section of a star. The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]

A star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].&lt;ref name=UBV/&gt;]]

Using this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,&lt;ref name=Kelley/&gt; with the Sun having an index of +0.648 ± 0.006.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt; Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.&lt;ref name=Golay/&gt; The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.&lt;ref name=Aller/&gt; For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt; which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.&lt;ref name=Bertotti/&gt;

===Black holes===
{{See also|Hawking radiation}}
A [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called "black" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body&lt;ref name=Schutz/&gt; (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the radius of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies).&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt; Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit radiation with a nearly perfect [[black-body radiation|black-body]] spectrum, ultimately [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporating]].&lt;ref name=Wald/&gt; The mechanism for this emission is related to [[vacuum fluctuations]] in which a [[virtual particles|virtual pair]] of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted.&lt;ref name=Carr/&gt; The energy distribution of emission is described by [[Planck's law]] with a temperature ''T'':
:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac {\hbar c^3}{8\pi Gk_BM} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], ℏ is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and ''M'' is the mass of the black hole.&lt;ref name=Frolov/&gt; These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.&lt;ref name=Wald2/&gt;

===Cosmic microwave background radiation===
{{See also|Big Bang|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}
The big bang theory is based upon the [[cosmological principle]], which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.  According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is "the most perfect black body ever measured in nature".&lt;ref name=White/&gt; It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&amp;thinsp;K.  It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.

==Radiative cooling==
[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|250px|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's displacement law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &amp;ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&amp;#178; radiant exitance]]
{{See also|Radiative cooling|Radiosity (heat transfer)}}
The integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature ''T'', and is known as the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P/A = \sigma T^4 \ , &lt;/math&gt;
where ''&amp;sigma;'' is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]], {{nowrap|''&amp;sigma;'' &amp;asymp; 5.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;8&lt;/sup&gt; W/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=NIST/&gt;}} To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature ''T'', the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of [[power (physics)|power]] P over the given area A.

The cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan–Boltzmann law supplemented with a "gray body" [[emissivity]] {{nowrap|''&amp;epsilon; ≤ 1''}}  {{nowrap|(''P/A'' &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''&amp;epsilon;&amp;sigma;T''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).}}  The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's [[heat capacity]].&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt; This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, [[phase transition]]s or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,&lt;ref name=Vollmer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Champion/&gt; and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.&lt;ref name=Shifman/&gt;

If a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan–Boltzmann law and its power emission ''P'' and temperature ''T'' are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10&amp;nbsp;km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured.&lt;ref name=Lewin/&gt; It should be noted that an accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.&lt;ref name=Mason/&gt;

&lt;ref name=emissivity&gt;
The emissivity of a surface in principle depends upon frequency, angle of view, and temperature. However,  by definition, the radiation from a ''gray body'' is simply proportional to that of a black body at the same temperature, so its emissivity does not depend upon frequency (or, equivalently, wavelength).

The '''Bureau of Economic Analysis''' ('''BEA''') of the [[United States Department of Commerce]] is a U.S. government agency that provides official [[economy of the United States|macroeconomic and industry]] statistics, most notably reports about the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the [[United States]] and its various units—states, cities/towns/townships/villages/counties and metropolitan areas.  They also provide information about personal income, corporate profits, and government spending in their [[National Income and Product Accounts]] (NIPAs).

Established in 1972 under the administration of 37th President [[Richard M. Nixon]] after a government agencies reorganization and reshuffling from older previous bureaus, the BEA is part of the [[Economics and Statistics Administration]] in the presidential cabinet level [[United States Department of Commerce]] and is one of the principal agencies of the [[Federal Statistical System of the United States|U.S. Federal Statistical System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/glance.htm |title=U.S. Economy at a Glance|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis | accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated mission is to "promote a better understanding of the U.S. economy by providing the most timely, relevant, and accurate economic data in an objective and cost-effective manner".&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/about/mission.htm|title=BEA: Mission, Vision, and Values|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BEA has about 500 employees and an annual budget of approximately $96.5 million.&lt;ref name="OMB-FY13-StatSystemReport"&gt;''[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/information_and_regulatory_affairs/13statprog.pdf Statistical Programs of the United States Government] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419180809/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/information_and_regulatory_affairs/13statprog.pdf# |date=2013-04-19 }}''. [[Office of Management and Budget]]. November 26, 2012.  Pages 5 and 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== National accounts ==
BEA's national economic statistics (National Economic Accounts) provide a comprehensive view of U.S. production, consumption, investment, exports and imports, and income and saving. These statistics are best known by summary measures such as gross domestic product (GDP), corporate profits, personal income and spending, and personal saving.

The National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs) provide information about personal income, corporate profits, government spending, fixed assets, and changes in the net worth of the U.S. Economy.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). {{Cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/about/pdf/bea-accounts.pdf|title=BEA Economic Accounts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}} 6/21/2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The accounts also include other approaches and methods of measuring income and spending, such as the [[gross domestic income]] (GDI) and [[gross national income]] (GNI).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. {{Cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipa_primer.pdf|title=Measuring the Economy.  Primer on GDP and the National Income and Product Accounts.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}} December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry accounts ==
The industry economic accounts, presented both in an input-output framework and as annual output by each industry, provide a detailed view of the interrelationships between U.S. producers and users and the contribution to production across industries. These accounts are used extensively by policymakers and businesses to understand industry interactions, productivity trends, and the changing structure of the U.S. economy.

There are quarterly and annual reports for "GDP by Industry Accounts", designed for analysis of a specific industry's contribution to overall economic growth and inflation.

== Regional Economic Accounts ==
The regional economic accounts provide information about the geographic distribution of U.S. economic activity and growth. The estimates of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) by state and state and local area [[personal income]] (PI), and the accompanying detail, provide a consistent framework for analyzing and comparing individual state and local area economies.&lt;ref name="Dept of Commerce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Economic Accounts: About Regional|url=https://www.bea.gov/regional/about.cfm|publisher=US Department of Commerce|accessdate=4 April 2018|language=EN-US}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uses of the regional program estimates ===
* The Federal government uses regional income and product estimates to distribute funds to states:
** BEA Regional Income and Product Account Estimates Used to Distribute $406.8 Billion in Federal Funds 
** FY2016 Federal Funds Distribution Using BEA Regional Income and Product Account Statistics
** Federal Uses of BEA Regional Statistics, FY2016
* Twenty-six states have set constitutional or statutory limits on state government revenues or spending that are tied to BEA state personal income or one of its components 
* The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) produces statistics for coastal areas, utilizing BEA regional statistics.
* Academic researchers use the estimates for applied economic research.
* Businesses, trade associations, and labor organizations use the estimates for market research.&lt;ref name="Dept of Commerce"/&gt;

=== BEA User Group Program ===
The regional program maintains a partnership with a group of users named the BEA User Group. The members of this group include State agencies, universities, and Census Primary State Data Centers. The BEA User Group disseminates regional data and gives feedback on our estimates and the presentation of the estimates. Distribution in this way encourages State universities and State agencies to use data that are comparable for all States and counties and consistent with national totals, thus enhancing the uniformity of analytic approaches taken in economic development programs and improving the recipients' ability to assess local area economic developments and to service their local clientele.&lt;ref name="Dept of Commerce"/&gt;

== International ==
The international transactions accounts provide information on trade in goods and services (including the balance of payments and the balance of trade), investment income, and government and private financial flows. In addition, the accounts measure the value of U.S. international assets and liabilities and direct investment by multinational enterprises. BEA’s data on direct investment— the most detailed data set on the activities of multinational enterprises (MNEs) available—are used to assess the role these business enterprises play in the global economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8142">'''The Cambridge English Corpus''' (formerly the Cambridge International Corpus) is a multi-billion word corpus of [[English language]] (containing both [[text corpus]] and spoken corpus data). The Cambridge English Corpus (CEC) contains data from a number of sources including written and spoken, British and American English. The CEC also contains the Cambridge Learner Corpus, a 40m word corpus made up from English exam responses written by English language learners.

The Cambridge English Corpus is used to inform Cambridge University Press [[English Language Teaching]] publications as well as for research in [[corpus linguistics]]. Access is currently restricted to authors and researchers working on projects and publications for [[Cambridge University Press]], and researchers at [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge International Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3637700/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-International-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt;

== Written Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains instances of modern written English, taken from newspapers, magazines, novels, letters, emails, textbooks, websites, and many other sources.

== Spoken Data ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a wide variety of spoken English language, taken from many sources, including everyday conversations, telephone calls, radio broadcasts, presentations, speeches, meetings, TV programmes and lectures.

== Cambridge Learner Corpus ==
The Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) is a collection of exam scripts written by students learning English, built in collaboration with Cambridge English Language Assessment. The CLC contains scripts from over 180,000 students, from around 200 countries, speaking 138 different [[first language]]s and is growing all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Learner Corpus, http://www.cambridge.org/us/esl/catalog/subject/custom/item3646603/Cambridge-International-Corpus-Cambridge-Learner-Corpus/?site_locale=en_US&lt;/ref&gt; The exams currently included are:

* KET [[Cambridge English: Key (KET)|Key English Test]] (and KET for schools)
* PET [[Preliminary English Test]] (and PET for schools)
* FCE [[First Certificate in English]]
* CAE [[Certificate in Advanced English]]
* CPE [[Certificate of Proficiency in English]]
* BEC [[Business English Certificate]] (all levels)
* IELTS [[International English Language Testing System]] (academic and general training)
* CELS Certificates in English Language Skills
* ILEC International Legal English Certificate
* ICFE International Certificate in Financial English
* Skills for Life

A unique feature of the Cambridge Learner Corpus is its error coding system. Language specialists identify and annotate errors in the exam scripts. This means that the Corpus can be used to find out about the frequency of different types of errors, the contexts that the errors are made in and the student groups that find particular language areas difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Nicholls, http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/publications/CL2003/papers/nicholls.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of Cambridge [[English Language Teaching]] resources can use this information to target common errors – for example, the Cambridge Advanced Learner’s Dictionary contains ‘Common mistake’ features which highlight frequent learner errors.

Conversely, the error coding system also reveals what students can achieve at each level. This is central to the work of [[English Profile]], a collaborative programme to enhance the learning, teaching and assessment of English worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile project, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=2&lt;/ref&gt; The founding partners are [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]], the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Bedfordshire]], the [[British Council]] and English UK.&lt;ref&gt;English Profile, http://www.englishprofile.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=22&lt;/ref&gt; The project’s aim is to describe what learners know and can do in English at each level of the [[Common European Framework of Reference]] (CEFR).&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, CEFR levels,{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030205032/http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp |archivedate=2009-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specialized corpora ==
The Cambridge English Corpus contains a number of specialized corpora:

=== Cambridge Business English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Business English Corpus is a large collection of British and American business language, including reports and documents, books relating to different aspects of business, and the business sections from many national newspapers.

The Cambridge Business English Corpus also includes the '''Cambridge and Nottingham Spoken Business English Corpus''' (CANBEC), the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]]. This is a collection of recordings of English from companies of all sizes, ranging from big multinational companies to small partnerships. It contains formal and informal meetings, presentations, telephone conversations, lunchtime conversations, and spoken language from other business situations.

=== Cambridge Legal English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Legal English Corpus contains books, journals and newspaper articles relating to the law and legal processes.

=== Cambridge Financial English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Financial English Corpus contains texts relating to economics and finance, including leading financial magazines and newspapers.

=== Cambridge Academic English Corpus ===
The Cambridge Academic English Corpus contains written and spoken academic language at undergraduate and post-graduate level from a range of US and UK institutions, including lectures, seminars, student presentations, journals, essays and text books.

=== CANCODE ===
The Cambridge and Nottingham Corpus of Discourse in English (CANCODE) is a collection of spoken English recorded at hundreds of locations across the British Isles in a wide variety of situations (e.g. casual conversation, socialising, finding out information, and discussions). The CANCODE corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and the [[University of Nottingham]].

There are about five million words in the CANCODE corpus, and it's a very rich resource for researchers of spoken English.  However, the data does have some limitations.  Most people knew they were being recorded, and are chatting in informal situations such as while relaxing at home, with others of fairly equal social status.  This means the interactions are generally consensual and collaborative, so the corpus has minimal evidence of conflict or adversarial exchanges&lt;ref&gt;Carter (2004) Language and Creativity: The Art of Common Talk. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cambridge-Cornell Corpus of Spoken North American English ===
The Cambridge University Press/Cornell Corpus is a large collection of informal, highly interactive, multiparty conversations between family/friends in North America. The Cambridge-Cornell corpus is the result of a joint project between [[Cambridge University Press]] and [[Cornell University]].

=== CAMSNAE ===
The Cambridge Corpus of Spoken North American English (CAMSNAE) is a large collection of spoken American English. It includes recordings of people going about their everyday life – at work, at home with their families, going shopping, having meals, etc.

[[File:Church fan.jpg|thumb|Church fan depicting two African-American girls praying.]]
A '''church fan''' is term used mainly in the [[United States]] for a [[hand fan]] used within a [[Christian church]] building to cool oneself off. The fan typically has a wooden handle and a fan blade made of hard stock paper (i.e. card-stock, 2-ply), often with a staple adjoining the two materials.

Modern air-conditioning became widely available in America during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7951/a-brief-history-of-air-conditioning-10720229/|title=A Brief History of Air Conditioning|date=2015-01-01|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many churches (primarily African-American congregations) were unable to afford the cooling machines for their [[church (building)|church buildings]]. In addition to their function of cooling the body, the paper blade of the fans were used for printed illustrations and community advertisements. Historically, funeral homes often acquired the space on the back of the fans to advertise their services to the churches members, in addition to other local businesses and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starnewsonline.com/news/20100306/collection-of-church-fans-represents-southern-hospitality|title=Collection of church fans represents Southern hospitality|last=Greene|first=Amanda|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations on the front blade of the fans are varied in subject matter; from illustrations of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], to notable people within the respective churches community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myauctionfinds.com/2014/07/23/a-time-when-hand-fans-cooled-church-goers/|title=A time when hand fans cooled church-goers {{!}} Auction Finds|website=myauctionfinds.com|access-date=2016-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary Use ==
With the spread of modern air-conditioning units within church buildings, church fans have become less popular. However, many churches still supply hand fans for their members.

'''Comparative foot morphology''' involves comparing the form of [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] [[structures]] of a variety of [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[vertebrates]].  Understanding the role that the foot plays for each type of organism must take account of the differences in body type, foot shape, arrangement of structures, loading conditions and other variables.  However, similarities also exist among the feet of many different terrestrial vertebrates.  The [[paw]] of the dog, the [[hoof]] of the horse, the ''manus'' (foot) and ''pes'' (foot) of the [[elephant]], and the foot of the human all share some common features of structure, organization and function.  Their foot structures function as the load-transmission platform which is essential to balance, standing and types of locomotion (such as walking, trotting, galloping and running).

The discipline of [[biomimetics]] applies the information gained by comparing the foot [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of a variety of terrestrial vertebrates to human-engineering problems.  For instance, it may provide insights that make it possible to alter the foot's load transmission in people who wear an external [[orthosis]] because of paralysis from spinal-cord injury, or who use a [[prosthesis]] following the diabetes-related amputation of a leg.  Such knowledge can be incorporated in technology that improves a person's balance when standing; enables them to walk more efficiently, and to exercise; or otherwise enhances their quality of life by improving their mobility.

Limb and foot structure of representative terrestrial vertebrates:

===Variability in scaling and limb coordination===
[[File:Elephant skeleton.jpg|thumb|Elephant skeleton]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the aforementioned variables are connected with differences in the scaling of body and limb dimension as well as in patterns of limb coordination and movement.  However, little is understood concerning the functional contribution of the foot and its structures during the weight-bearing phase.  The comparative morphology of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] limb and foot structure of some representative terrestrial vertebrates reveals some interesting similarities.

===Columnar organization of limb structures===
[[File:Panthera leo limbs.png|thumb|Limb skeleton of a lion, an example of an angulated bony column]]
Even many terrestrial vertebrates exhibit differences in the scaling of limb dimension, limb coordination and magnitude of forelimb-hind limb loading, in the dog, horse and elephant the structure of the distal forelimb is similar to that of the distal hind limb.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="extension.missouri.edu"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the human, the structures of the hand are generally similar in shape and arrangement to those of the foot. Terrestrial vertebrate quadrupeds and bipeds generally possess distal limb and foot [[endoskeleton]] structures that are aligned in series, stacked in a relatively vertical orientation and arranged in a quasi-columnar fashion in the extended limb.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Distal cushion===
{{Double image|right|Mm Fuß.jpg|160|Indischer Elefant Detail Füße.JPG|150|Distal cushions on the foot of a raccoon and an elephant}}
Many representative terrestrial vertebrates possess a distal cushion on the under-surface of the foot.  The dog's paw contains a number of [[Viscosity|visco]]-elastic pads oriented along the middle and distal foot.  The horse possesses a centralized digital pad known as the [[Horse hoof#The frog|frog]], which is located at the distal aspect of the foot and surrounded by the hoof.&lt;ref name="extension.missouri.edu"/&gt; Humans possess a tough [[Fiber|fibro]] and elastic pad of fat that is anchored to the skin and bone of the rear portion of the foot.&lt;ref name="Gefen A 1665"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foot of the elephant possesses what is perhaps one of the most unusual distal cushions found in vertebrates.  The forefoot (''manus'') and hindfoot (''pes'') contain huge pads of fat that are scaled to cope with the massive loadings imposed by the largest terrestrial vertebrate.  In addition, a [[cartilage]]-like projection ([[prepollex]] in the forelimb and [[prehallux]] in the hind limb) appears to anchor the distal cushion to the bones of the elephant's foot.&lt;ref name="Weissengruber"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distal cushions of all these organisms (dog, horse, human and elephant) are dynamic structures during locomotion, alternating between phases of compression and expansion; it has been suggested that these structures thereby reduce the loads experienced by the skeletal system.&lt;ref name="Gefen A 1665"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller-Young JE 1531"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weissengruber" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Konig"&gt;{{cite journal

==Organization==
Arrangement of foot structures:

Because of the wide variety in body types, scaling and morphology of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] limbs of terrestrial vertebrates, there exists a degree of controversy concerning the nature and organization of foot structures.  One organizational approach to understanding foot structures makes distinctions regarding their regional anatomy.  The foot structures are divided into segments from proximal to distal and are grouped according to similarity in shape, dimension and function.  In this approach, the foot may be described in three segments: as the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot.

The '''hindfoot''' is the most proximal and posterior portion of the foot.&lt;ref&gt;McPoil TG, Brocato RS. The foot and ankle: biomechanical evaluation and treatment. In: Gould JA, Davies GJ, ed. Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy. St. Louis: CV Mosby; 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Functionally, the structures contained in this region are typically robust, possessing a larger size and girth than the other structures of the foot.  The structures of the hindfoot are usually adapted for transmitting large loads between the proximal and distal aspects of the limb when the foot contacts the ground.  This is apparent in the human and elephant foot, where the hindfoot undergoes greater loading during initial contact in many forms of locomotion.&lt;ref name="Perry J 1992"&gt;{{Cite book
 | last = Perry | first = J
 | title = [[Gait Analysis: Normal and Pathological Function]]
 | publisher = SLACK Inc | location = Thorofare, NJ | year = 1992
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hindfoot structures of the dog and horse are located relatively proximally compared to the elephant and human foot.

The '''midfoot''' is the intermediate portion of the foot between the hindfoot and forefoot. The structures in this region are intermediate in size, and typically transmit loads from the hindfoot to the forefoot.  The human transverse tarsal joint of the midfoot transmits forces from the subtalar joint in the hindfoot to the forefoot joints (metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal) and associated bones (metatarsals and phalanges).&lt;ref name="Soderberg GL 1997"&gt;{{Cite book
 | last = Soderberg | first = GL
 | title = Kinesiology Application to Pathological Motion | edition = 2nd
 | location = Baltimore | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | year = 1997
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The midfoot of the dog, horse and elephant contains similar intermediate structures having similar functions to those of the human midfoot.

The '''forefoot''' represents the most distal portion of the foot. In the human and elephant, the bone structures contained in this region are generally longer and narrower.  The structures of the forefoot play a role in providing leverage for terminal stance propulsion and load transfer.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry J 1992"/&gt;

==Function==
Load transmission of the foot in representative terrestrial vertebrates:

===Dog paw===
[[File:DogDewClawTika1 wb.jpg|thumb|Dog paw]]
The paw of the dog has a [[digitigrade]] orientation.  The vertical columnar orientation of the proximal bones of the limbs, which articulate with distal foot structures that are arranged in quasi-vertical columnar orientation, is well-aligned to transmit loadings during weight-bearing contact of the skeleton with the ground.  The angled orientation of the elongated [[metatarsal]] and the digits extends the area available for storing and releasing mechanical energy in the muscle [[tendon]] units originating proximally to the ankle joint and terminating at the distal aspect of the foot bones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  When muscle tendon units lengthen, the load strain facilitates mechanical activity.  These muscle tendon unit structures appear well designed to aid in the ground-reaction transmission of forces that is essential for locomotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the pads of the distal paw appear to allow load attenuation, by enhancing shock absorption during the paw's contact with the ground.

===Horse foot===
[[File:Hufschnitt.jpg|thumb|left|Section of a horse foot]]
The horse's foot is in an [[Ungulate|unguligrade]] orientation.  The columnar orientation of bones and connective tissue is similarly well-aligned to transmit loads during the weight-bearing phase of locomotion.  The thick [[keratin]]ized and semicircular hoof changes shape during loading and unloading.  Similarly, the cushioned frog situated centrally at the rear ends of the hoof undergoes compression during loading, and expansion when unloaded.  Together, the hoof and cushioned frog structures may work in concert with hoof capsule to provide shock absorption.&lt;ref name="Konig" /&gt;  The horse hoof also acts dynamically during loading, which may cushion the endoskeleton from high loads that would otherwise produce critical deformation.

===Elephant foot===
[[File:PSM V04 D550 Elephant rear leg bones.jpg|thumb|Leg skeleton of the modern elephant]]
The hind limb and foot of the elephant are oriented semi-plantigrade, and closely resemble the structure and function of the human foot.  The [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]]s and [[metapodial]]s are arranged so as to form an arch, similarly to the human foot.  The six toes of each foot of the elephant are enclosed in a flexible sheath of skin.&lt;ref name="Weissengruber" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Recently, scientists at the [[Royal Veterinary College]] in the United Kingdom have discovered that the elephant possesses a sixth false toe, a [[sesamoid]], located similarly to the [[giant panda]]'s extra "thumb". They found that this sixth toe acts to support and distribute the weight of the elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2011-12-23|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2011/12/elephants-have-a-sixth-toe.html?ref=hp|title=Elephants Have a Sixth 'Toe'|publisher=ScienceMag.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human foot===
[[File:Primatenskelett-drawing.jpg|thumb|left|Skeleton of the human and gorilla (gorilla shown in non-natural posture)]]

The unique [[plantigrade]] alignment of the [[human foot]] results in a distal-limb structure that can adapt to a variety of conditions.  The less mobile and more robust [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]] bones are shaped and aligned to accept and transmit large loads during the early phases of stance (initial contact and loading response phases of walking, and inadvertent heel strikes during running).  The [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsals]] of the midfoot, which are smaller and shorter than the hindfoot tarsals, appear well oriented to transmit loads between the hindfoot and forefoot; this is necessary for load transfer and locking of the foot complex into a rigid lever for late stance phase.  Conversely, the midfoot bones and joints also allow for the transmission of loads and inter-joint movement that unlocks the foot to create a loosely packed structure which renders the foot highly compliant over a variety of surfaces.  In this configuration, the foot is able to absorb and damp the large loads encountered during heel strike and early weight acceptance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;  The forefoot, with its long [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] and relatively long [[Phalanx bone|phalanges]], transmits loads during the end-of-stance phase that facilitate the push-off and transfer of forward momentum.  The forefoot also serves as a [[lever]] to allow balance during standing and jumping. In addition, the [[arches of the foot]] that span the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot play a critical role in the nature of transformation of the foot from a rigid lever to a flexible weight-accepting structure.&lt;ref name="Perry J 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soderberg GL 1997"/&gt;

With a running gait, the foot-loading order is usually the reverse of walking. The foot strikes the ground with the [[Ball (anatomy)|ball]] of the foot, and then the [[heel]] drops.&lt;ref name="Lieberman et al 2010" &gt;{{Cite web

==Clinical implications==
Veterinarian or human healthcare professionals often respond when the foot of a dog, horse, elephant or human develops an abnormality.  They typically investigate to understand the nature of the [[pathology]] in order to generate and implement a clinical treatment plan. For instance, the paws of the dog and the hindfoot work together to absorb the shock of jumping and running, and to provide flexibility of movement.  If the dog's skeletal structures in areas other than the foot are compromised, the foot may be burdened with compensatory loading.  Structural faults such as straight or loose shoulders, straight [[stifle]]s, loose hips, and lack of balance between the forefoot and hindfoot, can all cause gait abnormalities that in turn damage the hindfoot and paws by overloading their foot structures as they compensate for the structural faults.

In the horse, dryness of the hoof may cause stiffening of the external foot structure.  The stiffer hoof reduces the foot's load attenuation capacity, rendering the horse unable to bear much weight on the distal limb.  Similar characteristic features emerge in the human foot in the form of the ''pes cavus'' alignment deformity, which is produced by tight connective tissue structures and joint congruency that create a rigid foot complex. Individuals with ''pes cavus'' display characteristic reduced load-attenuation features, and other structures proximal to the foot may compensate with increased load transfer (i.e., excessive loading to the knees, hips, lumbo-pelvic joints or lumbar vertebrae).&lt;ref name="Soderberg GL 1997"/&gt; Foot disorders are common in captive elephants. However, the cause is poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''Compton scattering''', discovered by [[Arthur Compton|Arthur Holly Compton]], is the scattering of a [[photon]] by a [[electric charge|charged]] particle, usually an [[electron]]. It results in a decrease in [[energy]] (increase in [[wavelength]]) of the photon (which may be an [[X-ray]] or [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]), called the '''Compton effect'''. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron. '''Inverse Compton scattering''' occurs, in which a charged particle transfers part of its energy to a photon.

== Introduction ==
[[File:Compton en.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Fig. 1: Schematic diagram of Compton's experiment. Compton scattering occurs in the graphite target on the left. The slit passes X-ray photons scattered at a selected angle. The energy of a scattered photon is measured using [[Bragg scattering]] in the crystal on the right in conjunction with ionization chamber; the chamber could measure total energy deposited over time, not the energy of single scattered photons.]]

Compton scattering is an example of [[inelastic scattering]]&lt;ref&gt;Elastic or [[inelastic scattering]]? The incident photon loses energy in the lab frame, which centuries of practice had identified with inelastic scattering—even though, in the c.m.  frame, the respective masses remaining the same, no new species are created and kinetic energy is conserved,  the mark of an ''elastic collision''. As a result, HEP and nuclear physicists prefer to emphasize elasticity, while atomic and molecular physicists use "inelastic". &lt;/ref&gt; of light by a free charged particle, where the wavelength of the scattered light is different from that of the incident radiation.  In Compton's original experiment (see Fig. 1), the energy of the X ray photon (≈17 keV) was very much larger than the binding energy of the atomic electron, so the electrons could be treated as being free.  The amount by which the light's wavelength changes is called the '''Compton shift'''. Although nuclear Compton scattering exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nuclear Compton scattering|author=P. Christillin|year=1986|journal= J. Phys. G: Nucl. Phys.|volume=12|pages=837–851|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0305-4616/12/9/008|doi=10.1088/0305-4616/12/9/008|bibcode = 1986JPhG...12..837C|issue=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compton scattering usually refers to the interaction involving only the electrons of an atom. The Compton effect was observed by [[Arthur Holly Compton]] in 1923 at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and further verified by his graduate student [[Wu Youxun|Y. H. Woo]] in the years following. Compton earned the 1927 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the discovery.

The effect is significant because it demonstrates that light cannot be explained purely as a [[wave]] phenomenon.

[[Thomson scattering]], the classical theory of an [[electromagnetic wave]] scattered by charged particles, cannot explain shifts in wavelength at low intensity: classically, light of sufficient intensity for the electric field to accelerate a charged particle to a relativistic speed will cause radiation-pressure recoil and an associated Doppler shift of the scattered light,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Observation of the Transition from Thomson to Compton Scattering in Optical Multiphoton Interactions with Electrons|author=C. Moore|year=1995|url=http://www.lle.rochester.edu/media/publications/documents/theses/Moore.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the effect would become arbitrarily small at sufficiently low light intensities ''regardless of wavelength''. Thus, light must behave as if it consists of particles, if we are to explain low-intensity Compton scattering. Or the assumption that the electron can be treated as free is invalid resulting in the effectively infinite electron mass equal to the nuclear mass (see e.g. the comment below on elastic scattering of X-rays being from that effect).  Compton's experiment convinced physicists that light can be treated as a stream of particle-like objects (quanta called photons), whose energy is proportional to the light wave's frequency.  But see the article on [[Julian Schwinger]] for Schwinger's different assessment of the necessity of any particles at all in a consistent QED or QCD.

As shown in Fig. 2, The interaction between an electron and a photon results in the electron being given part of the energy (making it recoil), and a photon of the remaining energy being emitted in a different direction from the original, so that the overall [[momentum]] of the system is also conserved. If the scattered photon still has enough energy, the process may be repeated. In this scenario, the electron is treated as free or loosely bound. Experimental verification of momentum conservation in individual Compton scattering processes by [[Walther Bothe|Bothe]] and [[Hans Geiger|Geiger]] as well as by Compton and Simon has been important in disproving the [[BKS theory]].

Compton scattering is one of three competing processes when photons interact with matter.  At energies of a few eV to a few keV, corresponding to [[visible light]] through soft X-rays, a photon can be completely absorbed and its energy can eject an electron from its host atom, a process known as the [[photoelectric effect]]. High energy photons of {{val|1.022|u=MeV}} and above may bombard the nucleus and cause an electron and a positron to be formed, a process called [[pair production]].  Compton scattering is the most important interaction in the intervening energy region.

== Description of the phenomenon ==
[[Image:Compton-scattering.svg|thumb|200px|right|Fig. 2: A photon of wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; comes in from the left, collides with a target at rest, and a new photon of wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda'&lt;/math&gt; emerges at an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. The target recoils, carrying away an angle-dependent amount of the incident energy.]]
By the early 20th century, research into the interaction of [[X-ray]]s with matter was well under way. It was observed that when X-rays of a known wavelength interact with atoms, the X-rays are scattered through an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and emerge at a different wavelength related to &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. Although [[classical electromagnetism]] predicted that the wavelength of scattered rays should be equal to the initial wavelength,&lt;ref name="taylor_136-9"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=J.R.|last2=Zafiratos|first2=C.D.|last3=Dubson|first3=M.A.|year=2004|title=Modern Physics for Scientists and Engineers|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0-13-805715-X|pages=136–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; multiple experiments had found that the wavelength of the scattered rays was longer (corresponding to lower energy) than the initial wavelength.&lt;ref name="taylor_136-9" /&gt;

In 1923, Compton published a paper in the ''[[Physical Review]]'' that explained the X-ray shift by attributing particle-like momentum to light quanta (Einstein had proposed light quanta in 1905 in explaining the photo-electric effect, but Compton did not build on Einstein's work). The energy of light quanta depends only on the frequency of the light. In his paper, Compton derived the mathematical relationship between the shift in wavelength and the scattering angle of the X-rays by assuming that each scattered X-ray photon interacted with only one electron.  His paper concludes by reporting on experiments which verified his derived relation:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda' - \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c}(1-\cos{\theta}),&lt;/math&gt;
:where
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the initial wavelength,
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda'&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength after scattering,
:&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron rest mass]],
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]], and
:&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the scattering angle.

The quantity {{sfrac|''h''|''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;c''}} is known as the [[Compton wavelength]] of the electron; it is equal to {{val|2.43|e=-12|u=m}}. The wavelength shift {{nowrap|''λ′'' − ''λ''}} is at least zero (for {{nowrap|''θ'' {{=}} 0°}}) and at most twice the Compton wavelength of the electron (for {{nowrap|''θ'' {{=}} 180°}}).

Compton found that some X-rays experienced no wavelength shift despite being scattered through large angles; in each of these cases the photon failed to eject an electron.&lt;ref name="taylor_136-9" /&gt; Thus the magnitude of the shift is related not to the Compton wavelength of the electron, but to the Compton wavelength of the entire atom, which can be upwards of 10000 times smaller.  This is known as "coherent" scattering off the entire atom since the atom remains intact, gaining no internal excitation.

In Compton's original experiments the wavelength shift given above was the directly-measurable observable.  In modern experiments it is conventional to measure the energies, not the wavelengths, of the scattered photons.  For a given incident energy &lt;math&gt;E_\gamma = hc/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, the outgoing final-state photon energy, &lt;math&gt;E_{\gamma^\prime}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by
: &lt;math&gt;
E_{\gamma^\prime} = \frac{E_\gamma}{1 + (E_\gamma/m_e c^2)(1-\cos\theta)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation of the scattering formula ===
[[File:ComptonEnergy.jpg|thumb|Fig. 3: Energies of a photon at 500 keV and an electron after Compton scattering.]]
A photon  {{mvar|γ}}  with wavelength {{mvar|λ}}   collides with an electron {{mvar|e}} in an atom, which is treated as being at rest. The collision causes the electron to [[recoil]], and a new photon {{mvar|γ}}'   with wavelength {{mvar|λ}}'   emerges at angle {{mvar|θ}}  from the photon's incoming path. Let {{mvar|e}}'  denote the electron after the collision. Compton allowed for the possibility that the interaction would sometimes accelerate the electron to speeds sufficiently close to the velocity of light as to require the application of Einstein's [[special relativity]] theory to properly describe its energy and momentum.

At the conclusion of Compton's 1923 paper, he reported results of experiments confirming the predictions of his scattering formula, thus supporting the assumption that photons carry momentum as well as quantized energy.  At the start of his derivation, he had postulated an expression for the momentum of a photon from equating Einstein's already established mass-energy relationship of &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt; to the quantized photon energies of &lt;math&gt;h f&lt;/math&gt;, which Einstein had separately postulated. If &lt;math&gt;mc^2 = hf&lt;/math&gt;, the equivalent photon mass must be &lt;math&gt;hf/c^2&lt;/math&gt;. The photon's momentum is then simply this effective mass times the photon's frame-invariant velocity {{mvar|c}}. For a photon, its momentum &lt;math&gt;p=hf/c&lt;/math&gt;, and thus {{math|''hf''}}  can be substituted for {{math|''pc''}}   for all photon momentum terms which arise in course of the derivation below. The derivation which appears in Compton's paper is more terse, but follows the same logic in the same sequence as the following derivation.

The [[conservation of energy]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; merely equates the sum of energies before and after scattering.
:&lt;math&gt;E_\gamma + E_e = E_{\gamma'} + E_{e'}.\!&lt;/math&gt;
Compton postulated that photons carry momentum;&lt;ref name="taylor_136-9" /&gt; thus from the [[conservation of momentum]], the momenta of the particles should be similarly related by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_\gamma = \mathbf{p}_{\gamma'} + \mathbf{p}_{e'},&lt;/math&gt;
:in which (&lt;math&gt;{p_e}&lt;/math&gt;) is omitted on the assumption it is effectively zero.

The photon energies are related to the frequencies by
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\gamma} = hf\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\gamma'} = hf'\!&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]].
Before the scattering event, the electron is treated as sufficiently close to being at rest that its total energy consists entirely of the mass-energy equivalence of its (rest) mass &lt;math&gt; m_e &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;E_e = m_ec^2.\!&lt;/math&gt;
After scattering, the possibility that the electron might be accelerated to a significant fraction of the speed of light, requires that its total energy be represented using the relativistic [[energy–momentum relation]]
:&lt;math&gt;E_{e'} = \sqrt{(p_{e'}c)^2 + (m_ec^2)^2} ~.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these quantities into the expression for the conservation of energy gives
:&lt;math&gt;hf + m_e c^2 = hf' + \sqrt{(p_{e'}c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
This expression can be used to find the magnitude of the momentum of the scattered electron,
:&lt;math&gt;p_{e'}^{\, 2}c^2 = (hf - hf' + m_{e}c^2)^2-m_{e}^2c^4. \qquad\qquad (1) \!&lt;/math&gt;
:Note that this magnitude of the momentum gained by the electron (formerly zero) exceeds the energy/c lost by the photon,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c}\sqrt{(hf - hf' + m_{e}c^2)^2-m_{e}^2c^4} &gt; \frac{hf - hf'}{c}~. &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (1) relates the various energies associated with the collision. The electron's momentum change involves a relativistic change in the energy of the electron, so it is not simply related to the change in energy   occurring in classical physics.  The change of the magnitude of the momentum of the photon is not just related to the change of its energy; it also involves a change in direction.
 
Solving the conservation of momentum expression for the scattered electron's momentum gives
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_{e'} = \mathbf{p}_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_{\gamma'}.&lt;/math&gt;

Making use of the [[scalar product]] yields the square of its magnitude,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p_{e'}^{\, 2} &amp;= \mathbf{p}_{e'}\cdot\mathbf{p}_{e'} = (\mathbf{p}_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_{\gamma'}) \cdot (\mathbf{p}_\gamma - \mathbf{p}_{\gamma'}) \\
 &amp;= p_{\gamma}^{\, 2} + p_{\gamma'}^{\, 2} - 2 p_{\gamma}\, p_{\gamma'} \cos\theta. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In anticipation of &lt;math&gt;p_{\gamma}c&lt;/math&gt; being replaced  with &lt;math&gt;h f&lt;/math&gt;, multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;c^2&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;p_{e'}^{\, 2}c^2 = p_{\gamma}^{\, 2}c^2 + p_{\gamma'}^{\, 2}c^2 - 2c^2 p_{\gamma}\, p_{\gamma'} \cos\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

After replacing the photon momentum terms with &lt;math&gt;h f/c&lt;/math&gt;, we get a second expression for the magnitude of the momentum of the scattered electron,
:&lt;math&gt;p_{e'}^{\, 2}c^2 = (h f)^2 + (h f')^2 - 2(hf)(h f')\cos{\theta}~. \qquad\qquad (2) &lt;/math&gt;

Equating the alternate expressions for this momentum gives
:&lt;math&gt; (hf - hf' + m_e c^2)^2 - m_e^{\, 2}c^4 = \left(h f\right)^2 + \left(h f'\right)^2 - 2h^2 ff'\cos{\theta},&lt;/math&gt;
which, after evaluating the square and canceling and rearranging terms, further  yields
:&lt;math&gt; 2 h f m_e c^2-2 h f' m_e c^2   = 2 h^2 f f' \left( 1 - \cos \theta \right).  &lt;/math&gt;
Dividing both sides by {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;2 h f f' m_e c&lt;/math&gt;}} yields
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{c}{f'} - \frac{c}{f} = \frac{h}{m_ec}\left(1-\cos \theta \right).   &lt;/math&gt;
:
Finally, since  {{math|''fλ''}} =  {{math|''f ' λ' ''}} = {{mvar|c}},
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda'-\lambda = \frac{h}{m_ec}(1-\cos{\theta})~. \qquad\qquad (3)&lt;/math&gt;
:

It can further be seen that the angle {{mvar|φ}} of the outgoing electron with the direction of the incoming photon is specified by 
::&lt;math&gt; \cot \varphi = \left ( 1+\frac{hf}{m_e c^2} \right ) \tan (\theta/2)~.\qquad\qquad (4)&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Compton scattering ===
Compton scattering is of prime importance to [[radiobiology]], as it is the most probable interaction of gamma rays and high energy X-rays with atoms in living beings and is applied in [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC. [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/chapter02/article/10165/1399960 "Principles of Radiation Therapy"] in Pazdur R, Wagman LD, Camphausen KA, Hoskins WJ (Eds) [http://www.cancernetwork.com/cancer-management-11/ Cancer Management: A Multidisciplinary Approach]. 11 ed. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In material physics, Compton scattering can be used to probe the [[wave function]] of the electrons in matter in the momentum representation.

Compton scattering is an important effect in [[gamma spectroscopy]] which gives rise to the [[Compton edge]], as it is possible for the gamma rays to scatter out of the detectors used. [[Compton suppression]] is used to detect stray scatter gamma rays to counteract this effect.

=== Magnetic Compton scattering ===
Magnetic Compton scattering is an extension of the previously mentioned technique which involves the magnetisation of a crystal sample hit with high energy, circularly polarised photons. By measuring the scattered photons' energy and reversing the magnetisation of the sample, two different Compton profiles are generated (one for spin up momenta and one for spin down momenta). Taking the difference between these two profiles gives the magnetic Compton profile  (MCP), given by &lt;math&gt;J_{\text{mag}}(\mathbf{p}_z)&lt;/math&gt; - a one-dimensional projection of the electron spin density.

&lt;math&gt;J_{\text{mag}}(\mathbf{p}_z) = \frac{1}{\mu}\iint_{-\infty}^\infty (n_{\uparrow} (\mathbf{p}) - n_{\downarrow}(\mathbf{p})) d\mathbf{p}_x d\mathbf{p}_y&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the number of spin-unpaired electrons in the system, &lt;math&gt;n_\uparrow(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_\downarrow(\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; are the three-dimensional electron momentum distributions for the majority spin and minority spin electrons respectively.

Since this scattering process is [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]] (there is no phase relationship between the scattered photons), the MCP is representative of the bulk properties of the sample and is a probe of the ground state. This means that the MCP is ideal for comparison with theoretical techniques such as [[density functional theory]].
The area under the MCP is directly proportional to the spin moment of the system and so, when combined with total moment measurements methods (such as [[SQUID]] magnetometry), can be used to isolate both the spin and orbital contributions to the total moment of a system.
The shape of the MCP also yields insight into the origin of the magnetism in the system.&lt;ref name="Cooper2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Cooper|title=X-Ray Compton Scattering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m58jXIJDs3QC|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=14 October 2004|publisher=[[OUP Oxford]]|isbn=978-0-19-850168-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inverse Compton scattering ===
Inverse Compton scattering is important in [[astrophysics]].  In [[X-ray astronomy]], the [[accretion disk]] surrounding a [[black hole]] is presumed to produce a thermal spectrum.  The lower energy photons produced from this spectrum are scattered to higher energies by relativistic electrons in the surrounding [[corona]].  This is surmised to cause the power law component in the X-ray spectra (0.2-10 keV) of accreting Black Holes.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}

The effect is also observed when photons from the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) move through the hot gas surrounding a [[galaxy cluster]].  The CMB photons are scattered to higher energies by the electrons in this gas, resulting in the [[Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect]]. Observations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect provide a nearly redshift-independent means of detecting galaxy clusters.

Some synchrotron radiation facilities scatter laser light off the stored electron beam.
This Compton backscattering produces high energy photons in the MeV to GeV range&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lnf.infn.it/~levisand/graal/graal.html |title=GRAAL home page |publisher=Lnf.infn.it |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently used for nuclear physics experiments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12496">'''Computer audition''' (CA) or '''machine listening''' is general field of study of [[algorithm]]s and systems for audio understanding by machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.igi-global.com/book/machine-audition-principles-algorithms-systems/40288|title= Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/596085/1/Wang_Preface_MA_2010.pdf |title= Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the notion of what it means for a machine to "hear" is very broad and somewhat vague, computer audition attempts to bring together several disciplines that originally dealt with specific problems or had a concrete application in mind. The engineer Paris Smaragdis, interviewed in ''Technology Review'', talks about these systems --"software that uses sound to locate people moving through rooms, monitor machinery for impending breakdowns, or activate traffic cameras to record accidents."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/VideoPosts.aspx?id=17438 Paris Smaragdis taught computers how to play more life-like music]&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by models of [[Hearing (sense)|human audition]], CA deals with questions of representation, [[transduction (machine learning)|transduction]], grouping, use of musical knowledge and general sound [[semantics]] for the purpose of performing intelligent operations on audio and music signals by the computer. Technically this requires a combination of methods from the fields of [[signal processing]], [[auditory modelling]], music perception and [[cognition]], [[pattern recognition]], and [[machine learning]], as well as more traditional methods of [[artificial intelligence]] for musical knowledge representation.

== Applications ==
Like [[computer vision]] versus image processing, computer audition versus audio engineering deals with understanding of audio rather than processing. It also differs from problems of [[speech recognition|speech understanding by machine]] since it deals with general audio signals, such as natural sounds and musical recordings.

Applications of computer auditions are widely varying, and include search for sounds, [[music genre|genre]] recognition, [[acoustic monitoring]], [[music transcription]], score following, [[audio texture]], [[music improvisation]], emotion in audio and so on.

== Related disciplines ==
Computer Audition overlaps with the following disciplines:
* [[Music Information Retrieval]]: methods for search and analysis of similarity between music signals.
* Auditory Science Analysis: understanding and description of audio sources and events. 
* Machine listening: methods for extracting auditory meaningful parameters from audio signals.
* Computational [[musicology]] and mathematical music theory: use of algorithms that employ musical knowledge for analysis of music data.
* [[Computer music]]: use of computers in creative musical applications.
* Machine musicianship: audition driven interactive music systems.

== Areas of study ==

Since audio signals are interpreted by the human ear-brain system, that complex perceptual mechanism should be simulated somehow in software for "machine listening". In other words, to perform on par with humans, the computer should hear and understand audio content much as humans do. Analyzing audio accurately involves several fields: electrical engineering (spectrum analysis, filtering, and audio transforms); artificial intelligence (machine learning and sound classification);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Daniel|last2=Caulfield|first2=Brian|title=Pervasive Sound Sensing: A Weakly Supervised Training Approach|journal=IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics|date=Feb 2015|doi=10.1109/TCYB.2015.2396291|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=7035063&amp;tag=1|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; psychoacoustics (sound perception); cognitive sciences (neuroscience and artificial intelligence);&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Purwins, Perfecto Herrera, Maarten Grachten, Amaury Hazan, Ricard Marxer, and Xavier Serra. Computational models of music perception and cognition I: The perceptual and cognitive processing chain. Physics of Life Reviews, vol. 5, no. 3, pp. 151-168, 2008. [http://www.mtg.upf.edu/node/938]&lt;/ref&gt; acoustics (physics of sound production); and music (harmony, rhythm, and timbre). Furthermore, audio transformations such as pitch shifting, time stretching, and sound object filtering, should be perceptually and musically meaningful. For best results, these transformations require perceptual understanding of spectral models, high-level feature extraction, and sound analysis/synthesis. Finally, structuring and coding the content of an audio file (sound and metadata) could benefit from efficient compression schemes, which discard inaudible information in the sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.media.mit.edu/~tristan/Classes/MAS.945/technical.html Machine Listening Course Webpage at MIT]&lt;/ref&gt; Computational models of music and sound perception and cognition can lead to a more meaningful  representation, a more intuitive digital manipulation and generation of sound and music in musical human-machine interfaces.

The study of CA could be roughly divided into the following sub-problems:
# Representation: signal and symbolic. This aspect deals with time-frequency representations, both in terms of notes and spectral models, including pattern playback and audio texture.
# Feature extraction: sound descriptors, segmentation, onset, [[Pitch detection algorithm|pitch]] and [[Envelope detector|envelope]] detection, [[Pitch class|chroma]], and auditory representations.
# Musical knowledge structures: analysis of [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and [[harmony|harmonies]].  
# Sound similarity: methods for comparison between sounds, sound identification, novelty detection, segmentation, and clustering. 
# Sequence modeling:  matching and alignment between signals and note sequences. 
# Source separation: methods of grouping of simultaneous sounds, such as multiple pitch detection and time-frequency clustering methods.
# Auditory cognition: modeling of emotions, anticipation and familiarity, auditory surprise, and analysis of musical structure.
# Multi-modal analysis: finding correspondences between textual, visual, and audio signals.

=== Representation issues ===
Computer audition deals with audio signals that can be represented in a variety of fashions, from direct encoding of digital audio in two or more channels to symbolically represented synthesis instructions. Audio signals are usually represented in terms of [[analog recording|analogue]] or [[Digital data|digital]] recordings. Digital recordings are samples of acoustic waveform or parameters of [[Audio compression (data)|audio compression]] algorithms. One of the unique properties of musical signals is that they often combine different types of representations, such as graphical scores and sequences of performance actions that are encoded as [[MIDI]] files.

Since audio signals usually comprise multiple sound sources, then unlike speech signals that can be efficiently described in terms of specific models (such as source-filter model), it is hard to devise a [[parameter|parametric]] representation for general audio. Parametric audio representations usually use [[filter bank]]s or [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al models to capture multiple sound parameters, sometimes increasing the representation size in order to capture internal structure in the signal. Additional types of data that are relevant for computer audition are textual descriptions of audio contents, such as annotations, reviews, and visual information in the case of audio-visual recordings.

=== Features ===
Description of contents of general audio signals usually requires extraction of features that capture specific aspects of the audio signal. Generally speaking, one could divide the features into signal or mathematical descriptors such as energy, description of spectral shape etc., statistical characterization such as change or novelty detection, special representations that are better adapted to the nature of musical signals or the auditory system, such as logarithmic growth of sensitivity ([[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) in frequency or [[octave]] invariance (chroma).

Since parametric models in audio usually require very many parameters, the features are used to summarize properties of multiple parameters in a more compact or salient representation.

=== Musical knowledge ===
Finding specific musical structures is possible by using musical knowledge as well as supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Examples of this include detection of tonality according to distribution of frequencies that correspond to patterns of occurrence of notes in musical scales, distribution of note onset times for detection of beat structure, distribution of energies in different frequencies to detect musical chords and so on.

=== Sound similarity and sequence modeling ===
Comparison of sounds can be done by comparison of features with or without reference to time. In some cases an overall similarity can be assessed by close values of features between two sounds. In other cases when temporal structure is important, methods of dynamic time warping need to be applied to "correct" for different temporal scales of acoustic events. Finding repetitions and similar sub-sequences of sonic events is important for tasks such as texture synthesis and machine improvisation.

=== Source separation ===
Since one of the basic characteristics of general audio is that it comprises multiple simultaneously sounding sources, such as multiple musical instruments, people talking, machine noises or animal vocalization, the ability to identify and separate individual sources is very desirable. Unfortunately, there are no methods that can solve this problem in a [[wikt:robust|robust]] fashion. Existing methods of source separation rely sometimes on correlation between different audio channels in [[multi-channel recording]]s. The ability to separate sources from stereo signals requires different techniques than those usually applied in communications where multiple sensors are available. Other source separation methods rely on training or clustering of features in mono recording, such as tracking harmonically related partials for multiple pitch detection.

=== Auditory cognition ===
Listening to music and general audio is commonly not a task directed activity. People enjoy music for various poorly understood reasons, which are commonly referred to the emotional effect of music due to creation of expectations and their realization or violation. Animals attend to signs of danger in sounds, which could be either specific or general notions of surprising and unexpected change. Generally, this creates a situation where computer audition can not rely solely on detection of specific features or sound properties and has to come up with general methods of adapting to changing auditory environment and monitoring its structure. This consists of analysis of larger repetition and [[self-similarity]] structures in audio to detect innovation, as well as ability to predict local feature dynamics.

=== Multi-modal analysis ===
Among the available data for describing music, there are textual representations, such as liner notes, reviews and criticisms that describe the audio contents in words. In other cases human reactions such as emotional judgements or psycho-physiological measurements might provide an insight into the contents and structure of audio. Computer Audition tries to find relation between these different representations in order to provide this additional understanding of the audio contents.

A '''DNA sequencer''' is a [[scientific instrument]] used to automate the [[DNA sequencing]] process.  Given a sample of [[DNA]], a DNA sequencer is used to determine the order of the four bases: G ([[guanine]]), C ([[cytosine]]), A ([[adenine]]) and T ([[thymine]]). This is then reported as a text [[String (computer science)|string]], called a read. Some DNA sequencers can be also considered [[optical instrument]]s as they analyze light signals originating from [[fluorochrome]]s attached to [[nucleotides]].

The first automated DNA sequencer, invented by [[Lloyd M. Smith]], was introduced by [[Applied Biosystems]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook-Deegan|first1=Robert Mullan|title=Origins of the Human Genome Project|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/mccurdy/Project.doc|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used the [[Sanger sequencing]] method, a technology which formed the basis of the “first generation” of DNA sequencers&lt;ref name=Metzker&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzker, M. L. |title=Emerging technologies in DNA sequencing |journal=Genome Res. |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1767–1776 |year=2005 |pmid=16339375 |doi= 10.1101/gr.3770505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchison, C.

Therefore, these sequencers can also be used in the [[genotyping]] of genetic markers where only the length of a DNA fragment(s) needs to be determined (e.g. [[microsatellite]]s, [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism|AFLPs]]).

The [[Human Genome Project]] catalysed the development of cheaper, high throughput and more accurate platforms known as [[Next-generation sequencing|Next Generation Sequencers]] (NGS) to sequence the [[human genome]]. These include the 454, [[ABI Solid Sequencing|SOLiD]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] DNA sequencing platforms. Next generation sequencing machines have increased the rate of DNA sequence substantially compared with previous Sanger methods. DNA samples can be prepared automatically in as little as 90 mins,&lt;ref name="a tale of three" /&gt; while a human genome can be sequenced at 15 times coverage in a matter of days.&lt;ref name="large genome centre"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael A.

More recent, third-generation  DNA sequencers such as [[Single Molecule Real Time Sequencing|SMRT]] and [[Nanopore sequencing|Oxford Nanopore]] measure the addition of nucleotides to a single DNA molecule in real time.

Because of limitations in DNA sequencer technology these reads are short compared to the length of a [[genome]] therefore the reads must be [[Sequence assembly|assembled]] into longer [[contig]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Heng Li, Jue Ruan, and Richard Durbin (2008) http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/11/1851 Mapping short DNA sequencing reads and calling variants using mapping quality scores. Genome Research.&lt;/ref&gt; The data may also contain errors, caused by limitations in the DNA sequencing technique or by errors during [[PCR amplification]]. DNA sequencer manufacturers use a number of different methods to detect which DNA bases are present. The specific protocols applied in different sequencing platforms have an impact in the final data that is generated. Therefore, comparing data quality and cost across different technologies can be a daunting task. Each manufacturer provides their own ways to inform sequencing errors and scores. However, errors and scores between different platforms cannot always be compared directly. Since these systems rely on different DNA sequencing approaches, choosing the best DNA sequencer and method will typically depend on the experiment objectives and available budget.&lt;ref name="Metzker"/&gt;

The first [[DNA sequencing]] methods were developed by Gilbert (1973)&lt;ref name="Gilbert 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilbert W, Maxam A |title=The Nucleotide Sequence of the lac Operator |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=13581–3584 |year=1973 |pmc=427284 |pmid=4587255 |doi=10.1073/pnas.70.12.3581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Sanger (1975).&lt;ref name=Sanger75&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanger F, Coulson AR |title=A rapid method for determining sequences in DNA by primed synthesis with DNA polymerase |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=441–8 |date=May 1975 |pmid=1100841 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(75)90213-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert introduced a sequencing method based on chemical modification of DNA followed by cleavage at specific bases whereas Sanger’s technique is based on [[dideoxynucleotide]] chain termination. The Sanger method became popular due to its increased efficiency and low radioactivity. The first automated DNA sequencer was the AB370A, introduced in 1986 by [[Applied Biosystems]]. The AB370A was able to sequence 96 samples simultaneously, 500 kilobases per day, and reaching read lengths up to 600 bases. This was the beginning of the “first generation” of DNA sequencers,&lt;ref name="Metzker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchison, C. A. III. 2007 6227–6237"/&gt; which implemented Sanger sequencing, fluorescent dideoxy nucleotides and polyacrylamide gel sandwiched between glass plates - slab gels.  The next major advance was the release in 1995 of the AB310 which utilized a linear polymer in a capillary in place of the slab gel for DNA strand separation by electrophoresis. These techniques formed the base for the completion of the human genome project in 2001.&lt;ref name="F. S. Collins, M. Morgan, and A. Patrinos 2003 286–290"/&gt; The human genome project catalysed the development of cheaper, high throughput and more accurate platforms known as Next Generation Sequencers (NGS). In 2005, 454 Life Sciences released the 454 sequencer, followed by Solexa Genome Analyzer and SOLiD (Supported Oligo Ligation Detection) by Agencourt in 2006. Applied Biosystems acquired Agencourt in 2006, and in 2007, Roche bought 454 Life Sciences, while Illumina purchased Solexa. Ion Torrent entered the market in 2010 and was acquired by Life Technologies (now Thermo Fisher Scientific). These are still the most common NGS systems due to their competitive cost, accuracy, and performance.

More recently, a third generation of DNA sequencers was introduced. The sequencing methods applied by these sequencers do not require DNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction&amp;nbsp;– PCR), which speeds up the sample preparation before sequencing and reduces errors. In addition, sequencing data is collected from the reactions caused by the addition of nucleotides in the complementary strand in real time. Two companies introduced different approaches in their third-generation sequencers. Pacific Biosciences sequencers utilize a method called Single-molecule real-time (SMRT), where sequencing data is produced by light (captured by a camera) emitted when a nucleotide is added to the complementary strand by enzymes containing fluorescent dyes. Oxford Nanopore Technologies is another company developing third-generation sequencers using electronic systems based on nanopore sensing technologies.

==Manufacturers of DNA sequencers==

DNA sequencers have been developed, manufactured, and sold by the following companies, among others.

===Roche===
The 454 DNA sequencer was the first next-generation sequencer to become commercially successful.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lin Liu |author2=Yinhu Li |author3=Siliang Li |author4=Ni Hu |author5=Yimin He |author6=Ray Pong |author7=Danni Lin |author8=Lihua Lu |author9=Maggie Law |title = Comparison of Next-Generation Sequencing Systems|journal = Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology|volume = |issue = |pages = |pmid = |doi = |url = http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2012/251364/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by 454 Life Sciences and purchased by Roche in 2007. 454 utilizes the detection of pyrophosphate released by the DNA polymerase reaction when adding a nucleotide to the template strain.

Roche currently manufactures two systems based on their pyrosequencing technology: the GS FLX+ and the GS Junior System.&lt;ref&gt;[http://454.com/products/index.asp Products : 454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The GS FLX+ System promises read lengths of approximately 1000 base pairs while the GS Junior System promises 400 base pair reads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://454.com/products/gs-flx-system/index.asp Products - GS FLX+ System : 454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://454.com/products/gs-junior-system/index.asp Products - GS Junior System : 454 Life Sciences, a Roche Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A predecessor to GS FLX+, the 454 GS FLX Titanium system was released in 2008, achieving an output of 0.7G of data per run, with 99.9% accuracy after quality filter, and a read length of up to 700bp. In 2009, Roche launched the GS Junior, a bench top version of the 454 sequencer with read length up to 400bp, and simplified library preparation and data processing.

One of the advantages of 454 systems is their running speed, Manpower can be reduced with automation of library preparation and semi-automation of emulsion PCR. A disadvantage of the 454 system is that it is prone to errors when estimating the number of bases in a long string of identical nucleotides. This is referred to as a homopolymer error and occurs when there are 6 or more identical bases in row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mardis|first=Elaine R.|title=Next-Generation DNA Sequencing Methods|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|date=1 September 2008|volume=9|issue=1|pages=387–402|doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.9.081307.164359|pmid=18576944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage is that the price of reagents is relatively more expensive compared with other next-generation sequencers.

In 2013 Roche announced that they would be shutting down development of 454 technology and phasing out 454 machines completely in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/roche-shutting-down-454-sequencing-business Roche Shutting Down 454 Sequencing Business&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio-itworld.com/2013/4/23/roche-shuts-down-third-generation-ngs-research-programs.html Roche Shuts Down Third-Generation NGS Research Programs&lt;/ref&gt;

Roche produces a number of software tools which are optimised for the analysis of 454 sequencing data.&lt;ref name=454analysis&gt;[http://454.com/products-solutions/analysis-tools/gs-de-novo-assembler.asp Products - Analysis Software : 454 Life Science, a Roche Company]&lt;/ref&gt; GS Run Processor&lt;ref&gt;[http://sequence.otago.ac.nz/download/ManualPartB.pdf Genome Sequencer FLX System Software Manual, version 2.3]&lt;/ref&gt; converts raw images generated by a sequencing run into intensity values. The process consists of two main steps: image processing and signal processing. The software also applies normalization, signal correction, base-calling and quality scores for individual reads. The software outputs data in Standard Flowgram Format (or SFF) files to be used in data analysis applications (GS De Novo Assembler, GS Reference Mapper or GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer). GS De Novo Assembler is a tool for ''de novo'' assembly of whole-genomes up to 3GB in size from shotgun reads alone or combined with paired end data generated by 454 sequencers. It also supports de novo assembly of transcripts (including analysis), and also isoform variant detection.&lt;ref name=454analysis /&gt; GS Reference Mapper maps short reads to a reference genome, generating a consensus sequence. The software is able to generate output files for assessment, indicating insertions, deletions and SNPs. Can handle large and complex genomes of any size.&lt;ref name=454analysis /&gt; Finally, the GS Amplicon Variant Analyzer aligns reads from amplicon samples against a reference, identifying variants (linked or not) and their frequencies. It can also be used to detect unknown and low-frequency variants. It includes graphical tools for analysis of alignments.&lt;ref name=454analysis /&gt;

===Illumina===
[[File:GA2.JPG|thumbnail|Illumina Genome Analyzer II sequencing machine]]
[[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] produces a number of next-generation sequencing machines using technology acquired from [[Manteia Predictive Medicine]] and developed by Solexa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-11-05/solexas-progress-is-in-the-genes Solexa's Progress Is In The Genes - Businessweek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Illumina makes a number of next generation sequencing machines using this technology including the HiSeq, Genome Analyzer IIx, MiSeq and the HiScanSQ, which can also process [[DNA microarray|microarrays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illumina.com/systems.ilmn Illumina Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology leading to these DNA sequencers was first released by Solexa in 2006 as the Genome Analyzer.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;  Illumina purchased Solexa in 2007. The Genome Analyzer uses a sequencing by synthesis method. The first model produced 1G per run. During the year 2009 the output was increased from 20G per run in August to 50G per run in December. In 2010 Illumina released the HiSeq 2000 with an output of 200 and then 600G per run which would take 8 days. At its release the HiSeq 2000 provided one of the cheapest sequencing platforms at $0.02 per million bases as costed by the [[Beijing Genomics Institute]].

In 2011 Illumina released a benchtop sequencer called the MiSeq. At its release the MiSeq could generate 1.5G per run with paired end 150bp reads. A sequencing run can be performed in 10 hours when using automated DNA sample preparation.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

The Illumina HiSeq uses two software tools to calculate the number and position of DNA clusters to assess the sequencing quality: the HiSeq control system and the real-time analyzer. These methods help to assess if nearby clusters are interfering with each other.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

===Life Technologies===
[[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]] (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) produces DNA sequencers under the [[Applied Biosystems]] and [[Ion Torrent]] brands. Applied Biosystems makes the SOLiD next-generation sequencing platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermofisher.com/appliedbiosystems SOLiD]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sanger-based DNA sequencers such as the 3500 Genetic Analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/sequencing/sanger-sequencing.html Sanger Sequencing | Life Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Ion Torrent brand, Applied Biosystems produces four next-generation sequencers: the Ion PGM System, Ion Proton System, Ion S5 and Ion S5xl systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thermofisher.com/iontorrent Ion Torrent&lt;/ref&gt;. The company is also believed to be developing their new capillary DNA sequencer called SeqStudio that will be released early 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/products-and-services/promotions/life-science/seqstudio-genetic-analyzer.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

SOLiD systems was acquired by Applied Biosystems in 2006. SOLiD applies sequencing by ligation and [[2 base encoding|dual base encoding]]. The first SOLiD system was launched in 2007, generating reading lengths of 35bp and 3G data per run. After five upgrades, the 5500xl sequencing system was released in 2010, considerably increasing read length to 85bp, improving accuracy up to 99.99% and producing 30G per 7-day run.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

The limited read length of the SOLiD has remained a significant shortcoming&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/absite/us/en/home/applications-technologies/solid-next-generation-sequencing.html SOLiD system accuracy]&lt;/ref&gt; and has to some extent limited its use to experiments where read length is less vital such as resequencing and transcriptome analysis and more recently ChIP-Seq and methylation experiments.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt; The DNA sample preparation time for SOLiD systems has become much quicker with the automation of sequencing library preparations such as the Tecan system.&lt;ref name="Comparison Next-Gen Seq" /&gt;

The colour space data produced by the SOLiD platform can be decoded into DNA bases for further analysis, however software that considers the original colour space information can give more accurate results. Life Technologies has released BioScope,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifetechnologies.com/au/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing/solid-next-generation-sequencing/solid-next-generation-sequencing-data-analysis-solutions/solid-bioscope-software.html SOLiD BioScope Software | Life Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; a data analysis package for resequencing, ChiP-Seq and transcriptome analysis. It uses the MaxMapper algorithm to map the colour space reads.

===Beckman Coulter===
[[Beckman Coulter]] (now [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher]]) has previously manufactured chain termination and capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencers under the model name CEQ, including the CEQ 8000.  The company now produces the GeXP Genetic Analysis System, which uses [[dye terminator sequencing]]. This method uses a [[thermocycler]] in much the same way as [[PCR]] to denature, anneal, and extend DNA fragments, amplifying the sequenced fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rai|first=Alex J.|author2=Kamath, Rashmi M. |author3=Gerald, William |author4= Fleisher, Martin |title=Analytical validation of the GeXP analyzer and design of a workflow for cancer-biomarker discovery using multiplexed gene-expression profiling|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|date=29 October 2008|volume=393|issue=5|pages=1505–1511|doi=10.1007/s00216-008-2436-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beckmancoulter.com/wsrportal/wsr/research-and-discovery/products-and-services/genetic-analysis-systems/genomelab-gexp-genetic-analysis-system/index.htm#overview Beckman Coulter, Inc - GenomeLab GeXP Genetic Analysis System]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific Biosciences===
[[Pacific Biosciences]] produces the PacBio RS and Sequel sequencing systems using a [[single molecule real time sequencing]], or SMRT, method.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pacb.com/products-and-services/pacbio-systems/ Pacific Biosciences: PacBio Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; This system can produce read lengths of multiple thousands of base pairs.  Higher raw read errors are corrected using either circular consensus - where the same strand is read over and over again - or using optimized [[Sequence assembly|assembly]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koren|first=S |author2=Schatz, MC |author3=Walenz, BP |author4=Martin, J |author5=Howard, JT |author6=Ganapathy, G |author7=Wang, Z |author8=Rasko, DA |author9=McCombie, WR |author10=Jarvis, ED |author11=Phillippy, AM|title=Hybrid error correction and de novo assembly of single-molecule sequencing reads.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=Jul 1, 2012|pmid=22750884|doi=10.1038/nbt.2280|volume=30|issue=7|pages=693–700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have reported 99.9999% accuracy with these strategies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n6/full/nmeth.2474.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Sequel system was launched in 2015 with an increased capacity and a lower price.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio-itworld.com/2015/10/1/a-worthy-sequel.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genomeweb.com/business-news/pacbio-launches-higher-throughput-lower-cost-single-molecule-sequencing-system&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxford Nanopore ===
[[Oxford Nanopore Technologies]] has begun shipping early versions of its [[nanopore sequencing]] MinION sequencer to selected labs. The device is four inches long and gets power from a [[USB port]]. MinION decodes DNA directly as the molecule is drawn at the rate of 450 bases/second through a [[nanopore]] suspended in a membrane. Changes in electric current indicate which base is present. It is 60 to 85 percent accurate, compared with 99.9 percent in conventional machines. Even inaccurate results may prove useful because it produces long read lengths. GridION is a slightly larger sequencer that processes up to five MinION flow cells at once. PromethION is another (unreleased) product that will use as many as 100,000 pores in parallel, more suitable for high volume sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/530746/radical-new-dna-sequencer-finally-gets-into-researchers-hands|title = Radical New DNA Sequencer Finally Gets into Researchers’ Hands|last = Regalado|first = Antonio|date = September 17, 2014|work = Technology Review|accessdate = October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Picswiss AI-04-02.jpg|thumb|300px|Dispersed settlement or ''Streusiedlung'' in [[Brülisau]], [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Switzerland]]]]
A '''dispersed settlement''', also known as a '''scattered settlement''', is one of the main types of [[Human settlement|settlement]] patterns used by [[Landscape history|landscape historians]] to classify [[rural]] settlements found in [[England]] and other parts of the world.  Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Muir, ''The NEW Reading the Landscape'', University of Exeter Press&lt;/ref&gt; A dispersed settlement contrasts with a [[nucleated village]].

The French term ''[[bocage]]'' is sometimes used to describe the type of landscape found where dispersed settlements are common.

In addition to Western Europe, dispersed patterns of settlement are found in parts of [[Papua New Guinea]], as among the Gainj, Ankave, and Baining tribes. It is also frequently met with in normadic pastoral societies.

==England==
In England, dispersed settlements are often found in the areas of ancient enclosure outside the central region—for example, [[Essex]], [[Kent]] and the [[West Country]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts &amp; Rathmell, ''An Atlas of Rural Settlement in England'', English Heritage&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a dispersed settlement given by [[William George Hoskins|W G Hoskins]] is [[Middle Barton]] in [[Steeple Barton]], [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of the English Landscape''. However, he uses the term "fragmented village".&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some parts of England, the pattern of dispersed settlement has remained unchanged for many hundreds of years. Many of the locations found in [[Domesday]] may be dispersed farmsteads.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tvg.bham.ac.uk/laxton/TTSN2002.pdf Keith Challis, Settlement Morphology and Medieval Planning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006080936/http://www.tvg.bham.ac.uk/laxton/TTSN2002.pdf |date=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes possible to identify documentary references to farmsteads in the 18th or 19th centuries with these Domesday entries.&lt;ref&gt;[[William George Hoskins|W G Hoskins]], ''Fieldwork in Local History''&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas of Kent and Essex close to London, development of residential housing during the 20th century has often disguised the dispersed nature of the original settlement.

The farmsteads which make up the dispersed settlement are often surrounded by small irregularly shaped fields.  Traditionally, trees are encouraged to grow at the edges of these fields and in thin strips alongside roads. However, during the 20th century, much of this woodland disappeared, either as a result of disease or modern farming practice. [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]'s description of the view from [[Langdon Hills]], "dark lanes intersected with numberless hedges and woods,"&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Young, ''A Six Weeks' Tour through the Southern Counties of England and Wales''&lt;/ref&gt; is a typical description of the landscape in an area of dispersed settlements.

==Italy==
Anthony Galt has written an extensive study of the dispersed settlement pattern around [[Locorotondo]] in the [[Province of Bari]] in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Galt, ''Far from the Church Bells'' (CUP, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Curtis, https://www.academia.edu/1933250/Is_there_an_agro-town_model_for_Southern_Italy_Exploring_the_diverse_roots_and_development_of_the_agro-town_structure_through_a_comparative_case_study_in_Apulia&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the settlement pattern developed because of movement from the town to the countryside in the 19th century. [[Emphyteutic lease]]s were used by landowners seeking to increase their income from land that was only marginally attractive for agriculture by encouraging the creation of [[vineyard]]s.

==German-speaking Europe==
{{see|Talschaft}}
Known as ''Streusiedlungen'' (singular ''Streusiedlung''), dispersed settlements are a characteristic of various parts of [[German-speaking Europe]], including in areas of [[Westphalia]], historically the [[Ruhr]] urban area (the dispersed settlements lending themselves to the development of [[urban sprawl]] after industrialisation), the Austro-Bavarian parts of the [[valleys of the Alps|Alps]] ([[Upper Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[South Tyrol]]) as well as [[Alamanni|Alamannic]] parts of the Alps ([[Bernese Oberland]], [[Central Switzerland]], [[Grisons]]).

'''Edwardian Baroque''' is the [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]] architectural style of many public buildings built in the [[British Empire]] during the [[Edwardian era]] (1901–1910).

==Description==
The characteristic features of the Edwardian Baroque style were drawn from two main sources: the architecture of France during the 18th century and that of Sir [[Christopher Wren]] in [[England]] during the 17th—part of the [[English Baroque]]. [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]] was a major exponent, designing many commercial buildings in what he termed 'the Grand Style' during the later 1910s and 1920s. This period of British architectural history is considered a particularly retrospective one, since it is contemporary with [[Art Nouveau]].

Typical details of Edwardian Baroque architecture include extensive [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]], usually more extreme at ground level, often running into and exaggerating the [[voussoir]]s of arched openings (derived from French models); domed corner rooftop pavilions and a central taller tower-like element creating a lively rooftop silhouette; revived Italian Baroque elements such as exaggerated keystones, segmental arched pediments, columns with engaged blocks, attached block-like rustication to window surrounds; [[colonnades]] of (sometimes paired) columns in the [[Ionic order]] and domed towers modelled closely on Wren's for the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]]. Some Edwardian Baroque buildings include details from other sources, such as the [[Dutch gable]]s of [[Norman Shaw]]'s [[Le Meridien Hotel Piccadilly|Piccadilly Hotel]] in [[London]].

The '''European Association for Digital Humanities''' ('''EADH'''), formerly known as the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC), is a [[digital humanities]] organisation founded in [[London]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;History of Humanities Computing, in: A Companion to Digital Humanities (2004), ed. Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth. Oxford: Blackwell|work= http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to promote the advancement of education in the digital humanities through the development and use of computational methods in research and teaching in the Humanities and related disciplines, especially literary and linguistic computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Constitution |work=EADH.org |url=http://www.allc.org/constitution | date=15 July 2013| accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Association joined the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO).&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalhumanities.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
A precursor for the later following annual conferences of the association was a meeting on literary and linguistic computing organized by Roy Wisbey and Michael Farringdon at the [[University of Cambridge]] in March, 1970. The year after the second conference in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]], in 1972, the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing was founded at a meeting at [[King's College, London]] (1973).&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Together with the [[Association for Computers and the Humanities]] (ACH) and the [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] (ACL), the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing sponsored and organized the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tei-c.org/About/history.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 the Association's name was changed to the European Association for Digital Humanities, while keeping the allc.org domain name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= ALLC: Proposed Name Change |date= 20 December 2011 |url= http://www.allc.org/news-events/allc-proposed-name-change |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120211210537/http://www.allc.org/news-events/allc-proposed-name-change |archivedate= 11 February 2012 |accessdate= 20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change to 'EADH' was made in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conference ==
The first conferences of the association were held annually until 1988, when a protocol was agreed with the Association for Computing in the Humanities for co-sponsorship of joint international conferences. The venue for these joint conferences alternated between Europe and North America. The first one took place in 1989 at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada. After the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] had been formed in 2005, the first joint conference with the new name “Digital Humanities” was held at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Conferences, www.allc.org/conferences; for the 2006 conference, see http://www.allc-ach2006.colloques.paris-sorbonne.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journals ==
Initially, EADH published its own ''Bulletin'' three times a year; its journal twice yearly from 1980 to 1985.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Afterwards, bulletin and journal were merged in order to become ''[[Literary and Linguistic Computing]]'' (LLC) in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Terras, Melissa (2005). “Disciplined: Using Curriculum Studies to Define 'Humanities Computing’”, http://pear.hcmc.uvic.ca:8080/ach/site/xhtml.xq?id=43.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary and Linguistic Computing is a peer-reviewed, international journal that publishes texts "on all aspects of computing and information technology applied to literature and language research and teaching."&lt;ref&gt;http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership of the association is by subscription to LLC.&lt;ref&gt;ALLC Membership,http://www.allc.org/about/membership&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010 there were 314 individual subscribers to Literary and Linguistic Computing.&lt;ref&gt;ALLC Membership Report December 2010, http://www.allc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/ALLC_Membership_report_December_2010.pdf.

Here one must know the [[bond length]]s &lt;math&gt;l_i&lt;/math&gt;, [[bond angle]]s &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[dihedral angle]]s &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; (note that the sequence of dihedral angles is specified using angle 0 as ''trans''). Applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates will describe the same three-dimensional structure using the Flory convention.

'''Harry Underwood''' (1969) is a painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels. His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry has been labelled an [[outsider artist]], a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned often taking months prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Harry's work that "what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of [[Edward Hopper]] meets [[Salvador Dali]] meets [[Andy Warhol]]."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is popularly known by his first name "Harry", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nolan |first1=Joe |title=Harry Underwood at Estel Gallery |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/arts-culture/article/13017001/harry-underwood-at-estel-gallery |website=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Harry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, FL. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God pentecostal church with them until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Harry cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, FL. He was uprooted by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 and spent time in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA before settling in Nashville, TN where he found work in the construction industry. He began painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry's work is infused with romanticism and an undercurrent of nostalgia for a life not necessarily experienced, but wished for. Repeated images flesh out his work; bathing beauties, motel pools, vintage cars, commercial signs, palm trees, old bicycles, and dancing couples. There is a sense of mid-twentieth century Americana in his works which evokes nostalgia or longing for the vacation one never got to take, or the life one might have lived in the past, with touches of irony and commercialization that relate to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harry Underwood |url=https://www.justfolk.com/product-category/outsider-art/underwood/ |website=Just Folk |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Harry first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville, TN. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working.

His first major solo show was titled "A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville, TN in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at numerous leading galleries and institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to "Outsider Artist" Label ==

Though labeled an outsider artist, Harry avoids the term. When asked about it once by a University of North Carolina (Wilmington) researcher, he answered "I don’t think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don’t consider myself part of a movement. I wasn’t aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don’t expect I’ll be tied to folk art forever. It wouldn’t be bad if I was. A friend recently called it “Americana,” and I kind of like that." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Louise Smith |first1=Emily |title=A Conversation with Harry Underwood |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/464134/pdf |website=John Hopkins University |publisher=University of North Carolina, Wilmington |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
* Invade the Wild Kingdom
* Location is Not Essential
* Fine Weather From A Friendly Place
* Landmark Preservation - Measuring 4' x 6', Landmark Preservation is one of Harry Underwood's largest works. It is on long-term display at the [[Belcourt Theatre]] in Nashville, TN. The painting is a commentary on the uncertainty created when rapidly developing cities start to demolish historical buildings in order to make room for new construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2016/01/landmark-preservation-new-painting-opinion-nashville-artist-harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hydrogen anion''', H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, is a [[Electric charge|negative]] [[ion]] of hydrogen, &lt;!-- don’t link as [[hydrogen ion]], it’s a set index! --&gt;that is, a [[hydrogen atom]] that has captured an extra electron. The hydrogen anion is an important constituent of the atmosphere of [[star]]s, such as the [[Sun]].  In chemistry, this ion is called '''[[hydride]]'''. The ion has [[Two-electron atom|two electrons]] bound by the [[electromagnetic force]] to a nucleus containing one proton.

The binding energy of H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; equals the binding energy of an extra electron to a hydrogen atom, called [[electron affinity]] of hydrogen. It is measured to be {{val|0.754195|(19)|ul=eV}} or {{val|0.0277161|(62)|ul=hartree}} (see [[Electron affinity (data page)]]). The total ground state energy thus becomes {{val|-14.359888|u=eV}}.

==Occurrence==
The hydrogen anion is an important species in the photosphere of the Sun. It absorbs energies in the range 0.75–4.0 [[electronvolt|eV]], which ranges from the [[infrared]] into the [[visible spectrum]] ({{harvnb|Rau|1999}}, {{harvnb|Srinivasan|1999}}). It also occurs in the Earth's [[ionosphere]] ({{harvnb|Rau|1999}}), and can be produced in particle accelerators.

Its existence was first proven theoretically by [[Hans Bethe]] in 1929 ({{harvnb|Bethe|1929}}). H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is unusual because, in its free form, it has no [[bound state|bound]] [[energy level|excited states]], as was finally proven in 1977 ({{harvnb|Hill|1977}}). It has been studied experimentally using [[particle accelerator]]s ({{harvnb|Bryant|1977}}).

In chemistry, the [[hydride]] anion is hydrogen that has the formal [[oxidation state]] −1.

The term hydride is probably most often used to describe compounds of hydrogen with other elements in which the hydrogen is in the formal −1 [[oxidation state]].  In most such compounds the bonding between the hydrogen and its nearest neighbor is covalent. An example of a hydride is the [[borohydride]] anion ({{chem|BH|4|-}}).

The '''''Journal of Law and Religion''''' is a peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary journal published through [[Cambridge University Press]] and edited by the [[Center for the Study of Law and Religion]] at [[Emory University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-religion|title=Journal of Law and Religion|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary interests include topics related to the relationship between religion and law, including subjects related to theological [[jurisprudence]] and [[political theology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The journal was founded at [[Hamline University School of Law]] by the Harvard Law professor [[Harold J. Berman]] in 1982 along with Stephen B.Young, then Dean of the law school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamline.edu/HUNewsDetail.aspx?id=2110|title=Journal of Law &amp; Religion Salutes 25 Years of "Building Community and Deepening Understanding"|last=|first=|date=|website=Hamline University Law School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council on Religion and Law and Harvard Divinity School Professor [[James Luther Adams]] were also instrumental in starting the Journal. The goal of the Journal was to provide multiple frameworks of analysis for the study and discussion of structures of positive law. The Journal moved to the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at [[Emory University School of Law|Emory]] in 2013, two years prior to Hamline's merger with [[William Mitchell College of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationaljurist.com/national-jurist-magazine/journal-law-and-religion-moves-hamline-emory|title=Journal of Law and Religion moves from Hamline to Emory|last=|first=|date=8 August 2013|website=The National Jurist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jožef Stefan Institute''' ('''IJS''') ({{lang-sl|Institut "Jožef Stefan"}}) is the largest research [[institute]] in [[Slovenia]]. The main research areas are [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technologies]], [[physics|reactor physics]], [[energy]] and [[Natural environment|environment]]. At the beginning of the 2013 the institute had 962 employees, 404 of them were [[Ph.D]] [[scientists]].

The mission of the Jožef Stefan Institute is the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge at the frontiers of natural science and technology to the benefit of society at large through the pursuit of education, learning, research, and development of high technology at the highest international levels of excellence.

==History==
The institute was founded by Yugoslav State Security in 1949 for atomic weapons research. Initially, the [[Vinča Nuclear Institute]] in Belgrade was established in 1948, followed by Rudjer Boskovic in Zagreb in 1949 and the Jožef Stefan Institute as an Institute for Physics in the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. It is named after the distinguished 19th-century physicist [[Josef Stefan|Jožef Stefan]], best known for his work on the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] of [[Black body|black-body]] radiation.

IJS is today involved in a wide variety of fields of scientific and economic interest. After close to 60 years of scientific achievement, the institute has become part of the image of [[Slovenia]].

Over the last 60 years it has created a number of important institutions, such as the [[University of Nova Gorica]], the Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mps.si/splet/index.asp?lang=eng|title=The 2013/2014 CALL FOR ENROLMENT to postgraduate study programmes|publisher=Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ljubljana Technology park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tp-lj.si/|title=Tehnološki Park Ljubljana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kahn system''' is an industrial construction technique for reinforcement of buildings that was engineered and patented by [[Julius Kahn (inventor)|Julius Kahn]]. The Kahn system is an industrial construction design using the Kahn Trussed Bar as the bases. This steel bar was a new type of reinforcing bar used in concrete and had unique engineered features to distribute stress.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|pp=31&amp;ndash;33}}

Kahn saw problems with the concrete reinforcement systems used in building construction at the end of the 19th century. The existing technique of construction of the time was using concrete with a plain straight steel in the center of a concrete beam. The steel in the concrete would slip if there was even the tiniest bit of room between the hardened concrete and the steel and it would break adhesion. The main reinforcing bar had plain steel beam members rigidly attached to it. This diagonal tension fractured the reinforcing bar beams since the adhesion was broken. This caused weakness in the concrete/steel reinforced beam and a failure that could cause catastrophic results. The problem was that the plain steel beam separated from the concrete causing a failure since the two materials were no longer working together for strength.&lt;ref name="KahnEngineer"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt1q2nc2q9;NAAN=13030&amp;chunk.id=ss1.4 | title=The George H. Scripps Memorial Marine Biological Laboratory of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego | publisher=Scripps Institution of Oceanography | author=Shor, George G. | author2=Shor, Elizabeth Noble | author3=Spiess, Fred Noel | journal=SIO Reference | year=1979 | issue=79–26 | pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A reinforced beam bar in the early 1900s consisted of a plain straight steel in the center of a molded concrete form. The beam would fail along the lines of principal stresses in the concrete through shearing. The plain straight steel was placed into an encased mold and concrete was poured in. This formulated mixture of steel and concrete then hardened and became the reinforced beam bar. But in some cases there was a tiny air gap between the steel and the hardened concrete which allowed the steel to move and slip. This weakened the reinforced beam from its original full strength capability. This meant then this weakened fractured beam could fail and break under the heavy load of the building it was supporting.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=47}}

Kahn discovered that concrete was much stronger in compression than tension, so devised the idea of distributing the stresses.&lt;ref name="SedlarReport"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/98436/Sedlar_Engineering_Industrial_Architecture.pdf | title=Engineering Industrial Architecture: Albert Kahn and the Trussed Concrete Steel Company | publisher=University of Michigan | date=June 24, 2013 | author=Sedlar, Frank | journal=2012–2013 MLibrary Undergraduate Research Award Maize Award for Single-Term  Projects | format=PDF | ref={{sfnRef|Sedlar|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did scientific engineering experiments and created the concept that if the steel beam edges were bent back at a 45-degree angle forming projecting tabs or "wings" before going into the molded form led to better stress distribution.{{sfnm|1a1=Bucci|1y=2002|1p=31|2a1=Skinner|2y=1997|2p=13}} The winged sheared members are cut and turned up to form an angle from the thin edge of the steel bar but are still permanently attached.{{sfn|Webb|Gibson|1916|p=48}} When the wet concrete mixture was poured and hardened there was no slippage of the steel beam because the tension stress is distributed throughout the beam.{{sfn|Ferry|1970|p=11}}

This new style constructed steel beam was called "the Kahn trussed bar", sometimes shortened to just "the Kahn bar".{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=31}} The trussed steel bar had bent-up "wings" on each side. The "wings" on the steel bar provided 20–30% additional strength to a reinforced concrete beam over the old technology of plain straight smooth steel bars or rods.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=47}} The primary concept of the Kahn bar was that it gave reinforcement in both the vertical and horizontal plane while it simplified construction.{{sfnm|1a1=Bucci|1y=2002|1p=31|2a1=Buel|2y=1904|2p=337}} The principal lines of shear stresses in a beam average a 45-degree angle, so the angled "wings" transmitted the tension down to the main reinforcing steel beam.&lt;ref name=SedlarReport/&gt;

The Kahn bar is of high grade steel with an elastic limit of 42,000 pounds and tensile strength of 70,000 pounds per square inch.{{sfn|Trussed Concrete Steel Company|1910|p=8}} Kahn formed his own company in 1903 called [[Trussed Concrete Steel Company]] (aka "Truscon Steel Company") located in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], to manufacture these special steel bars used in reinforced concrete beams.{{sfnm|1a1=Matuz|1y=2002|1p=47|2a1=Ferry|2y=1970|2p=10}}

Another new engineered innovation of Kahn was steel forms built with "ribs" instead of "wings". It was a derivative from Kahn's 1903 patent. This advanced technology was marketed by the Trussed Concrete Steel Company with the brand name of [[Hy-Rib]] products.{{sfn|Hughes|Allen|Hecht|2001|p=142}} The Kahn System of reinforced concrete is the first time an automobile factory was constructed; it was for [[Packard Automotive Plant|Packard automobile factory plant building number 10]] designed in 1903–05.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=31|ps=. "Thus Plant Number Ten represented a clear advance in factory construction for Packard and for the automobile industry in general, as it was the first automobile plant to be built of reinforced concrete."}}{{sfn|Sedlar|2013|p=31|ps=. "The Packard #10 building was the first to utilize reinforced concrete with Julius Kahn's Kahn Bar but also as previously discussed, the full range of steel building products from the Trussed Concrete Steel Company."}}&lt;ref name="Bentley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-0420?rgn=main;view=text | title=Albert Kahn papers | publisher=University of Michigan | work=Bentley Historical Library | date=January 14, 2004 | accessdate=July 30, 2014 | author=Kahn, Albert | editor=Bund, Sally Linvill | quote=Kahn's first factory built of reinforced concrete in Detroit was Building Number 10 for the Packard Motor Company (1905).}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=10|ps=. "The first reinforced concrete factory in the country, designed by Albert Kahn, made its appearance in 1903."}} The Kahn system of reinforcement products had been used in over 1500 buildings in the United States by 1907.{{sfn|Cody|2005|p=38}}

==Kahn trussed bar applications==
Kahn's patented invention is a steel bar of 45-degree diagonal "wings" as several minor members that are rigidly attached to the main member.{{sfn|Cody|2005|p=37}} The idea of the "wing" technique is that the stresses are distributed throughout the main reinforced beam.&lt;ref name=KahnEngineer/&gt; The steel then doesn't slip within the hardened concrete.&lt;ref name=KahnEngineer/&gt;

State-enforced laws can be made by a collective [[legislature]] or by a single legislator, resulting in [[statute]]s, by the executive through [[decree]]s and [[regulation]]s, or established by judges through [[precedent]], normally in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding [[contract]]s, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a [[constitution]], written or tacit, and the [[rights]] encoded therein. The law shapes [[politics]], [[economics]], [[history]] and [[society]] in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.

A general distinction can be made between (a) [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s, in which a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates their laws, and (b) [[common law]] systems, where judge-made [[precedent]] is accepted as [[Legally binding|binding]] law. Historically, [[religious law]]s played a significant role even in settling of secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities. Islamic [[Sharia law]] is the world's most widely used religious law, and is used as the primary legal system in some countries, such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law|title=What is sharia law?|work=brightknowledge.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019060625/http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/law-and-politics/spotlight-on-law/what-is-sharia-law/|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjudication of the law is generally divided into two main areas. [[Criminal law]] deals with conduct that is considered harmful to [[social order]] and in which the [[guilt (law)|guilty]] party may be imprisoned or fined. [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]] (not to be confused with civil law jurisdictions above) deals with the resolution of [[lawsuits]] (disputes) between individuals or organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cscja-acjcs.ca/criminal_civil_law-en.asp?l=4|title=Criminal and Civil Law|website=www.cscja-acjcs.ca|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into [[legal history]], [[philosophy]], [[economic analysis of law|economic analysis]] and [[sociology of law|sociology]]. Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and [[justice]].

== Definition ==
{{Main|Definition of law|Analytical jurisprudence}}

=== Mainstream definitions ===
Numerous definitions of ''law'' have been put forward over the centuries. The ''Third New International Dictionary'' from Merriam-Webster&lt;ref&gt;''Third New International Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, Inc., Springfield, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; defines law as: "Law is a binding custom or practice of a community; a rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority or is made obligatory by a [[sanction (law)|sanction]] (as an edict, decree, rescript, order, ordinance, statute, resolution, rule, judicial decision, or usage) made, recognized, or enforced by the controlling authority."

The ''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' published by Scribner's in 1973 defined the concept of law accordingly as: "A legal system is the most explicit, institutionalized, and complex mode of regulating human conduct. At the same time, it plays only one part in the congeries of rules which influence behavior, for social and moral rules of a less institutionalized kind are also of great importance."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', Charles Scribner's Sons, Editor Philip P. Weiner, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whether it is possible or desirable to define law ===
There have been several attempts to produce "a universally acceptable definition of law". In 1972, one source indicated that no such definition could be produced.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence. Third Edition 1972. Page 39"&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; McCoubrey and White said that the question "what is law?" has no simple answer.&lt;ref&gt;Mc Coubrey, Hilaire and White, Nigel D. ''Textbook on Jurisprudence''. Second Edition. [[Blackstone Press Limited]]. 1996. {{ISBN|1-85431-582-X}}. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glanville Williams]] said that the meaning of the word "law" depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, "[[early customary law]]" and "[[municipal law]]" were contexts where the word "law" had two different and irreconcilable meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Glanville. International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Meaning of the Word "Law". Revised version published in Laslett (Editor), ''Philosophy, Politics and Society'' (1956) p. 134 et seq. The original was published in (1945) 22 [[British Year Book of International Law|BYBIL]] 146.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thurman Arnold]] said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word "law" and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thurman. ''The Symbols of Government''. 1935. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word "law" (e.g. "let's forget about generalities and get down to [[Case law|cases]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Lloyd of Hampstead]]. ''Introduction to Jurisprudence''. Third Edition. Stevens &amp; Sons. London. 1972. Second Impression. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Milkau Oberer Teil der Stele mit dem Text von Hammurapis Gesetzescode 369-2.jpg|thumb|King [[Hammurabi]] is revealed the [[Code of Hammurabi|code of laws]] by the Mesopotamian sun god [[Shamash]], also revered as the god of justice.]]

The history of law links closely to the development of [[civilization]]. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian law, dating as far back as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books. It was based on the concept of [[Ma'at]], characterised by tradition, [[rhetoric]]al speech, social equality and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Théodoridés|title = law | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VerSteeg, ''Law in ancient Egypt''&lt;/ref&gt; By the 22nd century&amp;nbsp;BC, the ancient [[Sumer]]ian ruler [[Ur-Nammu]] had formulated the first [[Code of Ur-Nammu|law code]], which consisted of [[Casuistry|casuistic]] statements ("if … then ..."). Around 1760&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Hammurabi|King Hammurabi]] further developed [[Babylonian law]], by codifying and inscribing it in stone. Hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of Babylon as [[Stele|stelae]], for the entire public to see; this became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]. The most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the 19th century by British [[Assyriologists]], and has since been fully [[transliterated]] and translated into various languages, including English, Italian, German, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''Hammurabi's Laws'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old Testament]] dates back to 1280&amp;nbsp;BC and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society. The small [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] city-state, ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], from about the 8th century BC was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry, excluding women and the [[slavery|slave]] class. However, Athens had no legal science or single word for "law",&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law (''thémis''), human decree (''nomos'') and custom (''díkē'').&lt;ref&gt;J.P. Mallory, "Law", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', 346&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Ancient Greek law]] contained major [[Solonian Constitution|constitutional]] innovations in the development of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Ober, ''The Nature of Athenian Democracy'', 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman law]] was heavily influenced by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, ''A Short History of Western Legal Theory'', 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the [[Roman Empire]], law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name="St107"&gt;As a legal system, Roman law has affected the development of law worldwide. It also forms the basis for the law codes of most countries of continental Europe and has played an important role in the creation of the idea of a common European culture (Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 2, 104–107).&lt;/ref&gt; Although codes were replaced by [[custom (law)|custom]] and [[case law]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin [[legal maxim]]s (called [[brocard (law)|brocards]]) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of [[precedent]] which later became the [[common law]]. A Europe-wide [[Law Merchant]] was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property.&lt;ref&gt;Sealey-Hooley, ''Commercial Law'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; As [[nationalism]] grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The [[Napoleonic Code|Napoleonic]] and [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]] Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging.&lt;ref&gt;Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71&lt;/ref&gt; EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the [[European Court of Justice]].

[[File:Constitution of India.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Constitution of India]] is the longest written constitution for a country, containing 444 articles, 12 schedules, numerous amendments and 117,369 words.]]

Ancient [[Law of India|India]] and [[Chinese law|China]] represent distinct traditions of law, and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', probably compiled around 100&amp;nbsp;AD (although it contains older material), and the ''[[Manusmriti]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;100–300&amp;nbsp;AD) were foundational treatises in India, and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the composition and dating of these sources, see Olivelle, ''Manu's Code of Law'', 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Manu's central philosophy was tolerance and [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and was cited across Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 276&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, along with Islamic law, was supplanted by the common law when India became part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 273&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysia, Brunei, [[Law of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Law of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] also adopted the common law. The eastern Asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 287&lt;/ref&gt; Japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines, by importing bits of the [[Code Civil|French]], but mostly the German Civil Code.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 304&lt;/ref&gt; This partly reflected Germany's status as a rising power in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century. Similarly, [[traditional Chinese law]] gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the Japanese model of German law.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Law of the Republic of China|Taiwanese law]] retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period, because of the split between [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalists, who fled there, and [[Mao Zedong]]'s communists who won control of the mainland in 1949. The current legal infrastructure in the People's Republic of China was heavily influenced by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Socialist law]], which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; Due to rapid industrialisation, today China is undergoing a process of reform, at least in terms of economic, if not social and political, rights. A new contract code in 1999 represented a move away from administrative domination.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after negotiations lasting fifteen years, in 2001 China joined the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah, ''Five Years of China WTO Membership'', 263–304&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of law is commonly known as (general) jurisprudence. Normative jurisprudence asks "what should law be?", while analytic jurisprudence asks "what is law?" [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]]'s [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] answer was that law is "commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience".&lt;ref name="jap"&gt;Bix, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/austin-john/#3 John Austin]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural law]]yers on the other side, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature. The concept of "natural law" emerged in ancient [[Greek philosophy]] concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice, and re-entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]], notably his ''[[Treatise on Law]]''.

[[Hugo Grotius]], the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law, argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as Aristotle had indicated—and reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Berolzheimer]], ''The World's Legal Philosophies'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] believed a moral imperative requires laws "be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant|Kant, Immanuel]], ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals'', 42 (par. 434)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeremy Bentham]] and his student Austin, following [[David Hume]], believed that this conflated the [[Is-ought problem|"is" and what "ought to be"]] problem. Bentham and Austin argued for law's [[legal positivism|positivism]]; that real law is entirely separate from "morality".&lt;ref&gt;Green, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/ Legal Positivism]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant was also criticised by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who rejected the principle of equality, and believed that law emanates from the [[will to power]], and cannot be labelled as "moral" or "immoral".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Zur Genealogie der Moral'', Second Essay, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kazantzakis, ''Friedrich Nietzsche and the Philosophy of Law'', 97–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linarelli, ''Nietzsche in Law's Cathedral'', 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the Austrian philosopher [[Hans Kelsen]] continued the positivist tradition in his book the ''[[Pure Theory of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Marmor, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lawphil-theory/ The Pure Theory of Law]&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality, it is endowed with "normativity", meaning we ought to obey it. While laws are positive "is" statements (e.g. the fine for reversing on a highway ''is'' €500); law tells us what we "should" do. Thus, each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'') instructing us to obey. Kelsen's major opponent, [[Carl Schmitt]], rejected both positivism and the idea of the [[rule of law]] because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bielefeldt, ''Carl Schmitt's Critique of Liberalism'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception ([[state of emergency]]), which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience.&lt;ref name="F171"&gt;Finn, ''Constitutions in Crisis'', 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|Bentham's utilitarian theories remained dominant in law until the 20th century.]]

Later in the 20th century, [[H. L. A. Hart]] attacked Austin for his simplifications and Kelsen for his fictions in ''[[The Concept of Law]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, ''Hart's Legal Philosophy'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Hart argued law is a system of rules, divided into primary (rules of conduct) and secondary ones (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). Two of Hart's students continued the debate: In his book ''[[Law's Empire]]'', [[Ronald Dworkin]] attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. Dworkin argues that law is an "[[interpretivism (legal)|interpretive]] concept",&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, ''[[Law's Empire]]'', 410.&lt;/ref&gt; that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. [[Joseph Raz]], on the other hand, defended the positivist outlook and criticised Hart's "soft social thesis" approach in ''The Authority of Law''.&lt;ref name="jra"&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 3–36&lt;/ref&gt; Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning. In his view, any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to [[sociology]], rather than jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, ''The Authority of Law'', 37 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic analysis ===
{{Main|Law and economics}}

In the 18th century [[Adam Smith]] presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics.&lt;ref&gt;According to Malloy (''Law and Economics'', 114), Smith established "a classical liberal philosophy that made individuals the key referential sign while acknowledging that we live not alone but in community with others".&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. [[antitrust]] law. The most influential proponents, such as [[Richard Posner]] and [[Oliver E. Williamson|Oliver Williamson]] and the so-called [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] of economists and lawyers including [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Gary Becker]], are generally advocates of [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]], and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jakoby, ''Economic Ideas and the Labour Market'', 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard-A-Posner.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Posner]], one of the [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]], runs a blog with [[Bank of Sweden Prize]] winning economist [[Gary Becker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/beckerposner/ |title=The Becker-Posner Blog |accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The most prominent economic analyst of law is 1991 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ronald Coase]], whose first major article, ''[[The Nature of the Firm]]'' (1937), argued that the reason for the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of [[transaction cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Nature of the Firm'', 386–405&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homo economicus|Rational individuals]] trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, ''[[The Problem of Social Cost]]'' (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would [[bargaining|bargain]] with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', 1–44&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref name="Sturges" /&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of [[transaction costs]] may prevent this.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt; So the law ought to pre-empt what ''would'' happen, and be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', V, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;Coase, ''The Problem of Social Cost'', VIII, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociology ===
{{Main|Sociology of law}}

Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with society and overlaps with jurisprudence, philosophy of law, social theory and more specialised subjects such as [[criminology]].&lt;ref name="Jary"&gt;Cotterrell, ''Sociology of Law'', Jary, ''Collins Dictionary of Sociology'', 636&lt;/ref&gt; The institutions of [[social construction]], [[social norms]], dispute processing and [[legal culture]] are key areas for inquiry in this knowledge field. Sociology of law is sometimes seen as a sub-discipline of sociology, but its ties to the academic discipline of law are equally strong, and it is best seen as a transdisciplinary and multidisciplinary study focused on the theorisation and empirical study of legal practices and experiences as social phenomena. In the United States the field is usually called [[law and society]] studies; in Europe it is more often referred to as socio-legal studies. At first, jurists and legal philosophers were suspicious of sociology of law. Kelsen attacked one of its founders, [[Eugen Ehrlich]], who sought to make clear the differences and connections between positive law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law' or social norms that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching barristers and courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, ''Fundamental Principles'', Hertogh, ''Living Law'', Rottleuthner, ''La Sociologie du Droit en Allemagne'', 109, Rottleuthner, ''Rechtstheoritische Probleme der Sociologie des Rechts'', 521&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research in sociology of law is much concerned with the way that law is developing outside discrete state jurisdictions, being produced through social interaction in many different kinds of social arenas, and acquiring a diversity of sources of (often competing or conflicting) authority in communal networks existing sometimes within nation states but increasingly also transnationally.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Law, Culture and Society''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1917.jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Weber]] in 1917, Weber began his career as a lawyer, and is regarded as one of the founders of sociology and sociology of law.]]

Around 1900 [[Max Weber]] defined his "scientific" approach to law, identifying the "legal rational form" as a type of domination, not attributable to personal authority but to the authority of abstract norms.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinstein, ''Max Weber on Law and Economy in Society'', 336&lt;/ref&gt; Formal legal rationality was his term for the key characteristic of the kind of coherent and calculable law that was a precondition for modern political developments and the modern bureaucratic state. Weber saw this law as having developed in parallel with the growth of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Jary" /&gt; Another leading sociologist, [[Émile Durkheim]], wrote in his classic work ''The Division of Labour in Society'' that as society becomes more complex, the body of civil law concerned primarily with restitution and compensation grows at the expense of criminal laws and penal sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterrell, ''Emile Durkheim: Law in a Moral Domain'', Johnson, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology'', 156&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable early legal sociologists included [[Hugo Sinzheimer]], [[Theodor Geiger]], [[Georges Gurvitch]] and [[Leon Petrażycki]] in Europe, and [[William Graham Sumner]] in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gurvitch, ''Sociology of Law'', 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papachristou, ''Sociology of Law'', 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological background ==
Law is complex from a methodological viewpoint. Its peculiar features make its unique against the background of other sciences and disciplines.

First, it is not only of a normative but also of a prescriptive nature. Law says how people ought to behave or not, what they may or may not require from others, and what they have to or have not to do if someone ask for that. But normative statements in law are deprived of a descriptive  or causal character as opposed to normative statements in empirical science (as a law of gravity) or even social science (as a law of demand and supply in economics).

Second, there is no possibility of empirical verification of the contents of law.  Whether the law should or should not comprise precepts of such-and-such import remains far beyond empirical proof. It is a matter of choice.

Third, law is dependent on the shape of the physical world and the limitations inherent in it. It cannot mandate behaviours which are unattainable or force people to do things which are beyond their capabilities.

Fourth, law is fully contingent on humans and their minds. Without humans and their mental operations it would be very difficult to speak about the law, its enforcement and application.

Fifth, law agents, such as judges, advocates and officials, are unspecialized in the sense that they lack some complex theories as to good and evil, empirical and social science or justice (proper distribution of goods/privileges and burdens in a society).

Sixth, the role of authority is prominent in law, while at the same time in law there are not means which enable us to check the correctness of authoritative statements (be they comprised in judicial opinions or scholarly literature).

Seventh, the procedure in which law is authoritatively applied is very specific. It is rigorous, precise, complex, casuistic and often very formal. The outcome of such procedure is obligatory in the sense that a judge cannot free himself or herself from passing his/her decision. There are also very limited means for re-opening such procedure when its being once completed.&lt;ref&gt;See Maciej Koszowski, Why Does Legal Reasoning Have to Be Unique?. The Indonesian Journal of International &amp; Comparative Law no. 3/2016, pp.  555–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal methods ==

There are distinguished methods of legal reasoning (applying the law) and methods of interpreting (construing) the law. The former are [[legal syllogism]], which holds sway in civil law legal systems,  [[analogy]], which is present in common law legal systems, especially in the US, and argumentative theories that occur in both systems. The latter are different rules (directives) of legal interpretation such as directives of linguistic interpretation, teleological interpretation or systemic interpretation as well as more specific rules, for instance, [[golden rule]] or [[mischief rule]]. There are also many other arguments and cannons of interpretation which altogether make [[statutory interpretation]] possible.

Law professor and former [[United States Attorney General]] [[Edward H. Levi]] noted that the "basic pattern of legal reasoning is reasoning by example" - that is, reasoning by comparing outcomes in cases resolving similar legal questions.&lt;ref&gt;Edward H. Levi, ''An Introduction to Legal Reasoning'' (2013), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In a U.S. Supreme Court case regarding procedural efforts taken by a debt collection company to avoid errors, Justice [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]] cautioned that "legal reasoning is not a mechanical or strictly linear process"''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerman v. Carlisle]]'', 130 S.Ct. 1605, 1614, 559 U.S. 573, 587 (2010), [[Sonia Sotomayor|Sotomayor]], J.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal systems ==
{{Main|List of national legal systems}}
In general, legal systems can be split between civil law and common law systems.&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars argue that the significance of this distinction has progressively declined; the numerous [[legal transplants]], typical of modern law, result in the sharing by modern legal systems of many features traditionally considered typical of either common law or civil law (Mattei, ''Comparative Law and Economics'', 71)&lt;/ref&gt; The term "civil law" referring to a legal system should not be confused with "civil law" as a group of legal subjects distinct from criminal or [[public law]]. A third type of legal system—accepted by some countries without [[separation of church and state]]—is religious law, based on [[scripture]]s. The specific system that a country is ruled by is often determined by its history, connections with other countries, or its adherence to international standards. The [[sources of law|sources]] that jurisdictions adopt as authoritatively binding are the defining features of any legal system. Yet classification is a matter of form rather than substance, since similar rules often prevail.

=== Civil law ===
{{Main|Civil law (legal system)}}

[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7| Emperor [[Justinian]] (527–565) of the [[Byzantine Empire]] who ordered the codification of [[Corpus Juris Civilis]].]]

[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|First page of the 1804 edition of the [[Napoleonic Code]].]]

Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. In civil law the sources recognised as authoritative are, primarily, legislation—especially [[Codification (law)|codifications]] in constitutions or [[statute]]s passed by government—and [[custom (law)|custom]].&lt;ref&gt;Civil law jurisdictions recognise custom as "the other source of law"; hence, scholars tend to divide the civil law into the broad categories of "written law" (''ius scriptum'') or legislation, and "unwritten law" (''ius non scriptum'') or custom. Yet they tend to dismiss custom as being of slight importance compared to legislation (Georgiadis, ''General Principles of Civil Law'', 19; Washofsky, ''Taking Precedent Seriously'', 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Codifications date back millennia, with one early example being the [[Babylonian law|Babylonian]] ''[[Code of Hammurabi|Codex Hammurabi]]''. Modern civil law systems essentially derive from the legal practice of the 6th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] whose texts were rediscovered by late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Western Europe. Roman law in the days of the [[Roman Republic]] and Empire was heavily procedural, and lacked a professional legal class.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 18&lt;/ref&gt; Instead a lay [[magistrate]], ''iudex'', was chosen to adjudicate. Decisions were not published in any systematic way, so any case law that developed was disguised and almost unrecognised.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; Each case was to be decided afresh from the laws of the State, which mirrors the (theoretical) unimportance of judges' decisions for future cases in civil law systems today. From 529–534 AD the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]] codified and consolidated Roman law up until that point, so that what remained was one-twentieth of the mass of legal texts from before.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 32&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. As one legal historian wrote, "Justinian consciously looked back to the golden age of Roman law and aimed to restore it to the peak it had reached three centuries before."&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Justinian Code remained in force in the East until the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Western Europe, meanwhile, relied on a mix of the [[Codex Theodosianus|Theodosian Code]] and Germanic customary law until the Justinian Code was rediscovered in the 11th century, and scholars at the [[University of Bologna]] used it to interpret their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, ''Roman Law in European History'', 43&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law codifications based closely on Roman law, alongside some influences from [[religious law]]s such as [[canon law]], continued to spread throughout Europe until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; then, in the 19th century, both France, with the ''[[Code Civil]]'', and Germany, with the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'', modernised their legal codes. Both these codes influenced heavily not only the law systems of the countries in continental Europe (e.g. Greece), but also the [[Law of Japan|Japanese]] and [[South Korea|Korean]] legal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Hatzis, ''The Short-Lived Influence of the Napoleonic Civil Code in Greece'', 253–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demirgüç-Kunt -Levine, ''Financial Structures and Economic Growth'', 204&lt;/ref&gt; Today, countries that have civil law systems range from [[Law of Russia|Russia]] and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|China]] to most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[Law of South America|Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2100.html The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Field Listing&amp;nbsp;– Legal system], CIA&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Louisiana's Civil Code, the United States follows the common law system described below.

=== Common law and equity ===
{{Main|Common law}}
[[File:Joao sem terra assina carta Magna.jpg|thumb|King John of England signs Magna Carta]]

In [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law legal systems]], decisions by courts are explicitly acknowledged as "law" on equal footing with [[statute law|statutes]] adopted through the legislative process and with [[Regulation (law)|regulations]] issued by the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]].  The "doctrine of precedent", or ''[[stare decisis]]'' (Latin for "to stand by decisions") means that decisions by higher courts bind lower courts, and future decisions of the same court, to assure that similar cases reach similar results.  In [[Common law#2. Common law legal systems as opposed to civil law legal systems|contrast]], in "[[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]" systems, legislative statutes are typically more detailed, and judicial decisions are shorter and less detailed, because the judge or barrister is only writing to decide the single case, rather than to set out reasoning that will guide future courts.

Common law originated from England and has been inherited by almost every country once tied to the [[British Empire]] (except Malta, [[Law of Scotland|Scotland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec law|Quebec]]). In medieval England, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] the law varied-shire-to-shire, based on disparate tribal customs. The concept of a "common law" developed during the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during the late 12th century, when Henry appointed judges that had authority to create an institutionalized and unified system of law "common" to the country. The next major step in the evolution of the common law came when [[John of England|King John]] was forced by his barons to sign a document limiting his authority to pass laws. This "great charter" or ''[[Magna Carta]]'' of 1215 also required that the King's entourage of judges hold their courts and judgments at "a certain place" rather than dispensing autocratic justice in unpredictable places about the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html Magna Carta], Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; A concentrated and elite group of judges acquired a dominant role in law-making under this system, and compared to its European counterparts the English judiciary became highly centralized. In 1297, for instance, while the highest court in France had fifty-one judges, the [[English Court of Common Pleas]] had five.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; This powerful and tight-knit judiciary gave rise to a systematized process of developing common law.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the system became overly systematized—overly rigid and inflexible.  As a result, as time went on, increasing numbers of citizens petitioned the King to override the common law, and on the King's behalf the [[Lord Chancellor]] gave judgment to do what was equitable in a case. From the time of [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]], the first [[lawyer]] to be appointed as Lord Chancellor, a systematic body of equity grew up alongside the rigid common law, and developed its own [[Court of Chancery]]. At first, equity was often criticized as erratic, that it varied according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock (ed) ''Table Talk of [[John Selden]]'' (1927) 43; "Equity is a roguish thing. For law we have a measure... equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is longer or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure a Chancellor's foot."&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, courts of equity developed solid [[Maxims of equity|principles]], especially under [[John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon|Lord Eldon]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gee v Pritchard]]'' (1818) 2 Swans. 402, 414&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century in England, and in [[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish|1937 in the U.S.]], the two systems were [[Common law#1870 through 20th century, and the procedural merger of law and equity|merged]].

In developing the common law, [[Common law#Contrasting role of treatises and academic writings in common law and civil law systems|academic writings]] have always played an important part, both to collect overarching principles from dispersed case law, and to argue for change. [[William Blackstone]], from around 1760, was the first scholar to collect, describe, and teach the common law.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp Book the First&amp;nbsp;– Chapter the First]&lt;/ref&gt; But merely in describing, scholars who sought explanations and underlying structures slowly changed the way the law actually worked.&lt;ref&gt;Gordley-von Mehren, ''Comparative Study of Private Law'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious law ===
{{Main|Religious law}}
Religious law is explicitly based on religious precepts. Examples include the Jewish [[Halakha]] and Islamic [[Sharia]]—both of which translate as the "path to follow"—while Christian [[canon law]] also survives in some church communities. Often the implication of religion for law is unalterability, because the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or governments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} However a thorough and detailed legal system generally requires human elaboration. For instance, the [[Quran]] has some law, and it acts as a source of further law through interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, ''Legal Traditions of the World'', 159&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Qiyas]]'' (reasoning by analogy), ''[[Ijma]]'' (consensus) and [[precedent]]. This is mainly contained in a body of law and jurisprudence known as [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]] respectively. Another example is the [[Torah]] or [[Old Testament]], in the [[Pentateuch]] or Five Books of Moses. This contains the basic code of Jewish law, which some Israeli communities choose to use. The [[Halakha]] is a code of Jewish law which summarises some of the Talmud's interpretations. Nevertheless, [[Israeli law]] allows [[litigant]]s to use religious laws only if they choose. [[Canon law]] is only in use by members of the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Anglican Communion]].

[[File:1879-Ottoman Court-from-NYL.png|thumb|left|A trial in the Ottoman Empire, 1879, when religious law applied under the [[Mecelle]]]]

==== Sharia law ====
{{Main|Sharia}}
Until the 18th century, Sharia law was practiced throughout the [[Muslim world]] in a non-codified form, with the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Mecelle]] code in the 19th century being a first attempt at [[Codification (law)|codifying]] elements of Sharia law. Since the mid-1940s, efforts have been made, in country after country, to bring Sharia law more into line with modern conditions and conceptions.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;Anderson, ''Law Reform in the Middle East'', 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giannoulatos, ''Islam'', 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the legal systems of many Muslim countries draw upon both civil and common law traditions as well as Islamic law and custom. The constitutions of certain Muslim states, such as Egypt and Afghanistan, recognise Islam as the religion of the state, obliging legislature to adhere to Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia recognises Quran as its constitution, and is governed on the basis of Islamic law.&lt;ref name=Jurist&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830232216/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/world/saudiarabia.htm |date=30 August 2006 }}, Jurist&lt;/ref&gt; Iran has also witnessed a reiteration of Islamic law into its legal system after 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Akhlagi, ''Iranian Commercial Law'', 127&lt;/ref&gt; During the last few decades, one of the fundamental features of the movement of [[Islamic resurgence]] has been the call to restore the Sharia, which has generated a vast amount of literature and affected [[Global politics|world politics]].&lt;ref name="H1"&gt;Hallaq, ''The Origins and Evolution of Islamic Law'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal institutions ==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=left|quote=It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou givest up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.|source=Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]}}

The main institutions of law in industrialised countries are independent [[courts]], representative parliaments, an accountable executive, the military and police, [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] organisation, the [[legal profession]] and [[civil society]] itself. John Locke, in his ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'', and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] in ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', advocated for a [[separation of powers]] between the political, legislature and executive bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''The Spirit of Laws'', [http://www.constitution.org/cm/sol_11.htm#006 Book XI: Of the Laws Which Establish Political Liberty, with Regard to the Constitution, Chapters 6–7]&lt;/ref&gt; Their principle was that no person should be able to usurp all powers of the [[State (polity)|state]], in contrast to the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] theory of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]''.&lt;ref name="H17"&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20021125191001/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-c.html#CHAPTERXVII XVII]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] and others reshaped thinking on the extension of state. Modern military, policing and bureaucratic power over ordinary citizens' daily lives pose special problems for accountability that earlier writers such as Locke or Montesquieu could not have foreseen. The custom and practice of the legal profession is an important part of people's access to [[justice]], whilst civil society is a term used to refer to the social institutions, communities and partnerships that form law's political basis.

=== Judiciary ===
{{Main|Judiciary}}
A judiciary is a number of judges mediating disputes to determine outcome. Most countries have systems of appeal courts, answering up to a supreme legal authority. In the United States, this authority is the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf A Brief Overview of the Supreme Court], Supreme Court of the United States&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]]; in the UK, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/briefoverview.pdf House of Lords Judgments], House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany, the ''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]''; and in France, the ''[[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de Cassation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121164330/http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen.html |date=21 November 2006 }}, Bundesverfassungsgericht&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/ Jurisprudence, publications, documentation], Cour de cassation&lt;/ref&gt; For most European countries the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg can overrule national law, when EU law is relevant. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg allows citizens of the [[Council of Europe]] member states to bring cases relating to human rights issues before it.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, ''European Court of Human Rights'', 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Public hearing at the ICJ.jpg|thumb|left|The judges of the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[the Hague]]]]
Some countries allow their highest judicial authority to overrule legislation they determine to be [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. For example, in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the United States Supreme Court nullified many state statutes that had established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] schools, finding such statutes to be incompatible with the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, ''Brown v. Board of Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

A judiciary is theoretically bound by the constitution, just as all other government bodies are. In most countries judges may only [[interpretivism (legal)|interpret]] the constitution and all other laws. But in common law countries, where matters are not constitutional, the judiciary may also create law under the [[doctrine of precedent]]. The UK, Finland and New Zealand assert the ideal of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], whereby the unelected judiciary may not overturn law passed by a democratic legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Dicey, ''Law of the Constitution'', 37–82&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[communist state]]s, such as China, the courts are often regarded as parts of the executive, or subservient to the legislature; governmental institutions and actors exert thus various forms of influence on the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., the court president is a political appointee (Jensen–Heller, ''Introduction'', 11–12). About the notion of "judicial independence" in China, see Findlay, ''Judiciary in the PRC'', 282–284&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim countries, courts often examine whether state laws adhere to the Sharia: the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]] may invalidate such laws,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sherif, ''Constitutions of Arab Countries'', 158&lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran the [[Guardian Council]] ensures the compatibility of the legislation with the "criteria of Islam".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasekh, ''Islamism and Republicanism'', 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislature ===
{{Main|Legislature}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The debating chamber of the [[European Parliament]]]]
Prominent examples of legislatures are the [[Houses of Parliament]] in London, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in Washington D.C., the [[Bundestag]] in Berlin, the [[Duma]] in Moscow, the [[Parliament of Italy|Parlamento Italiano]] in Rome and the [[National Assembly of France|''Assemblée nationale'']] in Paris. By the principle of representative government people vote for politicians to carry out ''their'' wishes. Although countries like Israel, Greece, Sweden and China are [[unicameralism|unicameral]], most countries are [[bicameralism|bicameral]], meaning they have two separately appointed legislative houses.&lt;ref name="Riker101"&gt;Riker, ''The Justification of Bicameralism'', 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 'lower house' politicians are elected to represent smaller [[constituency|constituencies]]. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent states in a [[Federal republic|federal]] system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a [[House of Lords|house of review]]. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that the upper and lower houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise arbitrariness and injustice in governmental action.&lt;ref name="Riker101" /&gt;

To pass legislation, a majority of the members of a legislature must [[vote]] for a [[bill (proposed law)]] in each house. Normally there will be several readings and amendments proposed by the different political factions. If a country has an entrenched constitution, a special majority for changes to the constitution may be required, making changes to the law more difficult. A government usually leads the process, which can be formed from Members of Parliament (e.g. the UK or Germany). However, in a presidential system, the government is usually formed by an executive and his or her appointed cabinet officials (e.g. the United States or Brazil).&lt;ref&gt;About "cabinet accountability" in both presidential and parliamentary systems, see Shugart–Haggard, ''Presidential Systems'', 67 etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Executive ===
{{Main|Executive (government)}}
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev 2 April 2009-1.jpg|left|thumb|The [[G-20 major economies|G20]] meetings are composed of representatives of each country's executive branch.]]
The executive in a legal system serves as the centre of political [[authority]] of the [[State (polity)|State]]. In a [[parliamentary system]], as with Britain, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan, the executive is known as the cabinet, and composed of members of the legislature. The executive is led by the [[head of government]], whose office holds power under the [[Motion of no confidence|confidence]] of the legislature. Because popular elections appoint political parties to govern, the leader of a party can change in between elections.&lt;ref name="Haggard71"&gt;Haggard, ''Presidents, Parliaments and Policy'', 71&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[head of state]] is apart from the executive, and symbolically enacts laws and acts as representative of the nation. Examples include the [[President of Germany]] (appointed by [[Federal Convention (Germany)|members of federal and state legislatures]]), the [[Queen of the United Kingdom]] (an [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary office]]), and the [[President of Austria]] (elected by popular vote). The other important model is the [[presidential system]], found in the [[President of the United States|United States]] and in [[President of Brazil|Brazil]]. In presidential systems, the executive acts as both head of state and head of government, and has power to appoint an unelected cabinet. Under a presidential system, the executive branch is separate from the legislature to which it is not accountable.&lt;ref name="Haggard71" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olson, ''The New Parliaments of Central and Eastern Europe'', 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the role of the executive varies from country to country, usually it will propose the majority of legislation, and propose government agenda. In presidential systems, the executive often has the power to veto legislation. Most executives in both systems are responsible for [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]], the military and police, and the bureaucracy. [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] or other officials head a country's public offices, such as a [[Foreign minister|foreign ministry]] or [[Defence minister|defence ministry]]. The election of a different executive is therefore capable of revolutionising an entire country's approach to government.

=== Military and police ===
{{Main|Military|Police}}
[[File:US Customs and Border Protection officers.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] officers]]

While military organisations have existed as long as government itself, the idea of a standing police force is a relatively modern concept. For example, [[Medieval England]]'s system of traveling [[criminal court]]s, or [[Assize Court|assizes]], used [[show trial]]s and public executions to instill communities with fear to maintain control.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Tuberville v Savage'' (1669), 1 Mod. Rep. 3, 86 Eng. Rep. 684, where a knight said in a threatening tone to a layman, "If it were not assize time, I would not take such language from you."&lt;/ref&gt; The first modern police were probably those in 17th-century Paris, in the court of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 History of Police Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229014447/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?articleId=219522 |date=29 December 2006 }}, History.com Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; although the Paris Prefecture of Police claim they were the world's first uniformed policemen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506215949/http://www.prefecture-police-paris.interieur.gouv.fr/documentation/bicentenaire/theme_expo4.htm Des Sergents de Ville et Gardiens de la Paix à la Police de Proximité], La Préfecture de Police&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] famously argued that the state is that which controls the [[monopoly on the legitimate use of force]].&lt;ref name="mwp154"&gt;Weber, [[s:Politics as a Vocation|Politics as a Vocation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber, ''The Theory of Social and Economic Organisation'', 154&lt;/ref&gt; The military and police carry out enforcement at the request of the government or the courts. The term [[failed state]] refers to states that cannot implement or enforce policies; their police and military no longer control security and order and society moves into anarchy, the absence of government.&lt;ref&gt;In these cases sovereignty is eroded, and often warlords acquire excessive powers (Fukuyama, ''State-Building'', 166–167).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bureaucracy ===
{{Main|Bureaucracy}}
[[File:UN Headquarters 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The United Nations' New York [[United Nations Headquarters|headquarters]] houses civil servants that serve its 193 member states.]]

The etymology of "bureaucracy" derives from the French word for "office" (''bureau'') and the [[Ancient Greek]] for word "power" (''kratos'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=bureaucracy&amp;searchmode Bureaucracy], Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Like the military and police, a legal system's government servants and bodies that make up its bureaucracy carry out the directives of the executive. One of the earliest references to the concept was made by [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Baron de Grimm]], a German author who lived in France. In 1765 he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The real spirit of the laws in France is that bureaucracy of which the late Monsieur de Gournay used to complain so greatly; here the offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors and ''intendants'' are not appointed to benefit the public interest, indeed the public interest appears to have been established so that offices might exist.&lt;ref&gt;Albrow, ''Bureaucracy'', 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cynicism over "officialdom" is still common, and the workings of public servants is typically contrasted to [[private enterprise]] motivated by [[Maximization (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Mises, ''Bureaucracy'', II, [https://www.mises.org/etexts/mises/bureaucracy/section2.asp Bureaucratic Management]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact private companies, especially large ones, also have bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="K367"&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 367&lt;/ref&gt; Negative perceptions of "[[red tape]]" aside, public services such as schooling, health care, policing or public transport are considered a crucial state function making public bureaucratic action the locus of government power.&lt;ref name="K367" /&gt;

Writing in the early 20th century, Max Weber believed that a definitive feature of a developed state had come to be its bureaucratic support.&lt;ref name="mwp393"&gt;Weber, ''Economy and Society'', I, 393&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote that the typical characteristics of modern bureaucracy are that officials define its mission, the scope of work is bound by rules, and management is composed of career experts who manage top down, communicating through writing and binding public servants' discretion with rules.&lt;ref&gt;Kettl, ''Public Bureaucracies'', 371&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal profession ===
{{Main|Legal profession}}
[[File:Quentin Massys 007.jpg|thumb|In civil law systems such as those of Italy, France, Germany, Spain and Greece, there is a distinct category of [[Civil law notary|notary]], a legally trained public official, compensated by the parties to a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is a 16th-century painting of such a notary by Flemish painter [[Quentin Massys]].]]

A corollary of the rule of law is the existence of a legal profession sufficiently autonomous to invoke the authority of the independent judiciary; the right to assistance of a [[barrister]] in a court proceeding emanates from this corollary—in England the function of barrister or advocate is distinguished from legal counselor.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; As the European Court of Human Rights has stated, the law should be adequately accessible to everyone and people should be able to foresee how the law affects them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Sunday Times v The United Kingdom]]'' [1979] [http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1979/1.html ECHR 1 at 49] Case no. 6538/74&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to maintain professionalism, the [[practice of law]] is typically overseen by either a government or independent regulating body such as a [[bar association]], [[bar council]] or [[law society]]. Modern lawyers achieve distinct professional identity through specified legal procedures (e.g. successfully passing a qualifying examination), are required by law to have a special qualification (a legal education earning the student a [[Bachelor of Laws]], a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]], or a [[Juris Doctor]] degree. Higher academic degrees may also be pursued. Examples include a [[Master of Laws]], a [[Master of Legal Studies]], a [[Bar Professional Training Course]] or a [[Doctor of Laws]].), and are constituted in office by legal forms of appointment ([[admission to the bar|being admitted to the bar]]). There are few titles of respect to signify famous lawyers, such as [[Esquire]], to indicate barristers of greater dignity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British English: Esquire|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.|publisher=Collins Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/esquire?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins Dictionary|title=American English: Esquire|accessdate=23 September 2014|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Doctor of law]], to indicate a person who obtained a [[PhD]] in Law.

Many Muslim countries have developed similar rules about legal education and the legal profession, but some still allow lawyers with training in traditional Islamic law to practice law before personal status law courts.&lt;ref&gt;Ahamd, [http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf Lawyers: Islamic Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001195205/http://www.macalester.edu/~ahmad/Lawyers.pdf |date=1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In China and other developing countries there are not sufficient professionally trained people to staff the existing judicial systems, and, accordingly, formal standards are more relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;Hazard–Dondi, ''Legal Ethics'', 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Once accredited, a lawyer will often work in a [[law firm]], in a [[chambers (law)|chambers]] as a sole practitioner, in a government post or in a private corporation as an internal [[counsel]]. In addition a lawyer may become a [[legal research]]er who provides on-demand legal research through a library, a commercial service or freelance work. Many people trained in law put their skills to use outside the legal field entirely.&lt;ref name="Fine364"&gt;Fine, ''The Globalisation of Legal Education'', 364&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant to the practice of law in the common law tradition is the legal research to determine the current state of the law. This usually entails exploring [[law report|case-law reports]], [[legal periodical]]s and legislation. Law practice also involves drafting documents such as court [[pleading]]s, persuasive [[brief (law)|briefs]], contracts, or [[will (law)|wills]] and trusts. Negotiation and [[dispute resolution]] skills (including [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]] techniques) are also important to legal practice, depending on the field.&lt;ref name="Fine364" /&gt;

=== Civil society ===
{{Main|Civil society}}
[[File:1963 march on washington.jpg|thumb|left|A march in Washington D.C. during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963]]

The [[classical republicanism|Classical republican]] concept of "civil society" dates back to Hobbes and Locke.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Civil Society'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Locke saw civil society as people who have "a common established law and judicature to appeal to, with authority to decide controversies between them."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise]]'', Chap. VII, Of Political or Civil_Society. Chapter 7, section 87&lt;/ref&gt; German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] distinguished the "state" from "civil society" (''bürgerliche Gesellschaft'') in ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, ''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', 3, II, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/prcivils.htm 182]; Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 277–278&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel believed that [[civil society]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] were polar opposites, within the scheme of his dialectic theory of history. The modern dipole state–civil society was reproduced in the theories of [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;(Pelczynski, ''The State and Civil Society'', 1–13; Warren, ''Civil Society'', 5–9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays in post-modern theory civil society is necessarily a source of law, by being the basis from which people form opinions and lobby for what they believe law should be. As Australian barrister and author [[Geoffrey Robertson QC]] wrote of international law,

&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of its primary modern sources is found in the responses of ordinary men and women, and of the non-governmental organizations which many of them support, to the human rights abuses they see on the television screen in their living rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''Crimes Against Humanity'', 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]] and many other individual rights allow people to gather, discuss, criticise and hold to account their governments, from which the basis of a [[deliberative democracy]] is formed. The more people are involved with, concerned by and capable of changing how political power is exercised over their lives, the more acceptable and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] the law becomes to the people. The most familiar institutions of civil society include economic markets, profit-oriented firms, families, trade unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, [[cogers|debating clubs]], non-governmental organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and religious associations.&lt;ref&gt;There is no clear legal definition of the civil society, and of the institutions it includes. Most of the institutions and bodies who try to give a list of institutions (such as the [[European Economic and Social Committee]]) exclude the political parties. For further information, see Jakobs, ''Pursuing Equal Opportunities'', 5–6; Kaldor–Anheier–Glasius, ''Global Civil Society'', ''[http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf passim]'' (PDF); Karkatsoulis, ''The State in Transition'', 282–283. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817130457/http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Publications/Yearbooks/2003/2003Chapter1a.pdf |date=17 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal subjects ==
All legal systems deal with the same basic issues, but jurisdictions categorise and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between "[[public law]]" (a term related closely to the [[State (law)|state]], and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and "[[private law]]" (which covers contract, [[tort]] and property).&lt;ref&gt;Although many scholars argue that "the boundaries between public and private law are becoming blurred", and that this distinction has become mere "folklore" (Bergkamp, ''Liability and Environment'', 1–2).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[civil law(legal system)|civil law]] systems, contract and tort fall under a general [[law of obligations]], while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or [[Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|international conventions]]. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and [[trust law|trusts]] are regarded as the "traditional core subjects",&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in England these seven subjects, with EU law substituted for international law, make up a "qualifying law degree". For criticism, see [[Peter Birks]]' poignant comments attached to a previous version of the [http://webjcli.ncl.ac.uk/articles1/birks1.html#appendix Notice to Law Schools].&lt;/ref&gt; although there are many [[Law#Further disciplines|further disciplines]].

=== International law ===
{{Main|Public international law|Conflict of laws|European Union law}}
[[File:Naciones Unidas 3.jpg|right|thumb|Providing a constitution for public international law, the United Nations system was agreed during World War II.]]
[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|The Italian lawyer [[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]], the Father of international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=Vitoria: Political Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=UK|isbn=978-0-521-36714-1|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[International law]] can refer to three things: public international law, private international law or conflict of laws and the law of supranational organisations.
* '''[[Public international law]]''' concerns relationships between sovereign nations. The [[Sources of international law|sources]] for public international law development are [[Custom (law)|custom]], practice and treaties between sovereign nations, such as the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Public international law can be formed by [[international organisations]], such as the United Nations (which was established after the failure of the [[League of Nations]] to prevent World War II),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm History of the UN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218221016/http://www.un.org/aboutun/history.htm |date=18 February 2010 }}, United Nations. [[Winston Churchill]] (''The Hinge of Fate'', 719) comments on the League of Nations' failure: "It was wrong to say that the League failed. It was rather the member states who had failed the League."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Labour Organization|International Labour Organisation]], the [[World Trade Organization]], or the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Public international law has a special status as law because there is no international police force, and courts (e.g. the [[International Court of Justice]] as the primary UN judicial organ) lack the capacity to penalise disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;The prevailing manner of enforcing international law is still essentially "self help"; that is the reaction by states to alleged breaches of international obligations by other states (Robertson, ''Crimes against Humanity'', 90; Schermers-Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 900–901).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few bodies, such as the WTO, have effective systems of binding arbitration and dispute resolution backed up by trade sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;Petersmann, ''The GATT/WTO Dispute Settlement System'' [http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ International Criminal Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723080755/http://www.law2lawyer.com/2011/07/21/international-criminal-court/ |date=23 July 2011 }}, 32&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Conflict of laws]]''' (or "private international law" in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries) concerns which [[jurisdiction]] a legal dispute between private parties should be heard in and which jurisdiction's law should be applied. Today, businesses are increasingly capable of shifting [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[labour (economics)|labour]] supply chains across borders, as well as trading with overseas businesses, making the question of which country has jurisdiction even more pressing. Increasing numbers of businesses opt for commercial arbitration under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfem, ''International Commercial Arbitration'', 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[European Union law]]''' is the first and, so far, only example of an [[supranational law|internationally accepted legal system]] other than the [[United Nations|UN]] and the [[World Trade Organization]]. Given the trend of increasing global economic integration, many regional agreements—especially the [[Union of South American Nations]]—are on track to follow the same model. In the EU, sovereign nations have gathered their authority in a system of courts and [[European Parliament|political institutions]]. These institutions are allowed the ability to enforce legal norms both against or for member states and citizens in a manner which is not possible through public international law.&lt;ref&gt;Schermers–Blokker, ''International Institutional Law'', 943&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Court of Justice]] said in the 1960s, European Union law constitutes "a new legal order of international law" for the mutual social and economic benefit of the member states.&lt;ref&gt;See the fundamental [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61962J0026:EN:HTML C-26/62 ''Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen''], and [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61964J0006:EN:HTML ''Flaminio Costa v E.N.E.L.''] decisions of the European Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitutional and administrative law ===
{{Main|Constitutional law|Administrative law}}
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|The French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]]]
Constitutional and administrative law govern the affairs of the state. [[Constitutional law]] concerns both the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary and the human rights or [[civil liberties]] of individuals against the state. Most jurisdictions, like the [[Law of the United States|United States]] and [[Law of France|France]], have a single codified constitution with a [[bill of rights]]. A few, like the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], have no such document. A "constitution" is simply those laws which constitute the [[body politic]], from [[statute]], [[case law]] and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|convention]]. A case named ''[[Entick v Carrington]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' (1765) 19 Howell's State Trials 1030; [1765] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/1765/J98.html 95 ER 807]&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates a constitutional principle deriving from the common law. Mr Entick's house was searched and ransacked by Sheriff Carrington. When Mr Entick complained in court, Sheriff Carrington argued that a warrant from a Government minister, the [[George Montague-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax|Earl of Halifax]], was valid authority. However, there was no written statutory provision or court authority. The leading judge, [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], stated that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great end, for which men entered into society, was to secure their property. That right is preserved sacred and incommunicable in all instances, where it has not been taken away or abridged by some public law for the good of the whole ... If no excuse can be found or produced, the silence of the books is an authority against the defendant, and the plaintiff must have judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.constitution.org/trials/entick/entick_v_carrington.htm | title=Entick v Carrington | work=19 Howell’s State Trials 1029 (1765) | publisher=Constitution Society | location=US | accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fundamental constitutional principle, inspired by [[Two Treatises of Government|John Locke]], holds that [[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|the individual can do anything except that which is forbidden by law]], and the state may do nothing except that which is authorised by law.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''The Second Treatise'', [[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government#2:9|Chapter 9, section 124]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamanaha, ''On the Rule of Law'', 47&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative law is the chief method for people to hold state bodies to account. People can sue an agency, local council, public service, or government ministry  for [[judicial review]] of actions or decisions, to ensure that they comply with the law, and that the government entity observed required procedure. The first specialist administrative court was the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' set up in 1799, as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] assumed power in France.&lt;ref name="A75"&gt;Auby, ''Administrative Law in France'', 75&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal law ===
{{Main|Criminal law}}
Criminal law, also known as penal law, pertains to crimes and punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria|Cesare Beccaria]]'s seminal treatise of 1763–1764 is titled ''On Crimes and Punishments'' (''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; It thus regulates the definition of and penalties for offences found to have a sufficiently deleterious social impact but, in itself, makes no moral judgment on an offender nor imposes restrictions on society that physically prevent people from committing a crime in the first place.&lt;ref name="W2"&gt;Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 2; Wilson, ''Criminal Law'', 2&lt;/ref&gt; Investigating, apprehending, charging, and trying suspected offenders is regulated by the law of [[criminal procedure]].&lt;ref name="Br2"&gt;Dennis J. Baker, Glanville Williams ''Textbook of Criminal Law'' (London: 2012), 2&lt;/ref&gt; The [[paradigm]] case of a crime lies in the proof, [[Legal burden of proof|beyond reasonable doubt]], that a person is guilty of two things. First, the accused must commit an act which is deemed by society to be criminal, or ''[[actus reus]]'' (guilty act).&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Brody, Acker and Logan, ''Criminal Law'', 205 about ''[[Robinson v. California]]'', 370 U.S. 660 (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the accused must have the requisite [[intention (criminal law)|malicious intent]] to do a criminal act, or ''[[mens rea]]'' (guilty mind). However, for so called "[[Strict liability (criminal)|strict liability]]" crimes, an ''actus reus'' is enough.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Feinman, ''Law 111'', 260–261 about ''[[Powell v. Texas]]'', 392 U.S. 514 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal systems of the civil law tradition distinguish between intention in the broad sense (''dolus directus'' and ''dolus eventualis''), and negligence. Negligence does not carry criminal responsibility unless a particular crime provides for its punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dörmann, Doswald-Beck and Kolb, ''Elements of War Crimes'', 491&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, ''Leistungsstörungen'', 333&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SalemWitchcraftTrial large.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of a 17th-century criminal trial, for [[witchcraft]] in [[Salem witch trials|Salem]]]]
Examples of crimes include murder, assault, fraud and theft. In exceptional circumstances defences can apply to specific acts, such as killing in [[self-defense (theory)|self defence]], or pleading [[insanity defense|insanity]]. Another example is in the 19th-century English case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', which tested a defence of "[[necessity (criminal law)|necessity]]". The ''Mignonette'', sailing from [[Southampton]] to Sydney, sank. Three crew members and Richard Parker, a 17-year-old cabin boy, were stranded on a raft. They were starving and the cabin boy was close to death. Driven to extreme hunger, the crew killed and ate the cabin boy. The crew survived and were rescued, but put on trial for murder. They argued it was necessary to kill the cabin boy to preserve their own lives. [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]], expressing immense disapproval, ruled, "to preserve one's life is generally speaking a duty, but it may be the plainest and the highest duty to sacrifice it." The men were sentenced to [[hanging|hang]], but public opinion was overwhelmingly supportive of the crew's right to preserve their own lives. In the end, the [[Royal prerogative|Crown]] commuted their sentences to six months in jail.&lt;ref&gt;About ''R v Dudley and Stephens'' [1884] [http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html 14 QBD 273 DC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228224504/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_bqb14040.html |date=28 February 2005 }}, see Simpson, ''Cannibalism and the Common Law'', 212–217, 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law offences are viewed as offences against not just individual victims, but the community as well.&lt;ref name="W2" /&gt; The state, usually with the help of police, takes the lead in prosecution, which is why in common law countries cases are cited as "''The People'' v ..." or "''R'' (for [[Monarchy|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]]) v ...". Also, lay [[jury|juries]] are often used to determine the guilt of defendants on points of fact: juries cannot change legal rules. Some developed countries still condone capital punishment for criminal activity, but the normal punishment for a crime will be [[prison|imprisonment]], [[fine (penalty)|fines]], state supervision (such as probation), or [[community service]]. Modern criminal law has been affected considerably by the social sciences, especially with respect to [[sentence (law)|sentencing]], legal research, legislation, and [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Pelser, ''Criminal Legislation'', 198&lt;/ref&gt; On the international field, 111 countries are [[States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|members]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which was established to try people for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ The States Parties to the Rome Statute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623085130/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ASP/states+parties/ |date=23 June 2011 }}, International Criminal Court&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contract law ===
{{Main|Contract}}
[[File:carbolic smoke ball co.jpg|thumb|The famous Carbolic Smoke Ball advertisement to cure [[influenza]] was held to be a [[unilateral contract]]]]

Contract law concerns enforceable promises, and can be summed up in the Latin phrase ''[[pacta sunt servanda]]'' (agreements must be kept).&lt;ref&gt;Wehberg, ''Pacta Sunt Servanda'', 775&lt;/ref&gt; In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: [[offer and acceptance]], [[consideration]] and the intention to create legal relations. In ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get [[pound sterling|£]]100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an [[invitation to treat]], mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a [[reasonable man]] Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the "distinct inconvenience" of using a faulty product. "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said [[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lord Justice Lindley]], "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".&lt;ref name="CCSBCE"&gt;About ''[http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205104916/http://www.justis.com/titles/iclr_r9321042.html |date=5 December 2004 }}'' [[Case citation|[1893] 1 QB 256]], and the element of consideration, see Beale and Tallon, ''Contract Law'', 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

"Consideration" indicates the fact that all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of [[estoppel]] or ''culpa in contrahendo'', can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 NSWLR 582&lt;/ref&gt; In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in Germany, [http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/311.html §&amp;nbsp;311 Abs. II] [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]]&lt;/ref&gt; In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply on the basis of a "meeting of the minds" or a "concurrence of wills". [[Law of Germany|Germany]] has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their '[[abstraction principle (law)|abstraction principle]]' (''Abstraktionsprinzip'') means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal capacity to contract)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/BGB/105.html|title=§&amp;nbsp;105 BGB Nichtigkeit der Willenserklärung|work=dejure.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. [[Unjust enrichment]] law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''The Structure of Unjust Enrichment Law'', 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tort law ===
{{Main|Tort}}
[[File:Anti-McDonalds protest Leicester Square London 20041016.jpg|thumb|The "[[McLibel case]]" two were involved in the longest-running case in UK history for publishing a pamphlet criticising [[McDonald's]] restaurants.]]

Torts, sometimes called [[delict]]s, are civil wrongs. To have acted tortiously, one must have breached a duty to another person, or infringed some pre-existing legal right. A simple example might be accidentally hitting someone with a cricket ball.&lt;ref&gt;''Bolton v Stone'' [1951] AC 850&lt;/ref&gt; Under the law of [[negligence]], the most common form of tort, the injured party could potentially claim compensation for their injuries from the party responsible. The principles of negligence are illustrated by ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref name="DvS"&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' ([[Case citation#England and Wales|[1932] A.C. 532, 1932 S.C. (H.L.) 31, [1932] All ER Rep 1]]). See the original text of the case in [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/donoghue.htm UK Law Online].&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Mrs Donoghue ordered an opaque bottle of [[ginger beer]] (intended for the consumption of Mrs Donoghue) in a café in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]]. Having consumed half of it, Mrs Donoghue poured the remainder into a tumbler. The decomposing remains of a snail floated out. She claimed to have suffered from shock, fell ill with gastroenteritis and sued the manufacturer for carelessly allowing the drink to be contaminated. The [[House of Lords]] decided that the manufacturer was liable for Mrs Donoghue's illness. [[Lord Atkin]] took a distinctly moral approach, and said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The liability for negligence ... is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay ... The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the [[lawyer]]'s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532, 580&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This became the basis for the four principles of negligence: (1) Mr Stevenson owed Mrs Donoghue a [[duty of care]] to provide safe drinks (2) he [[Breach of duty in English law|breached]] his duty of care (3) the harm would not have occurred [[causation (law)|but for]] his breach and (4) his act was the [[proximate cause]] of her harm.&lt;ref name="DvS" /&gt; Another example of tort might be a neighbour making excessively loud noises with machinery on his property.&lt;ref name="Sturges"&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[nuisance]] claim the noise could be stopped. Torts can also involve intentional acts, such as [[assault (tort)|assault]], [[battery (tort)|battery]] or [[trespass]]. A better known tort is [[slander and libel|defamation]], which occurs, for example, when a newspaper makes unsupportable allegations that damage a politician's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. concerning a British politician and the Iraq War, ''[[George Galloway#Daily Telegraph libel case|George Galloway v Telegraph Group Ltd]]'' [2004] EWHC 2786&lt;/ref&gt; More infamous are economic torts, which form the basis of [[labour law]] in some countries by making trade unions liable for strikes,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Taff Vale Railway Co v Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants]]'' [1901] AC 426&lt;/ref&gt; when statute does not provide immunity.&lt;ref&gt;In the UK, [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]; c.f. in the U.S., [[National Labor Relations Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Property law ===
{{Main|Property law}}
[[File:South Sea Bubble.jpg|thumb|A painting of the [[South Sea Bubble]], one of the world's first ever speculations and crashes, led to strict regulation on share trading.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Bubble Act'', 610–627&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Property]] law governs ownership and possession. [[Real property]], sometimes called 'real estate', refers to ownership of land and things attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd]]'' [1997] [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldjudgmt/jd970424/hunter01.htm 2 All ER 426]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personal property]], refers to everything else; movable objects, such as computers, cars, jewelry or intangible rights, such as [[share (finance)|stocks and shares]]. A right ''[[in rem]]'' is a right to a specific piece of property, contrasting to a right ''[[in personam]]'' which allows compensation for a loss, but not a particular thing back. Land law forms the basis for most kinds of property law, and is the most complex. It concerns [[mortgage law|mortgages]], [[leasehold estate|rental agreements]], [[license|licences]], [[Covenant (law)|covenants]], [[easement]]s and the statutory systems for land registration. Regulations on the use of personal property fall under intellectual property, [[company (law)|company law]], [[trust law|trusts]] and [[commercial law]]. An example of a basic case of most property law is ''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' [1722].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Armory v Delamirie]]'' (1722) 93 ER 664, 1 Strange 505&lt;/ref&gt; A [[chimney sweep]]'s boy found a jewel encrusted with precious stones. He took it to a goldsmith to have it valued. The goldsmith's apprentice looked at it, sneakily removed the stones, told the boy it was worth three [[Halfpenny (British coin)|halfpence]] and that he would buy it. The boy said he would prefer the jewel back, so the apprentice gave it to him, but without the stones. The boy sued the goldsmith for his apprentice's attempt to cheat him. [[Lord Chief Justice Pratt]] ruled that even though the boy could not be said to own the jewel, he should be considered the rightful keeper ("finders keepers") until the original owner is found. In fact the apprentice and the boy both had a right of ''[[Possession (law)|possession]]'' in the jewel (a technical concept, meaning evidence that something ''could'' belong to someone), but the boy's possessory interest was considered better, because it could be shown to be first in time. Possession may be nine tenths of the law, but not all.

This case is used to support the view of property in common law jurisdictions, that the person who can show the best claim to a piece of property, against any contesting party, is the owner.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, ''The Man of Property'', 251–274&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the classic civil law approach to property, propounded by [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]], is that it is a right good against the world. Obligations, like contracts and torts, are conceptualised as rights good between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Savigny, ''Das Recht des Besitzes'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20080418181513/http://dlib-pr.mpier.mpg.de/m/kleioc/0010/exec/bigpage/%22235083_00000057%22 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of property raises many further philosophical and political issues. Locke argued that our "lives, liberties and estates" are our property because we own our bodies and [[Labour theory of property|mix our labour]] with our surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, ''[[s:Two Treatises of Government/The Second Treatise of Government: An Essay Concerning the True Origin, Extent, and End of Civil Government|Second Treatise on Civil Government]]'', Chap. IX. Of the Ends of Political Society and Government. Chapter 9, section 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity and trusts ===
{{Main|Equity (law)|Trust law|}}
[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|The [[Court of Chancery]], London, early 19th century]]

Equity is a body of rules that developed in England separately from the "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The [[Lord Chancellor]] on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so.&lt;ref&gt;McGhee, ''Snell's Equity'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; This meant equity came to operate more through [[Maxims of equity|principles]] than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to take good care of the entrusted property.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew]]'' [1998] Ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; In the early case of ''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' [1722]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Keech v Sandford]]'' (1726) Sel Cas Ch 61&lt;/ref&gt; a child had inherited the [[lease]] on a [[Romford Market|market]] in [[Romford]], London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) told Mr Sandford that he did not want the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of [[conflict of interest]]. The [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Peter King, 1st Baron King|Lord King]], agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote,

{{quote|I very well see, if a trustee, on the refusal to renew, might have a lease to himself few trust-estates would be renewed … This may seem very hard, that the trustee is the only person of all mankind who might not have the lease; but it is very proper that the rule should be strictly pursued and not at all relaxed.}}

Of course, Lord King LC was worried that trustees might exploit opportunities to use trust property for themselves instead of looking after it. Business speculators using trusts had just recently caused a [[South Sea Bubble|stock market crash]]. Strict duties for trustees made their way into company law and were applied to directors and chief executive officers. Another example of a trustee's duty might be to invest property wisely or sell it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nestlé v National Westminster Bank plc]]'' [1993] 1 WLR 1260&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case for pension funds, the most important form of trust, where investors are trustees for people's savings until retirement. But trusts can also be set up for [[charitable trust|charitable purposes]], famous examples being the [[British Museum]] or the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

=== Further disciplines ===
Law spreads far beyond the core subjects into virtually every area of life. Three categories are presented for convenience, though the subjects intertwine and overlap.

;Law and society
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|A trade union protest by [[UNISON]] while on strike]]
* '''[[Labour law]]''' is the study of a tripartite industrial relationship between worker, employer and trade union. This involves [[collective bargaining]] regulation, and the right to strike. Individual employment law refers to workplace rights, such as [[job security]], [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] or a [[minimum wage]].
* '''Human rights''', [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] and [[human rights law]] are important fields to guarantee everyone basic freedoms and entitlements. These are laid down in codes such as the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (which founded the [[European Court of Human Rights]]) and the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] makes the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] legally binding in all member states [[Opt-outs in the European Union#Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union – Poland and the United Kingdom|except Poland and the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf A Guide to the Treaty of Lisbon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910001253/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/guide_to_treaty_of_lisbon.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, The Law Society&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Civil procedure]]''' and '''[[criminal procedure]]''' concern the rules that courts must follow as a trial and appeals proceed. Both concern a citizen's [[right to a fair trial]] or hearing.
* '''[[Evidence (law)|Evidence]]''' law involves which materials are admissible in courts for a case to be built.
* '''[[Immigration law]]''' and '''[[nationality law]]''' concern the rights of foreigners to live and work in a nation-state that is not their own and to acquire or lose [[citizenship]]. Both also involve the [[right of asylum]] and the problem of [[statelessness|stateless]] individuals.
* '''[[Social security]]''' law refers to the rights people have to social insurance, such as jobseekers' allowances or housing benefits.
* '''[[Family law]]''' covers marriage and divorce proceedings, the rights of children and rights to property and money in the event of separation.
* '''[[Transactional law]]''' refers to the practice of law concerning business and money.

;Law and commerce
* '''[[Company law]]''' sprang from the law of trusts, on the principle of separating ownership of property and control.&lt;ref&gt;Berle, ''Modern Corporation and Private Property''&lt;/ref&gt; The law of the modern [[company (law)|company]] began with the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]], passed in the United Kingdom, which provided investors with a simple registration procedure to gain [[limited liability]] under the [[Juristic person|separate legal personality]] of the corporation.
* '''[[Commercial law]]''' covers complex contract and property law. The law of [[agency (law)|agency]], [[insurance law]], [[negotiable instrument|bills of exchange]], [[insolvency]] and [[bankruptcy law]] and sales law are all important, and trace back to the medieval ''[[Law Merchant|Lex Mercatoria]]''. The UK [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the US [[Uniform Commercial Code]] are examples of codified common law commercial principles.
* '''[[Admiralty law]]''' and the '''[[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]]''' lay a basic framework for free trade and commerce across the world's oceans and seas, where outside of a country's zone of control. Shipping companies operate through ordinary principles of commercial law, generalised for a global market. Admiralty law also encompasses specialised issues such as [[marine salvage|salvage]], [[Lien#Maritime liens|maritime liens]], and injuries to passengers.
* '''[[Intellectual property law]]''' aims at safeguarding creators and other producers of intellectual goods and services. These are legal rights ([[copyright]]s, trademarks, patents, and [[related right]]s) which result from intellectual activity in the industrial, literary and artistic fields.&lt;ref&gt;WIPO, ''Intellectual Property'', 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Restitution]]''' deals with the recovery of someone else's gain, rather than [[Damages|compensation]] for one's own loss.
* '''[[Unjust enrichment]]''' When someone has been unjustly enriched (or there is an "absence of basis" for a transaction) at another's expense, this event generates the right to restitution to reverse that gain.
* '''[[Space law]]''' is a relatively new field dealing with aspects of international law regarding human activities in Earth orbit and outer space.  While at first addressing space relations of countries via treaties, increasingly it is addressing areas such as [[commercialization of space|space commercialisation]], property, liability, and other issues.

;Law and regulation
[[File:1930-67B.png|thumb|The [[New York Stock Exchange]] trading floor after the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], before tougher [[banking regulation]] was introduced]]
* '''[[Tax law]]''' involves regulations that concern [[value added tax]], [[corporate tax]], and [[income tax]].
* '''[[Bank regulation|Banking law]]''' and [[financial regulation]] set minimum standards on the amounts of capital banks must hold, and rules about best practice for investment. This is to insure against the risk of economic crises, such as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].
* '''Regulation''' deals with the provision of [[public services]] and utilities. '''[[Water law]]''' is one example. Especially since [[privatization|privatisation]] became popular and took management of services away from public law, private companies doing the jobs previously controlled by government have been bound by varying degrees of social responsibility. [[Energy policy|Energy]], [[Ofgem|gas]], [[telecommunication policy|telecomms]] and [[water law|water]] are regulated industries in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.
* '''[[Competition law]]''', known in the U.S. as [[antitrust]] law, is an evolving field that traces as far back as [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] decrees against [[price fixing]] and the English [[restraint of trade]] doctrine. Modern competition law derives from the U.S. anti-cartel and anti-monopoly statutes (the [[Sherman Act]] and [[Clayton Act]]) of the turn of the 20th century.

'''The Marine Institute (Foras na Mara)''' is the national agency responsible to the Irish government for advice on and implementation of marine research, technology, development and innovation policy, and marine research services.  Its official vision is of &lt;br /&gt;''“A thriving maritime economy in harmony with the ecosystem and supported by the delivery of excellence in our services."''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Locations==
The institute is headquartered at Rinville, near [[Oranmore]], [[County Galway]] while its [http://www.imdo.ie/imdo/, ''Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO)''] is located in Harcourt Street, Dublin. The Marine Institute also operates an [[aquaculture]] and catchment management laboratory and office facility at Furnace, near [[Newport, County Mayo|Newport]], [[County Mayo]], as well as offices and laboratories in a number of Ireland's fishing ports.

==Vessels==
The Marine Institute oversees the operation of Ireland's two purpose-built research vessels, the [[RV Celtic Explorer]] and [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/ RV ''Celtic Explorer''] and the [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/ROV.htm Remotely Operated Vehicle, ''Holland 1''] as well as co-ordinating Sea Change – a seven-year Marine Knowledge, Research &amp; Innovation Strategy for Ireland 2007 – 2013.

==History==
[[Image:Marine Institute Headquarters Galway.jpg|thumb|The Marine Institute Headquarters [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfo6 jx5LZ0], Rinville, Oranmore, Galway, Ireland]]
Following the recommendation of the 1974 National Science Council report ''Ireland, Science and the Sea'', the Marine Institute was established by the Irish government under the Marine Institute Act of 1991
''to undertake, to co-ordinate, to promote and to assist in marine research and development and to provide such services that, in the opinion of the Institute will promote economic development and create employment and protect the marine environment''.

Starting with the appointment of its chief executive officer – Dr Peter Heffernan – followed by four Programme Managers in Marine Environment, Marine Food, Marine Technology and Marine Leisure and Tourism in 1995, the Marine Institute grew rapidly, to include the Irish Marine Data Centre and existing marine research facilities at Abbotstown, County Dublin and the Salmon Research Agency at Newport.

1998 saw the arrival of Ireland's first purpose-built research vessel, the 31-metre long [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/voyager/ RV ''Celtic Voyager'']. This was followed in 2000 by the announcement that the Institute would be moving from Dublin to new premises in Galway, and the arrival of the larger 65-metre deepwater research vessel [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/ RV ''Celtic Explorer''] in 2002. The [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/ROV.htm Deepwater Remotely Operated Vehicle, ''Holland 1''], was delivered in 2008.

2006 saw the Marine Institute move into its purpose-built headquarters and laboratory complex at Rinville, Oranmore, Galway. This building, which has won several architectural awards, houses 54 dedicated research laboratories, an auditorium capable of seating 150 people, a marine science library and an office crescent.

In 2006 the Institute also embarked on the planning and execution of Sea Change-A Marine Knowledge, Research &amp; Innovation Strategy for Ireland 2007–2013, aimed at applying state-of-the-art technology and innovation to the sustainable economic development of Ireland's oceans and seas in such a way as to increase their economic return from an annual €3 billion in 2007 to €4.5 billion by the end of the programme.

==Staff and structure==
The Marine Institute employs approximately 180 staff including specialists in fisheries, marine environment, technology, aquaculture, catchment management, ocean energy, functional foods and marine climate change, as well as experts in information technology, communications and logistical support.

The [http://www.marine.ie/home/aboutus/organisationstaff/OfficeoftheCEO.htm Office of the CEO] provides overall direction and co-ordination of foresight, strategic and research planning activities at national and international level. It works in association with the Marine Institute's five service areas and other national and international organisations.  The service areas are:

===Marine Environment and Food Safety Services (MEFS)===
[[Image:Environmental Food Symbol.jpg|thumb|Marine Environment and Food Safety Services(MEFS)Logo]]

Marine Environment &amp; Food Safety Services (MEFS) provides essential scientific advice and a range of marine [[environmental monitoring]] services to help ensure Irish [[seafood products]] meet approved standards. It also provides expert integrated advice to, and on behalf of, government departments and agencies, including the [http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/ Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine], [http://www.environ.ie/en/ Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government], and [http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/ the Department of Communications, Energy &amp; Natural Resources].

The [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/fishhealth/ '''Fish Health Team'''] works with the marine food industry to protect the health status of Irish farmed salmon, trout and shellfish. The Fish Health Unit is the Irish National Reference Laboratory for finfish, mollusc and crustacean diseases. The team tests aquatic animal samples, as required under EU and national legislation, and supports the aquaculture industry and the inland fisheries sector in maintaining Ireland's superior fish and shellfish health status. The Fish Health Unit is also the National Competent Authority for the implementation of aquatic animal health legislation under EU and national legislation and monitors the movement of finfish and shellfish into and within Ireland.

[http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/seafood/ '''Food Safety Monitoring'''] ensures that Irish marine fish, shellfish and seafood products remain safe from elevated levels of residues and contaminants. The programmes in this area include monitoring of Irish fish, shellfish and seafood products to assure that they are safe from elevated levels of residues and contaminants. This complies with a range of EU Directives as well as with national requirements. The programme monitors naturally occurring species of plankton and the toxins they produce which can be concentrated in filter-feeding shellfish. This information is provided directly to the seafood industry to allow harvesting. Research is also carried out on developing new methods of testing for identifying emerging phytoplankton species and ensuring that they can be identified and analysed effectively, and also monitoring of microbiological contaminants in shellfish.

The Marine Institute runs a national [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/data/Habs+Search+Database/ '''Harmful Algal Bloom (HABS)]''' monitoring service that warns producers and consumers of concentrations of toxic plankton in Irish coastal waters that could contaminate shellfish or cause fish deaths.

'''Environmental Monitoring''' is designed to assess levels, distribution and trends of man-made contaminants and naturally occurring biotoxins. Pollution may adversely affect the health of the seas and ultimately limit man's ability, or that of future generations, to use the seas as a sustainable resource.

The '''Aquaculture &amp; Rearing''' teams located in Galway and Newport provide research, monitoring, analyses and advice on finfish aquaculture, salmonid rearing and freshwater catchment studies. The team also implements the National Sea Lice Monitoring programme on behalf of the [http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/ Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine].

===Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services (FEAS)===
[[Image:Fisheries Symbol.jpg|thumb|Fisheries Science Services (FSS) Logo]]

The Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services unit researches, assesses and advises on the sustainable exploitation of the marine fisheries resources in the waters around Ireland, and on the impacts of fisheries on the ecosystem. Irish waters contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the world. These waters are important fish spawning and nursery grounds and their [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/fishstock/Biologically+Sensitive+Area.htm ‘Biological Sensitivity ’] is recognised internationally. To ensure the sustainable exploitation of this valuable fisheries resource and to protect the sensitive habitats in which they live, fisheries science is becoming a more 'broader based' science that will link into the concept of 'ocean management' and not just 'fisheries management'.

Linking fisheries data with '''oceanographic''', '''sea bed mapping''' and '''climate change data''', examining predator prey relationships, and interacting with stakeholders are all important components of a new form of 'ocean management advice' which comes under the umbrella of the 'ecosystem approach'. This approach considers all marine related activities such as fishing, gravel extraction and leisure use in a specific area (e.g. [[Irish Sea|the Irish Sea]]) and provides advice in this context. Much of the work of the unit in this area is also used as input to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive which seeks to ensure Ireland's marine area achieves a good environmental status by 2020.

Fisheries Ecosystems Advisory Services are charged with meeting Ireland's obligations under the EU Data Collection Framework. The Framework supports the scientific advice needed to underpin the Common Fisheries Policy. As such, the unit carries out [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/surveys/fisheries/ '''fisheries surveys'''] in the waters around Ireland using the research vessels [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/ RV ''Celtic Explorer''] &lt;br /&gt; and [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/voyager/ RV ''Celtic Voyager'']. These surveys collect extensive data for both national and international stock assessments of the main commercial species of fish and shellfish. Survey work is also conducted aboard commercial fishing vessels and unit staff collect data on the age and length profile of landings and examine fleet activity and fishing patterns. This information is used to produce the annual [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/publications/The+Stock+Book/ '''‘Stock Book’'''] which is the primary source of scientific advice on marine fisheries to the Irish Government and the Industry and is used to support fisheries negotiations with the [[European Union]].

Participation in '''applied research projects''' is critical to the evolution of scientific advice. The unit's flagship research project is the Beaufort Ecosystem Project, that links the third level sector on a broad range of ecosystem projects including fisheries seal interactions, marine birds, cetaceans, size based modelling and stakeholder engagement. Unit staff are also co-supervising a range of PhD projects and are active partners in many EU funded research projects.

===Ocean Science and Information Services (OSIS)===
[[Image:Ocean Science Services Symbol.jpg|thumb|The Ocean Science Services (OSS) Logo]]

The Ocean Science and Information Services (OSIS) team provide support for national and international marine research programmes in a number of areas.

'''Research Vessel Operations''' manage the Marine Institute's research fleet, the ''RV Celtic Explorer'' and the ''RV Celtic Voyager'', and also manage the foreign research vessel notification process.&lt;br /&gt; The 65m long [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/explorer/''RV Celtic Explorer''] is a highly sophisticated low-noise multipurpose research vessel designed for undertaking a wide array of offshore and deep-sea survey operations. The [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/researchvessels/voyager/ ''RV Celtic Voyager''] is a 31.4m multipurpose vessel suited to coastal research and off shore survey operations. Both vessels are fully fitted with state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation, laboratories and IT equipment and are used for a variety of applications including fisheries research, environmental monitoring, seabed mapping, oceanology, seismic surveys, student training and meteorological investigations.

'''Advanced Mapping Service Group''' carries out routine hydrographic and geophysical mapping for the Irish National Seabed Survey, the Integrated Mapping for the Sustainable Development of Irelands Marine Resource [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/surveys/seabed/ (INFOMAR)] and benthic fisheries projects. The team has considerable expertise in Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and resource mapping, including aspects of aggregates exploration and marine pelagic and benthic habitat mapping.&lt;br /&gt; The Advanced Mapping Section also mobilises and carries out rig site geo hazard surveys, pipeline investigations and are an active partners in the Mapping of European Seabed Habitats Project [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/surveys/seabed/Mesh.htm (MESH)]; concentrating on development of habitat mapping tools. This section also has the tools and infrastructure that permits acquisition, processing and interpretation of large survey data sets.

[http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/oceanography/ '''Oceanography and Ocean Modelling'''] provide comprehensive oceanographic services, including the [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/data/buoys/ National Weather Buoy Network] of five buoys around the Irish coast. The team is also involved in the establishment of an [http://www.marine.ie/home/services/operational/oceanography/TideGauge.htm Irish tide gauge network], ocean modelling, satellite remote sensing and oceanographic support of diverse seagoing research programmes related to marine fisheries and environment.

The '''Information Services &amp; Development''' team are responsible for the co-ordination of Marine Institute [http://www.marine.ie/home/publicationsdata/ data activities] and the provision of Information Technology infrastructure and information management for the Marine Institute.

The '''Advanced Marine Technology Programme''' is part of [https://web.archive.org/web/20080416014140/http://www.marine.ie/home/SeaChange.htm Sea Change], Ireland's marine research and innovation strategy. It seeks to create a critical mass, multi-disciplinary and industry-oriented research grouping in the area of advanced sensing, communications and informatics.

===The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO)===
[[Image:Marine Strategic Development Symbol.jpg|thumb|The Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) Logo]]

The [http://www.imdo.ie Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO)] of the Marine Institute is Ireland's first dedicated development, promotional and marketing agency for the shipping services sector. The IMDO's statutory mandate is to promote and develop growth in the [http://www.marine.ie/home/Shipping.htm Irish Shipping industry], and to attract to Ireland additional marine related service sector operations along with key players in International Shipping and ancillary services.

The shipping services sector is the largest segment of the Irish Marine industrial base, employing over 8,000 people while also generating over €1.5 billion within the economy annually. As an island-based economy, maritime transport carries 99% by volume of all Irish trade, making this a strategically important industry.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

IMDO provides assistance to the Irish maritime industry and its consumers in its effort to maintain competitiveness in the International market place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6767">In [[Social Science]], '''Methodological Nationalism''' is a term used to describe  an intellectual orientation and pattern in scholarly research that conceives of the nation-state as the sole unit of analysis or as a container for social processes. This term has been greatly developed by Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, who specifically define '''methodological nationalism''' as "understood as the assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological nationalism and beyond: nation-state building, migration and the social sciences|journal=Global Networks 2|volume=2|issue=4|pages=301–334|url=http://www.suz.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:1296e4ec-3ca6-4efe-b083-163b9b649bab/Text_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological Nationalism has been identified in many social science subfields, such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and the interdisciplinary field of [[migration studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological Nationalism, the Social Sciences, and the Study of Migration: An Essay in Historical Epistemology|journal=The International Migration Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=576–610|jstor=30037750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodological Nationalism, as a practice within Social Science, has been further critiqued by scholars such as [[Saskia Sassen]], who contends that the nation-state and its borders are an insufficient unit of analysis and that the national is at times the "terrains of the global".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sassen|first1=Saskia|title=The global inside the national A research agenda for sociology|url=http://www.saskiasassen.com/pdfs/publications/the-global-inside-the-national.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three types of methodological nationalism ==

Per Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller, there are three types of methodological nationalism in social science scholarship: ignoring or disregarding the importance of nationalism for modern societies, naturalization, and confining studies to geopolitical boundaries of a particular nation-state. These types may co-occur or occur separately. When they co-occur, they may reinforce each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wimmer|first1=Andreas|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|title=Methodological Nationalism, the Social Sciences, and the Study of Migration: An Essay in Historical Epistemology|journal=The International Migration Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=2|pages=576–610|jstor=30037750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodological Nationalism and Migration Studies ==

'''Methodological Nationalism''' and its conception of nation-states has been a component of both contemporary and historical methodologies in migration studies, insofar as certain studies have adhered to it or diverged from its theoretical foundations. This adherence has been acknowledged or otherwise criticized  in numerous studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mayall|first1=James|title=Nationalism and international society|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0521389617|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Anthony D.|title=Nationalism and modernism : a critical survey of recent theories of nations and nationalism|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415063418|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the historical prevalence of '''methodological nationalism''' within social science has been explored by scholarship which argues that many turn-of-the-century writings on globalization have  "conflated the necessary
conceptual critique of methodological nationalism with the empirical claim of the
nation-state’s diminishing relevance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chernilo|first1=Daniel|title=The critique of methodological nationalism|journal=Thesis Eleven|date=August 2011|volume=106|issue=1|pages=98–117|doi=10.1177/0725513611415789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, research on  [[transnationalism]] and [[transmigrants]] has contemporary examples of divergence and criticism of '''methodological nationalism''' as an enduring practice in scholarship. Recent studies in transnationalism have conceived of the nation-state as one agent in a complex relationship with many global actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quayson|first1=Ato|last2=Daswani|first2=Girish|title=A Companion to Diaspora and Transnationalism|date=September 2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-8826-5|pages=600|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-140518826X.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration Studies that conceive of society as extending beyond national boundaries, then, sever this link between nation-state and society.

Research on transnational Latina motherhood has negotiated issues of the nation-state as well as transnationalism. The conceptual frameworks of power geometries, social location, and geographic scales is positiojed to counteract the analytical tendency to fall back on methodological nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pessar |first= Patricia |title= Transnational Migration: Bringing Gender in |date=June 1971 |publisher= Center for Migration Studies of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Boehm |first=Deborah |title="For My Children:" Constructing Family and Navigating the State in the U.S.-MexicoTransnation |date=Fall 2003 |publisher= George Washington University for Ethnographic Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholarly research has combined transnational migration studies and conceptual frameworks such as [[coloniality of power]] to avoid '''methodological nationalism''' and better account for the intersecting transnational phenomena that constitutes the experiences of [[transmigrants]] and better explains the processes of transnational migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= Cervantes-Rodríguez, Margarita |last2=Grosfoguel,|first2=Ramón |last=Mielants |first=Eric |title=Caribbean migration to Western Europe and the United States essays on incorporation, identity, and citizenship|date=2009|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781592139569}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patel|first1=Sujata|title=Colonial Modernity and Methodological Nationalism in Sociology of India |website= vimeo.com/34815428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial Modernity and Methodological Nationalism ==

This video is of a lecture by [[Sujata Patel]] at [[University of Hyderabad]] (India), given on September 21, 2011 talking about effects of Methodological Nationalism in India. In this video, she discusses social behavior and the social effects of Methodological Nationalism: https://vimeo.com/34815428

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3720">'''Military terminology''' refers to the [[terminology|terms]] and language of [[military]] organizations and [[personnel]] as belonging to a discrete category, as distinguishable by their usage in [[military doctrine]], as they serve to depoliticise, dehumanise, or otherwise abstract discussion about its operations from an actual description thereof.

==Common understanding==
The operational pressure for uniform understanding has developed since the early 20th century with the importance of [[joint operations]] between different services (army, navy, air force) of the same country. International alliances and operations, including [[peacekeeping]],&lt;ref&gt;Colonel Andrei Demurenko and Professor Alexander Nikitin, ''Basic Terminology and Concepts in International Peacekeeping Operations: An Analytical Review'' (translated Robert R. Love) in Low Intensity Conflict &amp; Law Enforcement,

For example, the [[NATO]] alliance now maintains a large [[dictionary]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/doddict/natoterm_index.html DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms] accessed on Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), US  website, July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of common terms for use by member countries. Development work is also taking place&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bell, ''Ballistic Missile Threats:A NATO-Russia Strategic Challenge'' in Krasnaya Zvezda, Feb 23, 2003 accessed at NATO on-line Library [http://www.nato.int/docu/articles/2003/a030227a.htm] July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; between NATO and Russia on common terminology for extended air defence, in English, French and Russian.
'''

==Criticism==
Some claim military terms serve to depoliticise, dehumanize, or otherwise abstract discussion about operations from an actual description thereof. 
Similar to "[[legalese|legal terminology]]" and related to "political terminology", military terms are known for an oblique tendency to incorporate [[technical language]]. In many cases, it reflects a need to be precise. It can also reflect a perceived need for [[operational security]], giving away no more information than needed. It can also serve to disguise or distort meaning as with [[doublespeak]]. "Kinetic activity" as a [[buzzword]] for [[combat]], in use since the inception of the [[War on Terror]], has been criticized as a [[Don't ask, don't tell|don’t-ask-don’t-tell]] policy for murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An '''organotroph''' is an [[organism]] that obtains [[hydrogen]] or [[electron]]s from organic substrates. This term is used in [[microbiology]] to classify and describe organisms based on how they obtain electrons for their respiration processes.  Some organotrophs such as [[animal]]s and many [[bacteria]], are also [[heterotroph]]s. Organotrophs can be either anaerobic or aerobic.

Antonym: [[Lithotroph]], Adjective: [[Organotrophic]].

==History==
The term was suggested in 1946 by [[André Lwoff|Lwoff]] and collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Lwoff, A., C.B. van Niel, P.J. Ryan, and E.L. Tatum (1946). Nomenclature of nutritional types of microorganisms. ''Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology'' (5th edn.), Vol. XI, The Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, pp. 302–303, [http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/11/local/back-matter.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pattern language''' is a method of describing good design practices or patterns of useful organization within a field of expertise. The term was coined by architect [[Christopher Alexander]] and popularized by his 1977 book ''[[A Pattern Language]]''.

A pattern language can also be an attempt to express the deeper wisdom of what brings aliveness within a particular field of human endeavor, through a set of interconnected patterns. Aliveness is one placeholder term for "the quality that has no name": a sense of wholeness, spirit, or grace, that while of varying form, is precise and empirically verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alexander |first1=Christopher |title=The Timeless Way of Building |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-502402-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates{{who|date=March 2016}} of this design approach claim that ordinary people can use it to successfully solve very large, complex design problems.

==What is a pattern?==
{{See also|Design pattern}}
When a designer designs something – whether a house, computer program, or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems. A single problem is documented with its typical place (the [[syntax]]), and use (the [[grammar]]) with the most common and recognized good solution seen in the wild, like the examples seen in [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. Each such entry is a single [[design pattern]]. Each pattern has a name, a descriptive entry, and some cross-references, much like a dictionary entry. A documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern's contexts.

Elemental or universal ''patterns'' such as "door" or "partnership" are versatile ideals of design, either as found in experience or for use as components in practice, explicitly described as holistic resolutions of the forces in recurrent contexts and circumstances, whether in architecture, medicine, software development or governance, etc. Patterns might be invented or found and studied, such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments.&lt;ref&gt;Henshaw, J. [http://www.synapse9.com/pub/2015_PURPLSOC-JLHfinalpub.pdf Guiding Patterns of Naturally Occurring Design: Elements. PURPLSOC 2015 proceedings, July 3-5 2015 Krems, Austria] PURPLSOC meeting on the many open scientific questions, e.g. regarding the theoretical background of patterns and the practical implementation of pattern methods in research and teaching.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all languages, a pattern language has [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]], and [[grammar]] – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication. In pattern languages for design, the parts break down in this way:
* The language description – the ''vocabulary'' – is a collection of named, described solutions to problems in a field of interest. These are called ''design patterns''. So, for example, the language for architecture describes items like: settlements, buildings, rooms, windows, latches, etc.
* Each solution includes ''syntax'', a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger, more comprehensive or more abstract design. This automatically links the solution into a web of other needed solutions. For example, rooms have ways to get light, and ways to get people in and out.
* The solution includes ''grammar'' that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit. So, if the benefit is unneeded, the solution is not used. Perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources; if people do not need to wait to enter a room, a simple doorway can replace a waiting room.
* In the language description, grammar and syntax cross index (often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names) to other named solutions, so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related, needed solutions, and document them in a logical way. In Christopher Alexander's book ''A Pattern Language'', the patterns are in decreasing order by size, with a separate alphabetic index.
* The web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process.

This simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts. At the same time, if the pattern language has worked well for many projects, there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process, and the result will be usable. For example, skiers coming inside must shed snow and store equipment. The messy snow and boot cleaners should stay outside. The equipment needs care, so the racks should be inside.

==Many patterns form a language==
Just as [[words]] must have [[Grammar|grammatical]] and [[Semantics|semantic]] relationships to each other in order to make a spoken [[language]] useful, design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language. Christopher Alexander's work describes a process of decomposition, in which the designer has a problem (perhaps a commercial assignment), selects a solution, then discovers new, smaller problems resulting from the larger solution. Occasionally, the smaller problems have no solution, and a different larger solution must be selected. Eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders, and the "design" is done.

The actual organizational structure ([[Hierarchy|hierarchical]], [[Iterative method|iterative]], etc.) is left to the discretion of the designer, depending on the problem. This explicitly lets a designer explore a design, starting from some small part. When this happens, it's common for a designer to realize that the problem is actually part of a larger solution. At this point, the design almost always becomes a better design.

In the language, therefore, each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole. This gives the designer using the language a great deal of guidance about the related problems that must be solved.

The most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable, complete list of the problems to be solved. Of course, the people most familiar with the problems are the people that need a design. So, Alexander famously advocated on-site improvisation by concerned, empowered users,&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Christopher, The Oregon Project&lt;/ref&gt; as a powerful way to form very workable large-scale initial solutions, maximizing the utility of a design, and minimizing the design rework. The desire to empower users of architecture was, in fact, what led Alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place.

==Design problems in a context==
An important aspect of design patterns is to identify and document the key ideas that make a good system different from a poor system (that may be a house, a computer program or an object of daily use), and to assist in the design of future systems. The idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context, but still specific enough to give constructive guidance.

The range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context. An important part in each pattern is to describe this context. Examples can further illustrate how the pattern applies to very different situation.

For instance, Alexander's pattern "A PLACE TO WAIT" addresses bus stops in the same way as waiting rooms in a surgery, while still proposing helpful and constructive solutions. The [[Design Patterns|"Gang-of-Four" book ''Design Patterns'']] by Gamma et al. proposes solutions that are independent of the programming language, and the program's application domain.

Still, the problems and solutions described in a pattern can vary in their level of abstraction and generality on the one side, and specificity on the other side. In the end this depends on the author's preferences. However, even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are, by nature, absolutely concrete and specific.

Patterns can also vary in how far they are proven in the real world. Alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero, one or two stars, indicating how well they are proven in real-world examples. It is generally claimed that all patterns need at least some existing real-world examples. It is, however, conceivable to document yet unimplemented ideas in a pattern-like format.

The patterns in Alexander's book also vary in their level of scale – some describing how to build a town or neighbourhood, others dealing with individual buildings and the interior of rooms. Alexander sees the low-scale artifacts as constructive elements of the large-scale world, so they can be connected to a [[#Aggregation in an associative network (pattern language)|hierarchic network]].

===Balancing of forces===
A pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve, the context or situation where these problems arise, and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended.

Often these problems arise from a conflict of different interests or "forces". A pattern emerges as a dialogue that will then help to balance the forces and finally make a decision.

For instance, there could be a pattern suggesting a wireless telephone. The forces would be the need to communicate, and the need to get other things done at the same time (cooking, inspecting the bookshelf). A very specific pattern would be just "WIRELESS TELEPHONE". More general patterns would be "WIRELESS DEVICE" or "SECONDARY ACTIVITY", suggesting that a secondary activity (such as talking on the phone, or inspecting the pockets of your jeans) should not interfere with other activities.

Though quite unspecific in its context, the forces in the "SECONDARY ACTIVITY" pattern are very similar to those in "WIRELESS TELEPHONE". Thus, the competing forces can be seen as part of the essence of a design concept expressed in a pattern.

===Patterns contain their own rationale===
Usually a pattern contains a rationale referring to some given values. For Christopher Alexander, it is most important to think about the people who will come in contact with a piece of architecture. One of his key values is making these people feel more alive. He talks about the "quality without a name" (QWAN).

More generally, we could say that a good system should be accepted, welcomed and happily embraced as an enrichment of daily life by those who are meant to use it, or – even better – by all people it affects. For instance, when discussing a street café, Alexander discusses the possible desires of a guest, but also mentions people who just walk by.

The same thinking can be applied to technical devices such as telephones and cars, to social structures like a team working on a project, or to the user interface of a computer program. The qualities of a software system, for instance, could be rated by observing whether users spend their time enjoying or struggling with the system.

By focusing on the impacts on human life, we can identify patterns that are independent from changing technology, and thus find "timeless quality" (Alexander).

==Generic structure and layout==
Usually the author of a pattern language or collection chooses a generic structure for all the patterns it contains, breaking each into generic sections like context, problem statement, solution etc.

Christopher Alexander's patterns, for instance, each consist of a short name, a rating (up to two '*' symbols), a sensitizing picture, the context description, the problem statement, a longer part of text with examples and explanations, a solution statement, a sketch and further references. This structure and layout is sometimes referred to as the "Alexandrian form".

Alexander uses a special text layout to mark the different sections of his patterns. For instance, the problem statement and the solution statement are printed in bold font, the latter is always preceded by the "Therefore:" keyword. Some authors instead use explicit labels, which creates some degree of redundancy.

===Meaningful names===
When design is done by a team, pattern names will form a vocabulary they can share. This makes it necessary for pattern names to be easy to remember and highly descriptive. Some examples from Alexander's works are WINDOW PLACE (helps define where windows should go in a room) and A PLACE TO WAIT (helps define the characteristics of bus stops and hospital waiting rooms, for example).

==Aggregation in an associative network (pattern language)==
A pattern language, as conceived by Alexander, contains links from one pattern to another, so when trying to apply one pattern in a project, a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context.

In Alexander's book, such links are collected in the "references" part, and echoed in the linked pattern's "context" part – thus the overall structure is a directed graph. A pattern that is linked to in the "references" usually addresses a problem of lower scale, that is suggested as a part of the higher-scale problem. For instance, the "PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM" pattern has a reference to "STAIR SEATS".

Even without the pattern description, these links, along with meaningful names, carry a message: When building a place outside where people can spend time ("PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM"), consider to surround it by stairs where people can sit ("STAIR SEATS"). If you are planning an office ("WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES"), consider to arrange workspaces in small groups ("SMALL WORKING GROUPS"). Alexander argues that the connections in the network can be considered even more meaningful than the text of the patterns themselves.

The links in Alexander's book clearly result in a hierarchic network. Alexander draws a parallel to the hierarchy of a grammar – that is one argument for him to speak of a pattern ''language''.

The idea of linking is generally accepted among pattern authors, though the semantic rationale behind the links may vary. Some authors, however, like Gamma et al. in ''[[Design Patterns]]'', make only little use of pattern linking – possibly because it did not make that much sense for their collection of patterns. In such a case we would speak of a ''pattern catalogue'' rather than a ''pattern language''.&lt;ref name="dearden"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andy Dearden, Janet Finlay | title = Pattern Languages in HCI: A critical review | date = January 2006 | journal = Human Computer Interaction | volume = 21 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Alexander encouraged people who used his system to expand his language with patterns of their own. In order to enable this, his books do not focus strictly on architecture or civil engineering; he also explains the general method of pattern languages. The original concept for the book ''A Pattern Language'' was that it would be published in the form of a 3-ring binder, so that pages could easily be added later; this proved impractical in publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Portland Urban Architecture Research Laboratory
Symposium 2009, presentation by 4 of 6 original authors of ''A Pattern Language''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pattern language approach has been used to document expertise in diverse fields. Some examples are [[Design pattern (architecture)|architectural patterns]], [[Design pattern (computer science)|computer science patterns]], [[interaction design pattern]]s, [[pedagogical patterns]],  social action patterns, and group facilitation patterns. The pattern language approach has also been recommended as a way to promote [[civic intelligence]] by helping to coordinate actions for diverse people and communities who are working together on significant shared problems.&lt;ref&gt;For additional discussion of motivation and rationale as well as examples and experiments, see: {{cite web |last=Schuler |first=Douglas |url=http://publicsphereproject.org/sites/default/files/Critical%20Enablers%20of%20Civic%20Intelligence.reduced.pdf |title=Choosing success: pattern languages as critical enablers of civic intelligence |publisher=Portland Urban Architecture Research Laboratory Conference, Portland, OR, 2009 |website=publicsphereproject.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander's specifications for using pattern languages as well as creating new ones remain influential, and his books are referenced for style by experts in unrelated fields.

It is important to note that notations such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or the [[flowchart]] symbol collection are not pattern languages. They could more closely be compared to an alphabet: their symbols could be used to document a pattern language, but they are not a language by themselves. A [[recipe]] or other sequential set of steps to be followed, with only one correct path from start to finish, is also not a pattern language. However, the process of designing a new recipe might benefit from the use of a pattern language.

===Simple example of a pattern===
*''Name'': ChocolateChipRatio
*''Context'': You are baking chocolate chip cookies in small batches for family and friends
*''Consider these patterns first'': SugarRatio, FlourRatio, EggRatio
*''Problem'': Determine the optimum ratio of chocolate chips to cookie dough
*''Solution'': Observe that most people consider chocolate to be the best part of the chocolate chip cookie. Also observe that too much chocolate may prevent the cookie from holding together, decreasing its appeal. Since you are cooking in small batches, cost is not a consideration. Therefore, use the maximum amount of chocolate chips that results in a really sturdy cookie.
*''Consider next'': NutRatio or CookingTime or FreezingMethod

==Origin==
[[Christopher Alexander]], an architect and author, coined the term pattern language.&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]], USA | isbn = 0-19-501919-9 | last = Alexander | first = Christopher | title = A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction | year = 1977 | page = 1216}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used it to refer to common problems of the [[design]] and [[construction]] of buildings and towns and how they should be solved. The solutions proposed in the book include suggestions ranging from how cities and towns should be structured to where windows should be placed in a room.

The framework and philosophy of the "pattern language" approach was initially popularized in the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' that was written by Christopher Alexander and five colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure in Berkeley, California in the late 1970s. While ''A Pattern Language'' contains 253 "patterns" from the first pattern, "Independent Regions" (the most general) to the last, "Things from Your Life", Alexander's book ''[[The Timeless Way of Building]]'' goes into more depth about the motivation and purpose of the work. The following definitions of "pattern" and "pattern language" are paraphrased from ''A Pattern Language''&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;:

"A ''pattern'' is a careful description of a perennial solution to a recurring problem within a building context, describing one of the configurations that brings life to a building. Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt;

A ''pattern language'' is a network of patterns that call upon one another. Patterns help us remember insights and knowledge about design and can be used in combination to create solutions.

== Application domains ==
Christopher Alexander's idea has been adopted in other disciplines, often much more heavily than the original [[Pattern (architecture)|application of patterns to architecture]] as depicted in the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]''.&lt;ref name="Alexander_Pattern_1977"/&gt; Recent examples include [[software design pattern]]s in software engineering and, more generally, [[Architectural pattern (computer science)|architectural patterns in computer science]], as well as [[interaction design pattern]]s. [[Pedagogical patterns]] are used to document good practices in teaching. The book ''Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution'', containing 136 patterns for using information and communication to promote sustainability, democracy and positive social change, was published in 2008 along with a website containing even more patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/ |title=Liberating Voices Pattern Language |website=publicsphereproject.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deck "Group Works: A Pattern Language for Bringing Life to Meetings and Other Gatherings" was published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groupworksdeck.org/ |title=Group Pattern Language Project |website=groupworksdeck.org |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, patterns were also introduced into [[systems architecture]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Andreas|title=Adopting Patterns for Space Mission and Space Systems Architecting|url=https://www.academia.edu/2110976/A.M._Hein_Adopting_Patterns_for_Space_Mission_and._Space_Systems_Architecting_|work=5 th International Workshop on System &amp; Concurrent Engineering for Space ApplicationsSECESA 2012|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hein|first=Andreas|title=Project Icarus: Stakeholder Scenarios for an Interstellar Exploration Program|url=https://www.academia.edu/1354848/PROJECT_ICARUS_STAKEHOLDER_SCENARIOS_FOR_AN_INTERSTELLAR_EXPLORATION_PROGRAM|work=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, 64, 224-233, 2011|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cloutier|first=Robert|title=The Concept of Reference Architectures|url=http://www.calimar.com/TheConceptOfReferenceArchitectures.pdf|work=Systems Engineering Vol. 13, No. 1, 2010|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chess]] [[Chess strategy|strategy]] and [[Chess tactics|tactics]] involve many patterns from [[Chess opening|opening]] to [[checkmate]].

[[Ward Cunningham]], the inventor of [[wiki]], coauthored a paper with [[Michael Mehaffy]] arguing that there are deep relationships between wikis and pattern languages, and that wikis "were in fact developed as tools to facilitate efficient sharing and modifying of patterns".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cunningham |first1=Ward |authorlink1=Ward Cunningham |last2=Mehaffy |first2=Michael W. |authorlink2=Michael Mehaffy |date=2013 |chapter=Wiki as pattern language |title=Proceedings of the 20th Conference on [[Pattern Languages of Programs]], October 23–26, 2013, Monticello, Illinois |series=PLoP '13 |location=Corryton, TN |publisher=[[The Hillside Group]] |pages=32:1–32:14 |isbn=9781941652008 |chapterurl=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2725669.2725707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plant physiology''' is a subdiscipline of [[botany]] concerned with the functioning, or [[physiology]], of [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name="Salisbury &amp; Ross 1992"&gt;{{cite book| author = Frank B. Salisbury|author2=Cleon W. Ross | title = Plant physiology| year = 1992| publisher = Brooks/Cole Pub Co| isbn = 0-534-15162-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related fields include [[plant morphology]] (structure of plants), plant [[ecology]] (interactions with the environment), [[phytochemistry]] ([[biochemistry]] of plants), [[cell biology]], genetics, biophysics and [[molecular biology]].

Fundamental processes such as [[photosynthesis]], [[cellular respiration|respiration]], [[plant nutrition]], [[plant hormone]] functions, [[tropism]]s, [[nastic movements]], [[photoperiodism]], [[photomorphogenesis]], [[circadian rhythms]], environmental stress physiology, seed [[germination]], [[dormancy]] and [[stoma]]ta function and [[transpiration]], both parts of plant water relations, are studied by plant physiologists.

==Aims==
The field of plant physiology includes the study of all the internal activities of plants—those chemical and physical processes associated with [[life]] as they occur in plants.  This includes study at many levels of scale of size and time. At the smallest scale are [[molecule|molecular]] interactions of [[photosynthesis]] and internal [[diffusion]] of water, minerals, and nutrients.  At the largest scale are the processes of plant [[Developmental biology|development]], [[season]]ality, [[dormancy]], and [[reproductive]] control.  Major subdisciplines of plant physiology include [[phytochemistry]] (the study of the [[biochemistry]] of plants) and [[phytopathology]] (the study of [[disease]] in plants). The scope of plant physiology as a discipline may be divided into several major areas of research.

[[Image:Plant physiology.png|thumb|240px|Five key areas of study within plant physiology.]]
First, the study of [[phytochemistry]] (plant chemistry) is included within the domain of plant physiology.  To function and survive, plants produce a wide array of chemical compounds not found in other organisms.  [[Photosynthesis]] requires a large array of [[pigment]]s, [[enzyme]]s, and other compounds to function.  Because they cannot move, plants must also defend themselves chemically from [[herbivore]]s, [[pathogen]]s and competition from other plants.  They do this by producing [[toxin]]s and foul-tasting or smelling chemicals.  Other compounds defend plants against disease, permit survival during drought, and prepare plants for dormancy, while other compounds are used to attract [[pollinator]]s or herbivores to spread ripe seeds.

Secondly, plant physiology includes the study of biological and chemical processes of individual plant [[cell (biology)|cells]]. Plant cells have a number of features that distinguish them from cells of [[animal]]s, and which lead to major differences in the way that plant life behaves and responds differently from animal life.  For example, plant cells have a [[cell wall]] which restricts the shape of plant cells and thereby limits the flexibility and mobility of plants.  Plant cells also contain [[chlorophyll]], a chemical compound that interacts with [[light]] in a way that enables plants to manufacture their own nutrients rather than consuming other living things as animals do.

Thirdly, plant physiology deals with interactions between cells, [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], and organs within a plant.  Different cells and tissues are physically and chemically specialized to perform different functions.  [[Root]]s and [[rhizoid]]s function to anchor the plant and acquire minerals in the soil.  [[Leaf|Leaves]] catch light in order to manufacture nutrients. For both of these organs to remain living, minerals that the roots acquire must be transported to the leaves, and the nutrients manufactured in the leaves must be transported to the roots.  Plants have developed a number of ways to achieve this transport, such as [[vascular tissue]], and the functioning of the various modes of transport is studied by plant physiologists.

Fourthly, plant physiologists study the ways that plants control or regulate internal functions.  Like animals, plants produce chemicals called [[plant hormone|hormones]] which are produced in one part of the plant to signal cells in another part of the plant to respond.  Many [[flowering plant]]s bloom at the appropriate time because of light-sensitive compounds that respond to the length of the night, a phenomenon known as [[photoperiodism]].  The [[ripening]] of [[fruit]] and loss of leaves in the winter are controlled in part by the production of the gas [[ethylene]] by the plant.

Finally, plant physiology includes the study of plant response to environmental conditions and their variation, a field known as [[#Environmental physiology|environmental physiology]].  Stress from water loss, changes in air chemistry, or crowding by other plants can lead to changes in the way a plant functions.  These changes may be affected by genetic, chemical, and physical factors.

==Biochemistry of plants==
[[Image:Latex dripping.JPG|thumb|[[Rubber|Latex]] being collected from a [[rubber tapping|tapped]] [[rubber tree]].]]
{{main|Phytochemistry}}

The [[chemical element]]s of which plants are constructed—principally [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]], etc.—are the same as for all other life forms animals, fungi, [[bacteria]] and even [[virus]]es.  Only the details of the molecules into which they are assembled differs.

Despite this underlying similarity, plants produce a vast array of chemical compounds with unique properties which they use to cope with their environment.  [[Pigment]]s are used by plants to absorb or detect light, and are extracted by humans for use in [[dye]]s. Other plant products may be used for the manufacture of commercially important [[rubber]] or [[biofuel]].  Perhaps the most celebrated compounds from plants are those with [[pharmacological]] activity, such as [[salicylic acid]] from which [[aspirin]] is made, [[morphine]], and [[digoxin]].  [[Drug company|Drug companies]] spend billions of dollars each year researching plant compounds for potential medicinal benefits.

Plants require some [[nutrient]]s, such as [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]], in large quantities to survive.  Some nutrients are termed [[Macronutrient (ecology)|macronutrients]], where the prefix ''macro-'' (large) refers to the quantity needed, not the size of the nutrient particles themselves.  Other nutrients, called [[micronutrient]]s, are required only in trace amounts for plants to remain healthy.  Such micronutrients are usually absorbed as [[ion]]s dissolved in water taken from the soil, though [[carnivorous plant]]s acquire some of their micronutrients from captured prey.

The following tables list [[chemical element|element]] nutrients essential to plants.  Uses within plants are generalized.

=== Pigments ===
[[Image:Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Space-filling model of the [[chlorophyll]] molecule.]]
[[Image:orange violet pansies.jpg|thumb|[[Anthocyanin]] gives these [[pansies]] their dark purple pigmentation.]]
{{main|Biological pigment}}

Among the most important molecules for plant function are the [[pigment]]s.  Plant pigments include a variety of different kinds of molecules, including [[porphyrin]]s, [[carotenoid]]s, and [[anthocyanin]]s.  All [[biological pigment]]s selectively absorb certain [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] while [[Reflection (physics)|reflecting]] others.  The light that is absorbed may be used by the plant to power [[chemical reaction]]s, while the reflected wavelengths of light determine the [[color]] the pigment appears to the eye.

[[Chlorophyll]] is the primary pigment in plants; it is a [[porphyrin]] that absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light while reflecting [[green]].  It is the presence and relative abundance of chlorophyll that gives plants their green color.  All land plants and [[green alga]]e possess two forms of this pigment: chlorophyll ''a'' and chlorophyll ''b''.  [[Kelp]]s, [[diatom]]s, and other photosynthetic [[heterokont]]s contain chlorophyll ''c'' instead of ''b'',  [[red algae]] possess  chlorophyll ''a''.  All chlorophylls serve as the primary means plants use to intercept light to fuel [[photosynthesis]].

[[Carotenoid]]s are red, orange, or yellow [[tetraterpenoid]]s.  They function as accessory pigments in plants, helping to fuel [[photosynthesis]] by gathering wavelengths of light not readily absorbed by chlorophyll.  The most familiar carotenoids are [[carotene]] (an orange pigment found in [[carrot]]s), [[lutein]] (a yellow pigment found in fruits and vegetables), and [[lycopene]] (the red pigment responsible for the color of [[tomato]]es).  Carotenoids have been shown to act as [[antioxidant]]s and to promote healthy [[eyesight]] in humans.

[[Anthocyanin]]s  (literally "flower blue") are [[solubility|water-soluble]] [[flavonoid]] [[pigments]] that appear red to blue, according to [[pH]]. They occur in all [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of higher plants, providing color in [[leaf|leaves]], [[plant stem|stems]], [[root]]s, [[flower]]s, and [[fruit]]s, though not always in sufficient quantities to be noticeable. Anthocyanins are most visible in the [[petal]]s of flowers, where they may make up as much as 30% of the dry weight of the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Trevor Robinson| title = The organic constituents of higher plants: their chemistry and interrelationships| year = 1963| publisher = Cordus Press| page = 183  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are also responsible for the purple color seen on the underside of tropical shade plants such as ''[[Tradescantia zebrina]]''. In these plants, the anthocyanin catches light that has passed through the leaf and reflects it back towards regions bearing chlorophyll, in order to maximize the use of available light

[[Betalain]]s are red or yellow pigments.  Like anthocyanins they are water-soluble, but unlike anthocyanins they are [[indole]]-derived compounds synthesized from [[tyrosine]].  This class of pigments is found only in the [[Caryophyllales]] (including [[cactus]] and [[amaranth]]), and never co-occur in plants with anthocyanins. Betalains are responsible for the deep red color of [[beet]]s, and are used commercially as food-coloring agents.  Plant physiologists are uncertain of the function that betalains have in plants which possess them, but there is some preliminary evidence that they may have fungicidal properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Signals and regulators==
[[Image:Auxin.jpg|thumb|A [[mutation]] that stops ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' responding to [[auxin]] causes abnormal growth (right)]]
Plants produce hormones and other growth regulators which act to signal a physiological response in their tissues.  They also produce compounds such as [[phytochrome]] that are sensitive to light and which serve to trigger growth or development in response to environmental signals.

===Plant hormones===
{{main|Plant hormone}}

[[Plant hormone]]s, known as plant growth regulators (PGRs) or phytohormones, are chemicals that regulate a plant's growth. According to a standard animal definition, [[hormone]]s are signal molecules produced at specific locations, that occur in very low concentrations, and cause altered processes in target cells at other locations. Unlike animals, plants lack specific hormone-producing tissues or organs.  Plant hormones are often not transported to other parts of the plant and production is not limited to specific locations.

Plant hormones are [[chemical]]s that in small amounts promote and influence the [[cell growth|growth]], [[morphogenesis|development]] and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of cells and tissues. Hormones are vital to plant growth; affecting processes in plants from flowering to [[seed]] development, [[dormancy]], and [[germination]]. They regulate which tissues grow upwards and which grow downwards, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, as well as leaf [[abscission]] and even plant death.

The most important plant hormones are [[abscissic acid]] (ABA), [[auxin]]s, [[ethylene]], [[gibberellin]]s, and [[cytokinin]]s, though there are many other substances that serve to regulate plant physiology.

===Photomorphogenesis===
{{main|Photomorphogenesis}}

While most people know that [[light]] is important for photosynthesis in plants, few realize that plant sensitivity to light plays a role in the control of plant structural development ([[morphogenesis]]).  The use of light to control structural development is called [[photomorphogenesis]], and is dependent upon the presence of specialized [[Photopigment|photoreceptors]], which are chemical [[pigment]]s capable of absorbing specific [[wavelength]]s of light.

Plants use four kinds of photoreceptors:&lt;ref name="Salisbury &amp; Ross 1992" /&gt; [[phytochrome]], [[cryptochrome]], a [[UV-B]] photoreceptor, and [[protochlorophyllide|protochlorophyllide ''a'']].  The first two of these, phytochrome and cryptochrome, are [[photoreceptor protein]]s, complex molecular structures formed by joining a [[protein]] with a light-sensitive pigment.  Cryptochrome is also known as the UV-A photoreceptor, because it absorbs [[ultraviolet]] light in the long wave "A" region.  The UV-B receptor is one or more compounds not yet identified with certainty, though some evidence suggests [[carotene]] or [[riboflavin]] as candidates.&lt;ref name="Fosket 1994"&gt;{{cite book| last = Fosket| first = Donald E.| title = Plant Growth and Development: A Molecular Approach| year = 1994| publisher = Academic Press| location = San Diego| isbn = 0-12-262430-0| pages = 498–509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Protochlorophyllide ''a'', as its name suggests, is a chemical precursor of [[chlorophyll]].

The most studied of the photoreceptors in plants is [[phytochrome]].  It is sensitive to light in the [[red]] and [[far-red]] region of the [[visible spectrum]]. Many flowering plants use it to regulate the time of [[flower]]ing based on the length of day and night ([[photoperiodism]]) and to set circadian rhythms. It also regulates other responses including the germination of seeds, elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number of leaves, the synthesis of chlorophyll, and the straightening of the [[epicotyl]] or [[hypocotyl]] hook of [[dicot]] seedlings.

===Photoperiodism===
[[Image:Poinsettia 2.jpg|thumb|The [[poinsettia]] is a short-day plant, requiring two months of long nights prior to blooming.]]
{{main|Photoperiodism}}

Many [[flowering plant]]s use the pigment phytochrome to sense seasonal changes in [[day]] length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed [[photoperiodism]]. Broadly speaking, flowering plants can be classified as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length.  Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to starts flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism, though some may use temperature sensitivity ([[vernalization]]) instead.

Although a short day plant cannot flower during the long days of summer, it is not actually the period of light exposure that limits flowering.  Rather, a short day plant requires a minimal length of uninterrupted darkness in each 24-hour period (a short daylength) before floral development can begin.  It has been determined experimentally that a short day plant (long night) does not flower if a flash of phytochrome activating light is used on the plant during the night.

Plants make use of the phytochrome system to sense day length or photoperiod.  This fact is utilized by [[florist]]s and [[greenhouse]] gardeners to control and even induce flowering out of season, such as the ''[[Poinsettia]]''.

==Environmental physiology==
[[Image:Arabidopsis thaliana.jpg|thumb|[[Phototropism]] in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' is regulated by blue to UV light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantphys.net/article.php?id=266 plantphys.net]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Ecophysiology}}

Paradoxically, the subdiscipline of environmental physiology is on the one hand a recent field of study in plant ecology and on the other hand one of the oldest.&lt;ref name="Salisbury &amp; Ross 1992" /&gt; Environmental physiology is the preferred name of the subdiscipline among plant physiologists, but it goes by a number of other names in the applied sciences. It is roughly synonymous with [[ecophysiology]], crop ecology, [[horticulture]] and [[agronomy]]. The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint and goals of research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of [[ecology]].

Environmental physiologists examine plant response to physical factors such as [[radiation]] (including [[light]] and [[ultraviolet]] radiation), [[temperature]], [[fire]], and [[wind]]. Of particular importance are [[water]] relations (which can be measured with the [[Pressure bomb]]) and the stress of [[drought]] or [[flood|inundation]], exchange of gases with the [[atmosphere]], as well as the cycling of nutrients such as [[nitrogen]] and [[carbon]].

Environmental physiologists also examine plant response to biological factors.  This includes not only negative interactions, such as [[competition (biology)|competition]], [[herbivory]], [[disease]] and [[parasitism]], but also positive interactions, such as [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] and [[pollination]].

===Tropisms and nastic movements===
{{main|Tropism|Nastic movement}}

Plants may respond both to directional and non-directional [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].  A response to a directional stimulus, such as [[gravity]] or sun[[light]], is called a tropism.  A response to a nondirectional stimulus, such as [[temperature]] or [[humidity]], is a nastic movement.

[[Tropism]]s in plants are the result of differential [[cell (biology)|cell]] growth, in which the cells on one side of the plant elongates more than those on the other side, causing the part to bend toward the side with less growth.  Among the common tropisms seen in plants is [[phototropism]], the bending of the plant toward a source of light.  Phototropism allows the plant to maximize light exposure in plants which require additional light for photosynthesis, or to minimize it in plants subjected to intense light and heat. [[Geotropism]] allows the roots of a plant to determine the direction of gravity and grow downwards.  Tropisms generally result from an interaction between the environment and production of one or more plant hormones.

[[Nastic movement]]s results from differential cell growth (e.g. epinasty and hiponasty), or from changes in [[turgor pressure]] within plant tissues (e.g., [[nyctinasty]]), which may occur rapidly.  A familiar example is [[thigmonasty]] (response to touch) in the [[Venus fly trap]], a [[carnivorous plant]].  The traps consist of modified leaf blades which bear sensitive trigger hairs. When the hairs are touched by an insect or other animal, the leaf folds shut.  This mechanism allows the plant to trap and digest small insects for additional nutrients.  Although the trap is rapidly shut by changes in internal cell pressures, the leaf must grow slowly to reset for a second opportunity to trap insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Adrian Charles Slack|author2=Jane Gate | title = Carnivorous Plants| year = 1980| publisher = Cambridge, Massachusetts : MIT Press| isbn = 978-0-262-19186-9| page = 160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plant disease===
[[Image:Powdery mildew.JPG|thumb|[[Powdery mildew]] on crop leaves]]
{{main|Phytopathology}}

Economically, one of the most important areas of research in environmental physiology is that of [[phytopathology]], the study of [[disease]]s in plants and the manner in which plants resist or cope with infection.  Plant are susceptible to the same kinds of disease organisms as animals, including [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], and [[fungi]], as well as physical invasion by [[insect]]s and [[roundworm]]s.

Because the biology of plants differs with animals, their symptoms and responses are quite different.  In some cases, a plant can simply shed infected leaves or flowers to prevent the spread of disease, in a process called abscission.  Most animals do not have this option as a means of controlling disease.  Plant diseases organisms themselves also differ from those causing disease in animals because plants cannot usually spread infection through casual physical contact.  Plant [[pathogen]]s tend to spread via [[spore]]s or are carried by animal [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]].

One of the most important advances in the control of plant disease was the discovery of [[Bordeaux mixture]] in the nineteenth century.  The mixture is the first known [[fungicide]] and is a combination of [[copper sulfate]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]].  Application of the mixture served to inhibit the growth of [[downy mildew]] that threatened to seriously damage the [[France|French]] [[wine]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kingsley Rowland Stern|author2=Shelley Jansky | title = Introductory Plant Biology| year = 1991| publisher = WCB/McGraw-Hill| isbn = 978-0-697-09948-8| page = 309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|History of botany}}

===Early history===
[[Image:Portrait of J.B. van Helmont, Aufgang...1683 Wellcome L0003194.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Baptist van Helmont]].]]
Sir [[Francis Bacon]] published one of the first plant physiology experiments in 1627 in the book, ''Sylva Sylvarum.'' Bacon grew several terrestrial plants, including a rose, in water and concluded that soil was only needed to keep the plant upright. [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] published what is considered the first quantitative experiment in plant physiology in 1648. He grew a willow tree for five years in a pot containing 200 pounds of oven-dry soil. The soil lost just two ounces of dry weight and van Helmont concluded that plants get all their weight from water, not soil. In 1699, [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] published experiments on growth of [[spearmint]] in different sources of water. He found that plants grew much better in water with soil added than in distilled water.

[[Stephen Hales]] is considered the Father of Plant Physiology for the many experiments in the 1727 book;&lt;ref&gt;Hales, Stephen. 1727. ''Vegetable Staticks'' http://www.illustratedgarden.org/mobot/rarebooks/title.asp?relation=QK711H341727&lt;/ref&gt; though
[[Julius von Sachs]] unified the pieces of plant physiology and put them together as a discipline. His ''Lehrbuch der Botanik'' was the plant physiology bible of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Duane Isely| title = 101 Botanists| year = 1994| publisher = Iowa State Press| isbn = 978-0-8138-2498-7| pages = 216–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers discovered in the 1800s that plants absorb essential mineral nutrients as inorganic ions in water. In natural conditions, soil acts as a mineral nutrient reservoir but the soil itself is not essential to plant growth. When the mineral nutrients in the soil are dissolved in water, plant roots absorb nutrients readily, soil is no longer required for the plant to thrive. This observation is the basis for [[hydroponics]], the growing of plants in a water solution rather than soil, which has become a standard technique in biological research, teaching lab exercises, crop production and as a hobby.

===Current research===
One of the leading journals in the field is ''[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]]'', started in 1926. All its back issues are available online for free.[http://www.plantphysiol.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml] Many other journals often carry plant physiology articles, including ''Physiologia Plantarum'', ''Journal of Experimental Botany'', ''[[American Journal of Botany]]'', ''Annals of Botany'', ''Journal of Plant Nutrition'' and ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]].''

==Economic applications==

=== Food production ===
{{further|Agriculture|Horticulture}}

In [[horticulture]] and [[agriculture]] along with [[food science]], plant physiology is an important topic relating to [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s, and other consumable parts of plants.  Topics studied include: ''climatic'' requirements, fruit drop, nutrition, [[ripening]], fruit set.  The production of food crops also hinges on the study of plant physiology covering such topics as optimal planting and harvesting times and post harvest storage of plant products for human consumption and the production of secondary products like drugs and cosmetics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1171">In certain theories of [[syntax]], an '''R-expression''' (short for ''referring expression'') is a category in the three-way classification of [[noun phrases]] in binding theory, the other two being [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphors]] and [[pronominal]]s. According to [[principle C]] of binding theory, R-expressions must be free. R-expressions include names (e.g. Mary, John) and definite DPs (e.g. the cat).&lt;ref&gt;[[David Crystal]]; A Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Chomsky]]'s [[government and binding theory]], an R-expression is an overt NP analysed as [-a. -p] (not anaphor and not pronominal), and hence subject only to Principle C of the Binding Theory, namely, that it be free (unbound) in all domains. Examples of typical R-expressions are "Lisa", "the dog", "my pet unicorn", "the last chapter of the book", and "Janel's cigarettes". The name is derived from the phrase ''[[referring expression]]'', used in semantics for the largest class of NPs, but the GB usage is not synonymous with the semantic sense.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. L.

The '''Society for Ethnomusicology''' is, with the [[International Council for Traditional Music]] and the [http://www.bfe.org.uk/ British Forum for Ethnomusicology], one of three major international associations for [[ethnomusicology]]. Its mission is "to promote the research, study, and performance of music in all historical periods and cultural contexts."&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

Officially founded in 1955, its origins extend back to November, 1953 at the annual meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] in Philadelphia with an informal agreement between [[Willard Rhodes]], [[David P. McAllester|David McAllester]], and [[Alan P. Merriam]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan. 1953. "Introduction." ''Ethno-musicology Newsletter'' 1 (December), 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; These three traveled together to the annual meeting of the [[American Musicological Society]] in New Haven to enlist the support of musicologist [[Charles Seeger]] in their endeavor to create a new academic society. This meeting resulted in the launch of the ''Ethno-musicology Newsletter'', ethnomusicology's first dedicated serial publication, containing notes about current field research projects, a bibliography, and list of recordings of interest to the nascent discipline. The first annual meeting of the society was in [[Philadelphia]], in September 1955.

Over the decades, The Society for Ethnomusicology has created a setting that allows scholars to publish and present their work from the field, better communicate and connect with fellow researchers, and provides leadership opportunities for those striving to improve the field of ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Nettl, “We’re on the Map: Reflections on SEM in 1955 and 2005,” ''Ethnomusicology'' 50 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The society currently publishes a quarterly newsletter, a quarterly journal entitled ''Ethnomusicology'', and an extensive set of "ographies" (bibliography, discography, filmography, videography). It organizes an annual international conference and over a dozen regional conferences, maintains an active website, and presents more than a dozen awards for scholarship and service, such as the [[Jaap Kunst]] prize for the best published article in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnomusicology.org/general/custom.asp?page=Prizes_Kunst |title=Jaap Kunst Prize - Society for Ethnomusicology |publisher=Ethnomusicology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of SEM==

===Before 1953===

The founding of the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/ Society for Ethnomusicology] was not the first attempt at an organization focusing on the music of the world. Before the work of SEM’s founders in the 1950s, several efforts in Europe had taken place through the work of dozens of musicologists and those who would eventually be considered ethnomusicologists, including [[Frances Densmore]], [[Helen Heffron Roberts]], and [[George Herzog (ethnomusicologist)|George Herzog]]. These and other scholars found inspiration in Viennese [[Guido Adler]] and Englishman [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]], who both produced articles in 1885 discussing “ethnological studies” of music and the equal treatment of every society’s music.&lt;ref name="Nettl181"&gt;Nettl 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, scholars turned to Austrian [[Erich Moritz von Hornbostel]], credited with inventing the musical instrument categorization system still used today, and his 1905 article outlining "The Problems of Comparative Musicology."&lt;ref name="Nettl180"&gt;Nettl 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ethnomusicology, though casually used towards the mid-1900s, was not widely used officially. The word first appeared in publication in [[Jaap Kunst]]'s book, ''Ethno-musicology; a study of its nature, its problems, methods representative personalities'', which wasn’t published in 1955.&lt;ref name="Nettl180"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaap Kunst, ''Ethno-musicology; a study of its nature, its problems, methods and representative personalities; to which is added a bibliography'', Martinus Nijhoff, The Hauge, Netherlands, 1955, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

These works are a few of the examples of some of the musical thought taking place at the turn of the century. However, many European thinkers found fewer resources and more censorship with the incoming Second World War. In response, Charles Seeger helped found the American Society for Comparative Musicology to house the number of musicologists fleeing the rise of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Nettl181"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willard Rhodes, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/924574 A Decade of Progress]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 7 (1963): 178, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEM History"&gt;William Rhodes, "[http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=History_Founding SEM History]", The Society for Ethnomusicology Website, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953===

In November 1953, [[David P. McAllester]], [[Alan P. Merriam]], and [[Willard Rhodes]] attended the 52nd Annual Meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] taking place in the city of [[Philadelphia]]. The three found they shared a common interest, particularly in North American Indian music, but also had productive conversation about, "the problems of ethnomusicology, historical, theoretical and methodological, and above all, a need for association and communication with persons with similar interests."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; The scholars believed that the ever-evolving field of ethnomusicology would be better navigated if the scholars, musicologist, anthropologists, and anyone with passion for ethnomusicology formed a society. The three agreed that producing a newsletter was the first step in founding a society, as it would unite the wider community of scholars to better communicate research and ideas of their fellow scholars. Rhodes suggested seeking out colleague [[Charles Seeger]] as a fellow conspirator. Following the American Anthropology Association meeting, the team traveled to the [[American Musicological Society]] annual meeting the following December. Seeger became the fourth member of the group and, under his consultation and Merriam’s editorship, the Newsletter began to take shape.

Ignited and led by McAllester, Merriam, Rhodes, and Seeger, Ethno-musicology Newsletter No. 1 was mailed to about 300 individuals and institutions. While the initial effort towards the creation of the Newsletter lies solely with these four men, many other scholars were working towards the goals the Newsletter set out to promote. A letter separate from the Newsletter signed by the aforementioned four, but also [[Manfred Bukofzer]], [[Frances Densmore]], Mieczslaw Kolinksi, [[Curt Sachs]] (who worked alongside Hornbostel), [[Harold Spivacke]], and Richard Waterman, was sent to about 70 individuals. The letter stated, "It must be emphasized that the present effort is the prerogative of no individual or group of individuals rather, the project is conceived as the joint effort of all those interested in seeing contact reestablished among ethnomusicologists."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt;

===1955-1962===

The popularity of the Newsletter increased dramatically, jumping to 472 recipients by April 1955.&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; With the intense interest in ethnomusicology, it was felt that the society could soon be founded. The September Newsletter announced that an organized meeting of ethnomusicologists would take place at the 54th Annual Meeting of American Anthropology Association in [[Boston]] on November 18, 1955. McAllester, Merriam, Rhodes, Seeger, and several others, nearly all recipients of the Newsletter, founded the Society for Ethnomusicology and elected its first council:

President: Williard Rhodes,

Honorary President: Curt Sachs

Vice President: Mieczlaw Kolinki

Sectretary-Treasurer: David McAllester

Editor: Alan Merriam

The first official annual conference for the Society for Ethnomusicology was held the following year in alongside the 5th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences on September 5, 1956 in Philadelphia. The constitution was drafted, officer positions expanded, and mission statement defined: “…to promote the research, study, and performance of music in all historical periods and cultural contexts."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; It was also decided that the hyphen would be removed from ethno-musicology with some disapproval."&lt;ref&gt;David P., McAllester, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/852423 Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992)]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 37 (1993): 251-262, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, it was recorded that 25% of the Society’s membership was made up of non-U.S. residents and only 7% of that were Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Newsletter expanded and added David McAllester and [[Bruno Nettl]] as editors. In 1962, [[Wesleyan University]] took over the publication of the printed pamphlet newsletter, which had until this point been sponsored by the founding four.

===1963-1955===

In 1963, The Society for Ethnomusicology produce a special, tenth anniversary issue with articles that looked back at the Newsletter and Society’s accomplishments. Challenged to find a way to measure these successes, David McAllester and Donald Winkelman both commented on the impressive efforts made at academic institutions around the country to include courses entirely or partially related to ethnomusicology.  In McAllester’s “Ethnomusicology: The Field and the Society” article, he quoted Winkelman’s finding that about 30 institutions offered anywhere from one to fourteen courses related to ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;David P., McAllester, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/924575 Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 7 (1963): 182, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an incredible number when compared to the findings of [[Bruno Nettl]], who had been charged to construct a survey of the institutions that offered courses in ethnomusicology in 1954, which showed that only fourteen institutions made the list.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Winkelman found that the number had doubled in about ten years.

Among these institutions, a few stood out as academic leaders in ethnomusicology in 1963. [[UCLA]] offered one of the largest graduate program, which believed that the “actual performance of an exotic music is essential to the full understand of its structure and purpose."&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society,” 183.&lt;/ref&gt; UCLA was also praised for sending its graduate students abroad to be immersed in a culture and its music. The [[University of Hawaii]] was well known for its ability to harmonize the relationship between the anthropology and music departments, drawing from both to create well-rounded ethnomusicology courses. Alan Merriam had made significant headway at Indiana University, having been made a Professor of Anthropology in 1962, equipped with skills in African music, music analysis, and Indian music. He worked closely with music professor and ethnomusicologist, [[Walter Kaufmann (ethnomusicologist)|Walter Kaufmann]]. At [[Columbia University]], Willard Rhodes had already been teaching some ethnomusicology course since he was made full Professor in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992),” 255.&lt;/ref&gt; He helped develop the ethnomusicology depart alongside Nicholas England, but later traveled to Africa and Asia to conduct and bring back research.&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992),” 256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Nettl]] and Richard Waterman were able to bridge the gap between the anthropology and music departments by teaching across both departments, bringing up [[Wayne State University]] as one of the countries strongest ethnomusicology institutions.&lt;ref name="McAllester184"&gt;McAllester, "Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society," 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, [[Wesleyan University]] had already proven its great strength and devotion to ethnomusicology by printing the Newsletter, but McAllester continued to develop the ethnomusicology department throughout his time there.&lt;ref name="McAllester184"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie C., Wade, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20174447 Fifty Years of SEM in the United States: A Retrospective]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 50 (2006): 192, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the rise in institutions teaching ethnomusicology courses, Williard Rhodes found that students were able to produce more dissertations that ever before. Rhodes believed that this was because the Newsletter’s Bibliographies and Reviews sections had given students access to material and research that had previously been unavailable to them: “In comparison with the limited ethnomusicological literature in English that appeared during the first half of the present century, the production of books and monographs during the past decade is remarkable in quantity, quality, and range of subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, “A Decade of Progress,” 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes found that Frank Gillis’ 1962 supplement (Ethnomusicology 6: 191-214) written for Alan Merriam’s 1960 “Annotated Bibliography of Theses and Dissertations in Ethnomusicology and Folk Music Accepted at American Universities” (''Ethnomusicology'' 4: 21-35) showed an increase from 180 to 197 titles nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, “A Decade of Progress,” 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Governance===

The Society is governed by a Constitution, Board of Directors, Council Members, and stands by its strict Bylaws. There are several standing committees that members can participate, ranging in size from 4-15 members. Some of these committees organize national events, such as the annual conference, while others operate local events, nominations, awarding of prizes, publications, and student concerns.

===Membership===

The Society offers Individual and Institution Memberships, which offer benefits and additional resources not available to the public. Individual membership fees are determined by annual income and academic enrollment (full-time student), but also one-time lifetime memberships are also available. Members receive copies of SEM publications, such as the Newsletter and Journal, gain voting rights, can submit papers for meetings and conferences, can access a members-only section of the website, and receive discounts for certain databases, such as [[JSTOR]].

==Annual Conferences==

The first official SEM meeting was September 2–9, 1956, and since then, the Society of Ethnomusicology has continued to host annual conferences throughout the country and occasionally abroad. Locations for these large-scale gatherings require a host university with a strong ethnomusicology department, hotels that can house the huge number of attendees ranging, which ranges from 800-1000 people, at an affordable price, and has access to air travel. Locations are typical chosen three years in advance by the SEM Board. The conference is then executed by the Program Committee, Local Arrangements Committee, and Business Office. 
 
The Annual Meetings are made up of programs, paper presentations, lectures, banquets, and special events, which include diverse performances, formal concerts, and dances. Video-streaming will be available for several paper presentations. 
 
The 58th Annual Meeting will take place in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], from November 14–17, hosted by [http://www.iub.edu/ Indiana University Bloomington]. The programs and schedule are available [http://www.indiana.edu/~semhome/2013/index.shtml here].

The 59th Annual Meeting will take place in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] from November 13–16, 2014. It will be hosted by [http://www.pitt.edu/ The University of Pittsburgh].
 
The 60th Annual Meeting will be in [[Austin, Texas]] from December 3–6, 2015 and will be hosted by [http://www.utexas.edu/ The University of Texas at Austin].

==Publications==

Alongside the '''''Ethnomusicology''''' journal, The Society for Ethnomusicology publishes a variety of works, nearly all of which are peer-reviewed. The SEM [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/ website] itself serves as a communicative and archival device, enabling members to discuss the latest news, share project updates, and gives digital access to many of the print publications. The SEM website offers free access to the last fifteen issues of the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_Journal journal] (currently volumes 43-57 from 1999-2013), the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_StudentNews student newsletter], and on-going lists of [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_JournalOgraphies Ographies], including bibliographies, discographies, and dissertations. Issues of the SEM [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_Newsletter Newsletter] are also available from between 2002-2010, volumes 36-44, however, the latest digital copies are only available to members. A full list of SEM’s publications available through the website can be found [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=Publications_Home here].

==Prizes==

SEM awards prizes on national, chapter, and sectional levels. These awards are designed to recognize the work of individuals in the field of ethnomusicology. Awards vary in purpose, financial prize (if any), eligibility, where and how often the prize is awarded, and application deadline.

Within the linguistic study of [[endangered languages]], sociolinguists distinguish between different '''speaker types''' based on the type of [[Competence (linguistics)|competence]] they have acquired of the endangered language. Often in situations where a community is gradually shifting away from an endangered language to a majority language, not all speakers acquire full linguistic competence, but have varying degrees and types of competence depending on the kind of exposure to the minority language they experienced in their upbringing. Originally the relevance of speaker types in situations of language shift was noted by [[Nancy Dorian]] who coined the term [[semi-speaker]] to refer to those speakers of Sutherland Gaelic who were predominantly English-speaking and whose Gaelic competence was limited and showed considerable influence from English.&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, N. C. (1977). The problem of the semi-speaker in language death. Linguistics, 15(191), 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, N. C. (1980). Language shift in community and individual: The phenomenon of the laggard semi-speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language, 1980(25), 85-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies added additional speaker types such as [[Speaker types#Typology|rememberers]] (who remember some words and phrases but have little or no grammatical competence and do not actively speak the language), [[Passive speaker (language)|passive speakers]] (who have nearly full comprehension competence but do not actively speak the language). In the context of language revitalization, [[new speakers]] who have learned the endangered language as a second language are sometimes distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Hornsby, Michael. "The “new” and “traditional” speaker dichotomy: bridging the gap." International Journal of the Sociology of Language 2015, no. 231 (2015): 107-125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Colette. "Speakers and documentation of endangered languages." Language documentation and description 1 (2003): 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Collette &amp; Michel Bert. 2011. "Speakers and Communities" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88215-6}}. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;

In contexts of language acquisition and language teaching studies sometimes there is a distinction between [[native speakers]] and [[Second language|second language speakers]], depending on whether language was learned as a language of primary socialisation or learned after already having fully acquired a first language. In contexts of [[multilingualism]] a bilingual speaker may also be described as a [[heritage speaker]] (A heritage language actually refers to a language whose speakers have moved from the original area where the language was spoken: e.g. Welsh is a heritage language in Patagonia, but not in Wales) if they have not been as fully exposed to one of their languages, leading to a diminished degree of confidence in themselves as speakers, and sometimes also limited competence in one of their languages.

==Typology==
A '''rememberer''' is a person who knows individual words or phrases (sometimes entire texts) but cannot use the target language productively. Such persons are of particular interest when studying any [[Endangered language|endangered]] or [[Language death|dying language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages|last = Grinevald|first = Colette|authorlink=Colette Grinevald|publisher = Cambridge|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = 51|url = http://www.ddl.ish-lyon.cnrs.fr/colloques/3l_2012/pageweb/pdf/Grinevald%20&amp;%20Bert2011-Speakers&amp;Community.pdf|last2 = Bert|first2 = Michel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rememberers are contrasted with [[fluency|fluent]] or full speakers, who have a good command of the language, and [[semi-speaker]]s, who have a partial command of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Research Methods in Linguistics|last = Podesva|first = Robert J.|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107696358|location = |pages = 52|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gU5kAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=rememberer+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LQ3k8zd5F9&amp;sig=fqDd-Vf1laDbkOva58-pc6A6oo8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PgCyVNWNEsGwogTf_IHwAw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rememberer%20linguistics&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between fluent speakers and rememberers is important in fieldwork, but accurately determining where a member of a language community falls on the speaker-rememberer continuum can be challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of Descriptive Linguistic Fieldwork|last = Chelliah|first = Shobhana L.|authorlink=Shobhana Chelliah|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2010|isbn = 978-9048190256|location = |pages = 176–177|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=d1FfE30hZ7EC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=rememberer+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kBdn4yvVFI&amp;sig=cxxXaXUZDLl_0jvg16rehWK72F0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TgKyVLXlEtLloASOuoHYCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rememberer%20linguistics&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Passive speaker (language)|passive speaker]] (also referred to as a ''receptive bilingual'' or ''passive bilingual'') is someone who has had enough exposure to a language in childhood to have a [[native speaker|native-like]] comprehension of it, but has little or no active command of it. Such speakers are especially common in [[language shift]] communities where speakers of a declining language do not acquire active competence. Around 10% of the [[Ainu people]], for example, who speak the language are considered passive speakers. Passive speakers are often targeted in [[language revival]] efforts to increase the number of speakers of a language quickly, as they are likely to gain active and near-native speaking skills more quickly than those with no knowledge of the language. They are also found in areas where people grow up hearing another language outside their family with no formal education.

A '''semi-speaker''' is a speaker who has acquired a partial [[linguistic competence]] in a given language, but who does not generally use it regularly in conversation. Their speech can contain erroneous forms. Semi-speakers are often among the most motivated and engaged participants in language revitalization projects.&lt;ref&gt;Grinevald, Collette &amp; Michel Bert. 2011. "Speakers and Communities" in Austin, Peter K; Sallabank, Julia, eds. (2011). Cambridge Handbook of Endangered Languages. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-88215-6}}. p.50&lt;/ref&gt;  As languages become obsolete and [[speech community|speech communities]] shift to other languages, they are spoken less frequently and in fewer social domains. Many speakers learn the language partially, often in a simplified way, with significant influence from the majority language. They are sometimes referred to as "semi-speakers", "quasi-speakers" or "rememberers". The word semi-speaker was introduced by linguist [[Nancy Dorian]] in describing the last speakers of the East Sutherland dialect of [[Scottish Gaelic]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, Nancy C. 1980. Language Shift in Community and Individual: The Phenomenon of the Laggard Semi-Speaker. International Journal of the Sociology of Language. Vol. 1980, Iss. 25, Pages 85–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Dorian, "The Problem of the Semi-Speaker in Language Death," International Journal of the Sociology of Language 12 (1977): 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  When semi-speakers form a significant part of the speech, community [[language death|language contraction]] often ensues, as the linguistic norms are accommodated to the competences of the speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knowles-Berry |first=Susan |date=Winter 1987 |title=Linguistic decay in Chontal Mayan: the speech of semi-speakers |journal=Anthropological Linguistics |volume=29 |number=4 |pages=332–341 |jstor=30028108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dorian |first=Nancy C. |date=September 1978 |title=Fate of morphological complexity in language death: Evidence from East Sutherland Gaelic |journal=Language |volume=54 |number=3 |pages=590–609 |jstor=412788 |doi=10.1353/lan.1978.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''terminal speaker''' is the last speaker of a language. A terminal speaker may still be alive, or may have been the last person speaking what is now an [[extinct language]].&lt;ref&gt;Polinsky, Maria. 1995. Cross-linguistic parallels in language loss. ''Southwest Journal of Linguistics'' 14.1-2 pp. 87-123.&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of [[language death]], the remaining speakers begin to lose some of the vocabulary and grammar of the language, so when there is only a last terminal speaker, the person will not remember a complete form of the language as it had been spoken by a larger community using it in all language domains. Being a terminal speaker means that the person is bilingual, remembering their [[heritage language]] but interacting with their community in another language. The importance of this distinction is seen in the story of [[Dolly Pentreath]] of [[Cornwall]]. She is popularly named as the last fluent, first-language speaker of [[Cornish language|Cornish]], but there were others who still spoke it for many years, though possibly incompletely. Terminal speakers are sometimes found by linguists doing [[language documentation]] on a language before it dies. A clear example of a terminal speaker being contacted by a linguist is the case of Abegaz, the last speaker of the [[Mesmes language]] in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Ahland, Michael Bryan. (2010). ''Language death in Mesmes''. Dallas: SIL International and the University of Texas at Arlington.&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in an isolated hilly area and was about 80 years old when he was contacted by a team of sociolinguistic [[language survey]]ors; he has died since that contact.  [[Ned Maddrell]] was the last speaker of the [[Manx language]], having died in 1974. In 2008, Doris McLemore was reported to be the last speaker of the [[Wichita language]] as she worked with a team of linguists to document the language before it died completely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18532656 Web access]&lt;/ref&gt; Many more terminal speakers are listed under the Wikipedia category [[List of last known speakers of languages|Last known speakers of a language]].

      <comment>The definition using wavelength does not give the same index as using frequency.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3689">In [[astronomy]], the '''spectral index''' of a source is a measure of the dependence of radiative flux density (that is, radiative flux per unit of frequency) on [[frequency]]. Given frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and [[radiative flux]] density &lt;math&gt;S_\nu&lt;/math&gt;, the spectral index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given implicitly by
:&lt;math&gt;S_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
Note that if flux does not follow a [[power law]] in frequency, the spectral index itself is a function of frequency. Rearranging the above, we see that the spectral index is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \! \left( \nu \right) = \frac{\partial \log S_\nu \! \left( \nu \right)}{\partial \log \nu}.&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly the power law can only apply over a certain range of frequency because otherwise the integral over all frequencies would be infinite.

Spectral index is also sometimes defined in terms of [[wavelength]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the spectral index &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given implicitly by
:&lt;math&gt;S_\lambda\propto\lambda^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
and at a given frequency, spectral index may be calculated by taking the derivative
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \! \left( \lambda \right) =\frac{\partial \log S_\lambda \! \left( \lambda \right)}{\partial \log \lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;
The spectral index using the &lt;math&gt;S_\nu&lt;/math&gt;, which we may call &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\nu,&lt;/math&gt; differs from the index &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; defined using &lt;math&gt;S_\lambda.&lt;/math&gt; The total flux between two frequencies or wavelengths is
:&lt;math&gt;S=C_1(\nu_2^{\alpha_\nu+1}-\nu_1^{\alpha_\nu+1})=C_2(\lambda_2^{\alpha_\lambda+1}-\lambda_1^{\alpha_\lambda+1})=c^{\alpha_\lambda+1}C_2(\nu_2^{-\alpha_\lambda-1}-\nu_1^{-\alpha_\lambda-1})&lt;/math&gt;
which implies that
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_\lambda=-\alpha_\nu-2.&lt;/math&gt;
The opposite sign convention is sometimes employed,&lt;ref&gt;Burke, B.F., Graham-Smith, F. (2009). ''An Introduction to Radio Astronomy, 3rd Ed.'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-87808-1}}, page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the spectral index is given by
:&lt;math&gt;S_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

The spectral index of a source can hint at its properties. For example, using the positive sign convention, a spectral index of 0 to 2 at radio frequencies indicates [[thermal emission]], while a steep negative spectral index typically indicates [[synchrotron emission]].

==Spectral Index of Thermal emission==
At radio frequencies (i.e. in the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit), where the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] is a good approximation to the spectrum of [[thermal radiation]], intensity is given by
:&lt;math&gt;B_\nu(T) \simeq \frac{2 \nu^2 k T}{c^2}.&lt;/math&gt;
Taking the logarithm of each side and taking the partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\log \, \nu&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \log B_\nu(T)}{\partial \log \nu} \simeq 2.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the positive sign convention, the spectral index of thermal radiation is thus &lt;math&gt;\alpha \simeq 2&lt;/math&gt; in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. The spectral index departs from this value at shorter wavelengths, for which the Rayleigh-Jeans law becomes an increasingly inaccurate approximation, tending towards zero as intensity reaches a peak at a frequency given by [[Wien's_displacement_law#Frequency-dependent_formulation|Wien's displacement law]]. Because of the simple temperature-dependence of radiative flux in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime, the ''radio spectral index'' is defined implicitly by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Spectral Index |publisher=[[Wolfram Research]] |url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/RadioSpectralIndex.html  |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \propto \nu^{\alpha} T.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Staten Island boat graveyard''' is a [[Ship graveyard|marine scrapyard]] located in the [[Arthur Kill]] in [[Rossville, Staten Island|Rossville]], near the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]] on the northern shore of [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]]. The place has been recognized as an official dumping ground for old wrecked [[tugboats]], [[barges]] and decommissioned [[Ferry|ferries]]. It is known by many other names including the Witte Marine Scrap Yard, the Arthur Kill Boat Yard, and the "Tugboat Graveyard." Its official name as of 2014 is the Donjon Iron and Metal Scrap Processing Facility.&lt;ref name = "huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/staten-island-boat-graveyard_n_5544746.html?section=india|title=The Bizarre Attraction That Is New York City's Boat Graveyard|last=Mathias|first=Christopher|date=4 July 2014|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The scrapyard was founded in the 1930s by John J. Witte and managed by him until his death in 1980. It was then taken over by his son-in-law, Joe Coyne, who described it as similar to an automobile [[Wrecking yard|salvage yard]], with the boats serving as a source of parts to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/31/nyregion/a-lesson-in-history-of-old-ships.html|title=A Lesson In History Of Old Ships|last=Meyers|first=Keith|date=December 31, 1990|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now managed by John Witte's son Arnold. It contains about 100 boats and ships, down from an earlier high of 400.&lt;ref name = "Witte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/99670-the-witte-boneyard-different-kind-graveyard/|title=The Witte Boneyard: A Different Kind of Graveyard|publisher=[[WNYC]]|date=30 October 2010|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
The abandoned and decomposing vessels, mostly cargo ships and tugboats, come from "all decades of the 20th century".&lt;ref name = "forgotten"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2010/01/ship-graveyard-rossville-staten-island/|title=Sea of Dead Ships|date=January 27, 2010|work=Forgotten New York|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sit in the mud and shallow water until they are dismantled or salvaged. Some of them are historic, so that the place has been called an "accidental marine museum".&lt;ref name = "huff"/&gt; Vessels of historic interest include the submarine chaser {{USS|PC-1264||6}}, the first [[World War II]] US Navy ship to have a predominantly African-American crew; and the [[New York City Fire Department]] [[fireboat]] ''[[Abram S. Hewitt (fireboat)|Abram S.

The site is hard to reach and posted with "No trespassing" signs.&lt;ref name = "wired" /&gt; Nevertheless, visitors do come. Marine historians explore the area via boats or kayaks.

==History==
Synap was developed by James Gupta and Omair Vaiyani, two medical students at [[Leeds School of Medicine|Leeds Medical School]], with an interest in neuroscience and memory. Having used [[spaced repetition]] software such as [[anki (software)|Anki]] in the past, they created a website that allowed students to write [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] quizzes in a [[multiple choice|Multiple Choice Question]] (MCQ) format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/download/933/mbchb_brochure "Leeds Medicine Undergraduate Academic Brochure (p32)"], Leeds Medical School, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, Synap had no revenues, but the founders were exploring adding a premium version for paying users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/synaps-app-students-edtech-oxford-lse-1st-quiz-exams-2015-10 "Here's the new app Oxford medics and LSE business students are using to help them get a 1st"], Business Insider, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===MyCQs===

The first incarnation of Synap operated under the name 'MyCQs', which was released as a native iOS application and website in 2012, and initially gained popularity amongst UK medical students&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/university-of-leeds-students-aiming-to-get-top-marks-for-smartphone-app-1-5058922 "University of Leeds students aiming to get top marks for smartphone app"], Yorkshire Evening Post, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://time.leeds.ac.uk/time/time_osce.php "Student Generated Resources"], Technology in Medical Education (University of Leeds), retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medhealth.leeds.ac.uk/download/933/mbchb_brochure "Leeds Medicine Undergraduate Academic Brochure (p32)"], Leeds Medical School, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, CEO James Gupta was recruited as the Chief Technology Officer for [[JumpIn]], a student-focused taxi booking and sharing app.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lec.leeds.ac.uk/casestudies/sam-ryan-and-barney-williams-jumpin/ "Leeds University case studies: JumpIn"], Leeds University Careers, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; The company was acquired by taxi firm [[Addison Lee]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jackwills.com/young-brits-story-far/ "Young brits: the winner's stories so far"], Jack Wills Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cab4now.co.uk/blog/rideshare/rideshare/ "2015: Year of the rideshare?"], Cab4Now, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; after which James returned to focus on MyCQs.

In 2014, MyCQs received funding and mentoring from [[Jisc]], an education technology charity,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/summer-of-student-innovation-2014  "Jisc Summer of Student Innovation 2014"], Jisc, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; and received a scholarship from The University of Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/forstaff/news/article/4610/university_bootcamp_puts_fledgling_entrepreneurs_through_their_paces "University bootcamp puts fledgling entrepreneurs through their paces"], University of Leeds, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synap===
In 2015, the team shifted focus by integrating more algorithms based on [[educational psychology]] research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aistartups.org/2016/01/interview-with-james-gupta-ceofounder.html "Interview with James Gupta, CEO &amp; Founder of Synap"], AIStartups.org, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; and started to describe itself as a 'personalised learning' platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/james-gupta/the-death-of-the-universi_b_8173492.html "The death of the university lecture"], Huffington Post, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; This also led to the company being renamed Synap&lt;ref&gt;[https://synap.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207106445-What-Is-Synap- "Synap FAQ: What is Synap?"], Synap, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowdfunding===
In August 2015, Synap launched an [[equity crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Crowdcube]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.crowdcube.com/investment/synap-19333 "Crowdcube official pitch page for Synap"], Crowdcube, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/yorkshire/news/725346-edtech-entrepreneurs-launch-180-000-crowdfunding-campaign.html "Edtech entrepreneurs launch £180,000 crowdfunding campaign"], Business Desk, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Synap uses the concept of spaced repetition to send new content to users based on what they need to practice the most. In this sense, Synap is similar to existing spaced repetition platforms such as [[Anki (software)|Anki]] and [[Supermemo|SuperMemo]], though notably it does not support the creation of flashcards, which are more commonly associated with spaced repetition.

==Infrastructure==
Synap was originally developed on Facebook's [[Parse (company)|Parse]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://synap.ac/blog/developing-an-effective-technology-stack "Developing an effective technology stack"], Synap Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24/&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Facebook announced that Parse would be closing down, and advised developers to migrate their apps to other services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/ "Moving On"], Parse Blog, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2016, Synap has been hosted on [[Amazon Web Services]], using the newly open-sourced [https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server Parse Server], which itself uses [[Node.js]]. The website is developed in [[Ember.js]], and uses a MongoDB database, making Synap an example of [[MEAN (software bundle)|full stack JavaScript]] development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackshare.io/synap-ac/synap-ac "Synap.ac's technology stack"], StackShare, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and awards==
Synap has been featured in The Oxford Public Health Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/oxfordpublichealth/docs/oxph_magazine_issue_4_apr2016 "Oxford Public Health Magazine Issue 4: Innovation and social entrepreneurship (p32-33"], Oxford Public Health Magazine, retrieved 2016-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Synap was listed as one of 10 British AI companies to look out for, by Business Insider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.businessinsider.com/10-british-ai-companies-to-look-out-for-in-2016-2015-12 "10 British AI companies to look out for in 2016"], Business Insider, retrieved 2016-24-04&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4224">The '''user illusion''' is the illusion created for the user by a [[human-computer interface|human–computer interface]], for example the [[desktop metaphor|visual metaphor of a desktop]] used in many [[graphical user interfaces]]. The phrase originated at [[Xerox PARC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Tognazzini|authorlink=Bruce Tognazzini|title=Tog on Software Design|isbn=0-201-48917-1|year=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKBQAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Philosophy of mind|philosophers of mind]] have argued that [[consciousness]] is a form of user illusion. This notion is explored by [[Tor Nørretranders]] in his 1991 Danish book ''Mærk verden'', issued in a 1998 English edition as ''The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tor Nørretranders|authorlink=Tor Nørretranders|title=The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size|isbn=0-670-87579-1|year=1998|publisher=Viking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwMwAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He introduced the idea of [[exformation]] in this book.  Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] has also embraced the view that human consciousness is a "user-illusion."&lt;ref&gt;"Human consciousness is unlike all other varieties of animal consciousness in that it is a product in large part of cultural evolution . . . creating thereby a cognitive architecture unlike the ‘bottom-up’ minds of animals. . . . [T]his architecture furnishes each of us with . . . a user-illusion” (Daniel C. Dennett, ''From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds'' (2017), p. 370).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this picture, our experience of the world is not immediate, as all sensation requires processing time. It follows that our conscious experience is less a perfect reflection of what is occurring, and more a simulation produced unconsciously by the brain. Therefore, there may be phenomena that exist beyond our peripheries, beyond what consciousness could create to isolate or reduce them.

== Criticism ==
Critics of the idea of consciousness being a device for justifying preconceptions argue that such a device would consume [[nutrient]]s without producing any useful results, since it would not change the outcome of any decisions. These critics argue that the existence of  [[social insect]]s with extremely small brains [[falsifiability|falsifies]] the notion that social behavior requires consciousness, citing that insects have too small [[brain]]s to be conscious and yet there are observed behaviors among them that for all functional intents and purposes match those of complex social cooperation and manipulation (including hierarchies where each individual has its place among [[paper wasp]]s and [[Jack Jumper]] [[ant]]s and [[honey bee]]s sneaking when they lay eggs). These critics also argue that since social behavior in insects and other extremely small-brained animals have [[convergent evolution|evolved multiple times independently]], there is no evolutionary difficulty in simple reaction sociality to impose selection pressure for the more nutrient-consuming path of consciousness for sociality. These critics do point out that other evolutionary paths to consciousness are possible, such as critical evaluation that enhances plasticity by criticizing [[fallibility|fallible]] notions, while pointing out that such a critical consciousness would be quite different from the justificatory type proposed by Nørretranders, differences including that a critical consciousness would make individuals more capable of changing their minds instead of justifying and persuading.&lt;ref&gt;How the body shapes the way we think: A new view of intelligence, Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information Processing in Social Insects: Claire Detrain, Jean L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3894">In [[astrophysics]], the '''von Zeipel theorem''' states that the [[radiative flux]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in a uniformly rotating star is proportional to the local effective gravity &lt;math&gt;g_\text{eff}&lt;/math&gt;. Specifically,

: &lt;math&gt;F = -\frac{L(P)}{4\pi G M_*(P)} g_\text{eff},&lt;/math&gt;

where the luminosity &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and mass &lt;math&gt;M_*&lt;/math&gt; are evaluated on a surface of constant pressure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. The [[effective temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T_\text{eff}&lt;/math&gt; can then be found at a given [[colatitude]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; from the local effective gravity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;T_\text{eff}(\theta) \sim g_\text{eff}^{1/4}(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem is named after Swedish astronomer [[Edvard Hugo von Zeipel]].

According to the theory of rotating stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tassoul |first1=J.-L. |title=Theory of Rotating Stars |date=1978 |publisher=Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the rotational velocity of a star depends only on the radius, it cannot simultaneously be in thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium. This is called the von Zeipel paradox. The paradox is resolved, however, if the rotational velocity also depends on height, or there is a meridional circulation. A similar situation may arise in [[accretion disk]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kley |first1=W. |last2=Lin |first2=D. N. C. |title=Two-Dimensional Viscous Accretion Disk Models. I. On Meridional Circulations In Radiative Regions |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=1998 |volume=397 |pages=600–612 |doi=10.1086/171818 |bibcode = 1992ApJ...397..600K }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--The von Zeipel law, named for its creator, Swedish astronomer Edvard Hugo von Zeipel, has been used for the better part of a century to predict the difference in surface gravity, brightness and temperature between a rapidly rotating star's poles and its equator. In 2011, using a technique called interferometry [[University of Michigan]] researchers essentially zoomed in to take close-up pictures and measurements of the winter star [[Regulus]]. It's the brightest star in the constellation Leonis and if it were spinning just a few percent faster, it would fly apart. The astronomers found that the actual difference in temperature between its equator and poles is much less than the old theory predicts. "Our model fitting of interferometry data shows that while the law correctly describes the trend of surface temperature variation, it deviates quantitively," said Xiao Che, a doctoral student in the Department of Astronomy who is first author of a paper on the findings to be published in Astrophysical Journal on April 20. "It is surprising to me that von Zeipel's law has been adopted in astronomy for such a long time with so little solid observational evidence." It's important to get this number right, says John Monnier, an associate professor in the U-M Department of Astronomy. "In some cases, we found a 5,000-degree Fahrenheit [2800 kelvins] difference between what the theory predicts and what our actual measurements show," Monnier said. "That has a big effect on total luminosity. If we don't take this into account, we get the star's mass and age and total energy output wrong."--&gt;
