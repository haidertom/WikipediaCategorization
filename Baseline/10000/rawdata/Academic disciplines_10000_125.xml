'''''A Hacker Manifesto''''' is a critical manifesto written by [[McKenzie Wark]], which criticizes the [[commodification]] of information in the age of digital culture and globalization. It was published in the United States in 2004.

== Structure, style and influence ==
A Hacker Manifesto is divided into 17 chapters, with each chapter including a series of short numbered paragraphs (a total of 389) that mimics the epigrammic style of [[Guy Debord]]’s [[The Society of the Spectacle]]. The opening sentence in the book, “A double spooking the world, the double of abstraction” &lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; is a clear homage to [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]’ [[The Communist Manifesto]] which opens with the line “A specter is haunting Europe - the specter of Communism”.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, Engels, Friedrich. ''The communist manifesto''. 1848. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Wark builds on Marx and Engels’ ideas, alongside Deleuze and Guattari, by adding two new classes of workers into the mix - the “hacker class” and the “vectoralist class”.

As its title reads, the book really is a manifesto. It's a public declaration of principles for a radically new vision and a call to arms based on that vision. The written style is not 'difficult' in comparison to other post-structuralist philosophical texts; however in Wark's own words, it's "abstract". There are a few spelling/grammar mistakes and the language can be tricky to sink in at times, but its short, bullet style paragraphs depict a lot in the least possible space. Influenced by Marx, the book is awash with Communist Manifesto-like lingo, and Wark proceeds to link Marx's ideas to concepts in the current digital information age we live in, such as "intellectual property".

== Main ideas ==

=== Abstraction/hacker ===
For Wark, hacking begins with what he defines as an "abstraction", the construction of different and unrelated matters into previously unrealized relations. Hackers produce new conceptions, perceptions and sensations hacked out of raw data. Everything and anything is a code for the hacker to hack, be it "programming, language, poetic language, math, or music, curves or colourings" &lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and once hacked, they create the possibility for new things to enter the world. What they create is not necessarily "great", or "even good", but new, in the areas of culture, art, science, and philosophy or "in any production of knowledge where data can be extracted from it."

Wark argues that (new) information comes from the hack. It doesn't matter if you are a computer programmer, a philosopher, a teacher, a musician, a physicist, if you essentially produce new information - it's a hack [http://intertheory.org/wark-ruiz.htm]. In this sense, hackers are creators and they bring new ideas into the world. The aim of the book is to highlight the origins, purpose and efforts by this emerging hacker class, who produce new; concepts, perceptions, and sensations out of the stuff of raw data.

=== Commodification of information ===
The commodification of information is about how information that was free is appropriated by the vectoral class. McKenzie claims that free information is not a product, but a condition of the affective allocation of resources. There are many public and gift economies based around free information that keep the question of property open.&lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to McKenzie Wark when information becomes a commodity it means we will only be able to see the information produced by the vectoral class. This is because they are the ones whose profits depend on the scarcity of information. So when information becomes intellectual property we are bound to repeat the same commodity form, because this is what the market decrees.&lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the previously mentioned hacker class that produces new information, free from the restrictions of a property form. This however is then used by the vectoral class, who own and control the means of production of information on an industrial scale. The hacker and the vectoral class aren’t always at odds with each other. They can compromise on the free flow of information and the extraction of wealth from this information to fund its development. Think of the open source movement, Reddit and Wikipedia. McKenzie Wark believes that the hacker class should ally themselves with the other producing classes so that they together don’t have to answer to the vectoral class anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Wark, McKenzie. ''A Hacker Manifesto''. Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vectoralist Class ===
The hacker's main opposition to creating a world where information is free, and free of scarcity, is what Wark denotes as the "vectoralist" class. Named for their control over vectors (i.e. various pathways and networks over which information flows), the vectoralist class are the modern day dotcom corporate giants, the transnational turbo-capitalist regime, who own the means of production and thus monopolize abstractions. They maintain control by waging "an intensive struggle to dispossess hackers of their intellectual property", enforced by a series of patent and copyright laws that are used to separate the hacker class from the fruits of their labor.

== Reception ==
"Ours is once again an age of manifestos. Wark's book challenges the new regime of property relations with all the epigrammatic vitality, conceptual innovation, and revolutionary enthusiasm of the great manifestos." —Michael Hardt, co-author of ''Empire''

"A Hacker Manifesto will yield some provocative ideas and real challenges to a world in which everything is commodified." —Eric J. Iannelli, The Times Literary Supplement

"Wark- responds to the problems created by the current proliferation of digital culture. He pumps air back into Marxian categories and spices them up with Debord and Gautarri. As Millions of young people illegally download electronic information off the Internet, Wark sees possibilities for revolutionary politics grounded on the chaotic circulation of information freed from the regime of property." -William W. Sokoloff, ''Political Theory'', Vol. 34, No. 1 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20452438]

"Writers, artists, biotechnologists, and software programmers belong to the 'hacker class' and share a class interest in openness and freedom, while the 'vectoralist' and 'ruling classes' are driven to contain, control, dominate, and own. Wark crafts a new analysis of the tension between the underdeveloped and 'overdeveloped' worlds, their relationships to surplus and scarcity, and the drive toward human actualization." —Michael Jensen, The Chronicle of Higher Education [http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674015432&amp;content=reviews]

'''American anthropology''' has [[culture]] as its central and unifying concept. This most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human [[experience]]s [[symbol]]ically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially. American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture:

# [[biological anthropology]]
# [[linguistic anthropology]]
# [[cultural anthropology]]
# [[archaeology]]

Research in these fields has influenced anthropologists working in other countries to different degrees.

== Biological anthropology ==

{{synthesis|date=May 2013}}
Discussion concerning culture among [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] centers around two debates. First, is culture uniquely human or shared by other species (most notably, other primates)? This is an important question, as the theory of [[evolution]] holds that humans are descended from (now extinct) non-human primates. Second, how did culture evolve among human beings?

Gerald Weiss noted that although Tylor's classic definition of culture was restricted to humans, many anthropologists take this for granted and thus elide that important qualification from later definitions, merely equating culture with any learned behavior. This slippage is a problem because during the formative years of modern primatology, some primatologists were trained in anthropology (and understood that culture refers to learned behavior among humans), and others were not. Notable non-anthropologists, like [[Robert Yerkes]] and [[Jane Goodall]] thus argued that since [[chimpanzee]]s have learned behaviors, they have culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Yerkes 1943 ''Chimpanzees: A Laboratory Colony''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]].  51–52, 189, 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Goodall 1963 "My Life Among Wild Chimpanzees" ''National Geographic'' 124: 308&lt;/ref&gt; Today, anthropological primatologists are divided, several arguing that non-human primates have culture, others arguing that they do not.&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Andrew 1963 "Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture" Alan Bryan ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 301–303, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bryan 1963 "The Essential Morphological basis for Human Culture" ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keleman 1963 "Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture" Alan Bryan ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 301–303 p.304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in nonhuman primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 301–328&lt;/ref&gt;

This scientific debate is complicated by ethical concerns. The subjects of primatology are non-human primates, and whatever culture these primates have is threatened by human activity. After reviewing the research on primate culture, W. C. McGrew concluded, "[a] discipline requires subjects, and most species of nonhuman primates are endangered by their human cousins.  Ultimately, whatever its merit, cultural primatology must be committed to cultural survival [i.e. to the survival of primate cultures]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;W. C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in Nonhuman Primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 323&lt;/ref&gt;

McGrew suggests a definition of culture that he finds scientifically useful for studying primate culture. He points out that scientists do not have access to the subjective thoughts or knowledge of non-human primates. Thus, if culture is defined in terms of knowledge, then scientists are severely limited in their attempts to study primate culture. Instead of defining culture as a kind of knowledge, McGrew suggests that we view culture as a process. He lists six steps in the process:&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;
# A new pattern of behavior is invented, or an existing one is modified.
# The innovator transmits this pattern to another.
# The form of the pattern is consistent within and across performers, perhaps even in terms of recognizable stylistic features.
# The one who acquires the pattern retains the ability to perform it long after having acquired it.
# The pattern spreads across social units in a population. These social units may be families, clans, troops, or bands.
# The pattern endures across generations.
McGrew admits that all six criteria may be strict, given the difficulties in observing primate behavior in the wild. But he also insists on the need to be as inclusive as possible, on the need for a definition of culture that "casts the net widely":

{{quote|Culture is considered to be group-specific behavior that is acquired, at least in part, from social influences.  Here, group is considered to be the species-typical unit, whether it be a troop, lineage, subgroup, or so on.  ''Prima facie'' evidence of culture comes from within-species but across-group variation in behavior, as when a pattern is persistent in one community of chimpanzees but is absent from another, or when different communities perform different versions of the same pattern.  The suggestion of culture in action is stronger when the difference across the groups cannot be explained solely by ecological factors ....|&lt;ref&gt;W.C. McGrew 1998 "Culture in Nonhuman Primates?" ''Annual Review of Anthropology'' 27: 305&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Charles Frederick Voegelin pointed out, if "culture" is reduced to "learned behavior," then all animals have culture.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Voegelin 1951 "Culture, Language and the Human Organism" ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology'' 7: 370&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly all specialists agree that all [[Primate cognition|primate species evidence common cognitive skills]]: knowledge of object-permanence, cognitive mapping, the ability to categorize objects, and creative problem solving.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=511}} Moreover, all primate species show evidence of shared social skills: they recognize members of their social group; they form direct relationships based on degrees of kinship and rank; they recognize third-party social relationships; they predict future behavior; and they cooperate in problem-solving.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=511}}

Nevertheless, the term "culture" applies to non-human animals only if we define culture as any or all learned behavior. Within mainstream physical anthropology, scholars tend to think that a more restrictive definition is necessary. These researchers are concerned with how human beings evolved to be different from other species. A more precise definition of culture, which excludes non-human social behavior, would allow physical anthropologists to study how humans evolved their unique capacity for "culture".

Chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'' and ''Pan paniscus'') are humans' (''Homo sapiens'') closest living relatives; both are descended from a common ancestor which lived around seven million years ago. [[Timeline of human evolution#Hominidae|Human evolution]] has been rapid with modern humans appearing about 340,000 years ago. During this time humanity evolved three distinctive features:
:(a) the creation and use of conventional symbols, including linguistic symbols and their derivatives, such as written language and mathematical symbols and notations; (b) the creation and use of complex tools and other instrumental technologies; and (c) the creation and participation in complex social organization and institutions.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=510}} According to [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Michael Tomasello]], "where these complex and species-unique behavioral practices, and the cognitive skills that underlie them, came from" is a fundamental anthropological question. Given that contemporary humans and chimpanzees are far more different from horses and zebras, or rats and mice, and that the evolution of this great difference occurred in such a short period of time, "our search must be for some small difference that made a big difference&amp;nbsp;– some adaptation, or small set of adaptations, that changed the process of primate cognitive evolution in fundamental ways."  According to Tomasello, the answer to this question must form the basis of a scientific definition of "human culture."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=510}}

In a recent review of the major research on human and primate tool-use, communication, and learning strategies, Tomasello argues that the key human advances over primates (language, complex technologies, and complex social organization) are all the results of humans pooling cognitive resources. This is called "the [[ratchet effect]]:" innovations spread and are shared by a group, and mastered "by youngsters, which enables them to remain in their new and improved form within the group until something better comes along." The key point is that children are born good at a particular kind of social learning; this creates a favored environment for social innovations, making them more likely to be maintained and transmitted to new generations than individual innovations.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=512}} For Tomasello, human social learning—the kind of learning that distinguishes humans from other primates and that played a decisive role in human evolution—is based on two elements: first, what he calls "imitative learning," (as opposed to "[[Emulation (observational learning)|emulative learning]]" characteristic of other primates) and second,  the fact that humans represent their experiences symbolically (rather than iconically, as is characteristic of other primates).  Together, these elements enable humans to be both inventive, and to preserve useful inventions. It is this combination that produces the ratchet effect.

The kind of learning found among other primates is "emulation learning," which "focuses on the environmental events involved&amp;nbsp;– results or changes of state in the environment that the other produced&amp;nbsp;– rather than on the actions that produced those results."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=520}}&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Michael Tomasello 1990 "Cultural Transmission in the Tool Use and Communicatory Signaling of Chimpanzees?" in ''"Language" and Intelligence in Monkeys and Apes: Comparative Developmental Perspectives'' ed. S. Parker, K. Bibson. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 274–311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello 1996 "Do Apes Ape?" in ''Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture'' ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press, pp. 319–346&lt;/ref&gt;  Tomasello emphasizes that emulation learning is a highly adaptive strategy for apes because it focuses on the effects of an act. In laboratory experiments, chimpanzees were shown two different ways for using a rake-like tool to obtain an out-of-reach-object. Both methods were effective, but one was more efficient than the other. Chimpanzees consistently emulated the more efficient method.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Nagell, K., Olguin, K. and Tomasello, M. 1993 "Processes of social learning in the tool use of chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') and human children (''Homo sapiens'')" in ''Journal of Comparative Psychology'' 107: 174–186&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of emulation learning are well documented among primates.  Notable examples include Japanese [[macaque]] potato washing, chimpanzee tool use, and chimpanzee gestural communication. In 1953, an 18-month-old female macaque monkey was observed taking sandy pieces of sweet potato (given to the monkeys by observers) to a stream (and later, to the ocean) to wash off the sand. After three months, the same behavior was observed in her mother and two playmates, and then the playmates' mothers. Over the next two years seven other young macaques were observed washing their potatoes, and by the end of the third year 40% of the troop had adopted the practice.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kawamura 1959 "The process of subcultural propagation among Japanese macaques" ''Primates'' 2: 43–60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;M. Kawai 1965 "Newly acquired pre-cultural behavior of the natural troop of Japanese monkeys on Koshima Islet" ''Primates'' 6: 1–30&lt;/ref&gt; Although this story is popularly represented as a straightforward example of human-like learning, evidence suggests that it is not. Many monkeys naturally brush sand off food; this behavior had been observed in the macaque troop prior to the first observed washing. Moreover, potato washing was observed in four other separate macaque troops, suggesting that at least four other individual monkeys had learned to wash off sand on their own.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Other monkey species in captivity quickly learn to wash off their food.&lt;ref&gt;E. Visalberghi and D. M. Fragaszy 1990 "Food washing behavior in tufted Capuchin monkeys, ''Cebusapella'', and crabeating macaques, ''Macaca fasciculais''" ''Animal Behavior'' 40: 829–836&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the spread of learning among the Japanese macaques was fairly slow, and the rate at which new members of the troop learned did not keep pace with the growth of the troop. If the form of learning were imitation, the rate of learning should have been exponential. It is more likely that the monkeys' washing behavior is based on the common behavior of cleaning off food, and that monkeys that spent time by the water independently learned to wash, rather than wipe their food. This explains both why those monkeys that kept company with the original washer, and who thus spent a good deal of time by the water, also figured out how to wash their potatoes. It also explains why the rate at which this behavior spread was slow.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=519}}

Chimpanzees exhibit a variety of population-specific tool use: termite-fishing, ant-fishing, ant-dipping, nut-cracking, and leaf-sponging. Gombe Chimpanzees fish for termites using small, thin sticks, but chimpanzees in Western Africa use large sticks to break holes in mounds and use their hands to scoop up termites.  Some of this variation may be the result of "environmental shaping" (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, and know how to eat insects.  When children see their mothers rolling over logs to eat the insects beneath, they quickly learn to do the same. In other words, this form of learning builds on activities the children already know.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomasello 1996 "Do Apes Ape?" in ''Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture'' ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press. pp: 319–346&lt;/ref&gt;

The kind of learning characteristic of human children is [[imitative learning]], which "means reproducing an instrumental act understood intentionally."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=512}} Human infants begin to display some evidence of this form of learning between the ages of nine and 12 months, when infants fix their attention not only on an object, but on the gaze of an adult which enables them to use adults as points of reference and thus "act on objects in the way adults are acting on them."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=513}} This dynamic is well documented and has also been termed "joint engagement" or "joint attention."&lt;ref&gt;R.

Dunham 1995 ''Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development''. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to this dynamic is the infant's growing capacity to recognize others as "intentional agents:" people "with the power to control their spontaneous behavior" and who "have goals and make active choices among behavioral means for attaining those goals."&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello 1995 "Joint attention as social cognition" in ''Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development,'' ed. C. Moore and P. Dunham.  Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Press, pp. 103–130&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of skills in joint attention by the end of a human child's first year of life provides the basis for the development of imitative learning in the second year. In one study 14-month-old children imitated an adult's over-complex method of turning on a light, even when they could have used an easier and more natural motion to the same effect.&lt;ref&gt;W. C. Meltzoff 1988 "Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli" in ''Developmental Psychology'' 24: 470–476&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, 16-month-old children interacted with adults who alternated between a complex series of motions that appeared intentional and a comparable set of motions that appeared accidental; they imitated only those motions that appeared intentional.&lt;ref&gt;M. Carpenter, N. Akhtar, M. Tomasello 1998 "Sixteen-month old infants differentially imitate intentional and accidental actions" in ''Infant Behavior &amp; Development'' 21: 315–330&lt;/ref&gt; Another study of 18-month old children revealed that children imitate actions that adults intend, yet in some way fail, to perform.&lt;ref&gt;A. Meltzoff 1995 "Understanding the intentions of others: re-enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children" in ''Developmental Psychology'' 31: 838–850&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomasello emphasizes that this kind of imitative learning "relies fundamentally on infants' tendency to identify with adults, and on their ability to distinguish in the actions of others the underlying goal and the different means that might be used to achieve it."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=514}} He calls this kind of imitative learning "cultural learning because the child is not just learning about things from other persons, she is also learning things through them&amp;nbsp;— in the sense that she must know something of the adult's perspective on a situation to learn the active use of this same intentional act."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=515}}&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M., Kruger, A. &amp; Ratner, H. 1993 "Cultural learning" ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'' 16, 495–552&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that the key feature of cultural learning is that it occurs only when an individual "understands others as intentional agents, like the self, who have a perspective on the world that can be followed into, directed and shared."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=516}}

Emulation learning and imitative learning are two different adaptations that can only be assessed in their larger environmental and evolutionary contexts. In one experiment, chimpanzees and two-year-old children were separately presented with a rake-like-tool and an out-of-reach object.  Adult humans then demonstrated two different ways to use the tool, one more efficient, one less efficient. Chimpanzees used the same efficient method following both demonstrations, regardless of what was demonstrated. Most of the human children, however, imitated whichever method the adult was demonstrating. If the chimps and humans were to be compared on the basis of these results, one might think that chimpanzees are more intelligent. From an [[evolution]]ary perspective they are equally intelligent, but with different kinds of intelligence adapted to different environments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Chimpanzee learning strategies are well-suited to a stable physical environment that requires little social cooperation (compared to humans). Human learning strategies are well-suited to a more complex social environment in which understanding the intentions of others may be more important than success at a specific task.  Tomasello argues that this strategy has made possible the "ratchet effect" that enabled humans to evolve complex social systems that have enabled humans to adapt to virtually every physical environment on the surface of the earth.{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|pp=520–521}}

Tomasello further argues that cultural learning is essential for language-acquisition. Most children in any society, and all children in some, do not learn all words through the direct efforts of adults. "In general, for the vast majority of words in their language, children must find a way to learn in the ongoing flow of social interaction, sometimes from speech not even addressed to them."&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This finding has been confirmed by a variety of experiments in which children learned words even when the referent was not present, multiple referents were possible, and the adult was not directly trying to teach the word to the child.&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello and M. Barton 1994 "Learning Words in non-Ostensive Contexts" ''Developmental Psychology'' 30: 639–650&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Akhtar and M. Tomasello 1996 "Twenty-four month old children learn words for absent objects and actions" in ''British Journal of Developmental Psychology'' 14: 79–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomasello, R. Strosberg, N. Akhtar 1996 "Eighteen-month old children learn words in non-ostensive contexts" in ''Journal of Child Language''; 23: 157–176&lt;/ref&gt; Tomasello concludes that "a linguistic symbol is nothing other than a marker for an intersubjectively shared understanding of a situation."{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=516}}

Tomasello's 1999 review of the research contrasting human and non-human primate learning strategies confirms [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Ralph Holloway]]'s 1969 argument that a specific kind of sociality linked to symbolic cognition were the keys to human evolution, and constitute the nature of culture. According to Holloway, the key issue in the evolution of ''H. sapiens'', and the key to understanding "culture," "is how man organizes his experience." Culture is "the ''imposition of arbitrary form upon the environment.''"{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=395}} This fact, Holloway argued, is primary to and explains what is distinctive about human learning strategies, tool-use, and language. Human tool-making and language express "similar, if not identical, cognitive processes" and provide important evidence for how humankind evolved.{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=396}}

In other words, whereas McGrew argues that anthropologists must focus on behaviors like communication and tool-use because they have no access to the mind, Holloway argues that human language and tool-use, including the earliest [[stone tool]]s in the fossil record 2.6 million years ago, are highly suggestive of cognitive differences between humans and non-humans, and that such cognitive differences in turn explain human evolution. For Holloway, the question is not ''whether'' other primates communicate, learn or make tools, but the ''way'' they do these things. "Washing potatoes in the ocean ... stripping branches of leaves to get termites," and other examples of primate tool-use and learning "are iconic, and there is no feedback from the environment to the animal."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=400}} Human tools, however, express an independence from natural form that manifests symbolic thinking. "In the preparation of the stick for termite-eating, the relation between product and raw material is iconic.  In the making of a stone tool, in contrast, there is no necessary relation between the form of the final product and the original material."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=401}}

In Holloway's view, our non-human ancestors, like those of modern chimpanzees and other primates, shared motor and sensory skills, curiosity, memory, and intelligence, with perhaps differences in degree. He adds: "It is when these are integrated with the unique attributes of arbitrary production (symbolization) and imposition that man qua cultural man appears."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=399}}

He also adds:

{{quote|I have suggested above that whatever culture may be, it includes "the imposition of arbitrary forms upon the environment."  This phrase has two components. One is a recognition that the relationship between the coding process and the phenomenon (be it a tool, social network, or abstract principle) is non-iconic. The other is an idea of man as a creature who can make delusional systems work—who imposes his fantasies, his non-iconic constructs (and constructions), upon the environment.  The altered environment shapes his perceptions, and these are again forced back on the environment, are incorporated into the environment, and press for further adaptation.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=395}}}}

This is comparable to the "ratcheting" aspect suggested by Tomasello and others that enabled human evolution to accelerate. Holloway concludes that the first instance of symbolic thought among humans provided a "kick-start" for brain development, tool complexity, social structure, and language to evolve through a constant dynamic of positive feedback. "This interaction between the propensity to structure the environment arbitrarily and the feedback from the environment to the organism is an emergent process, a process different in kind from anything that preceded it."{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=399}}

Linguists [[Charles Hockett]] and R. Ascher have identified thirteen design-features of language, some shared by other forms of animal communication. One feature that distinguishes human language is its tremendous productivity; in other words, competent speakers of a language are capable of producing an exponential number of original utterances. This productivity seems to be made possible by a few critical features unique to human language. One is "duality of patterning," meaning that human language consists of the articulation of several distinct processes, each with its own set of rules: combining [[phonemes]] to produce [[morphemes]], combining [[morphemes]] to produce words, and combining words to produce sentences. This means that a person can master a relatively limited number of signals and sets of rules, to create infinite combinations.  Another crucial element is that human language is [[symbol]]ic: the sound of words (or their shape, when written) typically bear no relation to what they represent.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Hockett and R. Ascher 1964 "The Human Revolution" in ''Current Anthropology'' 4: 135–168.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, their meaning is arbitrary. That words have meaning is a matter of convention. Since the meaning of words are arbitrary, any word may have several meanings, and any object may be referred to using a variety of words; the actual word used to describe a particular object depends on the context, the intention of the speaker, and the ability of the listener to judge these appropriately.  As Tomasello notes,

{{quote|An individual language user looks at a tree and, before drawing the attention of her interlocutor to that tree, must decide, based on her assessment of the listener's current knowledge and expectations, whether to say "that tree over there," "it," "the oak," "that hundred-year-oak," "the tree," "the bagswing tree," "that thing in the front yard," "the ornament," "the embarrassment," or any of a number of other expressions.  ... And these decisions are not made on the basis of the speaker's direct goal with respect to the object or activity involved, but rather that they are made on the basis of her goal with respect to the listener's interest and attention to that object or activity. This is why symbolic cognition and communication and imitative learning go hand-in-hand.|{{sfn|Michael Tomasello|1999|p=517}}}}

Holloway argues that the stone tools associated with genus ''Homo'' have the same features of human language:
{{quote|Returning to matter of syntax, rules, and concatenated activity mentioned above, almost any model which describes a language process can also be used to describe tool-making.  This is hardly surprising.  Both activities are concatenated, both have rigid rules about the serialization of unit activities (the grammar, syntax), both are hierarchical systems of activity (as is any motor activity), and both produce arbitrary configurations which thence become part of the environment, either temporarily or permanently.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=401}}}}

He also adds:

{{quote|Productivity can be seen in the facts that basic types were probably used for multiple purposes, that tool industries tend to expand with time, and that a slight variation on a basic pattern may be made to meet some new functional requisite. ''Elements of a basic "vocabulary" of motor operations—flakes, detachment, rotation, preparation of striking platform, etc.—are used in different combinations to produce dissimilar tools, with different forms, and supposedly, different uses''. . . . Taking each motor event alone, no one action is complete; each action depends on the prior one and requires a further one, and each is dependent on another ax on the original plan. In other words, at each point of the action except the last, the piece is not "satisfactory" in structure. Each unit action is meaningless by itself in the sense of the use of the tool; it is meaningful only in the context of the whole completed set of actions culminating in the final product. This exactly parallels language.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=402}}}}

As Tomasello demonstrates, symbolic thought can operate only in a particular social environment:

{{quote|Arbitrary symbols enforce consensus of perceptions, which not only allows members to communicate about the same objects in terms of space and time (as in hunting) but it also makes it possible for social relationships to be standardized and manipulated through symbols. It means that idiosyncrasies are smoothed out and perceived within classes of behavior. By enforcing perceptual invariance, symbols also enforce social behavioral constancy, and enforcing social behavioral constancy is a prerequisite to differential task-role sectors in a differentiated social group adapting not only to the outside environment but to its own membership.|{{sfn|Ralph L. Holloway Jr.|1969|p=406}}}}

[[Biological anthropology|Biological anthropologist]] Terrence Deacon, in a synthesis of over twenty years of research on human evolution, human neurology, and primatology, describes this "ratcheting effect" as a form of "Baldwinian Evolution." Named after [[psychology|psychologist]] [[James Mark Baldwin|James Baldwin]], this describes a situation in which an animal's behavior has evolutionary consequences when it changes the natural environment and thus the selective forces acting on the animal.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=322}}

{{quote|Once some useful behavior spreads within a population and becomes more important for subsistence, it will generate selection pressures on genetic traits that support its propagation ... Stone and symbolic tools, which were initially acquired with the aid of flexible ape-learning abilities, ultimately turned the tables on their users and forced them to adapt to a new niche opened by these technologies.  Rather than being just useful tricks, these behavioral prostheses for obtaining food and organizing social behaviors became indispensable elements in a new adaptive complex.  The origin of "humanness" can be defined as that point in our evolution where these tools became the {{sic|?|principle}} source of selection on our bodies and brains.  It is the diagnostic of ''Homo symbolicus''.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=344}}}}

According to Deacon, this occurred between 2 and 2.5 million years ago, when we have the first fossil evidence of stone tool use and the beginning of a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause—and not the effect—of these trends.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=340}} More specifically, Deacon is suggesting that ''Australopithecines'', like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of ''Australopithecine'' history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that "it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species."{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=347}} This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the "ratchet effect") that led to their evolution to genus ''Homo''.

The question for Deacon is what behavioral-environmental changes could have made the development of symbolic thinking adaptive? Here he emphasizes the importance of distinguishing humans from all other species, not to privilege human intelligence but to problematize it. Given that the evolution of ''H. sapiens'' began with ancestors who did not yet have "culture," what led them to move away from cognitive, learning, communication, and tool-making strategies that were and continued to be adaptive for most other primates (and, some have suggested, most other species of animals)?  Learning symbol systems is more time consuming than other forms of communication, so symbolic thought made possible a different communication strategy, but not a more efficient one than other primates. Nevertheless, it must have offered some selective advantage to ''H. sapiens'' to have evolved. Deacon starts by looking at two key determinants in evolutionary history: foraging behavior, and patterns of sexual relations. As he observes competition for sexual access limits the possibilities for social cooperation in many species; yet, Deacon observes, there are three consistent patterns in human reproduction that distinguish them from other species:
# Both males and females usually contribute effort towards the rearing of their offspring, though often to differing extents and in very different ways.
# In all societies, the great majority of adult males and females are bound by long-term, exclusive sexual access rights and prohibitions to particular individuals of the opposite sex.
# They maintain these exclusive sexual relations while living in modest to large-sized, multi-male, multi-female, cooperative social groups.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=384–385}} 
Moreover, there is one feature common to all known human foraging societies (all humans prior to ten or fifteen thousand years ago), and markedly different from other primates: "the use of meat. . . . The appearance of the first stone tools nearly 2.5 million years ago almost certainly correlates with a radical shift in foraging behavior to gain access to meat."{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=386}} Deacon does not believe that symbolic thought was necessary for hunting or tool-making (although tool-making may be a reliable index of symbolic thought); rather, it was necessary for the success of distinctive social relations.

The key is that while men and women are equally effective foragers, mothers carrying dependent children are not effective hunters. They must thus depend on male hunters. This favors a system in which males have exclusive sexual access to females, and females can predict that their sexual partner will provide food for them and their children. In most mammalian species the result is a system of rank or sexual competition that results in either polygyny, or lifelong pair-bonding between two individuals who live relatively independent of other adults of their species; in both cases male aggression plays an important role in maintaining sexual access to mate(s).

{{quote|Human reliance on resources that are relatively unavailable to females with infants selects not only for cooperation between a child's father and mother but also for the cooperation of other relatives and friends, including elderly individuals and juveniles, who can be relied upon for assistance. The special demands of acquiring meat and caring for infants in our own evolution together contribute to the underlying impetus for the third characteristic feature of human reproductive patterns: cooperative group living.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=386–387}}}}

What is uniquely characteristic about human societies is what required symbolic cognition, which consequently leads to the evolution of culture: "cooperative, mixed-sex social groups, with significant male care and provisioning of offspring, and relatively stable patterns of reproductive exclusion." This combination is relatively rare in other species because it is "highly susceptible to disintegration."  Language and culture provide the glue that holds it together.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|p=388}}

Chimpanzees also, on occasion, hunt meat; in most cases, however, males consume the meat immediately, and only on occasion share with females who happen to be nearby. Among chimpanzees, hunting for meat increases when other sources of food become scarce, but under these conditions sharing decreases. The first forms of symbolic thinking made stone tools possible, which in turn made hunting for meat a more dependable source of food for our nonhuman ancestors while making possible forms of social communication that make sharing between males and females, but also among males, decreasing sexual competition:

{{quote|So the socio-ecological problem posed by the transition to a meat-supplemented subsistence strategy is that it cannot be utilized without a social structure which guarantees unambiguous and exclusive mating and is sufficiently egalitarian to sustain cooperation via shared or parallel reproductive interests. This problem can be solved symbolically.|{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=396–397}}}}

Symbols and symbolic thinking thus make possible a central feature of social relations in every human population: reciprocity. Evolutionary scientists have developed [[Inclusive fitness|a model]] to explain [[reciprocal altruism]] among closely related individuals. Symbolic thought makes possible reciprocity between distantly related individuals.{{sfn|Terrence Deacon|1997|pp=397–401}}

== Archaeology ==

[[File:Orkney Skara Brae.jpg|thumb|Excavated dwellings at [[Skara Brae]], [[Europe]]'s most complete [[Neolithic]] village]]

In the 19th century [[archaeology]] was often a supplement to [[history]], and the goal of archaeologists was to identify artifacts according to their [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] and [[stratigraphy]], thus marking their location in time and space. [[Franz Boas]] established that archaeology be one of American anthropology's four fields, and debates among archaeologists have often paralleled debates among cultural anthropologists. In the 1920s and 1930s, Australian-British archaeologist [[V. Gordon Childe]] and American archaeologist [[W. C. McKern]] independently began moving from asking about the date of an artifact, to asking about the people who produced it&amp;nbsp;— when archaeologists work alongside historians, historical materials generally help answer these questions, but when historical materials are unavailable, archaeologists had to develop new methods.  Childe and McKern focused on analyzing the relationships among objects found together; their work established the foundation for a three-tiered model:
# An individual artifact, which has surface, shape, and technological attributes (e.g. an arrowhead)
# A sub-assemblage, consisting of artifacts that are found, and were likely used, together (e.g. an arrowhead, bow and knife)
# An assemblage of sub-assemblages that together constitute the archaeological site (e.g. the arrowhead, bow and knife; a pot and the remains of a hearth; a shelter)
Childe argued that a "constantly recurring assemblage of artifacts" is an "[[archaeological culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;V. Gordon Childe 1929 ''The Danube in Prehistory'' Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By R. Lee Lyman and Michael J. O'Brien, 2003 ''W.C. McKern and the Midwestern Taxonomic Method.''  University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa&lt;/ref&gt;  Childe and others viewed "each archaeological culture ... the manifestation in material terms of a specific ''people''."&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn, 2008 ''Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice'' Fifth edition.  New York: Thames and Hudson. p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, [[Walter Taylor (archaeologist)|Walter Taylor]] systematized the methods and concepts that archaeologists had developed and proposed a general model for the archaeological contribution to knowledge of cultures.  He began with the mainstream understanding of culture as the product of human cognitive activity, and the Boasian emphasis on the subjective meanings of objects as dependent on their cultural context.  He defined culture as "a mental phenomenon, consisting of the contents of minds, not of material objects or observable behavior."{{sfn|Walter Taylor|1948|p= 96}}  He then devised a three-tiered model linking cultural anthropology to archeology, which he called [[conjunctive archaeology]]:
# Culture, which is unobservable (behavior) and nonmaterial
# Behaviors resulting from culture, which are observable and nonmaterial
# Objectifications, such as artifacts and architecture, which are the result of behavior and material
That is, material artifacts were the material residue of culture, but not culture itself.{{sfn|Walter Taylor|1948|p=100}}  Taylor's point was that the archaeological record could contribute to anthropological knowledge, but only if archaeologists reconceived their work not just as digging up artifacts and recording their location in time and space, but as inferring from material remains the behaviors through which they were produced and used, and inferring from these behaviors the mental activities of people.  Although many archaeologists agreed that their research was integral to anthropology, Taylor's program was never fully implemented.  One reason was that his three-tier model of inferences required too much fieldwork and laboratory analysis to be practical.&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) p.685&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, his view that material remains were not themselves cultural, and in fact twice-removed from culture, in fact left archaeology marginal to cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dunnel 1986 "Five Decades of American Archaeology" in ''American Archaeology Past and Future: A Celebration of the Society for American Archaeology, 1935–1985''.  D. Meltzer and J. Sabloff, eds.  Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Leslie White's former student [[Lewis Binford]] proposed a new model for anthropological archaeology, called "the New Archaeology" or "[[Processual archaeology|Processual Archaeology]]," based on White's definition of culture as "the extra-somatic means of adaptation for the human organism."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Binford 1962 "Archaeology as Anthropology" in ''American Antiquity'' 28(2):218; see White 1959 ''The Evolution of Culture'' New York: McGraw Hill p.8&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition allowed Binford to establish archaeology as a crucial field for the pursuit of the methodology of Julian Steward's cultural ecology:

{{quote|The comparative study of cultural systems with variable technologies in a similar environmental range or similar technologies in differing environments is a major methodology of what Steward (1955: 36–42) has called "cultural ecology," and certainly is a valuable means of increasing our understanding of cultural processes. Such a methodology is also useful in elucidating the structural relationships between major cultural sub-systems such as the social and ideological sub-systems.|&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Binford 1962 "Archaeology as Anthropology" in ''American Antiquity'' 28(2):218; see Steward 1955 ''Theory of Culture Change''. University of Illinois Press, Urbana.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, Binford proposed an archaeology that would be central to the dominant project of cultural anthropologists at the time (culture as non-genetic adaptations to the environment); the "new archaeology" was the cultural anthropology (in the form of cultural ecology or ecological anthropology) of the past.

In the 1980s, there was a movement in the United Kingdom and Europe against the view of archeology as a field of anthropology, echoing Radcliffe-Brown's earlier rejection of cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) p.684&lt;/ref&gt;  During this same period, then-[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] archaeologist [[Ian Hodder]] developed "[[post-processual archaeology]]" as an alternative.  Like Binford (and unlike Taylor) Hodder views artifacts not as objectifications of culture but ''as'' culture itself.  Unlike Binford, however, Hodder does not view culture as an environmental adaptation.  Instead, he "is committed to a fluid semiotic version of the traditional culture concept in which material items, artifacts, are full participants in the creation, deployment, alteration, and fading away of symbolic complexes."&lt;ref&gt;Patty Jo Watson 1995 "Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept" in ''American Anthropologist'' 97(4) pp. 687–6874&lt;/ref&gt;  His 1982 book, ''Symbols in Action'', evokes the symbolic anthropology of Geertz, Schneider, with their focus on the context dependent meanings of cultural things, as an alternative to White and Steward's materialist view of culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hodder 1982 ''Symbols in action: ethnoarchaeological studies of material culture''  Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1991 textbook, ''Reading the Past: Current Approaches to Interpretation in Archaeology'' Hodder argued that archaeology is more closely aligned to history than to anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hodder 1986 ''Reading the past: current approaches to interpretation in archaeology'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic anthropology ==

The connection between culture and language has been noted as far back as the classical period and probably long before. The ancient Greeks, for example, distinguished between civilized peoples and [[Barbarian|bárbaroi]] "those who babble", i.e. those who speak unintelligible languages.&lt;ref&gt;Baepler, Paul. 2003. "White slaves, African masters." The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 588(1): 90–111. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that different groups speak different, unintelligible languages is often considered more tangible evidence for cultural differences than other less obvious cultural traits.

The German romanticists of the 19th century such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], often saw language not just as one cultural trait among many but rather as the direct expression of a people's national character,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/slovaklawsonlanguage/Herder_on_Language.pdf | title = Herder on Language | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such as culture in a kind of condensed form. Herder for example suggests, "''Denn jedes Volk ist Volk; es hat seine National Bildung wie seine Sprache''" (Since every people is a People, it has its own national culture expressed through its own language).&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Anderson, Benedict R.O'G. 1983. ''Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism.'' London: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Boas, founder of American anthropology, like his German forerunners, maintained that the shared language of a community is the most essential carrier of their common culture. Boas was the first anthropologist who considered it unimaginable to study the culture of a foreign people without also becoming acquainted with their language. For Boas, the fact that the intellectual culture of a people was largely constructed, shared and maintained through the use of language, meant that understanding the language of a cultural group was the key to understanding its culture. At the same time, though, Boas and his students were aware that culture and language are not directly dependent on one another. That is, groups with widely different cultures may share a common language, and speakers of completely unrelated languages may share the same fundamental cultural traits.&lt;ref&gt;Sapir 1921:228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sapir 1995: 59&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other scholars have suggested that the form of language determines specific cultural traits.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Von Humboldt, Wilhelm. 1820. ''Über das vergleichende Sprachstudium in Beziehung auf die verschiedenen Epochen der Sprachentwicklung''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the notion of [[linguistic determinism]], which states that the form of language determines individual thought. While Boas himself rejected a causal link between language and culture, some of his intellectual heirs entertained the idea that habitual patterns of speaking and thinking in a particular language may influence the culture of the linguistic group.{{sfn|Whorf|1941}} Such belief is related to the theory of [[linguistic relativity]]. Boas, like most modern anthropologists, however, was more inclined to relate the interconnectedness between language and culture to the fact that, as [[B.L. Whorf]] put it, "they have grown up together".{{sfn|Whorf|1941|p=293}}&lt;ref&gt;See also e.g. Boas, Franz. 1911. "Introduction." ''Handbook of American Indian Languages''. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the [[origin of language]], understood as the human capacity of complex symbolic communication, and the origin of complex culture is often thought to stem from the same evolutionary process in early man. Evolutionary anthropologist [[Robin I. Dunbar]] has proposed that language evolved as early humans began to live in large communities which required the use of complex communication to maintain social coherence. Language and culture then both emerged as a means of using symbols to construct social identity and maintain coherence within a social group too large to rely exclusively on pre-human ways of building community such as for example [[Social grooming|grooming]]. Since language and culture are both in essence symbolic systems, twentieth century cultural theorists have applied the methods of analyzing language developed in the science of linguistics to also analyze culture. Particularly the [[Structuralism|structural]] theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] which describes symbolic systems as consisting of signs (a pairing of a particular form with a particular meaning) has come to be applied widely in the study of culture. But also post-structuralist theories that nonetheless still rely on the parallel between language and culture as systems of symbolic communication, have been applied in the field of [[semiotics]]. The parallel between language and culture can then be understood as analog to the parallel between a linguistic sign, consisting for example of the sound &lt;nowiki&gt;[kau]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the meaning "cow", and a cultural sign, consisting for example of the cultural form of "wearing a crown" and the cultural meaning of "being king". In this way it can be argued that culture is itself a kind of language. Another parallel between cultural and linguistic systems is that they are both systems of practice, that is, they are a set of special ways of doing things that is constructed and perpetuated through social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;(Duranti 1997: 49)(Mannheim &amp; Tedlock 1995: 2)&lt;/ref&gt; Children, for example, acquire language in the same way as they acquire the basic cultural norms of the society they grow up in&amp;nbsp;– through interaction with older members of their cultural group.

However, languages, now understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speak them. Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group and difference from others. Even among speakers of one language several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. In linguistics such different ways of using the same language are called "[[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]]". For example, the English language is spoken differently in the US, the UK and Australia, and even within English-speaking countries there are hundreds of [[dialect]]s of English that each signals a belonging to a particular region and/or subculture. For example, in the UK the [[cockney]] dialect signals its speakers' belonging to the group of lower class workers of east London. Differences between varieties of the same language often consist in different pronunciations and vocabulary, but also sometimes of different grammatical systems and very often in using different [[Style (sociolinguistics)|styles]] (e.g. cockney [[rhyming slang]] or [[Legalese#Legalese|lawyers' jargon]]). Linguists and anthropologists, particularly [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguists]], [[Anthropological linguistics|ethnolinguists]] and [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologists]] have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between speech communities.

A community's ways of speaking or signing are a part of the community's culture, just as other shared practices are. Language use is a way of establishing and displaying group identity. Ways of speaking function not only to facilitate communication, but also to identify the social position of the speaker. Linguists call different ways of speaking language [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]], a term that encompasses geographically or socioculturally defined [[dialect]]s as well as the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|jargons]] or [[Style shifting|styles]] of [[subculture]]s. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, Patricia. (1986) "The acquisition of communicative style in Japanese." In B. Schieffelin and E. Ochs (eds) ''Language Socialization across Cultures''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between languages does not consist only in differences in pronunciation, vocabulary or grammar, but also in different "cultures of speaking". Some cultures for example have elaborate systems of "social deixis", systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"&gt;Foley 1997 p??&lt;/ref&gt; In English, social deixis is shown mostly though distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, but also in titles such as "Mrs.", "boy", "Doctor" or "Your Honor", but in other languages such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. In several languages of east Asia, for example [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and [[Old Javanese|Javanese]], different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.&lt;ref name="Foley 1997 p"/&gt; Other languages may use different forms of address when speaking to speakers of the opposite gender or in-law relatives and many languages have special [[Baby talk|ways of speaking to infants and children]]. Among other groups, the culture of speaking may entail ''not speaking'' to particular people, for example many indigenous cultures of Australia have a [[taboo]] against talking to one's in-law relatives, and in some cultures speech is not addressed directly to children. Some languages also require different ways of speaking for different social classes of speakers, and often such a system is based on gender differences, as in [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese|Japanese]] and [[Koasati]].&lt;ref&gt;Men's and Women's Speech in Koasati, Mary R. Haas, ''Language'', Vol. 20, No. 3 (Jul.&amp;nbsp;– Sep., 1944), pp. 142–149 (also summarized in Foley 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Universal versus particular ===

[[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Boas]] established modern American anthropology as the study of the sum total of human phenomena. c. 1915]]

The modern anthropological concept of culture has its origins in the 19th century with German anthropologist [[Adolf Bastian]]'s theory of the "psychic unity of mankind," which, influenced by Herder and von Humboldt, challenged the identification of "culture" with the way of life of European elites, and British anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]'s attempt to define culture as inclusively as possible.  Tylor in 1874 described culture in the following way: "Culture or [[civilization]], taken in its wide [[ethnographic]] sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E.B. 1874. ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Tylor was not aiming to propose a general theory of culture (he explained his understanding of culture in the course of a larger argument about the nature of religion), American anthropologists have generally presented their various definitions of culture as refinements of Tylor's.  Franz Boas's student [[Alfred Kroeber]] (1876–1970) identified culture with the "superorganic," that is, a domain with ordering principles and laws that could not be explained by or reduced to biology.&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Kroeber 1917 "The Superorganic" ''American Anthropologist'', New Series, Vol. 19, No. 2 pp. 163–213.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, Gerald Weiss reviewed various definitions of culture and debates as to their parsimony and power, and proposed as the most scientifically useful definition that "culture" be defined "''as our generic term for all human nongenetic, or metabiological, phenomena''" (italics in the original).&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Weiss 1973 "A Scientific Concept of Culture" in ''American Anthropologist'' 75(5): 1382&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ruth Benedict]] was instrumental in establishing the modern conception of distinct cultures being patterned. 1937]]

[[Franz Boas]] founded modern American anthropology with the establishment of the first graduate program in anthropology at Columbia University in 1896.  At the time the dominant model of culture was that of [[cultural evolution]], which posited that human societies progressed through stages of savagery to barbarism to civilization; thus, societies that for example are based on horticulture and [[Iroquois kinship]] terminology are less evolved than societies based on agriculture and [[Eskimo kinship]] terminology.  One of Boas's greatest accomplishments was to demonstrate convincingly that this model is fundamentally flawed, empirically, methodologically, and theoretically. Moreover, he felt that our knowledge of different cultures was so incomplete, and often based on unsystematic or unscientific research, that it was impossible to develop any scientifically valid general model of human cultures. Instead, he established the principle of [[cultural relativism]] and trained students to conduct rigorous [[participant observation]] field research in different societies. Boas understood the capacity for culture to involve symbolic thought and social learning, and considered the evolution of a capacity for culture to coincide with the evolution of other, biological, features defining [[Homo (genus)|genus Homo]].  Nevertheless, he argued that culture could not be reduced to biology or other expressions of symbolic thought, such as language. Boas and his students understood culture inclusively and resisted developing a general definition of culture. Indeed, they resisted identifying "culture" as a thing, instead using culture as an adjective rather than a noun. Boas argued that cultural "types" or "forms" are always in a state of flux.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1940 [1920] "The Methods of Ethnology", in ''Race, Language and Culture'' ed. George Stocking.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press.  253&lt;/ref&gt; His student Alfred Kroeber argued that the "unlimited receptivity and assimilativeness of culture" made it practically impossible to think of cultures as discrete things.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeber, Alfred L., 1948, ''Anthropology: Race, Language, Culture, Psychology, Prehistory'' revised edition.  New York: Harcourt, Brace, and World, Inc. p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

Boas's students dominated [[cultural anthropology]] through World War II, and continued to have great influence through the 1960s.  They were especially interested in two phenomena: the great variety of forms culture took around the world,&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1907 "Anthropology" in ''A Franz Boas Reader: The Shaping of American Anthropology 1883–1911'' ed. George Stocking Jr. 267–382&lt;/ref&gt; and the many ways individuals were shaped by and acted creatively through their own cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Boas, Franz 1920 "The Methods of Ethnology" in ''Race, Language, and Culture''. ed.

New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Ruth Benedict]] (1887–1948) and [[Margaret Mead]] (1901–1978), produced monographs or comparative studies analyzing the forms of creativity possible to individuals within specific cultural configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Ruth. ''The Chrysanthemum and the Sword:  Patterns of Japanese Culture.''  Rutland, VT and Tokyo, Japan:  Charles E. Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Mead 1928 ''Coming of Age in Samoa''&lt;/ref&gt;  Essential to their research was the concept of "context": culture provided a context that made the behavior of individuals understandable; geography and history provided a context for understanding the differences between cultures.  Thus, although Boasians were committed to the belief in the psychic unity of humankind and the universality of culture, their emphasis on local context and cultural diversity led them away from proposing [[cultural universal]]s or universal theories of culture.

There is a tension in cultural anthropology between the claim that culture is a universal (the fact that all human societies have culture), and that it is also particular (culture takes a tremendous variety of forms around the world). Since Boas, two debates have dominated cultural anthropology. The first has to do with ways of modeling particular cultures. Specifically, anthropologists have argued as to whether "culture" can be thought of as a bounded and integrated thing, or as a quality of a diverse collection of things, the numbers and meanings of which are in constant flux. Boas's student Ruth Benedict suggested that in any given society cultural traits may be more or less "integrated," that is, constituting a pattern of action and thought that gives purpose to people's lives, and provides them with a basis from which to evaluate new actions and thoughts, although she implies that there are various degrees of integration; indeed, she observes that some cultures fail to integrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} pp.46–47&lt;/ref&gt;  Boas, however, argued that complete integration is rare and that a given culture only appears to be integrated because of observer bias.&lt;ref&gt;Franz Boas 1940 [1932]  "The Aims of Anthropological Research," in ''Race, Language and Culture'' ed. George Stocking. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 256&lt;/ref&gt; For Boas, the appearance of such patterns—a national culture, for example—was the effect of a particular point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Bashkow, Ira 2004 "A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries" ''American Anthropologist'' 106(3): 446&lt;/ref&gt;

The first debate was effectively suspended in 1934 when Ruth Benedict published ''[[Patterns of Culture]]'', which has continuously been in print.  Although this book is well known for popularizing the Boasian principle of [[cultural relativism]], among anthropologists it constituted both an important summary of the discoveries of Boasians, and a decisive break from Boas's emphasis on the mobility of diverse cultural traits.  "Anthropological work has been overwhelmingly devoted to the analysis of cultural traits," she wrote "rather than to the study of cultures as articulated wholes."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by Polish-British social anthropologist [[Bronisław Malinowski]], however, she argued that "The first essential, so it seems today, is to study the living culture, to know its habits of thought and the functions of its institutions" and that "the only way in which we can know the significance of the selected detail of behavior is against the background of the motives and emotions and values that are institutionalized in that culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Influenced by German historians [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Oswald Spengler]], as well as by [[gestalt psychology]], she argued that "the whole determines its parts, not only their relation but their very nature,"&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Benedict 1934 ''Patterns of Culture'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; and that "cultures, likewise, are more than the sum of their traits."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; She observed that "Just as each spoken language draws very selectively from an extensive, but finite, set of sounds any human mouth (free from defect) can make, she concluded that in each society people, over time and through both conscious and unconscious processes, selected from an extensive but finite set of cultural traits which then combine to form a unique and distinctive pattern."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Benedict argues

{{quote|The significance of cultural behavior is not exhausted when we have clearly understood that it is local and man-made and hugely variable.  It tends to be integrated.  A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action.  Within each culture there come into being characteristic purposes not necessarily shared by other types of society.  In obedience to their purposes, each people further and further consolidates its experience, and in proportion to the urgency of these drives the heterogeneous items of behavior take more and more congruous shape.  Taken up by a well-integrated culture, the most ill-assorted acts become characteristic of its particular goals, often by the most unlikely metamorphoses.|&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Benedict felt that virtually all cultures are patterned, she argued that these patterns change over time as a consequence of human creativity, and therefore different societies around the world had distinct characters. ''Patterns of Culture'' contrasts [[Zuni people|Zuňi]], [[Dobu]] and [[Kwakiutl]] cultures as a way of highlighting different ways of being human.  Benedict observed that many Westerners felt that this view forced them to abandon their "dreams of permanence and ideality and with the individual's illusions of autonomy" and that for many, this made existence "empty."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.277&lt;/ref&gt;  She argued however that once people accepted the results of scientific research, people would "arrive then at a more realistic social faith, accepting as grounds of hope and as new bases for tolerance the coexisting and equally valid patterns of life which mankind has created for itself from the raw materials of existence."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

This view of culture has had a tremendous impact outside of anthropology, and dominated American anthropology until [[the Cold War]], when anthropologists like [[Sidney Mintz]] and [[Eric Wolf]] rejected the validity and value of approaching "each culture" as "a world in itself" and "relatively stable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benedict|1934}} p.271&lt;/ref&gt; They felt that, too often, this approach ignored the impact of [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]], and the world [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy on the peoples Benedict and her followers studied (and thus re-opened the debate on the relationship between the universal and the particular, in the form of the relationship between the global and the local).  In the meantime, its emphasis on metamorphosing patterns influenced French [[structuralism]] and made American anthropologists receptive to British [[structural-functionalism]].

[[File:Cousin-Kinship-chart.png|thumb|left|300px|Iroqois Kinship Structure]]
The second debate has been over the ability to make universal claims about all cultures.  Although Boas argued that anthropologists had yet to collect enough solid evidence from a diverse sample of societies to make any valid general or universal claims about culture, by the 1940s some felt ready. Whereas Kroeber and Benedict had argued that "culture"—which could refer to local, regional, or trans-regional scales—was in some way "patterned" or "configured," some anthropologists now felt that enough data had been collected to demonstrate that it often took highly structured forms.  The question these anthropologists debated was, were these structures statistical artifacts, or where they expressions of mental models?  This debate emerged full-fledged in 1949, with the publication of [[George Murdock]]'s ''Social Structure'', and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s ''Les Structures Élémentaires de la Parenté''.

Opposing Boas and his students was [[Yale University|Yale]] anthropologist [[George Murdock]], who compiled the [[Human Relations Area Files]].  These files code cultural variables found in different societies, so that anthropologists can use [[statistics|statistical methods]] to study correlations among different variables.&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, George, 1949 ''Social Structure'' New York: The Macmillan Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, G. P. 1967. ''Ethnographic Atlas: A Summary''. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdock, G. P. 1981. ''Atlas of World Cultures''. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ultimate aim of this project is to develop generalizations that apply to increasingly larger numbers of individual cultures.  Later, Murdock and [[Douglas R. White]] developed the [[standard cross-cultural sample]] as a way to refine this method.

French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[structuralism|structuralist anthropology]] brought together ideas of Boas (especially Boas's belief in the mutability of cultural forms, and Bastian's belief in the psychic unity of humankind) and French sociologist's [[Émile Durkheim]]'s focus on social structures (institutionalized relationships among persons and groups of persons). Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, Lévi-Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature.  His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing members of the same society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as [[myth]]s and [[ritual]]s) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only ''not'' consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which people ''are'' aware).  He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures.  He argued that just as there are laws through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of things, there were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe.  The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural "table of elements," and once completed, this table of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the very people who produced and lived through these cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude 1955 ''Tristes Tropiques'' Atheneum Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude ''[[Mythologiques I-IV]]'' (trans. John Weightman and Doreen Weightman); ''Le Cru et le cuit'' (1964), ''The Raw and the Cooked'' (1969); ''Du miel aux cendres'' (1966), ''From Honey to Ashes'' (1973); ''L'Origine des manières de table'' (1968) ''The Origin of Table Manners'' (1978); ''L'Homme nu'' (1971), ''The Naked Man'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;  Structuralism came to dominate French anthropology and, in the late 1960s and 1970s, came to have great influence on American and British anthropology.

Murdock's HRAF and Lévi-Strauss's structuralism provide two ambitious ways to seek the universal in the particular, and both approaches continue to appeal to different anthropologists.  However, the differences between them reveal a tension implicit in the heritage of Tylor and Bastian.  Is culture to be found in [[empiricism|empirically]] observed behaviors that may form the basis of generalizations?  Or does it consist of universal mental processes, which must be inferred and abstracted from observed behavior?  This question has driven debates among [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologists]] and [[archeology|archeologists]] as well.

=== Structural functionalism ===

In structural functionalism, as a [[social theory]], society is viewed as "a reality of structural and cultural components or "facts" that can be investigated".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=24gOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=Structural%20functionalism&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Structural-functionalism] in Michael Rosenberg, ''Introduction to Sociology'', Routledge, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the 1940s the Boasian understanding of culture was challenged by that new paradigm for anthropological and social science research.  This paradigm developed independently but in parallel in both the United Kingdom and in the United States (In both cases it is ''sui generis'': it has no direct relationship to "structuralism" except that both French structuralism and Anglo-American Structural-Functionalism were all influenced by Durkheim.  It is also analogous, but unrelated to, other forms of "functionalism").  Whereas the Boasians viewed anthropology as that natural science dedicated to the study of humankind, structural functionalists viewed anthropology as one social science among many, dedicated to the study of one specific facet of humanity.  This led structural-functionalists to redefine and minimize the scope of "culture."{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the United Kingdom, the creation of structural functionalism was anticipated by [[Raymond Firth]]'s (1901–2002) ''We the Tikopia'', published in 1936, and marked by the publication of ''African Political Systems'', edited by [[Meyer Fortes]] (1906–1983) and [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]] (1902–1973) in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Firth 1936 ''We the Tikopia: A Sociological Study of Kinship in Primitive Polynesia'' London Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer Fortes and E.E. Evans Pritchard 1940. ''African Political Systems''. London and New York: International African Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  In these works these anthropologists forwarded a synthesis of the ideas of their mentor, [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942), and his rival, [[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] (1881–1955).  Both Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown viewed anthropology—what they call "[[social anthropology]]"—as that branch of sociology that studied so-called primitive societies.  According to Malinowski's theory of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]], all human beings have certain biological needs, such as the need for food and shelter, and humankind has the biological need to reproduce.  Every society develops its own institutions, which function to fulfill these needs.  In order for these institutions to function, individuals take on particular social roles that regulate how they act and interact.  Although members of any given society may not understand the ultimate functions of their roles and institutions, an ethnographer can develop a model of these functions through the careful observation of social life.&lt;ref&gt;Bronisław Malinowski 1944 ''The Scientific Theory of Culture''&lt;/ref&gt;  Radcliffe-Brown rejected Malinowski's notion of function, and believed that a general theory of primitive social life could only be built up through the careful comparison of different societies.  Influenced by the work of French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), who argued that primitive and modern societies are distinguished by distinct social structures, Radcliffe-Brown argued that anthropologists first had to map out the social structure of any given society before comparing the structures of different societies.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1952 ''Structure and Function in Primitive Society''&lt;/ref&gt;  Firth, Fortes, and Evans-Pritchard found it easy to combine Malinowski's attention to social roles and institutions with Radcliffe-Brown's concern with social structures.  They distinguished between "social organization" (observable social interactions) and "social structure" (rule-governed patterns of social interaction), and shifted their attention from biological functions to social functions. For example, how different institutions are functionally integrated, and the extent to, and ways in, which institutions function to promote social solidarity and stability.  In short, instead of culture (understood as all human non-genetic or extra-somatic phenomena) they made "sociality" (interactions and relationships among persons and groups of people) their object of study.  (Indeed, Radcliffe-Brown once wrote "I should like to invoke a taboo on the word ''culture''.")&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1957 ''A Natural Science of Society'' Glencoe: The Free Press p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally, in 1946 [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979) founded the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Department of Social Relations]] at [[Harvard University]].  Influenced by such European sociologists as [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber]], Parsons developed a theory of social action that was closer to British [[social anthropology]] than to Boas's American anthropology, and which he also called "structural functionalism."  Parson's intention was to develop a total theory of social action (why people act as they do), and to develop at Harvard an inter-disciplinary program that would direct research according to this theory.  His model explained human action as the result of four systems:
# the "behavioral system" of biological needs
# the "personality system" of an individual's characteristics affecting their functioning in the social world
# the "social system" of patterns of units of social interaction, especially social status and role
# the "cultural system" of norms and values that regulate social action symbolically

According to this theory, the second system was the proper object of study for psychologists; the third system for sociologists, and the fourth system for cultural anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons 1937, ''The Structure of Social Action''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott Parsons
1951, ''The Social System''&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Boasians considered all of these systems to be objects of study by anthropologists, and "personality" and "status and role" to be as much a part of "culture" as "norms and values," Parsons envisioned a much narrower role for anthropology and a much narrower definition of culture.

Although Boasian cultural anthropologists were interested in norms and values, among many other things, it was only with the rise of structural functionalism that people came to identify "culture" with "norms and values." Many American anthropologists rejected this view of culture (and by implication, anthropology). In 1980, anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] wrote,

{{quote|As the social sciences transformed themselves into "behavioral" science, explanations for behavior were no longer traced to culture: behavior was to be understood in terms of psychological encounters, strategies of economic choice, strivings for payoffs in games of power.  Culture, once extended to all acts and ideas employed in social life, was now relegated to the margins as "world view" or "values".|&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf 1980 "They Divide and Subdivide and Call it Anthropology."  ''The New York Times'' November 30:E9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, several of Talcott Parsons' students emerged as leading American anthropologists.  At the same time, many American anthropologists had a high regard for the research produced by social anthropologists in the 1940s and 1950s, and found structural-functionalism to provide a very useful model for conducting ethnographic research.

The combination of American cultural anthropology theory with British social anthropology methods has led to some confusion between the concepts of "society" and "culture." For most anthropologists, these are distinct concepts. Society refers to a group of people; culture refers to a pan-human capacity and the totality of non-genetic human phenomena.  Societies are often clearly bounded; cultural traits are often mobile, and cultural boundaries, such as they are, can be typically porous, permeable, and plural.&lt;ref&gt;Ira Bashkow, 2004 "A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries," ''American Anthropologist'' 106(3):445–446&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1950s, and 1960s anthropologists often worked in places where social and cultural boundaries coincided, thus obscuring the distinction.  When disjunctures between these boundaries become highly salient, for example during the period of European de-colonization of Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, or during the [[Bretton Woods system|post-Bretton Woods]] realignment of [[globalization]], however, the difference often becomes central to anthropological debates.&lt;ref&gt;Appadurai, Arjun 1986 ''The Social Life of Things''.

Parsons' students [[Clifford Geertz]] and [[David M. Schneider]], and Schneider's student [[Roy Wagner]], went on to important careers as cultural anthropologists and developed a school within American cultural anthropology called "symbolic anthropology," the study of the social construction and social effects of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz 1973 ''The Interpretation of Cultures'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Schneider 1968 ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Wagner 1980 ''American Kinship: A Cultural Account'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janet Dolgin, David Kemnitzer, and David Schneider, eds. ''Symbolic Anthropology: a Reader in the Study of Symbols and Meanings''&lt;/ref&gt;  Since symbolic anthropology easily complemented social anthropologists' studies of social life and social structure, many British structural-functionalists (who rejected or were uninterested in Boasian cultural anthropology) accepted the Parsonian definition of "culture" and "cultural anthropology."  British anthropologist [[Victor Turner]] (who eventually left the United Kingdom to teach in the United States) was an important bridge between American and British symbolic anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Turner 1967 ''The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Attention to symbols, the meaning of which depended almost entirely on their historical and social context, appealed to many Boasians. [[Leslie White]] asked of cultural things, "What sort of objects are they? Are they physical objects? Mental objects? Both? Metaphors? Symbols? Reifications?" In ''Science of Culture'' (1949), he concluded that they are objects "''[[sui generis]]''"; that is, of their own kind. In trying to define that kind, he hit upon a previously unrealized aspect of symbolization, which he called "the symbolate"—an object created by the act of symbolization. He thus defined culture as "symbolates understood in an extra-somatic context."&lt;ref&gt;White, L. 1949. ''The Science of Culture: A study of man and civilization.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, by the 1930s White began turning away from the Boasian approach.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Barrett 1989, "The Paradoxical Anthropology of Leslie White,"
''American Anthropologist'' Vol. 91, No. 4 (Dec., 1989), pp. 986–999&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote,

{{quote|In order to live man, like all other species, must come to terms with the external world.... Man employs his sense organs, nerves, glands, and muscles in adjusting himself to the external world. But in addition to this he has another means of adjustment and control.... This mechanism is ''culture''.|&lt;ref&gt;Leslie White, 1949 "Ethnological Theory." In ''Philosophy for the Future: The Quest of Modern Materialism''. R. W. Sellars, V.J. McGill, and M. Farber, eds. Pp. 357–384. New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although this view echoes that of Malinowski, the key concept for White was not "function" but "adaptation."  Whereas the Boasians were interested in the history of specific traits, White was interested in the cultural history of the human species, which he felt should be studied from an evolutionary perspective.  Thus, the task of anthropology is to study "not only how culture evolves, but why as well.... In the case of man ... the power to invent and to discover, the ability to select and use the better of two tools or ways of doing something— these are the factors of cultural evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie White, 1943 "Energy and the Evolution of Culture." ''American Anthropologist'' 45: 339&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike 19th century evolutionists, who were concerned with how civilized societies rose above primitive societies, White was interested in documenting how, over time, humankind as a whole has through cultural means discovered more and more ways for capturing and harnessing energy from the environment, in the process transforming culture.

At the same time that White was developing his theory of [[cultural evolution]], Kroeber's student [[Julian Steward]] was developing his theory of [[cultural ecology]].  In 1938, he published ''Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Socio-Political Groups'' in which he argued that diverse societies—for example the indigenous [[Shoshone]] or White farmers on the Great Plains—were not less or more evolved; rather, they had adapted to different environments in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward 1938 ''Basin Plateau Aboriginal Socio-political Groups'' (Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin, No 20)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas Leslie White was interested in culture understood holistically as a property of the human species, Julian Steward was interested in culture as the property of distinct societies.  Like White he viewed culture as a means of adapting to the environment, but he criticized Whites "unilineal" (one direction) theory of cultural evolution and instead proposed a model of "multilineal" evolution in which (in the Boasian tradition) each society has its own cultural history.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward 1955 ''Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution'' University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

When Julian Steward left a teaching position at the University of Michigan to work in Utah in 1930, Leslie White took his place; in 1946 Julian Steward was made Chair of the Columbia University Anthropology Department.  In the 1940s and 1950s their students, most notably [[Marvin Harris]], [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert Murphy]], [[Roy Rappaport]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Elman Service]], [[Andrew P. Vayda]] and [[Eric Wolf]] dominated American anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1979 ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture'' New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1977 ''Cannibals and Kings: Origins of Cultures'' New York: Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marvin Harris 1974 ''Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture'' New York: Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy A. Rappaport 1967 ''Pigs for the Ancestors: Ritual in the Ecology of a New Guinea People''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Steward, ed. 1966 ''The people of Puerto Rico: a study in social anthropology''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press (includes doctoral dissertations of Mintz and Wolf)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Murphy 1960 ''Headhunter's Heritage; Social and Economic Change Among the Mundurucu Indians''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Sahlins and Elman Service, ''''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elman R. Service 1962 ''Primitive social organization: an evolutionary perspective'' New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Peter Vayda, ed. 1969 ''Environment and cultural behavior: ecological studies in cultural anthropology'' Garden City: Natural History Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Most promoted materialist understandings of culture in opposition to the symbolic approaches of Geertz and Schneider.  Harris, Rappaport, and Vayda were especially important for their contributions to [[cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]] and [[ecological anthropology]], both of which argued that "culture" constituted an extra-somatic (or non-biological) means through which human beings could adapt to life in drastically differing physical environments.

The debate between symbolic and materialist approaches to culture dominated American anthropologists in the 1960s and 1970s.  The [[Vietnam War]] and the publication of [[Dell Hymes]]' ''Reinventing Anthropology'', however, marked a growing dissatisfaction with the then dominant approaches to culture.  Hymes argued that fundamental elements of the Boasian project such as holism and an interest in diversity were still worth pursuing: "interest in other peoples and their ways of life, and concern to explain them within a frame of reference that includes ourselves."{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=11}}  Moreover, he argued that cultural anthropologists are singularly well-equipped to lead this study (with an indirect rebuke to sociologists like Parsons who sought to subsume anthropology to their own project):

{{quote|In the practice there is a traditional place for openness to phenomena in ways not predefined by theory or design&amp;nbsp;– attentiveness to complex phenomena, to phenomena of interest, perhaps aesthetic, for their own sake, to the sensory as well as intellectual, aspects of the subject.  These comparative and practical perspectives, though not unique to formal anthropology, are specially husbanded there, and might well be impaired, if the study of man were to be united under the guidance of others who lose touch with experience in concern for methodology, who forget the ends of social knowledge in elaborating its means, or who are unwittingly or unconcernedly culture-bound.|{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=42}}}}

It is these elements, Hymes argued, that justify a "general study of man," that is, "anthropology".{{sfn|Dell Hymes|1969|p=43}}

During this time notable anthropologists such as Mintz, Murphy, Sahlins, and Wolf eventually broke away; experimenting with [[Structuralism|structuralist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] approaches to culture, they continued to promote cultural anthropology against structural functionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Mintz 1985 ''Sweetness and Power'' New York: Viking Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Murphy 1971 ''The Dialectics of Social Life'' New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Sahlins 1976 ''Culture and Practical Reason''  Chicago: University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf 1971 ''Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Wolf, 1982 ''Europe and the People Without History'' Berkeley: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local versus global ===

[[File:Taiwanese aborigines.JPG|thumb|[[Taiwanese aborigines]] dancing]]

Boas and Malinowski established ethnographic research as a highly localized method for studying culture.  Yet Boas emphasized that culture is dynamic, moving from one group of people to another, and that specific cultural forms have to be analyzed in a larger context.  This has led anthropologists to explore different ways of understanding the global dimensions of culture.

In the 1940s and 1950s, several key studies focused on how trade between indigenous peoples and the Europeans who had conquered and colonized the Americas influenced indigenous culture, either through change in the organization of labor, or change in critical technologies. [[Bernard Mishkin]] studied the effect of the introduction of horses on [[Kiowa]] political organization and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Mishkin, Bernard 1940 ''Rank and Warfare in Plains Indian Culture.''  Monographs of the American Ethnological Society no. 3.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oscar Lewis]] explored the influence of the fur trade on [[Blackfoot Indians|Blackfoot]] culture (relying heavily on historical sources).&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Oscar 1942  ''The Effects of White Contact upon Blackfoot Culture, with Special Reference to the Role of the Fur Trade.''  Monographs of the American Ethnological Society no. 6.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Jablow]] documented how [[Cheyenne]] social organization and subsistence strategy between 1795 and 1840 were determined by their position in trade networks linking Whites and other Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Jablow, Joseph 1951 ''The Cheyenne in Plains Indian Trade Relations, 1795–1972.''  American Ethnological Society Monograph 19.  New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Secoy]] argued that [[Great Plains]] Indians' social organization and military tactics changed as horses, introduced by the Spanish in the south, diffused north, and guns, introduced by the British and French in the east, diffused west.&lt;ref&gt;Secoy, Frank 1953  ''Changing Military Patterns on the Great Plains (17th Century through Early 19th Century).'' American Ethnological Society Monograph 21, New York: J.J. Augustin.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mexico.Mor.Tepoztlan.01.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[El Tepozteco|Tepozteco]] mountain dominates views from Tepoztlán.]]
In the 1950s, [[Robert Redfield]] and students of [[Julian Steward]] pioneered "community studies," namely, the study of distinct communities (whether identified by race, ethnicity, or economic class) in Western or "Westernized" societies, especially cities.  They thus encountered the antagonisms 19th century critics described using the terms "high culture" and "low culture."  These 20th-century anthropologists struggled to describe people who were politically and economically inferior but not, they believed, culturally inferior. [[Oscar Lewis]] proposed the concept of a "culture of poverty" to describe the cultural mechanisms through which people adapted to a life of economic poverty.  Other anthropologists and sociologists began using the term "sub-culture" to describe culturally distinct communities that were part of larger societies.

One important kind of subculture is that formed by an immigrant community.  In dealing with immigrant groups and their cultures, there are various approaches:
* [[Leitkultur]] (core culture): A model developed in Germany by [[Bassam Tibi]]. The idea is that minorities can have an identity of their own, but they should at least support the core concepts of the culture on which the society is based.
* [[Melting pot]]: In the [[United States]], the traditional view has been one of a melting pot where all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.
* [[Monoculturalism]]: In some European states, culture is very closely linked to [[nationalism]], thus government policy is to assimilate immigrants, although recent increases in migration have led many European states to experiment with forms of multiculturalism.
* [[Multiculturalism]]: A policy that immigrants and others should preserve their cultures with the different cultures interacting peacefully within one nation.

The way nation states treat immigrant cultures rarely falls neatly into one or another of the above approaches.  The degree of difference with the host culture (i.e., "foreignness"), the number of immigrants, attitudes of the resident population, the type of government policies that are enacted, and the effectiveness of those policies all make it difficult to generalize about the effects. Similarly with other subcultures within a society, attitudes of the mainstream population and communications between various cultural groups play a major role in determining outcomes.  The study of cultures within a society is complex and research must take into account a myriad of variables.

'''Archival informatics''' is the [[theory]] and [[:wikt:application|application]] of [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] in and around the realm of [[archives]] and [[record keeping]].&lt;ref name="Archival Informatics Newsletter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archimuse.com/publishing/AMInewsletters/AMInewsletter1987_1-1.pdf |title=Archival Informatics Newsletter |author=[[David Bearman]]|publisher=[[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics]] |year=1987 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, it refers to the proper understanding and use of emerging technologies, techniques, and theories such as [[Computational linguistics|linguistic analysis]], [[heuristics]], and [[automation]] in the storage, manipulation and retrieval of archives and [[databases]].

An ''Archival Informatics Newsletter'' was started in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUQPAQAAMAAJ | title=Archival Informatics Newsletter | publisher=[[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics]] | year=1987 | volume=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first use of ''informatics'' specifically within the field of [[archival science]] dates back to 1986 with the formation of [[Archives &amp; Museum Informatics]] by [[David Bearman]].&lt;ref name="Archival Informatics Newsletter"/&gt; He indicated that he borrowed the term from the field of [[biomedicine]] where "the importance of information technologies (like computers), information techniques (like [[full-text]] retrieval or [[digitizing]] [[radiographic]] images) and information theories, especially those of linguistic analysis, [[artificial intelligence]], indexing and retrieval, are coming together in new ways of practicing medicine". The concept was critical to him because it illustrated a "system oriented view of the [[synergy|synergism]] of information based activities", rather than the more [[Parochialism|parochial]] view implied by confined subject names such as automation or computerization. Although it has been 21 years since this term has been introduced its usage is not common in [[literature]]; largely it is used in reference to Bearman’s creation, though exceptions do exist.&lt;ref name=AnneJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/agilliland/ |title=Anne J.

'''Biogeochemistry''' is the [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] that involves the study of the [[chemistry|chemical]], [[physics|physical]], [[geology|geological]], and [[biology|biological]] processes and reactions that govern the composition of the natural environment (including the [[biosphere]], the [[cryosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[pedosphere]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and the [[lithosphere]]). In particular, biogeochemistry is the study of the [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycles]] of [[chemical element]]s, such as [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]], and their interactions with and incorporation into [[life|living things]] transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time. The field focuses on chemical cycles which are either driven by or influence biological activity. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of [[Carbon cycle|carbon]], [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], [[Sulfur cycle|sulfur]], and [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus]] cycles. Biogeochemistry is a [[Systems thinking|systems science]] closely related to [[systems ecology]].

==History==
[[File:5009-0006-reverse.gif|thumb|right|Vladimir Vernadsky]]
The founder of biogeochemistry was [[Russia|Russian]] scientist [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]  whose 1926 book ''The [[Biosphere]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir I. Vernadsky, 2007, Essays on Geochemistry &amp; the Biosphere, tr. Olga Barash, Santa Fe, NM, Synergetic Press, {{ISBN|0-907791-36-0}} (originally published in Russian in 1924)&lt;/ref&gt; in the tradition of [[Mendeleev]], formulated a physics of the earth as a living whole. Vernadsky distinguished three spheres, where a sphere was a concept similar to the concept of a [[phase-space]]. He observed that each sphere had its own laws of [[evolution]], and that the higher spheres modified and dominated the lower:

# Abiotic sphere – all the non-living energy and material processes
# Biosphere – the life processes that live within the abiotic sphere
# Nöesis or [[noosphere]] – the sphere of human cognitive process

Human activities (e.g., agriculture and industry) modify the biosphere and abiotic sphere.  In the contemporary environment, the amount of influence humans have on the other two spheres is comparable to a geological force (see [[Anthropocene]]).

==Early development==
The American [[limnology|limnologist]] and [[geochemistry|geochemist]] [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] is credited with outlining the broad scope and principles of this new field. More recently, the basic elements of the discipline of biogeochemistry were restated and popularized by the British scientist and writer, [[James Lovelock]], under the label of the ''[[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia Hypothesis]]''.  Lovelock emphasizes a concept that life processes regulate the Earth through [[feedback]] mechanisms to keep it habitable.

==Research==
There are biogeochemistry research groups in many universities around the world.  Since this is a highly inter-disciplinary field, these are situated within a wide range of host disciplines including: [[atmospheric sciences]], [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[geomicrobiology]], [[environmental chemistry]], [[geology]], [[oceanography]] and [[soil science]].  These are often bracketed into larger disciplines such as [[earth science]] and [[environmental science]].

Many researchers investigate the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s of [[chemical element]]s such as [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]], as well as their [[stable isotope]]s.  The cycles of [[trace element]]s such as the [[trace metal]]s and the [[radionuclide]]s are also studied. This research has obvious applications in the exploration for ore deposits and oil, and in remediation of environmental pollution.

Some important research fields for biogeochemistry include:
* [[scientific model|modelling]] of natural systems
* soil and water acidification recovery processes
* [[eutrophication]] of surface waters
* [[carbon sequestration]]
* [[Environmental remediation]]
* [[global change]]
* [[climate change]]
* biogeochemical [[prospecting]] for ore deposits
* [[Soil chemistry]]

The '''Buddhist Digital Resource Center''' (BDRC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Joining digital technology with scholarship, BDRC ensures that the ancient wisdom and cultural treasures of the [[Buddhist]] literary tradition are not lost, but are made available for future generations. BDRC is committed to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Current programs focus on the preservation of texts in [[Pali]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]].

==History==
In 2017, [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|TBRC]] announced the expansion of institutional mission to include the preservation of texts in languages beyond [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], including [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. To reflect this expansion, they have officially changed organizational name from [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center]] (TBRC) to Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC). In 2017, BDRC will begin preserving and making accessible texts in languages beyond Tibetan, starting with [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbrc.org/?locale=bo#!footer/news/20170210 Introducing Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon''' is a non-profit medical institution dedicated to the comprehensive treatment of pediatric cancer.  The center is affiliated with [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], founded by Lebanese U.S. comedian and actor [[Danny Thomas]]. He had a dream to open a similar medical institute in his ancestral home of [[Lebanon]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Danny Thomas's children [[Marlo Thomas|Marlo]] and [[Tony Thomas (producer)|Tony Thomas]] pursued his dream until the center opened in [[Beirut]] on April 12, 2002.  The center, which is located on 56 [[Rue Clémenceau]], works in association with the nearby [[American University of Beirut]] Medical Center (AUBMC). The mission of the center is to save children's lives using the protocols of [[St. Jude]].  The center depends completely on donations and fundraising programs. 

On April 12, 2002, the late Prime Minister of Lebanon, [[Rafik Hariri]], several ministers of the [[Lebanese government]] and members of the [[Lebanese Parliament]], as well as major officials from the [[American University of Beirut]], joined a delegation from  the [[American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities]] and [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] and the board of the ''Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon'' for the inauguration ceremony of the center. Additionally, parents and families of Lebanese children treated at St. Jude's in Memphis also attended the opening ceremony.

[[File:Hubert Lamb Building.jpg|right|thumb|The Hubert Lamb Building, University of East Anglia, where the Climatic Research Unit is based]]
The '''Climatic Research Unit''' ('''CRU''') is a component of the [[University of East Anglia]] and is one of the leading institutions concerned with the study of natural and [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Craig | title = The forecast for Scotland: wet, wet, wet | work = The Scotsman | date = 8 February 2005 | url = http://news.scotsman.com/weather/The-forecast-for-Scotland-wet.2601547.jp | accessdate = 1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a staff of some thirty research scientists and students, the CRU has contributed to the development of a number of the data sets widely used in climate research, including one of the global temperature records used to monitor the state of the climate system,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/about/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Global temperature 2008: Another top-ten-year | publisher = Met Office | date = 3 January 2008 | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2008/pr20080103.html | accessdate = 1 November 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184106/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/corporate/pressoffice/2008/pr20080103.html | archivedate = 11 May 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as statistical software packages and [[climate model]]s.&lt;ref name="UEA Climatic Research Unit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/about/ |title=About the Climatic Research Unit|accessdate=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The CRU was founded in 1971 as part of the university's School of [[Environmental science]]s. The establishment of the Unit owed much to the support of Sir [[Graham Sutton]], a former Director-General of the [[Meteorological Office]], Lord [[Solly Zuckerman]], an adviser to the University, and Professors [[Keith Clayton]] and [[Brian Funnel]], Deans of the School of Environmental Sciences in 1971 and 1972.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxvii"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hulme, Michael|editor2=Barrow, Elaine|author1=Lamb, H.H.|author2=Clayton, K.M.|author3=Wigley, T.M.L.|title=Climates of the British Isles: present, past and future|chapter=The Climatic Research Unit at Twenty-five Years|page=xxvii–xxix|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=978-0-415-13016-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZVVkhW8wL8C&amp;pg=PR27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; Initial sponsors included [[BP|British Petroleum]], the [[Nuffield Foundation]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE285&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=50HjSi5o8J0C&amp;pg=PA285 |title=The history of the University of East Anglia, Norwich |author=Michael Sanderson |page=285 |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-85285-336-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] was another early benefactor, and the [[Wolfson Foundation]] gave the Unit its current building in 1986.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxvii" /&gt; Since the second half of the 1970s the Unit has also received funding through a series of contracts with the [[United States Department of Energy]] to support the work of those involved in climate reconstruction and analysis of the effects on climate of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxviii"&gt;Hulme &amp; Barrow (1997), p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Government ([[Margaret Thatcher]]) became a strong supporter of climate research in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name = HistoryCRU /&gt;

The first director of the unit was Professor [[Hubert Lamb]], who had previously led research into climatic variation at the [[Met Office]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; He was then known as the "''ice man''" for his prediction of [[global cooling]] and a coming [[ice age]] but, following the UK's exceptionally [[1976 United Kingdom heat wave|hot summer of 1976]], he switched to predicting a more imminent [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; The possibility of major weather changes and flooding attracted attention to the unit and sponsorship by major insurance companies wanting to mitigate their potential losses.&lt;ref name=HistUAE285/&gt; Prior to the Unit's establishment, it had widely been believed by the meteorological establishment that the climate was essentially constant and unvarying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maunder|first=W.J.|title=The uncertainty business: risks and opportunities in weather and climate|page=6|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1986|isbn=978-0-416-36100-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamb and others in the climatological community had for years argued that the climate system was in fact highly variable on timescales of decades to centuries and longer. The establishment of the CRU enabled Lamb and his colleagues to focus on this issue and eventually to win the argument decisively.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxvii" /&gt;

Hubert Lamb retired in 1978. His successors were [[Tom Wigley]] (1978–1993), [[Trevor Davies]] (1993–1998), [[Jean Palutikof]] and [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] (jointly 1998–2004), Phil Jones (2004–2016), and [[Tim Osborn]] (from January 2017);&lt;ref name=HistoryCRU&gt;{{cite web|title = History of the Climatic Research Unit|publisher = Climatic Research Unit, [[University of East Anglia]]|url = http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/about-cru/history|accessdate = 21 January 2017|archivedate = 18 January 2017|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170118234215/http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/about-cru/history|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url = https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/tim-osborn-to-take-over-leadership-of-cru|title = Tim Osborn to take over leadership of CRU|publisher = [[University of East Anglia]]|date = 21 December 2016|accessdate = 20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Liss]] was acting director during investigations between December 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url = http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/dec/CRUphiljones|title = CRU Update 3|date = 1 December 2009|accessdate = 14 April 2010|archivedate = 2 December 2014|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141202075038/http://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2009/dec/CRUphiljones|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and July 2010.&lt;ref name="McCarthy2010-07-08"&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/conspiracy-theories-finally-laid-to-rest-by-report-on-leaked-climate-change-emails-2021222.html|last = McCarthy|first = Michael|title = 'Conspiracy theories finally laid to rest' by report on leaked climate change emails|date = 8 July 2010|newspaper = [[The Independent]]|accessdate = 20 January 2017|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160307144651/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/conspiracy-theories-finally-laid-to-rest-by-report-on-leaked-climate-change-emails-2021222.html|archivedate = 7 March 2016|deadurl = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the unit moved to a new cylindrical building designed by [[Rick Mather]].&lt;ref name=HistUAE345&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=50HjSi5o8J0C&amp;pg=PA345|title = The history of the University of East Anglia, Norwich|first = Michael|last = Sanderson|page = 345|year = 2002|isbn=978-1-85285-336-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, this was named the ''Hubert Lamb Building'' in honour of the first director.&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink = Fred Pearce|last = Pearce|first = Fred|title = The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming|year = 2010|publisher = [[Guardian Books]]|isbn = 978-0-85265-229-9|page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

At the time of its establishment the CRU set out four key aims, which still remain valid:

* To establish firmer knowledge of the history of climate in the recent and distant past.
* To monitor and report on current climatic developments on a global scale.

CRU produces a range of climate datasets, covering temperature, precipitation, pressure and circulation, both global and regional.&lt;ref name="Data"&gt;{{cite web |title=Data | website=CRU | url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/data | accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the CRU's most significant products is the CRUTEM global dataset of land near-surface temperature anomalies on a 5° by 5° grid-box basis, which is compiled in conjunction with the [[Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research]] and its sea-surface temperature dataset to produce the [[HadCRUT]] [[Instrumental temperature record|temperature record]].&lt;ref name="CRUTEM"&gt;{{cite web | title=Temperature data (HadCRUT4) | website=CRU | date=27 August 2015 | url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/ | accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; First compiled in the early 1980s, the record documents global temperature fluctuations since the 1850s. The CRU compiles the land component of the record and the Hadley Centre provides the marine component. The merged record is used by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] in all its publications.&lt;ref name="Hulme-xxviii" /&gt; Other products include the CRU TS high resolution gridded land surface dataset of multiple factors including precipitation, vapour pressure and cloud cover as well as temperatures.&lt;ref name="CRU TS"&gt;{{cite web | title=High-resolution gridded datasets | website=CRU | date=1 September 2015 | url=http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/ | accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRU is also involved in a study of Eurasian climate over the last 10,000 years based upon [[dendroclimatology|tree ring data]] and a study of European climate in the last 200 years based upon temperature records.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt; It is a participant in MEDALUS – the [[Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use project]].&lt;ref name=ed&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFmadtCvtRoC&amp;pg=PA72 |pages=72–3 |title=The environment dictionary |author=David D.

===Release of raw meteorological data === 
{{main|Freedom of Information requests to the Climatic Research Unit}}
The CRU collates data from many sources around the world. In August 2009 its director, [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]], told the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' that he was working to make the data publicly available with the agreement of its owners but this was expected to take some months, and objections were anticipated from National Meteorological Organisations that made money from selling the data. It was not free to share that data without the permission of its owners because of confidentiality agreements, including with institutions in Spain, Germany, Bahrain and Norway, that restricted the data to academic use. In some cases the agreements were made orally, and some of the written agreements had been lost during a move. Despite this, the CRU was the focus of numerous requests under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] for data used by the unit's scientists. ''Nature'' reported that in the course of five days in July 2009 the CRU had been "inundated" with 58 FOI requests from [[Stephen McIntyre]] and people affiliated with his [[Climate Audit]] blog requesting access to raw climate data or information about their use.&lt;ref name="Nature 20090812"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090812/full/460787a.html|title=Climate data spat intensifies|date=12 August 2009|issue=460|page=787|work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]}} Subscription or payment required to read article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011 a large amount of raw weather station data had been released by the [[Met Office]] and the US [[Global Historical Climatology Network]], but around two-thirds of the data owners did not respond to the CRU requests for agreement, and both [[Poland]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] declined. Two FOIA requests for data shared with another researcher were refused by the university, and the requestors appealed this to the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO). In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO required CRU to release the remaining raw data irrespective of the wishes of the meteorological organisations which owned the data. This decision included data from Trinidad and Tobago but did not cover Poland. The raw data release was completed by 27 July 2011.&lt;ref name="beeb 27 July 2011"&gt;{{Cite web |last = Black | first = Richard | title = Climate unit releases virtually all remaining data | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-14315747 |work=''BBC News''|date = 27 July 2011 | accessdate =15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of textiles''' refers to the processes by which [[textile]]s are cared for and maintained to be [[preservation (library and archival science)|preserved]] from future damage.  The field falls under the category of [[art conservation]] as well as [[Preservation (library and archival science)|library preservation]], depending on the type of collection.  In this case, the concept of textile preservation applies to a wide range of artifacts, including [[tapestry|tapestries]], [[carpet]]s, [[quilt]]s, [[clothing]], [[flag]]s and [[curtain]]s, as well as objects which ‘’contain’’ textiles, such as upholstered [[furniture]], dolls, and accessories such as fans, [[umbrella|parasols]], [[glove]]s and [[hat]]s or [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]].  Many of these artifacts require specialized care, often by a professional conservator.  The goal of this article is to provide a general overview of the textile preservation process, and to serve as a jumping-off point for further research into more specialized care.  Always contact a professional conservator if you are unsure of how to proceed in the preservation process.

==Collections==
Historic textile collections can largely be divided into three categories:  [[museum]]s, historic societies/locations, and [[private collection]]s.  The needs of each of these locations will vary.  A private collection, for instance, is less likely to have as high a traffic flow as a museum, and may thus be able to take preservation steps that a working museum cannot (such as keeping lights to a minimum for longer periods of time).  The different venues may also have different problems that arise, such as the fact that many historic homes do not have climate control, and rely strongly on natural light to display their furnishings, both of which may contribute to textile decay.

==Environment==
[[Image:Crochet linen collar damaged.jpg|left|thumb|Deterioration and discoloration due to poor storage on a crocheted linen collar of the 1920s or 1930s.]]
The chief cause for decay in textiles is almost always the environment in which they are stored.  Light, temperature, and humidity can all contribute to a textile’s health or deterioration, depending on their intensity.  Additionally, pests, chemicals, and pollutants may also cause damage to an antique fabric.  Airborne chemicals, such as smog or cigarette smoke are also harmful to the textiles, and should be avoided if at all possible:  high-efficiency air filters should be installed throughout the building to reduce the presence of airborne chemicals that may stain, discolor, or weaken fabrics.

===Light===
[[Light]] can have a variety of effects on textiles over time.  In some cases, it may contribute to fading or discoloration, but of more concern is the damage which the fibers may suffer under prolonged exposure to non-visible light, such as [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]] lighting.  Ideally, textiles should be stored or displayed in as little light as possible, and preferably in total darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 26&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as this is impractical for display and care of the piece, knowing the limits of lighting as well as the safest amounts of lighting, become important.

[[Sunlight|Natural light]] is the most common source of ultraviolet light, and as such, care should be taken to avoid exposure to direct sunlight at all costs, and indirect sunlight whenever possible.  This may mean storing or displaying textiles in an area without windows, or with blackout curtains, which can be pulled whenever the room is not in use.  If a room relies on natural light, UV screens or coatings can be applied to the windows to block harmful rays while still allowing light to pass through.  These filters should be checked periodically, however, as they have a limited lifespan and may need to be replaced every few years.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fluorescence|Fluorescent]] and halogen-produced light can also produce large amounts of UV radiation, though filters which fit over the bulbs are available to limit the damaging light.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 21&lt;/ref&gt; These filters will need to be replaced when the bulbs are changed, so maintenance staff should be aware of them and their use.

One advantage of fluorescent lights is that they produce little [[heat]], which may also be harmful to textiles.  [[Incandescent light bulb|Incandescent lights]] produce a large amount of heat in addition to large quantities of infrared radiation, which is likewise damaging to the fibers in antique textiles.  If incandescent lights must be used, they should be placed far enough away from display cases that their heat does not affect the contents.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;  	

In the case of particularly delicate textiles, display organizers might consider [[motion detection|motion-activated]] or timed lighting, or lighting controlled though a visitor-activated switch, which would allow the textiles to remain in darkness when they are not under view.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 23&lt;/ref&gt;  All textiles should be displayed on a rotating schedule, allowing them a few months of display, then the rest of the year in dark storage, to prolong their life.

===Climate===

Heat and [[humidity]] can both contribute and a textile’s deterioration.  However, excessive dryness may also cause damage, especially to elastic fibers, such as [[wool]], which rely on some amount of [[moisture]] to maintain their flexibility (Putnam and Finch).  Additionally, [[temperature]] and humidity should be kept as constant as possible; changes in either of these may cause the textile fibers to expand and contract, which, over time, can also cause damage and deterioration to the textile.  For this reason, both storage and display areas should be fitted with [[hygrometer|monitoring equipment]] to gauge the temperature and humidity of rooms, display cases, enclosed storage facilities, and work areas.

Ideally, temperature should be kept around 70 degrees [[Fahrenheit]],&lt;ref name="Fahey"&gt;Fahey&lt;/ref&gt; though some slight fluctuation in either direction is permissible, as long as it occurs gradually.&lt;ref name="Mailand 6"&gt;Mailand 6&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, temperature may be slightly lower in winter to save energy costs, but the change should be effected slowly, so as not to place the fibers under undue stress.

As for humidity, the preservationist or conservator should aim for a relative humidity of 50%, though, as with temperature, some small fluctuation is allowable, as long as it occurs gradually (Mailand).  In enclosed display or storage cases, humidity can be somewhat maintained through the use of [[silica gel]] crystals.  These crystals should not be placed in contact with the textiles, but may be placed in breathable muslin bags and hung inside the case to maintain a constant humidity;&lt;ref name="Mailand 6"/&gt; they should be monitored periodically, however, to be sure that they are working.

In areas where [[HVAC|climate control]] is unavailable (such as in historic buildings), the conservator can still moderate the temperature and relative humidity through use of fans, [[humidifiers]] and [[dehumidifiers]], and portable heating or cooling units.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to temperature and humidity, air flow is also a concern for textile preservation.  Textiles should never be sealed in plastic or other air-tight casing unless it is part of a treatment or cleaning process.  Proper circulation, combined with the suggested humidity, will help to prevent the growth of [[mold]] and [[mildew]], which may [[stain]] or weaken antique textiles.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pests===

Pests are another significant threat to textile collections, as there are a number of creatures which can cause damage to fibres.  Among the most common are [[tineidae|clothes moths]], [[dermestidae|carpet beetles]], [[silverfish]], [[firebrat]]s and rodents.

Clothes moths are attracted to [[protein]] fibres, and so are especially drawn to [[silk]], wool, and [[feather]]s.  An infestation might be identified through the evidence of white [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s (or the remnants thereof) on the textiles, or of sighting the insects themselves.  They are roughly 8 centimetres long and white in colour.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;

Like clothes moths, carpet beetles are likewise drawn to proteins, and can be quite destructive.  Evidence of an infestation may take of the form of chewed holes, carcasses, or larvae, which appear as small pale worm-like insects.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;

Silverfish and firebrats are related insects which consume [[starch]], usually found in [[Sizing#Textile warp sizing|sizing]] or other treatments applied to fabrics, as well as plant-based textiles such as [[linen]] and [[cotton]].  Both are attracted to dark, moist climates, though silverfish prefer cooler temperatures, while firebrats tend towards warmer.  Both are about 12 millimetres in length and either light or dark in colouring, depending on which type is present.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;

Rodent infestations can be identified in the usual ways, such as seeing droppings, nests, or comparatively large chewed areas of textile where they have caused damage.
	
In all cases, [[chemical]] means of [[pest control]] should be avoided if possible, not only due to harm to humans who come in contact with them, but because the chemicals may cause damage to the very textiles the conservator is trying to save.  For rodents, [[mousetrap|snap traps]] may be effective, and if needed, a professional [[Pest control|exterminator]] should be called.  Poison baited traps should be avoided, as the rodent could die somewhere inaccessible, and provide a breeding ground for further pests.&lt;ref name="Mailand and Alig 27"&gt;Mailand and Alig 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in the case of a rodent infestation, all access points to the room (such as cracks or holes) through which they might be entering should be located and sealed if possible.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand 11&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[insect]]s, keeping clean storage, display, and work environment is the best method of prevention.  Also, sticky [[insect trap|traps]] (replaced often) around doors, windows, and display cases may be useful for monitoring the insect population.  Furthermore, the population of carnivorous insects, such as [[spider]]s, should be observed.  While such insects are not harmful to textiles by themselves, they may indicate another population of insects which are.&lt;ref name="Mailand and Alig 27"/&gt;

If the infestation can be limited to one or a few pieces, the insects may be killed through [[freezing]] of the object.  The textile should be wrapped in plastic and [[vacuum packing|vacuum-sealed]], then brought to a freezing temperature as quickly as possible, to prevent the insects from adjusting to the cold.  The object may be left frozen for several days, but should be brought slowly back up to room temperature to avoid further damage.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;  Note that while this method should kill adults, it may not destroy any eggs that are present.

If chemical means must be employed, it would be best to consult with a 	professional conservator to be certain that the treatment will not harm the textiles themselves.

Even if no signs of an infestation are present, textiles should still be inspected periodically to be certain that there is no outbreak that has gone unobserved.  Additionally, when dealing with a new acquisition which shows signs of insect damage, the specimen should be [[quarantine]]d until it can be determined whether the insects are still present before introducing it to the rest of the collection.

==Textile instability==
In some cases, the textiles are weakened not by outside causes such as light or pests, but by [[chemical reaction]]s taking place within the fabric itself, such as the [[redox|oxidation]] of iron-based [[mordant]]s over time, which can cause darkening and discolouration in the surrounding fibres.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 18&lt;/ref&gt;

One example which is cited frequently throughout the literature is the case of “shattered silk.”  During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many silk manufacturers treated their fabrics with [[metal]]lic salts (usually containing [[tin]] and [[iron]]) to give them a heavier, more luxurious feel.  However, as these fabrics have aged, the metals in the fibres have accelerated their decay and caused them to become extremely [[brittleness|brittle]].  The shredded or “shattered” effect this causes is the reason for the name.  In this case, the environment of the textile contributes very little to the deterioration from the metallic salts, though exposure to light may accelerate it even further.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 19"&gt;Putnam and Finch 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile preservationists should be familiar with their collections and the history and [[provenance]] of their pieces.  Chemical tests can reveal the types of dyes and mordants used, as well as any other treatments applied to the fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Schweppe 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Such knowledge can lead to the prevention of further decay by learning which pieces need to be handled with particular care.

==Handling==

It goes without saying that fragile and/or valuable textiles should be handled with care, and as little as necessary in any given circumstance.  However, should handling be necessary, there are precautions &lt;ref&gt;Taken from Fahey&lt;/ref&gt; which can be taken to ensure the safety of the textile.

Because our hands contain [[oil]]s and [[acid]]s in the [[skin]], clean cloth gloves should be worn when handling textiles.  If gloves are unavailable, then frequent hand-washing should be undertaken to ensure that no damage is caused.  For similar reasons, the working, display, and storage areas should be free of food, drink, and cigarette smoke, which can also stain or damage the fabric.  Finally, to avoid ink stains, only pencils should be used for writing or sketching in the work space.

To avoid snags and pulls, remove any jewelry that may catch in the fabric’s weave, and wear clothing free of large buckles or other objects which may snag the textile.  Long hair should also be tied back to allow a clear view of the working area, even when the head is bent over the table.

When working with the textiles, it should be placed on a clean, flat surface which is larger than the textile itself, so that the whole piece is supported evenly.  Although it is supported, never place anything on top of the textile while it is in the flat position.

When moving the textile, it is important to maintain the flat, even support of the work space.  If the piece is small enough (a [[handkerchief]] or [[sampler (needlework)|sampler]], for instance), it may be placed on an [[acid-free paper|acid-free board]] or similar support and carried as if on a tray.  If the piece is too large for this (a carpet or tapestry, for example), the piece may be rolled around an acid-free tube and carried by two people to its new location.
 
Finally, antique [[costume]]s and clothing should never be worn, as the mere process of putting the clothes on and taking them off will cause damage.   Additionally, the model may not fit the costume precisely&amp;nbsp;– clothing was for a long time made to fit a specific person, not mass-produced in approximate sizes&amp;nbsp;– causing strain where there should be none and slack where there likewise should be none.

==Cleaning==

===Vacuuming===

One of the safest and easiest ways to clean textiles is to [[vacuum cleaner|vacuum]] them.  The fabric is placed on a clean, flat work surface.  If the specimen is particularly delicate, or simply as a precaution, a [[fibreglass]] [[window screen|screen]] edged with [[twill tape]] may be placed over the textile.  The screen allows dirt and [[dust]] to pass through, but prevents individual threads from being pulled loose or unravelled further by the suction.  Using a vacuum attachment and the lowest power setting, move the suction over the screen until the entire area has been cleaned.  If needed, move the screen to a new area and begin again.  Always remember to vacuum both sides of the textile, as dirt may filter through to the other side.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 48"&gt;Putnam and Finch 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanging textiles will need to be vacuumed less often than horizontal pieces, as there are fewer places where dust can collect.

===Wet cleaning===

One of the key standards of preservation is that of reversibility:  anything done to preserve a piece should be able to be undone with minimal damage to the piece itself.  Because wet cleaning is a chemical process, it is not reversible, and so should be used only when absolutely necessary.

Before cleaning a textile, certain questions&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Rice, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; should be asked to determine both the best treatment for that particular combination of textile and soil, and to ascertain whether the piece is able to be cleaned, or may sustain damage during the process.

'''What is the chemical composition of the textile?'''  In other words, does it have a high acid content?  Were there chemicals used in its production that might contribute to how it reacts to water?  Or how it may react to cleaning chemicals?

'''What are the characteristics of the fibres?'''  For instance, cotton and linen, being [[fibre crop|plant fibers]], are both stronger wet than dry, and so may be able to withstand a more mechanical stress than something like silk.  Wool can absorb large amounts of water, but mats if washed in high temperatures.  All silks become brittle with age, but weighted silks (see Textile Instability above) decay more quickly, and thus must be handled with extreme care.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 19"/&gt;  Additionally, some silks, once wet, can be permanently spotted.  Learn the basic characteristics of the type of fibres you have, and how they have been treated before undertaking any kind of cleaning.

'''What [[colourant]]s have been used, and how will they react to cleaning?'''  This can apply not only to [[dye]]s but to mordants as well.  Different parts of the world may have different dye processes, so here is where knowledge of when and where a textile originated, as well as a working knowledge of [[chemistry]], can come in handy.  If in doubt as to the wash ability of a dye, apply a drop or two of water to an inconspicuous place and blot with a clean white cloth.  If the dye transfers to the cloth, even in small amounts, the textile should not be washed.&lt;ref name="Mailand 8"&gt;Mailand 8&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Are there finishes or surface treatments that must be preserved?'''  For example, is the fabric [[paint]]ed?  If so, it should never be washed; some other cleaning method should be used.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 47"&gt;Putnam and Finch 47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What kinds of soils are there?'''  The older the stain, the more difficult it is to remove.  After a certain point, it may be best to leave the stain or soil, or remove it only partially, in order to preserve the rest of the piece.  Additionally, soils which may not be detectable to the naked eye might be present in the textile; flags, for instance, may be highly acidic due to long exposure to [[air pollution|air pollutants]], and should be treated by a professional conservator.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 47"/&gt;

'''What cleaner is safest and most effective?'''  Commercial [[detergent]]s should never be used on [[antique]] textiles, whatever their claims of gentleness:  the chemicals used in most clothes detergents are too harsh for old fibres to withstand.  A wide range of speciality detergents are available from conservation suppliers, though most sources suggest [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory dish soap]] as a last-minute substitution if needed.  Never use chemical spot cleaners, as they are likewise too harsh for old fibres to tolerate.  This is especially important for pieces [[in situ]], as this may endanger other nearby pieces as well (the wooden part of an upholstered piece of furniture, for instance).&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What additives and cleaning aids are needed?'''  This can include physical supplies ([[water]], screens, a vacuum cleaner), as well as chemical ([[water softening|water softener]], cleaning agents, etc.).

'''How long can the specimen be exposed to the cleaner?'''  Prolonged exposure may cause additional damage to the fibres.

'''What mechanical action can be used?'''  The older and more fragile a textile, the less movement it will be able to tolerate during the cleaning process, so this should be considered before undertaking a cleaning.

Once the best cleaning process has been determined, the piece should be prepared for [[washing]].  Usually, this involves vacuuming to remove any surface dirt.  [[Lining (sewing)|Linings]] and backing should also be removed, vacuumed, and washed separately.  This is not only to prevent colour bleeding, but to avoid trapping dirt between the layers, which may cause discolouration from the inside.  Additionally, different fibres react to cleaning in different ways, and fabrics may shrink or stretch, which, if they are still attached together, may cause rippling and [[distortion]] in the lining and outer layer of the textile.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 48"/&gt;

As with moving or working with dry pieces, the textile should be washed in a flat, fully supported position.  Usually this is achieved through the use of screens like the ones used in vacuuming, though these may be supported in a frame of some kind for added stability.  The textile should be sandwiched between two screens.  If the piece is particularly delicate or fragile, it may be wrapped in [[net (textile)|netting]], then placed between the screens.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 48"/&gt;  	

The cleaning [[solution]] should be prepared using [[distilled water]].  If that is unavailable, softened water may be substituted.  The main concern is to avoid [[hard water]], which will leave deposits of [[mineral]]s in the fibres.&lt;ref name="Mailand 8"/&gt;  The solution should be placed in a container large enough for the textile to lie flat in.  For large pieces, it may be necessary to construct a temporary basin outside or in a large room:  Putnam and Finch suggest using boards or bricks to constrict a frame, then lining it with a large piece of [[plastic]], weighted on the sides, and strong enough to support the water that will be poured into it.  If a smaller basin is used, it should be of [[ceramic]], [[stainless steel]] or a stable plastic.

The screen-encased textile is lowered into the solution.  The textile can then be washed by pressing a soft [[sponge]] directly down onto the fibres.  DO NOT RUB the sponge, as this will cause unnecessary [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] at a moment when the textile is already weak from the water.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 50&lt;/ref&gt;  The textile may be submerged for no more than an hour, and should be rinsed at least four times after it is cleaned (Mailand).  The final rinse should always be with distilled water.  The textile should be placed to dry on a flat surface or screen, in a well-ventilated room away from heat.

===Dry cleaning===

[[Dry cleaning]] is generally only used for oil stains, as it is a very stressful process of the textile.  Commercial dry cleaners should never be used, as the chemicals used in the process are too strong for old fabrics to withstand without damage.  If dry cleaning is absolutely necessary, consult a professional conservator.&lt;ref name="Mailand 9"&gt;Mailand 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steaming and ironing===

[[Steam]]ing and [[ironing]] textiles should be done with caution, as the heat may affect the viability of the fibres.  More importantly, the fabric should always be cleaned before either of these processes is used, since heat may trap dirt and stains in the fibres to such an extent that the stain becomes permanent.  Always use the lowest setting for either of these procedures.&lt;ref name="Mailand 9"/&gt;  If a garment relies on folds to maintain its proper shape (such as [[pleat]]s), it may be better to finger-press the folds into place when the garment is damp and allow it to dry that way, rather than subject it to the added stress of ironing.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

===One alternative to ironing===

If a textile item is relatively thin and light, and is safe to wet, it can be laid out flat on a piece of glass which is larger than the item.  Before each use, the glass surface should be cleaned with 'safe' cleaners, as for the textile itself (see 'Wet Cleaning,' above), even if the glass has been kept in a clean place.  The last rinse of the glass should ideally be with a very clean cotton cloth and distilled water.

Lay the textile out as flat as possible on the dry glass.  Do not let the textile touch any metal or other casing that protects the edge of the glass.  Old storm-windowpanes and glass shower doors are often used for this task, and they usually have their original edging left on, if it's not too bulky, for reasons of safety in handling.  If the textile is known to be clean, it can be laid out dry and gently wetted to full saturation.  As sections are wetted, any crumples, folds, or details (such as fringes, the picots on the edges of lace, or fine pleats) can be gently teased into place with clean fingertips so that they lie as flat as possible on the glass.

Some old textiles can be flattened on glass just after washing, though it may be best to transfer to the glass fully supported, as on a netting screen or similar.  The supporting fabric can be removed by rolling it out from under the textile item as it is laid out on the glass, bit by bit.  Just be aware that this can stress the fibres:  do not use this method on any old textile that is likely to be damaged by the handling.  Let such fabrics dry first, then lay them on the glass and wet them in place.

Let dry completely in a darkened place with good air-flow.  The textile can be gently lifted from the glass when it's completely dry, and will usually look just as smooth as if a hot iron had been used on it.

==Restoration==
Restoration can be done with techniques like [[Clothing#Mending|mending]] and [[darning]].&lt;ref name=darn1&gt;[https://www.deccanherald.com/content/325696/rafoogari-art-darning.html Rafoogari: Art of darning], [[Deccan herald]], 13 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darn2&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/8LxZYCbNJemRy3h1DwQGYN/New-Delhi-Mapping-a-forgotten-tradition.html New Delhi: Mapping a forgotten tradition], [[LiveMint]], 28 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darn3&gt;[https://www.thestatesman.com/features/journey-of-a-shawl-1502624308.html Journey of a shawl ], The Statesman, 19 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darn4&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/The-fabric-of-hope/article14588954.ece The fabric of hope], [[The Hindu]], 25 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage==

As stated in the Climate section, the best storage environment for textiles is clean, dark, cool, and moderately dry, with a constant temperature and relative humidity.  Ideally, there should be no strain on any one particular area of cloth.  There are three basic kinds of storage for textiles, and the choice of which to use relies on the type of textile and the space available.  The three types are:  Flat, Rolled, and Hanging storage.

===Flat storage===

Flat storage is the best option for exceptionally fragile pieces because it provides the most even support for the fibres.  Enamelled metal shelves or drawers may be used, or acid-free boxes.  The textiles may be placed in the boxes or drawers flat, if at all possible.  If folding becomes necessary, acid-free [[tissue paper]] should be used to form soft rolls around which the folds can be shaped, to prevent creases from forming.  Even so, folded textiles should be removed and refolded differently every few months, to allow even wear on the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rolled storage===

For exceptionally large textiles, such as tapestries, draperies, carpets and quilts, rolled storage is the best option.  Like the upholstery section of a fabric store, the rolled storage area should consist of racks, each containing horizontally suspended acid-free or fabric-covered tubes around which the fabrics can be wrapped, being sure to line the [[selvage]]s up with the edges of the roll.  Textiles with a decorative side (such as [[velvet]]s and [[embroidery|embroidered]] textiles) should always be rolled with the decorative side facing out.  This is because the inner layer, especially if there is a lining, may crease, stretch, or fold while it is on the roll.  The rolled textiles can then be covered with a [[muslin]] wrapper to protect it from dust.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hanging costume storage===

For costumes, flat storage may create more problems than it solves, since it is impossible to store them in this manner without forming folds and creases.  Therefore, unless the costume is so weakened that it cannot support its own weight, hanging storage is perhaps the best option.  Costumes which are unusually heavy (heavily [[bead]]ed [[gown]]s, for instance), or those whose fabric may distort easily (such as some [[stretch fabric]]s, or those cut on the bias) should also be stored in flat storage.  Garments suitable for hanging should be placed on plastic hangers which have been padded to mimic the shape of human shoulders, and covered with a plastic or cloth cover with an open bottom to allow air circulation while keeping the costume clean.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;  Wooden hangers may have a high acid content, which may cause discolouration or decay to the costume.  Likewise, metal hangers do not provide sufficient support, and may lead to distortion of the garments’ shoulders.  Therefore, both forms of hanging should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 44&lt;/ref&gt;

If sufficient space is available, selected garments may be stored on [[mannequin|dummies]] to better keep their shape.  If this method is used, dummies should be fitted out with the proper [[undergarment]]s, such as [[bustle]]s or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]], to provide adequate support for the garments as they were intended to be worn.  However, while the main concern of a display may be to make the garment look attractive on the dummy, storage need have no such considerations.  Loose, unsupported parts of the garment (such as sleeves or shirts) should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue paper to provide additional support.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Costume [[fashion accessory|accessories]] can be stored in a variety of ways.  Generally, bonnets and gloves should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue and placed in archival-quality boxes or under cover.  Fans and parasols may be stored in half-open positions, which provide the least amount of stress on the fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==

The conditions required for display of textiles are largely those that have already been discussed in the Storage and Environment sections.  Dry, cool, and dark, are to be preferred, with clean surroundings and frequent checks to be certain that the textiles are remaining in good condition.  Lighting should be kept to a minimum, and textiles should be rotated through display, so that each is only exposed to light for a few months at a time before being returned to darkness or taken for cleaning/conservation work.  Textiles should be vacuumed before and after display.

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in textiles arts are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

'''Ecomusicology''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] οἶκος, meaning "house"; μουσική, "music"; and -λογία, "study of-") is an academic discipline concerned with the study of music, culture, and [[nature]], and considers musical and sonic issues, both textual and performative, related to ecology and the natural environment. It is in essence a mixture of [[ecocriticism]] and [[musicology]] (rather than "ecology" and "musicology"), in [[Charles Seeger]]'s holistic definition.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{Citation | last = Allen | first = Aaron S. | contribution = Ecomusicology | year = forthcoming 2013 | title = Grove Dictionary of American Music | publisher = New York: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecomusicology.info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecomusicology.info – Main Page|url=http://www.ecomusicology.info|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

With the increasing intertwined interest in the environment and the sciences in North America from the 1970s, there has been an increase in interest in the term ecomusicology, which was established as a term in the early 21st century in North American and Scandinavian circles.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; As a field, ecomusicology was created out of a common area of interest between the fields of ecocriticism and musicology, expressed by a range of scholars and artists such as composers, [[acoustic ecology|acoustic ecologists]], [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]], [[biomusicology|biomusicologists]], and others.&lt;ref name="jams"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = Aaron S. | title = Ecomusicology: Ecocriticism and Musicology | journal = [[Journal of the American Musicological Society]] | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 392–393 | date = Summer 2011 | url = http://www.ecomusicology.info/wp-content/uploads/Supplementary/JAMS_Ecomusicology_Colloquy.pdf | accessdate = 2013-04-01 | doi=10.1525/jams.2011.64.2.391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecomusicology embraces what is today considered the field of historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and related [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] fields, which while at the same time may enable specialists within each of these fields to interact with academics in the other fields in their approach, it also provides individuals with flexibility to approach an ecocritical study of music through a variety of disciplines and fields.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12407">'''Experimental physics''' is the category of disciplines and sub-disciplines in the field of [[physics]] that are concerned with the [[observation]] of physical [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] and [[experiment]]s. Methods vary from discipline to discipline, from simple experiments and observations, such as the [[Cavendish experiment]], to more complicated ones, such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]].

==Overview==

Experimental physics regroups all the disciplines of physics that are concerned with data acquisition, data–acquisition methods, and the detailed conceptualization (beyond simple [[thought experiment]]s) and realization of laboratory experiments. It is often put in contrast with [[theoretical physics]], which is more concerned with predicting and explaining the physical behaviour of nature than the acquisition of knowledge about it.

Although experimental and theoretical physics are concerned with different aspects of nature, they both share the same goal of understanding it and have a symbiotic relation. The former provides data about the universe, which can then be analyzed in order to be understood, while the latter provides explanations for the data and thus offers insight on how to better acquire data and on how to set up experiments. Theoretical physics can also offer insight on what data is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the universe, and on what experiments to devise in order to obtain it.

==History==
As a distinct field, experimental physics was established in [[early modern Europe]], during what is known as the [[Scientific Revolution]], by physicists such as [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Blaise Pascal]] and Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. In the early 17th century, Galileo made extensive use of experimentation to validate physical theories, which is the key idea in the modern scientific method. Galileo formulated and successfully tested several results in dynamics, in particular the law of [[inertia]], which later became the first law in [[Newton's laws of motion]]. In Galileo's ''[[Two New Sciences]]'', a dialogue between the characters Simplicio and Salviati discuss the motion of a ship (as a moving frame) and how that ship's cargo is indifferent to its motion. Huygens used the motion of a boat along a Dutch canal to illustrate an early form of the conservation of [[momentum]].

Experimental physics is considered to have reached a high point with the publication of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687 by Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727). In 1687, Newton published the ''Principia'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: [[Newton's laws of motion]], from which arise [[classical mechanics]]; and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], which describes the [[fundamental force]] of [[gravity]]. Both theories agreed well with experiment. The ''Principia'' also included several theories in [[fluid dynamics]].

From the late 17th century onward, [[thermodynamics]] was developed by physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle|Boyle]], [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]], and many others. In 1733, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] used statistical arguments with classical mechanics to derive thermodynamic results, initiating the field of [[statistical mechanics]]. In 1798, [[Benjamin Thompson|Thompson]] demonstrated the conversion of mechanical work into heat, and in 1847 [[James Joule|Joule]] stated the law of conservation of [[energy]], in the form of heat as well as mechanical energy. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], in the nineteenth century, is responsible for the modern form of [[statistical mechanics]].

Besides classical mechanics and thermodynamics, another great field of experimental inquiry within physics was the nature of [[electricity]]. Observations in the 17th and eighteenth century by scientists such as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]] created a foundation for later work. These observations also established our basic understanding of electrical charge and [[electric current|current]]. By 1808 [[John Dalton]] had discovered that atoms of different elements have different weights and proposed the modern [[Atomic theory|theory of the atom]].

It was [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] who first proposed the connection between electricity and magnetism after observing the deflection of a compass needle by a nearby electric current. By the early 1830s [[Michael Faraday]] had demonstrated that magnetic fields and electricity could generate each other. In 1864 [[James Clerk Maxwell]] presented to the [[Royal Society]] a set of equations that described this relationship between electricity and magnetism. [[Maxwell's equations]] also predicted correctly that [[light]] is an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]]. Starting with astronomy, the principles of [[natural philosophy]] crystallized into fundamental [[law of physics|laws of physics]] which were enunciated and improved in the succeeding centuries. By the 19th century, the sciences had segmented into multiple fields with specialized researchers and the field of physics, although logically pre-eminent, no longer could claim sole ownership of the entire field of scientific research.

==Current experiments==

[[File:Construction of LHC at CERN.jpg|right|thumb|A view of the [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] detector, an experimental endeavour of the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] at [[CERN]].]]

Some examples of prominent experimental physics projects are:

* [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] which collides heavy ions such as [[gold]] ions (it is the first heavy ion collider) and [[proton]]s, it is located at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], on Long Island, USA.
* [[Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage|HERA]], which collides [[electron]]s or [[positron]]s and protons, and is part of [[DESY]], located in [[Hamburg]], Germany.
* [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], or the Large [[Hadron]] [[Collider]], which completed construction in 2008 but suffered a series of setbacks. The LHC began operations in 2008, but was shut down for maintenance until the summer of 2009. It is the world's most energetic collider upon completion, it is located at [[CERN]], on the French-Swiss border near [[Geneva]]. The collider became fully operational March 29, 2010 a year and a half later than originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|date=2010-03-29|title=Yes, we did it!|url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2010/14/News%20Articles/1246424?ln=en|publisher=[[CERN]]|accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[LIGO]], the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is a large-scale physics experiment and observatory to detect cosmic gravitational waves and to develop gravitational-wave observations as an astronomical tool. Currently two LIGO observatories exist: LIGO Livingston Observatory in [[Livingston, Louisiana]], and LIGO Hanford Observatory near [[Richland, Washington|Richland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].
* [[James Webb Space Telescope|JWST]], or the [[James E. Webb|James Webb]] Space Telescope, is planned for launch in 2021. It will be the successor to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. It will survey the sky in the infrared region. The main goals of the JWST will be in order to understand the initial stages of the universe, galaxy formation as well as the formations of stars and planets, and the origins of life.

==Method==
{{main|Experiment}}
Experimental physics uses two main methods of experimental research, [[Scientific control|controlled experiments]], and [[natural experiment]]s. Controlled experiments are often used in [[laboratories]] as laboratories can offer a controlled environment. Natural experiments are used, for example, in [[astrophysics]] when observing [[celestial objects]] where control of the variables in effect is impossible.

[[File:LePetomane.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Le Pétomane]] was a professional flatulist around the start of the 20th century in France.]]
A '''flatulist''', '''fartist''', or '''professional farter''' is an [[entertainer]] (sometimes considered a [[comedian]]) whose routine consists solely or primarily of [[Flatulence|passing gas]] in a creative, musical, or amusing manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ljhelms.com/pet/_pujol/thestory/retro.htm Le Pétomane:The Strange Life of a "Fartiste"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are a number of scattered references to [[Classical Antiquity|ancient]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] flatulists, who could produce various rhythms and pitches with their [[flatulence|intestinal wind]]. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] in ''City of God (De Civitate Dei)'' (14.24) mentions some performers who did have "such command of their bowels, that they can break wind continuously at will, so as to produce the effect of singing." [[Juan Luis Vives]], in his 1522 commentary to Augustine's work, testifies to having himself witnessed such a feat,{{cn|date=March 2015}} a remark referenced by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in an essay.{{Which|date=December 2017}}

The professional farters of medieval [[Ireland]] were called braigetoír. They are listed together with other performers and musicians in the 12th century ''Tech Midchúarda'', a diagram of the banqueting hall of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]. As entertainers, these braigetoir ranked at the lower end of a scale headed by [[bard]]s, [[fili]], and [[harp]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The bagpipe: the history of a musical instrument | first=Francis M. | last=Collinson | publisher=Routledge | year=1975 | isbn=0-7100-7913-3 | page=73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Drama and the performing arts in pre-Cromwellian Ireland: a repertory of sources and documents from the earliest times until c. 1642 | first=Alan John | last=Fletcher | publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer | year=2001 | isbn=0-85991-573-5 | page=468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One late medieval flatulist is mentioned in an entry in the 13th-century English ''Liber Feodorum'' or ''[[Book of Fees]]''. It lists one [[Roland the Farter]], who held [[Hemingstone]] manor in the county of [[Suffolk]], for which he was obliged to perform ''"Unum saltum et siffletum et unum bumbulum"'' (one jump, one whistle, and one fart) annually at the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] every Christmas. The ''Activa Vita'' character in the 14th century allegorical poem [[Piers Plowman]] appears to number farting among the abilities desirable in a good entertainer in general, alongside storytelling, fiddling, or playing the harp.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meredith, [http://brepols.metapress.com/content/v76511103m5t4746/ "The professional travelling players of the fifteenth century: myth or reality?"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714165129/http://brepols.metapress.com/content/v76511103m5t4746/ |date=2012-07-14 }} ''European Medieval Drama'' '''2''' (1998) 21-34. DOI 10.1484/J.EMD.2.300900&lt;/ref&gt; This poem translates to "As for me, I can neither drum nor trumpet, nor tell jokes, nor fart amusingly at parties, nor play the harp."

In Japan, during the [[Edo period]], flatulists were known as "heppiri otoko" (放屁男), lit. "farting men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 | title = 放屁男
 | encyclopedia = Nihon Kokugo Daijiten (日本国語大辞典)
 | publisher = Shogakukan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
*[[Terrance and Phillip]], from the animated series ''[[South Park]]'', are fictional comedic flatulists.
*[[Peräsmies]], featured in the [[Pahkasika]] magazine, is a [[superhero]] whose only superpower is the ability to fart supernaturally hard, similar to [[Fartman (Howard Stern)]].
*The characters Le Corbusier et Papin on ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''.
*An episode of the sketch comedy series ''[[Mr. Show]]'' features two fictional flatulists named Fartin' Gary and Fartin' Rudy. In the sketch, Rudy steals a comedy show from professional Fartin' Gary, a professional comedic flatulist. Rudy then earns the title of "Crown Prince of Fartistry" and his talents win him a starring role in his own television [[sitcom]] entitled ''Second Wind''.
*The male lead Paulino in the Spanish play ''[[¡Ay Carmela! (play)|¡Ay Carmela!]]'' by [[José Sanchis Sinisterra]] (1987), and in the [[¡Ay Carmela!|movie of the same name]] based on it (1990), performs as a flatulist in the work.
*In the 1999 film ''[[Mystery Men]]'', [[Paul Reubens]] plays The Spleen. Cursed, The Spleen can aim his super-powered flatulence to take out his targets, but he smells terrible at all times. 
* On the 1977 comedy album ''[[Derek and Clive Come Again]]'', [[Dudley Moore]] posed as a professional farter from Scotland called Ross McPharter on a mock Scottish radio show hosted by a character played by [[Peter Cook]].
* Radio shock jock [[Howard Stern]] appeared at the [[1992 MTV Video Music Awards]] as [[Fartman (Howard Stern)|Fartman]], a fictional superhero who fights crime and can fly thanks to his super-powered flatulence. The Fartman character first appeared in the ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' humor magazine series in the mid-1970s.
*In the manga/anime series ''[[One Piece]]'', there is a new character named "Kin'emon" who was introduced with his body cut into three segments, one of which being his lower-half which was the first to be encountered by the main protagonists. During that time he was able to communicate via flatulence.
*[[Johnny Fartpants]] from ''[[Viz (comic)|Viz]]'' occasionally performs as a flatulist; however, he generally employs his rectal capacity as a [[superhero]].

==Notable flatulists==
*[[Mr. Methane]], contemporary flatulist
*[[Le Pétomane]], performed in France from 1887 until 1914
*[[Roland the Farter]], flatulist in the court of King Henry II of England.

[[File:TrafficJamFrustration.jpg|thumb|right|A frustrated man sitting in a traffic jam]]
In psychology, '''frustration''' is a common [[emotional]] response to opposition, related to [[anger]], [[annoyance]] and [[disappointment]], frustration arises from the perceived resistance to the fulfillment of an individual's [[Will (philosophy)|will]] or goal&lt;ref name="The Consolations of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Botton|first1=Alain|title=The Consolations of Philosophy|date=April 2011|publisher=Vintage Books, a division of Random House Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-679-77917-5|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is likely to increase when a will or goal is denied or blocked. There are two types of frustration; internal and external. Internal frustration may arise from challenges in fulfilling [[Personality psychology|personal]] [[objective (goal)|goals]], [[Desire (philosophy)|desires]], instinctual drives and needs, or dealing with perceived [[:wikt:deficiency|deficiencies]], such as a lack of [[confidence]] or [[fear]] of social situations. [[Emotional conflict|Conflict]], such as when one has competing goals that interfere with one another, can also be an internal source of frustration and can create [[cognitive dissonance]]. External causes of frustration involve conditions outside an individual's control, such as a physical roadblock, a difficult task, or the perception of wasting time.&lt;ref name="Frustration"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frustration|url=http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/pyschologist_frustration.htm|website=Psychologist Anywhere Anytime|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple ways individuals [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with frustration such as [[passive–aggressive behavior]], [[anger]], or violence, although frustration may also propel positive processes via enhanced effort and strive.&lt;ref name="FrustrationIndivDiff"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeronimus | displayauthors=etal|title= Encyclopedia of Personality and Individual Differences |chapter=Frustration|date=Jan 2018|publisher=Springer |location=New York|editors= Zeigler-Hill, V., Shackelford, T.K. |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-28099-8_815-1|page=1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This broad range of potential outcomes makes it difficult to identify the original cause(s) of frustration, as the responses may be indirect. However, a more direct and common response is a propensity towards aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The [[Frustration aggression theory|frustration–aggression hypothesis]] | last = Miller | first = NE | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 48 | issue = 4 |date=July 1941 | pages = 337–42 | doi=10.1037/h0055861}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Frustration originates from feelings of uncertainty and insecurity which stems from a sense of inability to fulfill needs. If the needs of an individual are blocked, uneasiness and frustration are more likely to occur. When these needs are constantly ignored or unsatisfied, anger, depression, loss of self-confidence, annoyance, aggression, and sometimes violence are likely to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Overcome Frustration|url=http://www.eruptingmind.com/how-to-overcome-frustration/|website=Erupting Mind|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needs can be blocked two different ways; internally and externally. Internal blocking happens within an individual's mind, either through lack of ability, confidence, conflicting goals and desires, and/or fears. External blocking happens to an individual outside their control such as physical roadblocks, difficult tasks, or perceived waste of time.

Some people are predisposed towards feelings of frustration, indexed in terms of [[temperament]] (frustration), in adolescence and [[neuroticism]] in adulthood.&lt;ref name="FrustrationIndivDiff"/&gt; Temperamental frustration is associated with perceptual alterations including changes in perceived relationship affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Laceulle, O.M. | displayauthors=etal| year = 2015 | title = Why Not Everyone Gets Their Fair Share of Stress: Adolescent's Perceived Relationship Affection Mediates Associations Between Temperament and Subsequent Stressful Social Events | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.1989/full| journal = European Journal of Personality| volume = 29 | issue = 2| page = 125 | doi=10.1002/per.1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==

Frustration can be considered a problem–response behavior and can have a number of effects, depending on the mental health of the individual. In positive cases, this frustration will build until a level that is too great for the individual to contain or allow to continue, and thus produce action directed at solving the inherent problem in a disposition that does not cause social or physical harm. In negative cases, however, the individual may perceive the source of frustration to be outside their control, and thus the frustration will continue to build, leading eventually to further problematic behavior (e.g. violent reaction against perceived oppressors or enemies).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkowitz|first=Leonard|title=Frustration-aggression hypothesis: Examination and reformulation.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.106.1.59|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=106|issue=1|pages=59–73|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.1.59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stubborn refusal to respond to new conditions affecting the goal, such as removal or modification of the barrier, sometimes occurs. As pointed out by [[J.A.C. Brown]], severe punishment may cause individuals to continue non-adaptive behavior blindly: "Either it may have an effect opposite to that of reward and as such, discourage the repetition of the act, or, by functioning as a frustrating agent, it may lead to fixation and the other symptoms of frustration as well. It follows that [[punishment]] is a dangerous tool, since it often has effects which are entirely the opposite of those desired".&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{Citation | first = JAC | last = Brown | title = The Social Psychology of Industry | place = Baltimore, MD | publisher = Penguin | year = 1954 | pages = 253–54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frustration tolerance==
Frustration tolerance is one's ability to resist becoming frustrated when facing difficult tasks. Having a [[low frustration tolerance]] is related to trait anger and a higher level of frustration tolerance is related to lower levels of anger and longer persistence on difficult tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szasz|first1=P.L.|last2=Szentagotai|first2=A.|last3=Hofmann|first3=S.|title=The Effect of Emotion Regulation Strategies on Anger|journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy|date=30 November 2010|volume=49|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671000238X|accessdate=27 November 2016|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2010.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a child with a high frustration tolerance may be able to deal with repeated challenges and failures without experiencing significant frustration. The child with a low frustration tolerance can be quick to experience frustration when asked to perform tasks of moderate difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liden|first1=C.|title=9 Traits You Should Know About Your Temperament|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000579671000238X|website=The Being Well Center|accessdate=26 November 2016|doi=10.1016/j.brat.2010.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8401">'''George Vicesimus Wigram''' (28 March 1805 – 1 February 1879) was an English biblical scholar and theologian.

==Early life==
He was the 20th child (hence his middle name) of [[Sir Robert Wigram, 1st Baronet]], a famous and wealthy merchant, and the 14th child of Lady Eleanor Wigram, Robert's 2nd wife (an aunt to [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]). His family were all capable and several of his siblings became illustrious in their own field. [[James Wigram (judge)|Sir James Wigram]] became a judge and Vice-Chancellor; [[Joseph Cotton Wigram]] became [[Bishop of Rochester]], [[Loftus Wigram]] was a barrister and politician, and [[Octavius Wigram]] was prominent as an insurance underwriter in the [[City of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Courthope (officer of arms)|William Courthope]], ''Debrett's complete peerage of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'' (1838), p. 605&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man George Wigram obtained a commission in the army. One of his postings was to [[Brussels]]. He spent an evening exploring the [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] battlefield and it was here he had a religious experience that changed his life. He wrote of it thus, "suddenly there came on my soul a something I had never known before. It was as if some One, Infinite and Almighty, knowing everything, full of the deepest, tenderest interest in myself, though utterly and entirely abhorring everything in, and connected with me, made known to me that He pitied and loved myself".&lt;ref&gt;D[ennett], E[dward], ed., ''Memorials of the Ministry of G. V. Wigram'', vol. 1 (Broom, London, 1880), p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; This led to his resigning his commission in the army and in 1826 he entered [[Queens College, Oxford]], with the intention of becoming an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman.

==Christian career==

At Oxford he met [[John Nelson Darby]] and [[Benjamin Wills Newton]]. Dissatisfied with the established church, Wigram and his friends left the Anglican church and helped establish non-denominational assemblies which became known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]].
He had considered joining [[Anthony Norris Groves]] and his mission to [[Baghdad]] in June 1829, but changed his mind just prior to the faith mission set off. 
After leaving Oxford University, Wigram, using his family wealth, in 1831 bought church premises in Plymouth and there established a Brethren assembly. During the 1830s Wigram also financed the establishment of assemblies in London.

Wigram had a keen interest in the original Hebrew and Greek texts of the Bible, which was of great interest to the emerging Brethren assemblies. In 1839, after years of work and financial investment, he published ''The Englishman's Greek and English Concordance to the New Testament'', followed in 1843 by ''The Englishman's Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance to the Old Testament''. He also edited the influential Brethren periodical ''Present Testimony and Original Christian Witness'' for many years (from 1849 to his death with posthumous issues running to 1881). This periodical superseded the Brethren's first magazine, ''The Christian Witness''.
Besides his literary work his oral ministry was considered to be marked by an attractive freshness: a contemporary remarked that his "very face became radiant as he spoke".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall, E.E. (1932/33). [http://www.stempublishing.com/hymns/biographies/wigram.html ''Songs of Pilgrimage and Glory: Notes on the Hymns of Certain Hymn-Writers'']. Central Bible Truth Depot, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his addresses have been preserved and published in the two volumes ''Memorials of the Ministry of G.V. Wigram'' and ''Gleanings from the Teaching of G.V. Wigram''. These were collected by the erstwhile Lewisham Road [[Baptist]] Church Minister, [[Edward Dennett]].

With Wigram's help, Darby became the most influential personality within the Brethren movement. Wigram is often referred to as being Darby's lieutenant&lt;ref&gt;Neatby, William Blair (1901). ''A History of the Plymouth Brethren'', p. 60. Hodder and Stoughton, London.&lt;/ref&gt; as he firmly supported Darby during moments of crisis. In 1845 he supported Darby in his doctrinal differences with Benjamin Wills Newton in the Brethren assembly at Plymouth. In Darby's 1848 dispute with [[George Müller]], Wigram again sided with Darby in relation to the reception of believers who had previously been in fellowship with Newton, and on Müller's reluctance to publicly denounce errors by Newton in regards to the sufferings of Christ (errors which Newton had already retracted). He also helped Darby fend off accusations of heresy, also in regards to the sufferings of Christ, in articles written in 1858 and 1866, which some considered were very similar to Newton's errors two decades earlier.

==Married life==
Wigram married Fanny Bligh in 1830, the daughter of Thomas Cherburgh Bligh whom Wigram had known as a girl in Ireland; she died in 1834. His second marriage was to Catherine, the only daughter of [[Charles_Stewart_Parnell#Family_background_and_early_life|William Parnell of Avondale]]. Their London home was 3 Howley Place, Harrow Road, London. In 1867, Wigram visited Canada. His wife Catherine joined him there two months later, but became ill and died after a short illness in Canada. The family physician was Limerick-born Dr [[Thomas Mackern]]. Wigram was 62 years old. Four years later his daughter Fanny Theodosia, child of his first wife, died.

==Travels==
Wigram travelled in the UK preaching and teaching in large Brethren assemblies. He visited [[Switzerland]] in 1853 and again in [[Vaud]] Canton in 1858. In later life he went abroad to minister to the many overseas assemblies of the Brethren, including [[Boston]] and Canada in 1867. Writing in November 1871, from [[Demerara]], [[British Guiana]], he said, "I came out in my old age, none save Himself with me". He visited Jamaica in 1872. This led to further travel, visiting Australia and [[New Zealand]] in 1873-75 and again in 1877-78.

Besides travel he maintained a wide correspondence with labourers in emerging Brethren assemblies. Among these were Louis Favez of [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;D[ennett], E[dward] (Ed., 1881). ''Memorials of the Ministry of G.V. Wigram'', vol. 3, p. 4 (26 April 1856). Broom, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hymnology==
Wigram contributed to the [[hymnology]] of the Brethren assemblies in a number of ways. He edited the anthology ''Hymns for the Poor of the Flock'' (1838). This collection contained hymns by [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]], [[Thomas Kelly (hymnwriter)|Thomas Kelly]] and others; and an appendix was added, chiefly to include a number of hymns by [[Sir Edward Denny, 4th Baronet|Sir Edward Denny]] that had just been written. The four earliest of [[John Nelson Darby]]'s were also inserted. 18 years later (1856) Wigram compiled ''[[Little Flock hymnbook|A Few Hymns and some Spiritual Songs for the Little Flock]]'' to replace the previous collection. This hymnbook was revised by Darby in 1881, [[William Kelly (Bible scholar)|William Kelly]] in 1894 and again by [[T.H. Reynolds]] in 1903.

Wigram also wrote a number of hymns and these include the following
* Well may we sing, with triumph sing
* Oh, what a debt we owe
* The Person of the Christ
* What raised the wondrous thought

==Death==
Wigram died in 1879 at the age of 74 and was buried with his daughter in [[Paddington Cemetery]] by the side of Sir Edward Denny. It has been said that the large concourse of people there sang a hymn in deference to his wish expressed in his lifetime, so that all might understand that he owed all to the sovereign mercy of God. The hymn sung was: "Nothing but mercy'll do for me, / Nothing but mercy – full and free, / Of sinners chief – what but the blood / Could calm my soul, before my God".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall, E.E. (1932/33). [http://www.stempublishing.com/hymns/biographies/wigram.html ''Songs of Pilgrimage and Glory: Notes on the Hymns of Certain Hymn-Writers'']. Central Bible Truth Depot, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Dragon''' was a  mystical Tibetan or Japanese occult Order, mentioned since the beginning of 20th century. Probably mainly the organization was popularized through the book ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]''.&lt;ref name="Lachman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|authorlink=Gary Lachman|title=Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius  |publisher=[[The Disinformation Company]]|year=2003|isbn=0-9713942-3-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jfptmqzTzkC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=utro&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/reih/21.htm Жак Бержье, Луи Повель]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that the Order collaborated with [[Theosophical Society]] and [[Thule Society]]. Influenced the well-known secular figures in Europe, traveled to the East - to Tibet and Japan. It is claimed that the alleged in the capture of Berlin in [[World War II]], the Nazis were discovered Tibetan (or Kalmyk) appearance.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;[http://maybelogic.blogspot.ru/2011/01/seven-heads-of-green-dragon.html "The seven heads of the Green Dragon" (about "Les Sept têtes du Dragon Vert" book by Teddy Legrand)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/books/details/René_Alleau_Hitler_et_les_sociétés_secrètes_Enquêt?id=ObJSCwAAQBAJ Hitler et les sociétés secrètes : Enquête sur les sources occultes du nazisme]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Green building]]''' results in structures that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout their lifecycle – from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igreenbuild.com/cd_1967.aspx |title=GreenBuild.com |publisher=Igreenbuild.com |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2009 report by the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] evaluated 12 sustainably designed GSA buildings, and found they cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were more satisfied with the overall building than those in typical commercial buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalmarketspartnership.com/UserFiles/Admin%20GSA%20June%202008%20-%20Assessing%20Green%20Building%20Performance.pdf |title=GSA Public Buildings Service Assessing Green Building Performance A Post-Occupancy Evaluation of 12 GSA Buildings |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wood products]]''' from responsible sources are a good choice for most green building projects – both new construction and renovations. Wood grows naturally using energy from the sun, is renewable, sustainable and recyclable. It is an effective insulator and uses far less energy to produce than concrete or steel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodworks.org/woodBenefits/sustainableDesign/default.aspx WoodWorks Sustainable Design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818041504/http://www.woodworks.org/woodBenefits/sustainableDesign/default.aspx |date=August 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood can also mitigate climate change because wood products continue to store carbon absorbed by the tree during its growing cycle, and because substituting wood for fossil fuel-intensive materials such as steel and concrete result in ‘avoided’ greenhouse gas emissions. 

Wood’s natural beauty and warmth have been shown to generate improved productivity and performance in schools, offices and better patient outcomes in hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=221&amp;C=694 |title=McGraw Hill Construction How Wood Products Stack Up in Green Building Systems |publisher=Continuingeducation.construction.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle assessment==

A [[life cycle assessment]] can help avoid a narrow outlook on environmental, social and economic concerns by assessing each and every impact associated with all the stages of a process from cradle-to-grave (i.e., from raw materials through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use, repair and maintenance, and disposal or recycling).

A comprehensive review of scientific literature from Europe, North America and Australia pertaining to life cycle assessment of wood products &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discover-decouvrir.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/dcvr/ctrl?action=shwart&amp;aix=3&amp;aid=7314557 |title=Abstract Wooden building products in comparative LCA 2007 |publisher=Discover-decouvrir.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded, among other things, that:
* Fossil fuel consumption, the potential contributions to the greenhouse effect and the quantities of solid waste tend to be minor for wood products compared to competing products.
* Wood products that have been installed and are used in an appropriate way tend to have a favourable environmental profile compared to functionally equivalent products out of other materials.

A study by the [[Canadian Wood Council]] compared the life cycle impacts of three {{convert|2400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} homes designed primarily in wood, steel and concrete over the first 20 years of their lifespans. Relative to the wood design, the steel and concrete designs released more air pollution, produced more solid wastes, used more resources, required more energy, emitted more greenhouse gases and discharged more water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwc.ca/DesignWithWood/Sustainability/?Language=EN Canadian Wood Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312112233/http://www.cwc.ca/DesignWithWood/Sustainability/?Language=EN |date=March 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the complete life cycle is considered, including use and disposal, the great majority of the studies indicate that wood products have lower greenhouse gas emissions. In the few cases where wood products cause greater greenhouse gas emissions than their non-wood counterparts, the cause was inappropriate post-use disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 6 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tools are available that enable architects to judge the relative environmental merits of building materials. They include the [[ATHENA Impact Estimator for Buildings]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athenasmi.org/tools/impactEstimator/index.html |title=ATHENA Institute Impact Estimator for Buildings |publisher=Athenasmi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is capable of modeling 95% of the building stock in North America, and the ATHENA® EcoCalculator for Assemblies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athenasmi.org/tools/ecoCalculator/index.html ATHENA Institute EcoCalculator for Assemblies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014164446/http://www.athenasmi.org/tools/ecoCalculator/index.html |date=October 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  provides instant life cycle assessment results for common assemblies based on detailed assessments previously conducted using the Estimator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athenasmi.org/about/index.html |title=ATHENA Institute |publisher=Athenasmi.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EcoCalculator is available free from the non-profit [http://www.athenasmi.org Athena Sustainable Materials Institute] in order to encourage greater use of LCA by design and building professionals.

==Wood and climate change==

As trees grow, they absorb carbon dioxide and store it in biomass (wood, leaves, roots). When trees decompose or burn, much of the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, mainly as carbon dioxide, and some of the carbon remains in the forest debris and soils.&lt;ref name="naturallywood1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Header/tackle-climate-change.pdf |title=Tackle Climate Change, Use Wood |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a tree is cut and the wood is used for products such as structural lumber or furniture, the carbon is stored for decades or longer. A typical {{convert|2400|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home in North America contains 29 metric tonnes of carbon, or the equivalent of offsetting the greenhouse gas emissions produced by driving a passenger car over five years (about 12,500 litres of gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpinnovations.ca/ |title=FPInnovations Wood and Climate Change |publisher=Fpinnovations.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
 
When wood replaces a fossil fuel for energy or a construction material with a greater greenhouse gas footprint, this lowers greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="naturallywood1"/&gt;

Studies show that wood products are associated with far less greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime than other major building materials. Substituting a cubic metre of blocks or brick with wood results in a significant saving of 0.75 to one tone of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/rome2007/docs/Using_wood_products_to_mitigate_climate_change.pdf |title=Using Wood Products to Mitigate Climate Change Page 7 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Increasing the use of wood products in construction and for other long-lived uses, plus the use of wood byproducts and wood waste as biomass replacement for fossil fuels, can contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gas stabilization. The sustainable management of forests for the production of wood products is a feasible and beneficial part of an overall strategy to mitigate climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 8 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Securing the Future]], a United Kingdom government strategy for sustainable development, stated: “Forestry practices can make a significant contribution by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through increasing the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere by the national forest estate, by burning wood for fuel, and by using wood as a substitute for energy-intensive materials such as concrete and steel.”

==The role of wood in carbon balances==

[[FPInnovations]], a Canadian non-profit research organization, conducted a literature review of 66 scientific peer-reviewed articles regarding the net impact on atmospheric greenhouse gases due to wood product use within a life cycle perspective. It showed several ways wood product substitution affects greenhouse gas balances, including:

* Less fossil fuel consumption in manufacturing;
* Avoidance of industrial process carbon emissions from cement manufacturing when wood products replace cement-based products;
* Carbon storage in wood products and in the forest; and
* Avoided fossil fuel emissions when wood biofuels replace fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 3 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==

As high-performance buildings use less operating energy, the embodied energy required to extract, process, transport and install building materials may make up as much as 30% of the overall life cycle energy consumption. Studies such as the U.S. LCI Database Project show buildings built primarily with wood will have a lower embodied energy than those built primarily with brick, concrete or steel.

A recent case study of the Eugene Kruger Building in Quebec, Canada determined that the all-wood solution adopted for this 8,000-square-metre academic building resulted in a 40% reduction in embodied energy compared to steel and concrete alternatives.

A 2002 study compared production energy values for building components (e.g. walls, floors, roofs) made predominantly of wood, steel and concrete, and found that wood construction has a range of energy use from 185 to 280 Gigajoules (GJ), concrete from 265 to 521 GJ, and steel from 457 to 649 GJ. Wood construction will generally use less energy than other materials, although the high end of the range of wood construction energy overlaps with the low end of the range of concrete construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |title=FPInnovations 2010 A Synthesis of Research on Wood Products and Greenhouse Gas Impacts Page 42 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321215904/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/Public_Information/technical_rpt/TR19%20Complete%20Pub-web.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Passive design]] uses natural processes – convection, absorption, radiation, and conduction – to minimize energy consumption and improve thermal comfort. Researchers in Europe have identified wood as a suitable material in the development of passive buildings due to its unique combination of properties, including thermal resistance, natural finish, structural integrity, light weight and weatherproof qualities. Passive design is beginning to be incorporated in small buildings in North America through the use of structural wood panels.
 
Due to its cellular structure and lots of tiny air pockets, wood is a better natural insulator in most climates – 400 times better than steel and 10 times better than concrete. More insulation is needed for steel and concrete to achieve the same thermal performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Green_Building/Module-3_Energy_Conservation.pdf |title=Naturally:wood Green Building Toolkit Module 3 Energy Conservation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2002 study prepared by the [[National Association of Home Builders]] Research Center Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.p2pays.org/ref/15/14083.pdf |title=NAHB Research Center Inc. Steel vs. Wood: Long-Term Thermal Performance Comparison 2002 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared long-term energy use in two nearly identical side-by-side homes, one framed with conventional dimensional lumber and the second framed with cold-formed steel. It found the steel-framed house used 3.9% more natural gas in the winter and 10.7% more electricity in the summer.

==Health and well-being==

Solid wood products, particularly flooring, are often specified in environments where occupants are known to have allergies to dust or other particulates. 

Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet. The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturallywood.com/resources |title=Naturally:wood Green Building with Wood Toolkit |publisher=Naturallywood.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study at the University of British Columbia and FPInnovations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/28644 |title=Wood in the Human Environment: Restorative Properties of Wood in the Build Indoor Environment Fell, David Robert |publisher=Circle.ubc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the visual presence of wood in a room lowers [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS) activation in occupants, further establishing the positive link between wood and human health. SNS activation is the way human bodies prepare themselves to deal with stress. It increases blood pressure and heart rate while inhibiting digestion, recovery and repair functions in order to deal with immediate threats. While necessary in the short term, prolonged periods in an SNS-activated state have a negative effect on the body’s physiological and psychological health.

The study supports wood’s value as a tool in [[evidence-based design]] (EBD) – a growing field that seeks to promote health and other positive outcomes such as increased productivity and well-being based on scientifically credible evidence. So far, EBD has focused largely on healthcare and, in particular, patient recovery.

==Reducing waste==

Green building seeks to avoid wasting energy, water and materials during construction. Design and building professionals can reduce construction waste through design optimization, using right-sized framing members, for example, or pre-manufactured and engineered components.

The wood industry reduces waste in a similar way by optimizing sawmill operations and by using wood chips and sawdust to produce paper and composite products, or as fuel for renewable bioenergy. North American wood producers use 98 percent of every tree harvested and brought to a mill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://woodworks.org/files/PDF/publications/Green_Bldg.pdf |title=Wood and Green Building |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than demolishing structures at the end of their useful life, they are deconstructed to reclaim useful building materials rather than dumping them in the landfill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jgpress.com/inbusiness/archives/_free/000648.html In Business magazine Green Builders Get Big Help from Deconstruction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121092246/http://www.jgpress.com/inbusiness/archives/_free/000648.html |date=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When used properly, wood, concrete and steel can last for decades or centuries. In North America, most structures are demolished because of external forces such as zoning changes and rising land values. Designing for flexibility and adaptability secures the greatest value for the [[embodied energy]] in building materials. 

Wood is versatile and flexible, making it the easiest construction material for renovations. Wood buildings can be redesigned to suit changing needs, whether this involves adding a new room or moving a window or door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturallywood.com/why-wood |title=Naturally:wood |publisher=Naturallywood.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood structures are typically easy to adapt to new uses because the material is so light and easy to work with. Few homeowner or professional remodelers have the skill and equipment needed to alter steel-frame structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwc.ca/Resources/Tips/#Q18 |title=Canadian Wood Council |publisher=Cwc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural wood members can typically be reclaimed and reused for the same or similar purpose with only minor modifications or wastage, or remilled and fashioned into alternate products such as window and door frames.
To reduce the amount of wood that goes to landfill, the CO2 Neutral Alliance (a coalition of government, NGOs and the forest industry) created the website dontwastewood.com. The site includes resources for regulators, municipalities, developers, contractors, owner/operators and individuals/homeowners looking for information on wood recycling.

==Responsible sourcing==

Wood is a responsible environmental choice for construction as long as it comes from forests that are managed sustainably. [[Illegal logging]] and the international trade in illegally logged timber is a major problem for many timber-producing countries in the developing world. It causes environmental damage, costs governments billions of dollars in lost revenue, promotes corruption, undermines the rule of law and good governance and funds armed conflict. Consumer countries can use their buying power by ensuring the wood products they buy are from known and legal sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illegal-logging.info/ |title=Illegal-Logging.info |publisher=Illegal-Logging.info |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation, which is the permanent removal of forests where the land is converted to other uses such as agriculture or housing, is also a significant problem in developing countries, and globally accounts for 17% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. 

The forests most vulnerable to destruction are in tropical regions of the world, where the rate of deforestation was estimated at {{convert|32000000|acre|km2}} a year from 1990 to 2005. According to the State of the World’s Forests Report, 2007, “the world lost about 3 percent of its forest area from 1990 to 2005; but, in North America, the total forest area remained virtually constant.” When forest land is converted for other uses, a portion of the deforestation can be offset by afforestation—such as the planting of trees on land that has been bare of trees for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcclimatechange.org/ Tackle Climate Change – Use Wood book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0773e/a0773e00.HTM |title=State of the World’s Forests, 2007 |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary third-party forest certification is a credible tool for communicating the environmental and social performance of forest operations.&lt;ref name="metafore1"&gt;{{cite web|author=GreenBlue |url=http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 |title=Metafore |publisher=Metafore |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards. This certification verifies that forests are well-managed – as defined by a particular standard – and ensures that certified wood and paper products come from legal and responsible sources.&lt;ref name="metafore1"/&gt;

==Green building rating systems==

A 2010 study by the [[Light House Sustainable Building Centre]] in British Columbia, Canada examined the ways in which the world’s major voluntary green building rating systems incorporate wood. It found that rating systems for single family homes in North America were the most inclusive of wood products and rating systems for commercial buildings and buildings outside of North America were the least inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://continuingeducation.construction.com/article.php?L=221&amp;C=694McGraw Hill Construction How Wood Products Stack Up in Green Building Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;
Systems studied included [[BREEAM]] (United Kingdom), Built Green (United States and Canada), CASBEE (Japan), [[Green Globes]] (United States), [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] (Australia), [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (launched in United States and used in countries such as Canada, China, India and Mexico), [[Living Building Challenge]] (United States and Canada), the [[NAHB – National Green Building Program]] (United States), and the SB Tool (Canada and UK). 

In most cases, the rating systems offer credits/point for the use of wood in the following areas: certified wood; recycled /reused /salvaged materials; and local sourcing of materials. In some cases, building techniques and skills (such as advanced framing) and waste minimalization are recognized, and most demand that all wood adhesives, resins, engineered and composite products contain no added [[urea formaldehyde]] and have strict limits on VOC ([[volatile organic compound]]) content.

==LEED certified wood credit==
{{see also|Certified wood}}

In December 2010, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] failed to get enough yes votes from members for a proposed rewrite of the certified wood policy in its [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) rating system. Since its inception, LEED has only accepted wood certified to Forest Stewardship Council standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ndash; Tristan Roberts |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2010/12/7/Not-Enough-Votes-for-LEED-Certified-Wood-Benchmark/ |title=Environmental Building News |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two largest third-party forest certification standards in the United States – the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fscus.org/green_building/index.php |title=Forest Stewardship Council |publisher=Fscus.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfiprogram.org/leed/index.php |title=Sustainable Forestry Initiative |publisher=Sfiprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; – opposed the proposed benchmarks. FSC questioned their rigor and SFI claimed the process was overly detailed and complex.

A number of organizations, including the [[National Association of State Foresters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateforesters.org/node/886 |title=National Association of State Foresters Resolution 2008-6: Green Building and the Role of Wood Products |publisher=Stateforesters.org |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canadian Institute of Forestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cif-ifc.org/uploads//Website_Assets/USGB_media_release_April_19_2010.pdf |title=Canadian Institute of Forestry |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Society of American Foresters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goergen |first=Michael T. |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2011509983_guest03green.html |title=Michael Goergen, Society of American Foresters Column in Seattle Times |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; called for LEED to recognize all credible certification programs to encourage the use of wood as a green building material.

In its 2008-2009 Forest Products Annual Review, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe/Food and Agriculture Organization stated that green building initiatives (GBI) can be a mixed blessing for wood products. “GBI standards giving exclusive recognition to particular
forest-certification brands may help drive demand for these brands at the expense of wider appreciation of the environmental merits of wood.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |title=2008-2009 UNECE-FAO Forest Products Annual Review Page 123 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2009-2010 review, the UNECE/FAO reported growing convergence between certification systems: "Over the years, many of the issues that previously divided the (certification) systems have become much less distinct. The largest certification systems now generally have the same structural programmatic requirements." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/Final_FPAMR2009.pdf |title=2008-2009 UNECE-FAO Forest Products Annual Review Page 121 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Woodblock printing ==
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] [[China]], 868 AD ([[British Museum]]), which is widely seen as the earliest extant printed book]]

Traditionally, there have been two main printing techniques in Asia: woodblock printing ([[xylography]]) and moveable type printing. In the woodblock technique, ink is applied to letters carved upon a wooden board, which is then pressed onto paper. With moveable type, the board is assembled using different lettertypes, according to the page being printed. Wooden printing was used in the East from the 8th century onwards, and moveable metal type came into use during the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Fifty Wonders of Korea"&gt;Fifty Wonders of Korea: Volume 1. Seoul: Samjung Munhwasa, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9797263-1-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest specimen of woodblock printing on paper, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them, was discovered in 1974 in an excavation of [[Xi'an]] (then called [[Chang'an]], the capital of Tang China), [[Shaanxi]], China.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;Pan, Jixing. "On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries", in ''Chinese Science Bulletin'', 1997, Vol. 42, No. 12: 976–981. ISSN 1001-6538. Pages 979&amp;ndash;980.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[dharani]]'' sutra printed on [[hemp]] paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt; Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang dynasty has also been found, the Saddharmapunṇḍarīka sutra or [[Lotus Sutra]] printed from 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180" /&gt;

[[File:Dharani sutra.jpg|thumb|The Pure Light Dharani Sutra is the world's oldest surviving woodblock print.]]

In [[Korea]], an example of woodblock printing from the eighth century was discovered in 1966. A copy of the [[Buddhist]] [[Dharani Sutra]] called the [[Pure Light Dharani Sutra]] ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}), discovered in [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]] in a [[Silla]] dynasty pagoda that was repaired in 751 AD,&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=149,150}}&lt;/ref&gt; was undated but must have been created sometime before the reconstruction of the [[Seokgatap|Shakyamuni Pagoda]] of [[Bulguk Temple]], Kyongju Province in 751 AD.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Keith|title=Everlasting Flower: A History of Korea|date=August 15, 2007|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn= 978-1861893352|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000593746&amp;danrak_no=&amp;clss_cd=&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000808 Early Printing in Korea.

Rightreading.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/7.htm North Korea - Silla. Country Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; The document is estimated to have been created no later than 704 AD.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 149,150" /&gt;

=== The printing process ===

The manuscript is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed sheets of paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which a thin layer of rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a double edged tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four proof-readings are normally required – the transcript, the corrected transcript, first sample print from block and after any corrections have been made. A small correction to a block can be made by cutting a small notch and hammering in a wedge-shaped piece of wood. Larger errors require an inlay. After this the block is washed to remove any refuse.

To print, the block is fixed firmly on a table. The printer takes a round horsehair inking brush and applies ink with a vertical motion. The paper is then laid on the block and rubbed with a long narrow pad to transfer the impression to the paper. The paper is peeled off and set to dry. Because of the rubbing process, printing is only done on one side of the paper, and the paper is thinner than in the west, but two pages are normally printed at once.

Sample copies were sometimes made in red or blue, but black ink was always used for production. It is said that a skilled printer could produce as many as 1500 or 2000 double sheets in a day. Blocks can be stored and reused when extra copies are needed. 15,000 prints can be taken from a block with a further 10,000 after touching up.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spread of printing in East Asia ===
Printing started in China in 593 AD.&lt;ref name="minnesota-china.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213025/http://www.minnesota-china.com/education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was promoted by the spread of Buddhism.
 
The Buddhist scroll known as the "Great Dharani Sutra of Immaculate and Pure Light" or "Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra" ({{korean|hangul=무구정광대다라니경|hanja=無垢淨光大陀羅尼經|rr=Mugu jeonggwang dae darani-gyeong}}) is currently the oldest surviving woodblock print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|title=Spotless Pure Light Dharani Sutra|publisher=National Museum of Korea|accessdate=17 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001405/http://211.252.141.1/program/relic/relicDetailEng.jsp?menuID=002005002&amp;relicID=4367&amp;relicDetailID=17466|archivedate=31 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/736|title=Seokguram Grotto and Bulguksa Temple|publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage Centre]]|accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in Korea before the year 751 A.D. during the Silla Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt; This Darani Sutra was found inside the Seokga Pagoda of Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju, Korea. Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju in October 1966 within the seokgatap (释迦塔) while dismantling the tower to repair much of the sari was found with the prints. One row of the darani gyeongmun 8-9 are printed in the form of a roll. [[Tripitaka Koreana]] was printed between 1011 and 1082. It is the world's most comprehensive and oldest intact version of Buddhist canon. A reprint in 1237–51 used 81,258 blocks of magnolia wood, carved on both sides, which are still kept almost intact at [[Haeinsa]]. A printing office was established in the National Academy in 1101 and the [[Goryeo]] government collection numbered several tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=323–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], one thousand copies of the [[Lotus sutra]] were printed in 1009 as a pious work, not intended to be read and therefore legibility was not so important. The spread of printing outside Buddhist circles didn't develop until the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|pp=338–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The westward movement of printing started from eastern [[Turkestan]] where printing in the [[Uyghur language]] appeared in about 1300, though the page numbers and descriptions are in Chinese. Both blocks and moveable type printing has been discovered at [[Turfan]] as well as several hundred wooden type for Uighur. After the [[Mongol]]s conquered Turfan, a great number of Uighurs were recruited into the Mongol army and after the Mongols incorporated [[Persia]] in the middle of the 13th century, paper money was printed in [[Tabriz]] in 1294, following the Chinese system. The [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani#Book transmission: printing and translation|first description of the Chinese printing system]] was made by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]] in 1301–11 in his history of the world.

Some fifty pieces of printed matter have been found in [[Egypt]] printed between 900 and 1300 in black ink on paper by the rubbing method in the Chinese style. Although there is no transmission evidence, experts believe there is a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, 1955, pp 179–180&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the print scholar [[A. Hyatt Mayor]], "it was the Chinese who really discovered the means of communication that was to dominate until our age."&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints and People'', Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos. 1–4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both woodblock and movable type printing were replaced in the second half of the 19th century by [[Typography|western-style printing]], initially [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;
"The phase of technological development that distinguished China's and particularly Shanghai's early Westernized printing industry was that involving lithography."

== Movable type ==
{{Further|Movable type}}

=== Ceramic movable type in China ===
[[Bi Sheng]] (毕昇) (990–1051) developed the first known movable-type system for printing in China around 1040 AD during the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, using ceramic materials.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;Man, John. ''The Gutenberg Revolution: The story of a genius that changed the world'' (c) 2002 Headline Book Publishing, a division of Hodder Headline, London. {{ISBN|0-7472-4504-5}}. A detailed examination of Gutenberg's life and invention, interwoven with the underlying social and religious upheaval of [[Medieval Europe]] on the eve of the Renaissance.&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (沈括) (1031–1095):

:When he wished to print, he took an iron frame and set it on the iron plate. In this he placed the types, set close together. When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [at the back] was slightly melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.

:For each character there were several types, and for certain common characters there were twenty or more types each, in order to be prepared for the repetition of characters on the same page. When the characters were not in use he had them arranged with paper labels, one label for each rhyme-group, and kept them in wooden cases.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

:If one were to print only two or three copies, this method would be neither simple nor easy. But for printing hundreds or thousands of copies, it was marvelously quick. As a rule he kept two forms going. While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;

In 1193, Zhou Bida, an officer of Southern Song Dynasty, made a set of clay movable-type method according to the method described by Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', and printed his book ''Notes of The Jade Hall'' (《玉堂杂记》).&lt;ref name="Yinong"&gt;Xu Yinong, ''Moveable Type Books'' (徐忆农《活字本》) {{ISBN|7-80643-795-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay type printing was practiced in China from the Song dynasty through the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001, p22&lt;/ref&gt; As late as 1844 there were still books printed in China with ceramic movable types.&lt;ref name="Yinong" /&gt;

=== Wooden movable type in China ===
Wooden movable type was also first developed around 1040 AD by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051), as described by the Chinese scholar [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), but was abandoned in favour of clay movable types due to the presence of wood grains and the unevenness of the wooden type after being soaked in ink.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Shen Kuo]] |title = [[Dream Pool Essays]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese movable type 1313-ce.png|thumb|A revolving typecase for wooden type in China, from [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]]'s book published in 1313]]
In 1298, [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] (王祯/王禎), a [[Yuan dynasty]] governmental official of [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui|Anhui Province]], China, re-invented a method of making movable wooden types. He made more than 30,000 wooden movable types and printed 100 copies of ''Records of Jingde County'' (《旌德县志》), a book of more than 60,000 [[Chinese characters]]. Soon afterwards, he summarized his invention in his book ''A method of making moveable wooden types for printing books''. This system was later enhanced by pressing wooden blocks into sand and casting metal types from the depression in copper, bronze, iron or tin. This new method overcame many of the shortcomings of woodblock printing. Rather than manually carving an individual block to print a single page, movable type printing allowed for the quick assembly of a page of text. Furthermore, these new, more compact type fonts could be reused and stored.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; The set of wafer-like metal stamp types could be assembled to form pages, inked, and page impressions taken from rubbings on cloth or paper.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt; In 1322，a [[Fenghua|Fenghua county]] officer Ma Chengde (马称德) in Zhejiang, made 100,000 wooded movable types and printed 43 volume ''Daxue Yanyi'' (《大学衍义》). Wooden movable types were used continually in China. Even as late as 1733, a 2300-volume ''Wuying Palace Collected Gems Edition'' (《武英殿聚珍版丛书》) was printed with 253500 wooden movable type on order of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and completed in one year.

A number of books printed in [[Tangut script]] during the [[Western Xia]] (1038–1227) period are known, of which the ''[[Auspicious Tantra of All-Reaching Union]]'' that was discovered in the ruins of [[Baisigou Square Pagoda]] in 1991 is believed to have been printed sometime during the reign of [[Emperor Renzong of Western Xia]] (1139–1193).&lt;ref name="zhang-yuzhen-2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Zhang Yuzhen (张玉珍) |title=世界上现存最早的木活字印本—宁夏贺兰山方塔出土西夏文佛经《吉祥遍至口和本续》介绍 |trans-title=The world's oldest extant book printed with wooden movable type |journal=Library and Information (《图书与情报》) |year=2003 |issue=1 |url=http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |issn=1003-6938 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150528/http://www.zhg1.cn/science/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=244&amp;Page=1 |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered by many Chinese experts to be the earliest extant example of a book printed using wooden movable type.&lt;ref name="beijing-daily"&gt;{{Cite news |author1 = Hou Jianmei (侯健美) |author2 = Tong Shuquan (童曙泉) |title = 《大夏寻踪》今展国博 |trans-title='In the Footsteps of the Great Xia' now exhibiting at the National Museum |newspaper = [[Beijing Daily]] (《北京日报》) |date = 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular difficulty posed the logistical problems of handling the several thousand [[logograph]]s whose command is required for full literacy in [[Middle Chinese|Chinese language]]. It was faster to carve one woodblock per page than to composit a page from so many different types. However, if one was to use movable type for multitudes of the same document, the speed of printing would be relatively quicker.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

Although the wooden type was more durable under the mechanical rigors of handling, repeated printing wore the character faces down, and the types could only be replaced by carving new pieces.

=== Metal movable type in China ===
Bronze movable type printing was invented in China no later than the 12th century, according to at least 13 material finds in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguogudaishi/special/huoziyinshua/ 韩国剽窃活字印刷发明权只是第一步]&lt;/ref&gt; in large scale bronze plate printing of paper money and formal official documents issued by [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] (1115–1234) and [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279) dynasties with embedded bronze metal types for anti counterfeit markers. Such paper money printing might date back to the 11th-century  [[jiaozi (currency)|''jiaozi'']] of [[Northern Song]] (960–1127).&lt;ref&gt;Pan Jixing, ''A history of movable metal type printing technique in China 2001'', pp. 41-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:五贯宝卷.jpg|thumb|right|Copperplate of 1215–1216 5000-[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|cash]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] [[paper money]] with bronze movable type counterfeit markers]]
The typical example of this kind of bronze movable type embedded copper-block printing is a printed "check" of Jin Dynasty with two square holes for embedding two bronze movable type characters, each selected from 1000 different characters, such that each printed paper money has different combination of markers. A copper block printed paper money dated between 1215–1216 in the collection of [[Luo Zhenyu]]'s ''Pictorial Paper Money of the Four Dynasties'', 1914, shows two special characters one called ''Ziliao'', the other called ''Zihao'' for the purpose of preventing counterfeit; over the ''Ziliao'' there is a small character (輶) printed with movable copper type, while over the ''Zihao'' there is an empty square hole, apparently the associated copper metal type was lost. Another sample of [[Song dynasty]] money of the same period in the collection of [[Shanghai Museum]] has two empty square holes above ''Ziliao'' as well as ''Zihou'', due to the loss of two copper movable types. Song dynasty bronze block embedded with bronze metal movable type printed paper money was issued in large scale and in circulation for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Moveable Type Printing in China'', by Pan Jixing, Professor of the Institute for History of Science, Academy of Science, Beijing, China, English Abstract, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1298 book ''Zao Huozi Yinshufa'' (《造活字印书法》/《造活字印書法》) by the early [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368) official [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]], there is mention of [[tin]] movable type, used probably since the [[Southern Song]] dynasty (1127–1279), but this was largely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] |year = 1298 |title = Zao Huozi Yinshufa (《造活字印書法》) |quote = 近世又铸锡作字, 以铁条贯之 (rendering: In the modern times, there's melten Tin Movable type, and linked them with iron bar)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unsatisfactory due to its incompatibility with the [[ink]]ing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mongol Empire]] (1206–1405), printing using movable type spread from China to Central Asia.{{clarify |reason = which others? names of cultures please. It beats saying "among others..." |date = February 2012}} The [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of Central Asia used movable type, their script type adopted from the Mongol language, some with Chinese words printed between the pages, a strong evidence that the books were printed in China.&lt;ref name="TsienACH"&gt;''Chinese Paper and Printing, A Cultural History'', by Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Removeable type book.jpg|thumb|A page from bronze movable-type book by [[Hua Sui]], printed in 1490]]
During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Hua Sui]] in 1490 used bronze type in printing books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574 the massive 1000 volume encyclopedia [[Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era]] (《太平御览》/《太平御覧》) were printed with bronze movable type.

In 1725, the [[Qing dynasty]] government made 250,000 bronze movable-type characters and printed 64 sets of the encyclopedic ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' (《古今图书集成》/《古今圖書集成》, ''Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current Times''). Each set consisted of 5040 volumes, making a total of 322,560 volumes printed using movable type.&lt;ref name="TsienACH" /&gt;

=== Metal movable type in Korea ===
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|[[Jikji]], "Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Son Masters", the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, printed in [[Korea]] in 1377. Bibliothèque Nationale de France.]]

The transition from wood type to movable metal type occurred in [[Korea]] during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty, some time in the 13th century, to meet the heavy demand for both religious and secular books. A set of ritual books, ''Sangjeong Gogeum Yemun'' were printed with movable metal type in 1234.&lt;ref name="christensen"&gt;

The techniques for bronze casting, used at the time for making coins (as well as bells and statues) were adapted to making metal type. Unlike the metal punch system thought to be used by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]], the Koreans used a sand-casting method. The following description of the Korean font casting process was recorded by the [[Joseon]] dynasty scholar Song Hyon (15th century):

:''At first, one cuts letters in beech wood. One fills a trough level with fine sandy &lt;nowiki&gt;[clay]&lt;/nowiki&gt; of the reed-growing seashore. Wood-cut letters are pressed into the sand, then the impressions become negative and form letters &lt;nowiki&gt;[molds]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. At this step, placing one trough together with another, one pours the molten bronze down into an opening. The fluid flows in, filling these negative molds, one by one becoming type. Lastly, one scrapes and files off the irregularities, and piles them up to be arranged.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While metal movable type printing was developed in Korea and the oldest extant metal print book had been printed in Korea,&lt;ref name="available online"&gt;Michael Twyman, ''The British Library Guide to Printing: History and Techniques'', London: The British Library, 1998 [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0802081797&amp;id=KXoaalwyOjAC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=korea+gutenberg+surviving&amp;sig=4QBhy9ty1jbXJASJcUzFBDfKbGo available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Korea never witnessed a printing revolution comparable to Europe's:

:''Korean printing with movable metallic type developed mainly within the royal foundry of the Yi dynasty. Royalty kept a monopoly of this new technique and by royal mandate suppressed all non-official printing activities and any budding attempts at commercialization of printing. Thus, printing in early Korea served only the small, noble groups of the highly stratified society.''&lt;ref&gt;Sohn, Pow-Key, "Early Korean Printing", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 79, No. 2 (April–June  1959), pp.&amp;nbsp;96–103 (103).&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential solution to the linguistic and cultural bottleneck that held back movable type in Korea for two hundred years appeared in the early 15th century—a generation before Gutenberg would begin working on his own movable type invention in Europe&amp;mdash;when [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong]] devised a simplified [[alphabet]] of 24 characters called [[Hangul]] for use by the common people, which could have made the typecasting and compositing process more feasible.

=== Movable type in Japan ===
Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a Western [[movable type]] [[printing-press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], printing equipment&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;[[Richard Douglas Lane|Lane, Richard]] (1978). ''Images of the Floating World''. Old Saybrook, CT: Konecky &amp; Konecky. P.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt; brought back by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army in 1593 from Korea had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming ''[[shōgun]]'', effected the creation of the first native movable type,&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.

An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598 using metal moveable type printing equipment at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writings would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sansom, George (1961).

== Comparison of woodblock and movable type in East Asia ==
[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|China Block Printing Museum in [[Yangzhou]]]]

Despite the introduction of movable type from the 11th century, printing using woodblocks remained dominant in East Asia until the introduction of [[lithography]] and [[photolithography]] in the 19th century. To understand this it is necessary to consider both the nature of the language and the economics of printing.

Given that the Chinese language does not use an alphabet it was usually necessary for a set of type to contain 100,000 or more blocks, which was a substantial investment. Common characters need 20 or more copies, and rarer characters only a single copy. In the case of wood, the characters were either produced in a large block and cut up, or the blocks were cut first and the characters cut afterwards. In either case the size and height of the type had to be carefully controlled to produce pleasing results. To handle the typesetting, Wang Zhen used revolving tables about 2m in diameter in which the characters were divided according to the five tones and the rhyme sections according to the official book of rhymes. The characters were all numbered and one man holding the list called out the number to another who would fetch the type.

This system worked well when the run was large. Wang Zhen's initial project to produce 100 copies of a 60,000 character gazetteer of the local district was produced in less than a month. But for the smaller runs typical of the time it was not such an improvement. A reprint required resetting and re-proofreading, unlike the wooden block system where it was feasible to store the blocks and reuse them. Individual wooden characters didn't last as long as complete blocks. When metal type was introduced it was harder to produce aesthetically pleasing type by the direct carving method.

It is unknown whether metal movable types used from the late 15th century in China were cast from moulds or carved individually. Even if they were cast, there were not the economies of scale available with the small number of different characters used in an alphabetic system. The wage for engraving on bronze was many times that for carving characters on wood and a set of metal type might contain 200,000–400,000 characters. Additionally, the ink traditionally used in Chinese printing, typically composed of pine soot bound with glue, didn't work well with the tin originally used for type.

As a result of all this, movable type was initially used by government offices which needed to produce large number of copies and by itinerant printers producing family registers who would carry perhaps 20,000 pieces of wooden type with them and cut any other characters needed locally. But small local printers often found that wooden blocks suited their needs better.&lt;ref name="Tsien 1985 201"/&gt;

== Mechanical presses ==

Mechanical presses as used in [[Europe]]an printing remained unknown in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;printing. Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 5, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]].&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, printing remained an unmechanized, laborious process with pressing the back of the paper onto the inked block by manual "rubbing" with a hand tool.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt; In Korea, the first printing presses were introduced as late as 1881–83,&lt;ref&gt;Albert A. Altman, "Korea's First Newspaper: The Japanese Chosen shinpo", ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 43, No. 4. (August 1984), pp.&amp;nbsp;685–696.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Melvin McGovern"&gt;Melvin McGovern, "Early Western Presses in Korea", ''Korea Journal'', 1967, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–23.&lt;/ref&gt; while in Japan, after an early but brief interlude in the 1590s,&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (34).&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg's printing press arrived in Nagasaki in 1848 on a Dutch ship.&lt;ref&gt;Akihiro Kinoshita, Keiichi Ishikawa, "Early Printing History in Japan", Gutenberg-Jahrbuch, Volume 73.1998 (1998), pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35 (33 ''et seq.'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Gutenberg printing, which allowed printing on both sides of the paper from its very beginnings (although not simultaneously until very recent times), East Asian printing was done only on one side of the paper, because the need to rub the back of the paper when printing would have spoilt the first side when the second side was printed.&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p.&amp;nbsp;64–127 , Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963. {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason was that, unlike in Europe where Gutenberg introduced more suitable oil-based ink, Asian printing remained confined to water-based inks which tended to soak through the paper.

'''Idiom''' is the syntactical, grammatical, or structural form peculiar to a [[language]].&lt;ref name="MWCD"&gt;{{Citation | author = Merriam-Webster | authorlink = Merriam-Webster | title = Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary | publisher = Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idiom is the realized structure of a language, as opposed to possible but unrealized structures that could have developed to serve the same [[semantic]] functions but did not.

Language grammar and syntax is often inherently arbitrary and peculiar to a particular language or a [[language family|group of related languages]]. For example, although in English it is ''idiomatic'' (accepted as structurally correct) to say "cats are associated with agility", other forms could have developed, such as "cats associate toward agility" or "cats are associated of agility".&lt;ref name="Garner_2016_headword_accompanied"&gt;{{Citation |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |author-link=Bryan A. Garner |year=2016 |title=Garner's Modern English Usage |edition=4th |location=headword "accompanied" |url=http://www.lawprose.org/bryan-garner/books-by-bryan-garner/garners-modern-english-usage-4th-edition-2016/ |isbn=978-0190491482 |quote=Idiom requires ''accompanied by'', not ''*accompanied with''—e.g.: '[…] sliced in half and accompanied with [read ''accompanied by''] no more than a small scoop of ice cream.' |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unidiomatic constructions sound wrong to fluent speakers, although they are often entirely comprehensible. For example, the title of the classic book ''[[English As She Is Spoke]]'' is easy to understand (its idiomatic counterpart is ''English As It Is Spoken''), but it deviates from English idiom in the [[grammatical gender|gender]] of the pronoun and the [[inflection]] of the verb. [[Accidental gap|Lexical gaps]] are another key example of idiom.

==Emic and etic views==
[[Monolingual]] native speakers in an insulated monolingual-native environment are mostly not conscious of ''idiomaticness'' (the quality or state of a construction matching the idiom of the given language), because in general their minds never reach for, or hear, other possible structures. The main exception is when they hear the natural experimentation of children acquiring the language, when they may encounter, for example, [[overregularization]] (for example, ''I seed two deers'' for ''I saw two deer''). By this correlation, [[solecism]] to native-speaking monolingual minds often sounds childish. However, when adults study a foreign language, they become consciously aware of idiomaticness and the lack of it. For example, in English it is idiomatic to use an [[article (grammar)#Indefinite article|indefinite article]] when describing a person's occupation (''I am '''a''' plumber''; ''she is '''an''' engineer''), but in Spanish and many other languages it is not (''soy plomero''; ''ella es ingeniera''), and a native speaker of English learning Spanish must encounter and accept that fact to become fluent.

The [[count noun|count]] [[word sense|sense]] of the word ''idiom'', referring to [[idiom|a saying with a figurative meaning]], is related to the present sense of the word by the arbitrariness and peculiarity aspects; the idiom "she is pulling my leg" (meaning "she is humorously misleading me") is idiomatic because it belongs, by convention, to the language, whether or not anyone can identify the original logic by which it was coined (arbitrariness), and regardless of whether it translates literally to any other language (peculiarity).

'''Indifferentism''', in the Roman Catholic faith, is the belief held by some that no one religion or philosophy is superior to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indifferentism |title=Indifferentism - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]] ascribes indifferentism to many [[atheism|atheistic]], [[materialism|materialistic]], [[pantheism|pantheistic]], and [[agnosticism|agnostic]] philosophies. There are three basic types of indifferentism described by [[Catholic apologetics]]: absolute, restricted, and liberal or latitudinarian indifferentism. Indifferentism was first explicitly identified and opposed by [[Pope Gregory XVI]], in his encyclical ''[[Mirari vos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Greg16/g16mirar.htm |title=Mirari Vos |publisher=Papalencyclicals.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious Indifferentism is to be distinguished from political indifferentism, which is applied to the policy of a state that treats all the religions within its borders as being on an equal footing before the law of the country. Indifferentism is not to be confounded with religious indifference. The former is primarily a theory disparaging the value of religion; the latter term designates the conduct of those who, whether they do or do not believe in the necessity and utility of religion, do in fact neglect to fulfill its duties.

==Catholic teachings on indifferentism==
In the [[Catholic Church]], the belief that one [[religion]] is as good as another, and that all religions are equally valid paths to [[salvation]], is believed to be obviously false, on the grounds that nobody honestly believes that, for instance, a religion based on human sacrifice and the subjugation of rivals is as good, true, and beautiful as one based on heroic love of God and neighbor. The  condemnation of Indifferentism as a heresy is closely linked to the [[dogmatic definition]] that [[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|outside the Church there is no salvation]], a complex idea postulating that many people are followers of Christ without any specific understanding that it is in fact Jesus whom they are following. See also the Catholic concept of the [[Baptism of desire|"Baptism of Desire"]]. In support of this stance the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith has said "This does not lessen the sincere respect that the Church has for the various religious traditions, recognizing in them elements of truth and goodness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20021124_politica_en.html#_ftn30 |title=Doctrinal Note on some questions regarding the participation of Catholics in political life |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute indifferentism===
[[Immanuel Kant]] argues that absolute indifferentism represents an extreme form of skepticism that argues that there is no rational ground for accepting any philosophical position,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, D.A. "Kant, Bayle and Indifferentism," ''The Philosophical Review,'' 63(4) {{doi|10.2307/2182293}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that matches the Roman Catholic understanding of the term. According to the Catholic Church, this type of absolute indifferentism results in a willingness to concede any position.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J. (1910). Religious Indifferentism. In The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved December 17, 2010 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07759a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is often associated with [[moral relativism]].

===Restricted indifferentism===
Catholicism also opposes as "indifferentism" a spectrum of pragmatic ideas that admit the necessity of religion because of its positive influence on human life; but which hold that all religions are equally true. The classic advocate of this theory is [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who maintains, in his ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|Emile]]'', that God looks only to the sincerity of intention, and that everybody can serve Him by remaining in the religion in which they were raised, or by converting to any other that pleases them more (Emile, III). This doctrine is widely advocated today on the grounds that, beyond the truth of God's existence, we can attain to no certain religious knowledge; and that, since God has left us thus in uncertainty, He will be pleased with whatever form of worship we sincerely offer Him. This idea appears to be tenable only in a cultural context that takes most core ethical beliefs for granted: it runs into serious trouble as soon as the basis of ethics comes into question. 

From a Roman Catholic perspective, to say that all these [[argument from inconsistent revelations|irreconcilable beliefs]] are equally pleasing to God is to say that God has no preference for truth and to deny reason. The Roman Catholic Church argues that restricted indifferentism is no different from absolute indifferentism because while nominally acknowledging the utility of religion, to affirm that "all religions are equally good" ultimately means that religion is good for nothing.

===Liberal or latitudinarian indifferentism===
The [[Catholic Church]] also resists as indifferentism the belief that, since [[Christianity]] is the true religion,  it makes no difference which of the several Christian [[religious denomination|denominations]] the believer chooses to join.  Catholicism critiques [[Protestantism]] specifically for this sort of limited indifferentism, noting that many Protestant denominations do not claim any particular fidelity to the gospel, while maintaining that all forms of worship may be equally (read "indifferently") effective for the purpose of building a closer union with God: a [[latitudinarianism|latitudinarian]] position. [[Pope Pius XI]] explicitly criticized the [[Ecumenism|Ecumenical movement]] on these grounds in his encyclical, ''Mortalium animos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XI |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19280106_mortalium-animos_en.html |title=Pius XI, Mortalium animos (06/01/1928) |publisher=Vatican.va |date=1928-01-06 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the Catholic perspective, this form of indifferentism is rather like saying, "It makes no difference what tools and materials are used to build a house, it will turn out just fine, no matter what you do or don't do."

Traditionally, an '''Islamic garden''' is a cool place of rest and reflection, and a reminder of [[Jannah|paradise]].  The [[Qur'an]] has many references to gardens, and the garden is used as an earthly analogue for the life in paradise which is promised to believers:

:''Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode; and best of all is Allah's goodly pleasure; that is the grand achievement'' (Qur'an 9.72)

There are surviving formal Islamic gardens in a wide zone extending from Spain and Morocco in the west to India in the east. Famous Islamic gardens include those of the [[Taj Mahal]] in India and the [[Generalife]] and [[Alhambra]] in Spain.

The general theme of a traditional Islamic garden is water and shade, not surprisingly since Islam came from and generally spread in a hot and arid climate.  Unlike English gardens, which are often designed for walking, Islamic gardens are intended for rest and contemplation.  For this reason, Islamic gardens usually include places for sitting.

==Types==
[[D. Fairchild Ruggles|Fairchild Ruggles]] refers to the universal nature of gardening, and the basic human needs it fulfills; the needs to cultivate, to master the wild landscape, and to bring order to it.  The spiritual aspects of gardening, according to this view, were a later development.  She further points out the classic formal garden, known as the [[Charbagh]] (or Chahar Bagh), is but one form which exists in the Islamic civilization; a civilization which has traditionally included peoples of many faiths and cultures.&lt;ref name="Ruggles, D. Fairchild 2008"&gt;[[D. Fairchild Ruggles|Ruggles, D. Fairchild]]. ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clifford A. Wright, an author on Mediterranean cuisine, describes different garden types for different purposes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/29/id/53/|title=Did You Know: Food History - The Muslim Gardens of Paradise|website=www.cliffordawright.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Muslims had different kinds of gardens serving different purposes. The bustan was the garden of the inner court of a house, a formal garden with pools and water channels. The jannah was an orchard with palms, oranges, and vines irrigated by canals. The rawdah referred in particular to the vegetable garden that produced foods for the cooks.}}

==Persian, Arabic and Byzantine influence==
After the Arab invasions of the 7th century CE, the traditional design of the [[Persian garden]] was used in the Islamic garden. [[Persian gardens]] after that time were traditionally enclosed by walls and were designed to represent [[Jannah|paradise]]; the Persian word for enclosed space is 'pairi-daeza.'   In the [[Charbagh]], or [[paradise garden]], four water canals typically carry water into a central pool or fountain, interpreted as the four rivers in paradise, filled with milk, honey, wine and water.&lt;ref name="Gardens of Islam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Arts|url=http://islamispeace.org.uk/itm.php?id_top=27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014025728/http://islamispeace.org.uk/itm.php?id_top=27|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 October 2007|website=Islamispeace.org.uk|publisher=Islamispeace.org.uk|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe,'' Citadelles &amp; Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hellenistic]] influences are also apparent; the Western use of straight lines in the plan is blended with [[Sassanid]] ornamental plantations and fountains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Luise Gothein]], ''A History of Garden Art'', Diederichs, 1914, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving gardens==
Many of the gardens of Islamic civilization are lost to us today. While most others may retain their forms, the original plantings have been replaced with modern ones.&lt;ref name="Ruggles, D. Fairchild 2008"/&gt; The garden is a transient form of architectural art dependent upon the climate, and the resources available to those who care for it.

===Albania===
[[Evliya Çelebi]]'s 17th century CE [[Seyahatname]] (travel book) contains descriptions of Paradise Gardens around the towns of Berat and Elbasan, Albania. According to Dr. [[Robert Elsie]], an expert on Albanian culture, very few traces of the refined oriental culture of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era remain here today.&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elsie|first1=Robert|title=Texts and Documents of Albanian History|url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts16-18/AH1670_1.html|website=Albanian History|accessdate=3 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705153855/http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts16-18/AH1670_1.html|archivedate=5 July 2011|quote=Extract from: Robert Dankoff and Robert Elsie (ed.): Evliya Çelebi in Albania and Adjacent Regions (Kosovo, Montenegro, Ohrid), Leiden 2000, p. 101 127, 161 193. Translated from the Ottoman Turkish by Robert Elsie and Robert Dankoff. Also published in R. Elsie: Early Albania, a Reader of Historical Texts, 11th - 17th Centuries, Wiesbaden 2003, p. 195-218.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Çelebi describes the town of Berat:

{{quote|It is a huge open town, entirely outside the walls of the fortress. It is situated in a large area along the bank of the [...] river to the east and south of the upper fortress and is covered in vineyards, rose gardens and vegetable gardens. There are 5,000 one- and two-story stonework houses with red-tiled roofs. They are well built and attractive houses with gardens and are spread over seven verdant hills and valleys. Among them are over 100 splendid mansions with cisterns and fountains and an invigorating climate.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;}}

Çelebi describes the town of Elbasan:

{{quote|The open town outside the walls extends on all sides of the fortress to the foot of the hills at a distance of one hour's march. The prosperous and cheerful-looking mansions in the open town are adorned with beautiful vineyards, paradisiacal gardens and parks with their pavilions and galleries. They are two or three stories high, made of stonework and with tiled roofs. Each of them has a source of pure flowing water, a pool and a fountain with water spurting from jets. They are luxurious dwellings like those in the gardens of paradise.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;}}

===Algeria===
Dar al-Bahr, the Lake Palace, is situated on the southern end of [[Beni Hammad Fort]], a ruined fortified city which has remained uninhabited for 800 years.  Artifacts recovered from the site attest to a high degree of civilization. During its time, it was remarked upon by visitors for the nautical spectacles enacted in its large pool.  Surrounding the pool and the palace were terraces, courtyards and gardens.  Little is known of the details of these gardens, other than the lion motifs carved in their stone fountains.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, D. Fairchild. ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Beni Hammad Fort is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], noted as an "authentic picture of a fortified Muslim city."

===The Shalimar gardens===
The name Shalimar is thought to mean, among other things, "abode of bliss" or "light of the moon". There were originally three gardens with the name Shalimar: [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|one in Lahore, Pakistan]], [[Shalimar Bagh (Srinagar)|another in Jammu Kashmir]], India and finally one, located in Delhi, which has completely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Sikander, Sattar. ''The Shalamar: A Typical Muslim Garden''. Environmental Design: Journal of the Islamic Environmental Design Research Centre 2, 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shalimar Gardens, Lahore====
[[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens, Lahore]], was built by the governor of Lahore, with funds supplied by the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], beginning in 1641 CE.  The water is supplied by a canal dug from the nearby Ravi river.  Built in the [[Mughal gardens|Mughal style]], it is surrounded by high walls with towers in the corners.  The inner face of the walls have traces of frescoes done in floral patterns.  The canal passes through the gardens, which are constructed on three separate terraces at different elevations.  The garden terraces are laid out in the traditional "paradise" motif of four channels converging on a central fountain, and cover a total of forty acres.&lt;ref&gt;Sikander, Sattar. ''The Shalamar: A Typical Muslim Garden''. Environmental Design: Journal of the Islamic Environmental Design Research Centre 2, 1986, pp. 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20060214214014/http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/4883/doc/DPC0715.pdf]

===Andalusian Spain===
The garden was a common feature of homes in Arab Spain.  Andalusian designs emphasized privacy and coolness, with rooms opening onto a roofed, open corridor.  Next to this corridor, one would typically find a verdant patio garden complete with central fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, T. B. ''The Falcon of Spain ''. Ashraf Press, 1962, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Azhar park, Cairo===
[[Al-Azhar Park]] is a modern landmark in Cairo, Egypt. It is laid out along a central series of terraced, formal Islamic gardens.  Multicolored [[Mamluk]] stonework, fountains and [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are the predominating stylistic theme of the park.  It is listed as one of the world's sixty great public spaces by the [[Project for Public Spaces]] ([http://www.pps.org/ PPS]).&lt;ref name="PPS Sixty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home |title=60 of the World's Great Places - Project for Public Spaces |accessdate=2006-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206002657/http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home |archivedate=2006-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Semple Kerr''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (6 July 1932 – 15 October 2014) was an [[architectural historian]] and heritage practitioner in Australia, who was prominent in the drafting of the original [[Burra Charter]] and its subsidiary documents, and developing standards for conservation practice, particularly in relation to conservation assessments and management reports such as conservation management plans. Kerr's influence in the conservation movement is most notable for his publication of the ''[[Conservation Plan]]'', which has guided building conservation in Australia and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/publications/the-conservation-plan/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; Publications &gt; The Conservation Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work and contributions==

Kerr undertook a doctorate at the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies, at the [[University of York]] in 1974. In 1978 he took up the position as Assistant Director at the [[Australian Heritage Commission]] in Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/steggall-rev.pdf Tradition and its transformation: Joan Kerr, housewife to historian, Susan Steggall]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an assistant director of the National Trust of Australia (NSW).&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Conservation-Plan-7th-Edition-reduced-file-size.pdf Conservation Plan online edition, Australia ICOMOS &gt; Publications, 2013, author details p.83]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerr was prominent in heritage conservation in Australia for over 40 years and was an early member of [[Australia ICOMOS]], taking a major role in the formulation of the [[Burra Charter]] and its Guidelines. His publication in 1982 of ''The Conservation Plan: A guide to the preparation of conservation plans for places of European cultural significance'' was a landmark in Australian conservation. ''The Conservation Plan'' is widely used by heritage practitioners and property owners in Australia, and worldwide as a primary guide to the process of researching, documenting and managing historic places in accordance with the [[Burra Charter]], through a logical process. First published by the [[National Trust of Australia]] (NSW) in 1982, it has subsequently been reprinted in expanded form over seven editions and twelve printing impressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Hanna, Bronwyn J.

{{Quotation|
For Kerr, "the seven deadly sins of heritage assessment were: the Timorous; the Inarticulate; the Aesthetes and Moralists; the Indiscriminate; the Egotists; the Slothful and the Muddled".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Kate|title=Obituary: Jim Kerr's heritage legacy forms guard of honour|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/obituary-jim-kerrs-heritage-legacy-forms-guard-of-honour-20141121-11r4nu.html|accessdate=22 November 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|issue=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Life and family==

Kerr was born on 6 July 1932 in Rockhampton, Queensland, son of grazier James Kerr and Iris (née Rudd), and he and his sisters were raised on Hampden Downs Station. Initially home schooled by his mother, he later attended Toowoomba Preparatory School and then King's School Parramatta. He joined the [[Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] in 1952, leaving in 1956. He became an accomplished oarsman in Queensland and later NSW state competitions, but missed out narrowly on selection for the 1956 Olympics.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;

Kerr married [[Joan Kerr|Joan Lyndon]] (1938–2004), an art and architectural historian, whom he had met in 1957. They wed on 30 November 1960 at [[All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane]], moving to Sydney soon after. Kerr was working in management at [[Qantas]] at the time. In 1963, Qantas posted Kerr to Geneva,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daao.org.au/bio/joan-kerr-2/biography/ Design &amp; Art Australia Online, 'Professor Joan Kerr' Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; and then to London, where Joan enrolled them both in a history of art course run by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] at [[Birkbeck College]]. They returned to Australia in 1968, settling in [[Cremorne, New South Wales|Cremorne]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/03/1078295446185.html?from=storyrhs 'Sparkling mind lit up the art world' Obituary Professor Joan Kerr, ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 4 March 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, a daughter, Tamsin and a son, James.

Kerr's wife Joan died in 2004, and James published "Joan Kerr, A Pictorial Biography, 1938–2004" in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Kerr, James Semple | author2=Torrance, Joan, 1867–1943 | title=Joan Kerr : a pictorial biography, 1938–2004 | publication-date=2006 | publisher=Cremorne, N.S.W. J.S. Kerr | isbn=978-0-9775454-0-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published letters from his son (also James Semple), who worked as an [[outback]] [[Stockman (Australia)|stockman]].&lt;ref&gt;Stockman's Progress: 1982–1989: Letters of James Semple Kerr (born 1963), to His Parents from the Northern Territory and The Kimberleys, James Semple Kerr, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerr died on Wednesday 15 October 2014 at Elizabeth Lodge nursing home, [[Willoughby, New South Wales]]. His final project had been to catalogue the works of his wife and of his own.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; His personal papers, along with those of his wife, and records of his family history have been deposited, in bound volumes, in the [[National Library of Australia]] in Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/e-news/australia-icomos-e-mail-news-no-654/#1. Australia ICOMOS E-Mail News No. 654 17 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

Kerr was made Honorary Life Member of the National Trust (NSW) in 1992 and was awarded the NSW National Trust Heritage Award with his wife Joan in 1995, and they received the lifetime achievement award in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/Assets/16074/1/TrustHeritageawardpastwinners.pdf  Professor Joan and Dr James Kerr for their outstanding contribution to heritage over many years Sydney Electricity National Trust Sponsor's Award]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was made an Honorary Life Member of Australia ICOMOS in 2003 and International Honorary Life Member in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.icomos.org/about-us/australia-icomos/honours-and-awards/ Australia ICOMOS &gt; About Us &gt; Australia ICOMOS &gt; Honours And Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also made a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] in 1999, "...for service to heritage conservation through organisations including the Australian International Council on Monuments And Sites, and The New South Wales Branch of the National Trust of Australia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=878243&amp;search_type=simple&amp;showInd=true Australian Honours Secretariat, Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6047">In [[statistics]], '''latent variables''' (from [[Latin]]: [[present participle]] of ''lateo'' (“lie hidden”), as opposed to [[observable variable]]s), are [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that are not directly observed but are rather [[Statistical inference|inferred]] (through a [[mathematical model]]) from other variables that are observed (directly measured). Mathematical models that aim to explain observed variables in terms of latent variables are called [[latent variable model]]s. Latent variable models are used in many disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[demography]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[physics]], [[machine learning]]/[[artificial intelligence]], [[bioinformatics]], [[natural language processing]], [[econometrics]], [[management]] and the [[social sciences]].

Sometimes latent variables correspond to aspects of physical reality, which could in principle be measured, but may not be for practical reasons. In this situation, the term '''hidden variables''' is commonly used (reflecting the fact that the variables are "really there", but hidden). Other times, latent variables correspond to abstract concepts, like categories, behavioral or mental states, or data structures. The terms '''hypothetical variables''' or '''hypothetical constructs''' may be used in these situations.

One advantage of using latent variables is that they can serve to [[Dimensionality reduction|reduce the dimensionality]] of data. A large number of observable variables can be aggregated in a model to represent an underlying concept, making it easier to understand the data. In this sense, they serve a function similar to that of scientific theories. At the same time, latent variables link observable ("[[sub-symbolic]]") data in the real world to symbolic data in the modeled world.

==Examples of latent variables==

===Psychology=== 

Latent variables, as created by factor analytic methods, generally represent "shared" variance, or the degree to which variables "move" together.   Variables that have no correlation cannot result in a latent construct based on the common [[Factor analysis|factor model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tabachnick |first1=B.G. |last2=Fidell |first2=L.S. |title=Using Multivariate Analysis |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-321-05677-9 }}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===

Examples of latent variables from the field of [[economics]] include [[quality of life]], business confidence, morale, happiness and conservatism: these are all variables which cannot be measured directly. But linking these latent variables to other, observable variables, the values of the latent variables can be inferred from measurements of the observable variables. Quality of life is a latent variable which cannot be measured directly so observable variables are used to infer quality of life. Observable variables to measure quality of life include wealth, employment, environment, physical and mental health, education, recreation and leisure time, and social belonging.

==Common methods for inferring latent variables==

* [[Hidden Markov model]]s
* [[Factor analysis]]
* [[Principal component analysis]]
* [[Partial least squares regression]]
* [[Latent semantic analysis]] and [[Probabilistic latent semantic analysis]]
* [[EM algorithm]]s

===Bayesian algorithms and methods===

[[Bayesian statistics]] is often used for inferring latent variables.

* [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation]]
* The [[Chinese Restaurant Process]] is often used to provide a prior distribution over assignments of objects to latent categories.
* The [[Indian buffet process]] is often used to provide a prior distribution over assignments of latent binary features to objects.

Within the field of [[rhetoric]], the contributions of female rhetoricians have often been overlooked. Anthologies comprising the history of rhetoric or rhetoricians often leave the impression there were none. Throughout history, however, there have been a significant number of women rhetoricians.

''Re∙Vision—the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering an old text from a new critical direction—is for women more than a chapter in cultural history: it is an act of survival.'' -Adrienne Rich

The following is a timeline of contributions made to the field of rhetoric by women.

==Before Common Era==

*[[Aspasia]] (c. 410 BC) was a [[Miletus|Milesian]] woman who was known and highly regarded  for her teaching of political theory and rhetoric. She is mentioned in [[Plato]]'s [[Memexenus]], and is often credited with teaching the [[Socratic method]] to [[Socrates]].

*[[Diotima of Mantinea]] (4th century BC) is an important character in Plato's [[Symposium]]. It is uncertain if she was a real person or perhaps a character modelled after Aspasia, for whom Plato had much respect.

==14th century==

*[[Julian of Norwich]](1343-1415) was an English [[mysticism|mystic]] who challenged the teachings of [[medieval]] [[Christianity]] in regard to women's inferior role in religion.
:*[[Revelations of Divine Love]]

*[[Catherine of Siena]] (1347-1380) was an Italian who was influential through her writings to men and women in authority, where she begged for peace in [[Italy]] and for the return of the [[papacy]] to [[Rome]]. She was [[canonized]] in 1461 by [[Pope Pius II]].
:*"Letter 83: To Mona Lapa, her mother, in Siena" (1376)

*[[Christine de Pizan]] (1365-1430) was a [[Venice|Venetian]] who moved to France at an early age. She was influential as a writer, rhetorician and critic during the medieval period, and was Europe's first female professional author.
:*[[The Book of the City of Ladies]] (1404)

*[[Margery Kempe]] (1373-1439) was a British woman who could neither read nor write, but dictated her life story ''The Book of Margery Kempe''after receiving a vision of Christ during the birth of the first of her fourteen children. From the 15th century Kempe was viewed as a holy woman after her book was published in pamphlet form with any thought or behavior that could be viewed as nonconforming or unorthodox removed. When the original was rediscovered in 1934, a more complex self-portrait emerged.
:*''[[The Book of Margery Kempe]]'' (1436)

==15th century==

*[[Laura Cereta]] (1469-1499) was an Italian [[Renaissance Humanism|humanist]] and [[feminist]] who was influential in the letters she wrote to other intellectuals.  Through her letters she fought for women's right to education and against the oppression of married women.
:*''Letter to Bibulus, Sempronius, Defense of the Liberal Instruction of Women" (1488)

==17th century==

*[[Margaret Fell]] (1614-1702) was a British founding member of the [[Religious Society of Friends]], and was popularly known as the "mother of Quakerism". She was persecuted and imprisoned for speaking her mind. She is credited with many essential changes within the Quaker church which brought more freedom for women in religious, social, and political areas.
:*Women's Speaking Justified, Proved and Allowed by the Scriptures'' (1666)

*[[Margaret Cavendish]], Duchess of Newcastle (c. 1623-1673) was a British novelist, playwright, philosopher, poet, and rhetorician. Recent critics—most notably Christine Sutherland and Jane Donawerth—have explored her rhetorical theory and practice. Key works in this vein include:
:*sections of ''The Worlds Olio'' (1655)
:*''Orations of Divers Sorts'' (1662)
:*''The Female Academy'' in ''Playes'' (1662)

*[[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]] (1651-1695) was a Mexican who entered a [[convent]] to dedicate her life to scholarship. She took part in the elite intellectual circles of her time, and many see her as the first feminist of the [[New World]]. She wrote poetry, essays, and religious treatises, and argued for a more [[holistic]] role for women in society.
:*''[[La Respuesta]]'' (1691)

*[[Mary Astell]] (1668-1731) is regarded by many as the first English feminist writer. In her anonymous publications, Astell vigorously supported equal education opportunities for women.
:*''[[A Serious Proposal to the Ladies]] (1694)
:*''[[A Serious Proposal to the Ladies, Part II]]'' (1697)
:*''[[Some Reflections Upon Marriage]]'' (1700)

==18th century==

*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was a British writer who wrote abundantly across the disciplines. In her brief writing career she advocated women's equality and argued against the male birthright as a necessity for political rights. Today, she is celebrated as an essential force in the history of feminism.
:*''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792)

==Nineteenth century==
*[[Susan B. Anthony]] (1820-1906)
:*''[[The United States of America v. Susan B. Anthony]]'' (1873)

*[[Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American [[journalist]], [[critic]] and [[women's rights]] activist, a contributor to the "first wave" of feminism in the US. Her idea of gender equality rested upon the transcendental notion of the universal one, the fact that female and male form a whole and require one another.
:*''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1845)

*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860-1935) was a prominent American author, artist, lecturer, and feminist social reformer. She is best known for her short story ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'', which she based on her own experience with mental illness and misguided medical treatment.
:*''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'' (1892)
:*''[[Women and Economics]]'' (1898)

*[[Sarah Moore Grimké|Sarah Grimke]] (1792-1873) was an American, who was influential in her work in the abolitionist movement during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and also for writings and lectures she made in support of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Since Grimke was prohibited from receiving formal education, she educated herself to become the oritor she had always wanted to be.  She also taught her personal slave to read even though it was against the law for her to do so. Grimke noted that fighting for abolition was as important as fighting for women's rights.
:*"[[Letter to Theodore Weld]]" (1837)

*[[Frances Harper]] (1825-1911)
:*''[[We Are All Bound Up Together]]'' (1866)

Stanton and [[Lucretia Mott]] were the primary organizers of the 1848 [[Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]]. Stanton drafted a "[[Declaration of Sentiments]]" for the convention, in which she declares that men and women are created equal. She also proposed a resolution demanding the right to vote be extended to include women. That resolution was voted upon at the convention and carried. Stanton went on to write many important documents and speeches of the women's rights movement.
:*''[[Declaration of Sentiments]]'' (1848)
:*''[[The Solitude of Self]]'' (1892)

*[[Maria W. Stewart]] (1803-1879) was an [[African American]] public speaker, [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], and [[feminist]]. Her speeches addressed the plight of Northern black people and drew arguments from the Scriptures. She became the first woman to speak in front of a mixed audience, both male and female, black and white.
:*"[[Lecture Delivered at the Franklin Hall]]" (1832)

*[[Sojourner Truth]] (1797-1883) was an American abolitionist. A former slave, she became an important rhetorical figure for the women's rights movement. Truth could neither read nor write, but had powerful oratory skills, which she used to challenge white Americans to live up to their own ideals.
:*''[[Ar'n't I a Woman?]]'' (1851)

*[[Ida B. Wells]] (1862-1931) was born into slavery,  researched and rallied campaigns against systematic [[lynching]] in the South at the end of the 1800s.

The '''Malaysian Physics Institute''' (''Institut Fizik Malaysia'' or '''IFM''') is the sole representative body for physicists and for those involved in the practice of [[physics]] or physics related work in [[Malaysia]].

==Objectives==
# promotion of the advancement of physics.
# promotion of activities that will bring together members to co-operate in the fields of education, training and practice of physics
# elevation of the professional status of physicist.

==History==
The need for a single body to represent the growing number of physicists in the country was felt by many since the early sixties. Although most physicists in the universities were member of the [[Institute of Physics|UK Institute of Physics]] (IOP), the majority of physicists, especially teachers and those in the research and service sectors, were not.
The first interim committee met in [[Kuala Lumpur]] in 1971. The Institute's constitution was later formally approved and IFM was thus established in 1973 with an initial membership of 35. Although the growth of the Institute was initially slow, by 2009 the number of members exceeded 1200, reflecting the continuing acceptance and support of the Institute by the country's physics community.

==Activities==
IFM organises conferences, seminars courses, workshops and meetings on issues which are not only of current interest to physicists, but also on issues which highlight the important role of physics in the country's development. The National Physics Symposium is held once every two years. Here physicists meet to discuss issues pertaining to the many areas of physics. International and regional meetings are also organised. Special courses are held from time to time, e.g. courses on microcomputers, lasers, plasmas, etc.

The Institute publishes a quarterly journal (''JURNAL FIZIK MALAYSIA'')[http://ifm.org.my/jurnal-fizik-malaysia] to report up-to-date research findings in physics. A newsletter, ''BERITA FIZIK'', is published quartely to report current and future activities of the Institute. A magazine, ''MAJALAH FIZIK'', is biannual and contains popular articles.

==Associations==
The IFM is a member and associate of multiple Associations:
* A member entity of the Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics (APCTP),
* A member of the Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies (AAPPS).
* A member of the Confederation of Scientific and Technological Associations in Malaysia (COSTAM).
* An associate member of the Asia Oceania Forum for Synchrotron Radiation Research

IFM also cooperates with most other physics institutes/organisations of other countries.

'''Marathon Reading''' is a yearly program put on by the [[UCLA]] department of [[English studies|English]], where a group of students, faculty, community members, [[alumni]], and often even [[celebrity|celebrities]] read a novel (or two) out loud non-stop for a 24-hour period.

Texas Tech University also hosts an annual marathon reading, coordinated by Dr. Rich Rice, Assistant Professor of English. Other higher-learning institutions that put on annual marathon readings include James Madison College at Michigan State University, Cleveland State University, Grand Valley State University, and Ball State University, Dr. Rice's doctoral alma mater.

The [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in Massachusetts hosts an annual nonstop reading aloud of [[Moby-Dick]], the novel by [[Herman Melville]]. Held each January since 1995, the event marks the anniversary of Melville’s 1841 departure from the Port of New Bedford and Fairhaven aboard the whale ship Acushnet. Hundreds attend the approximately 25-hour multimedia event, which is [[live-streamed]] on the Internet.

'''Military branch''' (also '''service branch''' or '''armed service''') is according to common standard the subdivision of the national [[armed forces]] of a sovereign nation or state.

==Branches==
===Classical branches===
In classical NATO terminology, the three basic environmental commands military branches are the [[Army]], [[Air Force]], and [[Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;''STANAG 2116: NATO Codes for Grades of Military Personnel.'' NATO. 13 March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Fleet 5 nations.jpg|&lt;center&gt;'''Navy'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Specialized branches ===
Countries which do not have access to any of the [[brown water]], [[green water]], [[blue water]] or any oceans generally do not have a national navy.

In some countries there might be other military branches. In addition to the above-mentioned military branches, examples are:

* In [[Argentina]] the [[Argentine National Gendarmerie|National Gendarmerie]] and the [[Argentine Naval Prefecture|Naval Prefecture]]
* In [[China]] the [[People's Liberation Army Rocket Force|Rocket Force]] and the [[People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force|Strategic Support Force]]
* In [[France]] the [[National Gendarmerie]] and the [[French National Guard|National Guard]]
* In [[Germany]] the [[Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service|Joint Medical Service]], the [[Streitkräftebasis|Joint Support Service]] and the [[Cyber and Information Space Command (Germany)|Cyber and Information Space Command]]
* In [[Italy]] the [[Carabinieri]]
* In [[Norway]] the [[Home Guard (Norway)|Home Guard]] and the [[Norwegian Cyber Defence Force|Cyber Defence Force]]
* In [[Poland]] the [[Polish Special Forces|Special Forces]]
* In [[Russia]] the [[Russian Airborne Troops|Airborne Troops]] and the [[Strategic Missile Troops]]
* In [[South Africa]] the [[South African Military Health Service|Military Health Service]] 
* In [[South Korea]] the [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]
* In [[Taiwan]] the [[Republic of China Military Police|Military Police]]
* In the [[United States]] the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Historical development ==
The military branches came into being in line with military technical progress and have been developed permanently. With that background, the air force was established early in the 20th century as one of the latest armed service.

The army is traditionally the oldest – and in many countries the biggest armed service.

=== Unified forces ===
The [[Canadian Armed Forces]] is the unified armed forces of Canada. While it has three environmental commands - namely [[Royal Canadian Navy]], [[Canadian Army]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] - it remains a single military service.

===NATO definition===
''Branch of service'' (also ''branch of military service'' or ''branch of armed service'') refers, according to NATO standards, to a branch, employment of combined forces or parts of a [[Military service|service]], below the level of service, military serviced or armed service.&lt;ref&gt;MILITÄRISCHES STUDIENGLOSAR ENGLISCH Teil I, A – K, Bundessprachenamt (Stand Januar 2001), page 226, definition: branch of service.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

===Dionysian ''imitatio''===
{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}
'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Taussig==
{{Further|Cultural appropriation|Appropriation (sociology)}}
In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1409">The '''National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard''' ('''NIMAS''') helps facilitate timely access to alternate formats of [[instructional materials]] for students with [[visual impairments]] or other [[print disabilities]]. NIMAS (pronounced NYE-mas) outlines a set of consistent and valid [[XML]]-based source files created by [[K-12]] [[curriculum]] [[publishers]] or other content producers. These well-structured source files can be used to create [[accessible]] specialized formats (i.e., [[braille]], audio, [[e-text]], [[large print]], etc.) of print instructional materials. The full set of files includes XML content files, a package file, [[image]]s, and a [[PDF]] file of the title page (or whichever page contains [[ISBN]] and [[copyright]] information).

In a significant step forward for students with disabilities, the [[U.S. Congress]] adopted NIMAS as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, a reauthorization of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]].

'''Neo-expressionism''' is a style of [[Late Modernism|late modernist]] or early-[[Postmodern art|postmodern]] painting and sculpture that emerged in the late 1970s. Neo-expressionists were sometimes called ''[[Transavantgarde]]'', ''[[Junge Wilde]]'' or ''Neue Wilden'' ('The new wild ones'; 'New Fauves' would better meet the meaning of the term). It is characterized by intense subjectivity and rough handling of materials.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-expressionism developed as a reaction against [[conceptual art]] and [[minimal art]] of the 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in an [[abstract art|abstract]] manner), in a rough and violently emotional way, often using vivid colors. It was overtly inspired by [[German Expressionist]] painters, such as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[James Ensor]] and [[Edvard Munch]]. It is also related to American [[Lyrical Abstraction]] painting of the 1960s and 1970s, [[The Hairy Who]] movement in Chicago, the [[Bay Area Figurative School]] of the 1950s and 1960s, the continuation of [[Abstract Expressionism]], New Image Painting and precedents in [[Pop art|Pop Painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503-504&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

Neo-expressionism dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. The style emerged internationally and was viewed by many  critics, such as [[Achille Bonito Oliva]] and [[Donald Kuspit]], as a revival of traditional themes of self-expression in European art after decades of American dominance. The social and economic value of the movement was hotly debated.

Critics such as [[Benjamin Buchloh]], [[Hal Foster (art critic)|Hal Foster]], [[Craig Owens (critic)|Craig Owens]], and [[Mira Schor]] were highly critical of its relation to the marketability of painting on the rapidly expanding art market, celebrity, the [[anti-feminism|backlash against feminism]], [[anti-intellectualism]], and a return to mythic subjects and individualist methods they deemed outmoded. Women were notoriously marginalized in the movement, and painters such as [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]] and [[Maria Lassnig]] were omitted from many of its key exhibitions, most notoriously the 1981 "New Spirit in Painting" exhibition in London which included 38 male painters but no female painters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21271">'''New Public Management''' (NPM) is an approach to running [[public service]] organizations that is used in government and public service institutions and agencies, at both sub-national and national levels. The term was first introduced by academics in the UK and Australia &lt;ref&gt;Hood 1991 and Hood and Jackson 1991&lt;/ref&gt; to describe approaches that were developed during the 1980s as part of an effort to make the public service more "businesslike" and to improve its efficiency by using private sector management models. As with the private sector, which focuses on "[[customer service]]", NPM reforms often focused on the "...centrality of citizens who were the recipient of the services or customers to the public sector." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPM reformers experimented with using decentralized service delivery models, to give local agencies more freedom in how they delivered programs or services. In some cases, NPM reforms that used [[e-government]] consolidated a program or service to a central location to reduce costs. Some governments tried using [[quasi-market]] structures, so that the public sector would have to compete against the private sector (notably in the UK, in [[health care]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key themes in NPM were "...financial control, value for money, increasing efficiency...,identifying and setting targets and continuance monitoring of performance, handing over.. power to the senior management" [[Senior management|executives]]. Performance was assessed with audits, benchmarks and performance evaluations. Some NPM reforms used private sector companies to deliver what were formerly public services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NPM advocates in some countries worked to remove "...collective agreements [in favour of]...individual rewards packages at senior levels combined with short term contracts" and introduce private sector-style [[corporate governance]], including using a [[Board of Directors]] approach to strategic guidance for public organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; While NPM approaches have been used in many countries around the world, NPM is particularly associated with the most industrialized [[OECD]] nations such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States of America]]. NPM advocates focus on using approaches from the private sector–the [[corporation|corporate]] or business world–which can be successfully applied in the public sector and in a [[public administration]] context. NPM approaches have been used to reform the public sector, its policies and its programs. NPM advocates claim that it is a more efficient and effective means of attaining the same outcome. 

In NPM, citizens are viewed as "customers" and public servants are viewed as public managers. NPM tries to realign the relationship between public service managers and their political superiors by making a parallel relationship between the two. Under NPM, public managers have incentive-based motivation such as pay-for-performance, and clear performance targets are often set, which are assessed by using [[performance evaluation]]s. As well, managers in an NPM paradigm may have greater discretion and freedom as to how they go about achieving the goals set for them. This NPM approach is contrasted with the traditional [[public administration]] model, in which institutional decision-making, policy-making and public service delivery is guided by regulations, legislation and [[administrative law|administrative procedures]]. 

NPM reforms use approaches such as disaggregation, customer satisfaction initiatives, [[customer service]] efforts, applying an [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial spirit]] to public service, and [[innovation|introducing innovations]]. The NPM system allows "the expert manager to have a greater discretion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance, and Public Administration|date=Feb 2, 2006|pages=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Public Managers under the New Public Management reforms can provide a range of choices from which customers can choose, including the right to opt out of the service delivery system completely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first practices of New Public Management emerged in the United Kingdom under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Thatcher played the functional role of “policy entrepreneur" and the official role of prime minister.{{fact|date=November 2016}} Thatcher drove changes in public management policy in such areas as organizational methods, civil service, labor relations, expenditure planning, financial management, audit, evaluation, and procurement. Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]], kept public management policy on the agenda of the Conservative government, leading to the implementation of the Next Steps Initiative. Major also launched the programs of the Citizens Charter Initiative, Competing for Quality, Resource Accounting and Budgeting, and the Private Finance Initiative.

A term was coined in the late 1980s to denote a new (or renewed) focus on the importance of management and ‘production engineering’ in public service delivery, which often linked to doctrines of economic rationalism (Hood 1989, Pollitt 1993). During this timeframe public management became an active area of policy-making in numerous other countries, notably in New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden.  At the same time, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ]] (OECD) established its Public Management Committee and Secretariat (PUMA), conferring to public management the status normally accorded more conventional domains of policy. In the 1990s, public management was a major item on President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]’s agenda. Early policy actions of the Clinton administration included launching the [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government|National Partnership]] and signing into law the [[Government Performance and Results Act]]. Currently there are few indications that public management issues will vanish from governmental policy agendas. A recent study showed that in Italy, municipal directors are aware of a public administration now being oriented toward new public management where they are assessed according to the results they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1093–1115|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term New Public Management (NPM) expresses the idea that the cumulative flow of policy decisions over the past twenty years has amounted to a substantial shift in the governance and management of the “state sector” in the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[North America]]. A benign interpretation is that these decisions have been a defensible, if imperfect, response to policy problems. Those problems as well as their solutions were formulated within the policy-making process. The agenda-setting process has been heavily influenced by electoral commitments to improve macro- economic performance and to contain growth in the public sector, as well as by a growing perception of public bureaucracies as being inefficient. The alternative-generation process has been heavily influenced by ideas coming from economics and from various quarters within the field of management.

== Globalization ==
Although the origins of NPM came from Westernized countries it expanded to a variety of other countries in the 1990s. Before the 1990s, NPM was largely associated to an idea utilized by developed countries that are particularly Anglo-Saxon. However the 1990s have seen countries in Africa, Asia and other countries looking into using this method. In Africa, downsizing and decrease of user fees have been widely introduced. These autonomous agencies within the public sectors have been established in these areas. Performance contracting became a common policy in crisis states worldwide. Contracting out of this magnitude can be used to do things such as waste management, cleaning, laundry, catering and road maintenance.

== Aspects  ==

NPM was accepted as the "gold standard for administrative reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management: Theory, Ideology, and Practice|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance and Public Administration|date=Jan 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s. The idea for using this method for government reform was that if the government guided private-sector principles were used rather than rigid hierarchical bureaucracy, it would work more efficiently. NPM promotes a shift from bureaucratic administration to business-like professional management. NPM was cited as the solution for management ills in various organizational context and policy making in education and health care reform.

The basic principles of NPM is can best be described when split into seven different aspects elaborated by Christopher Hood in 1991. Hood also invented the term NPM itself. &lt;ref&gt;in "A Public Management for all seasons?", Public Administration Review, Voæl 69, Spring1991 (3-19).&lt;/ref&gt; They are the following:

=== Management ===
Because of its belief in the importance and strength of privatizing government, it is critical to have an emphasis on management by engaging in hands-on methods. This theory allows leaders the freedom to manage freely and open up discretion.

=== Performance standards ===
Its important to maintain explicit standards and measures of performance in a workforce. Using this method promotes clarification of goals/intent, targets, and indicators for progression.

=== Output controls ===
The third point acknowledges the "shift from the use of input controls and bureaucratic procedures to rules relying on output controls measured by quantitive performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;Yamaoto, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect requires using performance based assessments when looking to outsource work to private companies/groups.

=== Decentralization ===
NPM advocates often shifted from a unified management system to a decentralized system in which managers gain flexibility and are not limited to agency restrictions.

=== Competition ===
This characteristic focuses on how NPM can promote competition in the public sector which could in turn lower cost, eliminate debate and possibly achieve a higher quality of progress/work through the term contacts. Competition can also be found when the government offers contracts to the private sectors and the contract is given in terms of the ability to deliver the service effectively, quality of the goods provided, hence this will increase competition because the other private sector which did not get the contract will make strides to improve the quality and ability thereby facilitating competition.

=== Private-sector management ===
This aspect focuses on the necessity to establish short-term labor contracts, develop corporate plans or [[business plan]]s, performance agreements and [[mission statement]]s. It also focuses on establishing a workplace in which public employees or contractors are aware of the goals and intention that agencies are trying to reach.

=== Cost reduction ===
The most effective one which has led to its ascent into global popularity, focuses on keeping cost low and efficiency high. "Doing more with less" &lt;ref&gt;Hood, 1991: 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;
moreover cost reduction stimulates efficiency and is one way which makes it different from the traditional approach of management&lt;ref&gt;Deffy, 1999:67-78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between public and private sectors ==
New Public Management draws practices from the private sector and uses them in the public sector of management. NPM reforms use market forces to hold the public sector accountable and the satisfaction of preferences as the measures of accountability.  In order for this system to proceed, certain conditions, such as the existence of competition, must exist and information about choices must be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms that promise to reinvent government by way of focusing on results and customer satisfaction as opposed to administrative and political processes fail to account for legislative self-interest. Institutions other than federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinvention would not even be announced, except perhaps on hallway bulletin boards.

== Issues ==

===Criticisms===
There are blurred lines between policymaking and providing services in the New Public Management system. Questions have been raised about the potential politicization of the public service, when executives are hired on contract under pay-for-performance systems.  There are concerns that public managers may move away from trying to meet citizens' needs. NPM brings to question integrity and compliance when dealing with incentives for public managers. Questions such as managers being more or less faithful arise. The public interest is at risk and could undermine the trust in government. Accountability can be a big issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relevance  ====

Although NPM had a dramatic impact in the 1990s on managing and policymaking, many scholars believe that NPM has hit its prime. Scholars like Frank Dunleavy believe New Public Management is phasing out because of disconnect with “customers” and their institutions. Scholars cite the Digital Era and the new importance of technology that kills the necessity of NPM. In countries that are less industrialized the NPM concept is still growing and spreading. This trend has much to do with a country's ability or inability to get their public sector in tune with the Digital Era. New Public Management was created in the Public Sector to create change based on: disaggregation, competition, and incentives. Using incentives to produce the maximum services from an organization is largely stalled in many countries and being reversed because of increased complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
Post-NPM, many countries explored [[digital era governance]] (DEG). Dunleavy believes this new way of governance should be heavily centered upon information and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology will help re-integrate with digitalization changes. Digital Era Governance provides a unique opportunity for self- sustainability however, there are various factors that will determine whether or not DEG can be implemented successfully. When countries have proper technology, NPM simply can't compete very well with DEG. DEG does an excellent job of making services more accurate, prompt and remove most barriers and conflicts. DEG also can improve the service quality and provide local access to outsourcers.

===Comparisons to New Public Administration===

New Public Management is often mistakingly compared to [[New Public Administration]]. The ‘New Public Administration’ movement was one established in the USA during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfiffner|first1=James|title=Public Administration versus The New Public Management|url=http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Book_Chapters/NewPublicMgt.doc.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there may be some common features, the central themes of the two movements are different. The main thrust of the New Public Administration movement was to bring academic public administration into line with a radical egalitarian agenda that was influential in US university campuses. By contrast, the emphasis of the New Public Management movement a decade or so later was firmly managerial in the sense that it stressed the difference that management could and should make the quality and efficiency of public services. It focuses on public service production functions and operational issues contrasted with the focus on public accountability, ‘model employer’ public service values, ‘due process,’ and what happens inside public organizations in conventional public administration. That meant New Public Management doctrines tended to be opposed to egalitarian ideas of managing without managers, juridical doctrines of rigidly rule-bound administration and doctrines of self-government by public-service professionals like teachers and doctors.

[[File:NouveauRealsime1960.jpg|thumb|The ''Nouveau Réalisme Manifesto'', signed by all of the original members in Yves Klein's apartment, 27 October 1960]]

'''Nouveau réalisme''' ('''new realism''') refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic [[Pierre Restany]]&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, ''Art of the 20th Century'', Taschen, 2000, p. 518. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the painter [[Yves Klein]] during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in [[Milan]].  Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the "Constitutive Declaration of New Realism," in April 1960, proclaiming, "Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real."&lt;ref name=Stremmel13&gt;Kerstin Stremmel, ''Realism'', Taschen, 2004, p. 13. {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s, [[Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.&lt;ref name=Stremmel13/&gt;

Contemporary of American [[pop art]], and often conceived as its transposition in France, new realism was, along with [[Fluxus]] and other groups, one of the numerous tendencies of the [[avant-garde]] in the 1960s. The group initially chose [[Nice (France)|Nice]], on the [[French Riviera]], as its home base since [[Yves Klein|Klein]] and [[Arman]] both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the {{Ill|École de Nice|fr}} movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary M. O'Neill, ''Art and Visual Culture on the French Riviera, 1956–1971: The Ecole de Nice'', Ashgate, 2012, p. 93. &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Hains-TravailleursCommunistes.jpg|thumb|left|''Travailleurs Communistes'' by Raymond Hains]]
The term "new realism" was first used in May 1960 by Pierre Restany, to describe the works of Omiros, Arman, François Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely and Jacques Villeglé as they exhibited their work in Milan. He had discussed this term before with Yves Klein (who died prematurely in 1962), who preferred the expression "today's realism" (''réalisme d'aujourd'hui'') and criticized the term "New". After the first "Manifesto of New Realism", a second manifesto, titled "40° above [[Dada]]" (''40° au-dessus de Dada'') was written between 17 May and 10 June 1961. [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]] (then practicing "shooting paintings") Omiros with his "free space" and [[Gérard Deschamps]] then joined the movement, followed by [[Christo]] in 1963. Klein, however, started to distance himself from the group around 1961, disliking Restany's insistence on a [[Dadaist]] heritage. 

The first exposition of the ''nouveaux réalistes'' took place in November 1960 at the Paris "''Festival d'avant-garde''".  This exposition was followed by others: in May 1961 at the Gallery J. in Paris; ''Premier Festival du Nouveau Réalisme'' in [[Nice, France|Nice]] from July til September 1961 at the Muratore Gallery and the Abbaye de Roseland; ''International Exhibition of the New Realists'', a survey of contemporary American [[pop art]] and the Nouveau Réalisme movement at the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]] in New York at the end of 1962; and at the Biennale of San Marino in 1963 (which would be the last collective show by the group). The movement had difficulty maintaining a cohesive program after the death of Yves Klein in June, 1962 and when Omiros abandonned it and decided to go in his own path experimenting with perspective and space.

==Ideas and techniques==
The members of the '''nouveaux réalistes''' group tended to see the world as an image from which they could take parts and incorporate them into their works—as they sought to bring life and art closer together. They declared that they had come together on the basis of a new and real awareness of their "collective singularity", meaning that they were together in spite of, or perhaps because of, their differences. But for all the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Pierre Restany, to a "poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality".&lt;ref&gt;60/90. ''Trente ans de Nouveau Réalisme, La Différence'', 1990, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the nouveaux réalistes advocated a return to "reality" in opposition to the lyricism of [[abstract painting]]. They also wanted to avoid what they saw as the traps of figurative art, which was seen as either [[petty-bourgeois]] or as Stalinist [[socialist realism]]. Hence the Nouveau Réalistes used exterior objects to give an account of the reality of their time. They were the inventor of the ''[[décollage]]'' technique (the opposite of collages), in particular through the use of lacerated posters—a technique mastered by François Dufrene, Jacques Villeglé, Mimmo Rotella and Raymond Hains. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously.

Nouveau réalistes made extensive use of [[collage]] and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], using real objects incorporated directly into the work and acknowledging a debt to the [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]] of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. But the New Realism movement has often been compared to the pop art movement in New York for their use and critique of mass-produced commercial objects ([[Jacques de la Villeglé|Villeglé]]'s ripped cinema posters, [[Arman]]'s collections of detritus and trash), although Nouveau Réalisme maintained closer ties with Dada than with pop art.

==The new realists in architecture==
"The new realists" is also a term applied to a group of Australian architects determined to create a "New Realism" in architecture, based on the understanding of past developments in the discipline of architecture and modern day explorations of new technologies in the fields of design and building technology.

==Analyse critique==
Les artistes reprennent les objets de la société pour en faire des reliques, des symboles puissants de la consommation.

Exemple : Les compressions de César qui mettent en scène des automobiles, le but étant de transformer un objet culte de notre société et d’en faire quelque chose d'autre, à travers ses formes géométriques, l’œuvre sent la conception par l’intermédiaire d’une machine, c’est la disparition de l’habileté manuelle qui était à l’époque un facteur important dans la reconnaissance de la valeur d’un artiste.

On constate également la disparition du matériau noble, les nouveaux réalistes n’utilisent plus de bronze, de pierre, mais de la tôle ou du ciment, des matériaux industriels.

:« L’école niçoise veut nous apprendre la beauté du quotidien. Faire du consommateur un producteur d’art. Une fois qu'un être s'est intégré dans cette vision, il est très riche, pour toujours. Ces artistes veulent s'approprier le monde pour vous le donner. A vous de les accueillir ou de les rejeter. »&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Restany, ''Avec le nouveau réalisme, sur l’autre face de l’art'', Nîmes, Éditions Jacqueline Chambrons, 2000, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

===L'objet comme matériau===
L’accumulation d’Arman, est un agglomérat de voitures de marque [[Renault (Groupe)|Renault]], chez qui il est directement allé travailler pour trouver sa matière première.

Son œuvre n’a pas d’utilité particulière mais il veut surtout le mouvement et la couleur, on ne retient plus que les effets plastiques.

Le matériel n’est pas détourné, il est utilisé pour travailler un mouvement et devient matériau.
Une autre manière de transformer un matériel en matériau selon César, c’est sa mousse de polyuréthane, c’est un matériau presque vivant qui échappe au contrôle de l’artiste, la matière se fixe ses propres limites, et l’œuvre devient indépendante du projet plastique.

Gérard Deschamps, lui, assemble des chiffons, des sous-vêtements feminins (ce qui lui vaudra d'être censuré à de nombreuses reprises) ou expose des bâches de signalisation de l'armée américaine, des plaques de blindage, des tôles irisées par la chaleur, des patchworks, des ballons dans des boîtes en plexiglas ou dans des filets, des skateboards, des « pneumostructures » faites de bouées ou de matelas pneumatiques..et des voiles de planches....a voiles.

===L’objet comme rebut===
L’œuvre de Daniel Spoerri rend compte de la société de consommation qui mange, il se sert dans les poubelles de ses voisins, de ses congénères. Il s’agit du détournement d’un moment important de la journée, qui est figé et réinvesti dans l’art. La résine est affichée contre le mur comme une toile.

Il a la volonté de fixer le temps d’un moment sensé être agréable alors que la société veut de plus en plus nous le marchandiser, et nous presser. Le repas n’est plus le moment convivial qu’il était avant, il devient la nouvelle cible des grosses sociétés de consommation, on se retrouve presque dans une succursale d’une enseigne de la restauration rapide alors que l’on est chez soi. Faire vite, faire simple, peu importe que ce soit vraiment bon. Il faut faire vite, se nourrir, manger, boulimiquement, pour se remplir, Spoerri met ici l’accent sur la nécessité d’un retour aux sources, et d’une société de consommation qui influencerait moins de ses codes, et qui submergerait moins de ses produits, la société actuelle.

Renvoyant à l'univers de la [[publicité]] et de la [[société de consommation]], les [[affiche]]s, décollées, superposées, lacérées, inspirent Jacques Villeglé, Raymond Hains et François Dufrêne ainsi que Mimmo Rotella, qui suit un itinéraire parallèle mais distinct.

===Les « Actions-spectacles »===
Il s'agit de ce qu'on appelera plus tard des "performances" où l'œuvre d'art se construit (ou se détruit) devant le public. L'un des exemples les plus connus sont les ''anthropométries'' d'Yves Klein où ce dernier enduit de jeunes femmes dénudées de peinture et leur commande de se rouler sur une toile blanche, crant ainsi la trace visuelle de leurs mouvements.--&gt;

The '''Ogilvie Professor of Human Geography''' is the name for the occupant of the '''Ogilvie Chair of Geography''' at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. It is named in honour of [[Alan Grant Ogilvie]] [[FRSE]] (1887-1954), the first professor (1931) of their Department of Geography and an important figure in the early years of the Department of Geography at Edinburgh, who had died in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/geography/centenary/ |title=A Short History of Geography in Edinburgh |website=www.geos.ed.ac.uk |publisher= [[University of Edinburgh]] |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Old Powder Mills''' was a former research centre of GSK in [[Kent]].

==History==
In 1949 the site became a pharmaceutical manufacturing factory, when [[Menley &amp; James]] bought the site, who were owned by [[Smith, Kline &amp; French]]. In 1952 the site became wholly owned by Smith, Kline &amp; French (SK&amp;F), running under the name Bridge Chemicals. SK&amp;F was based in [[Welwyn Garden City]], and the site ran under Smith Kline &amp; French Research, or SK&amp;F Research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BtDxhCDDvUUC&amp;pg=PA629&amp;dq=%22Powder+Mills%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi914aR8KzNAhUKKMAKHYJPD0wQ6AEINTAF New Scientist September 1981]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the site became part of SmithKline Beecham.

By around 2000, when GSK was formed, around 300 people worked on the site.

===Closure===
GSK left the site in 2010, after announcing the closure of the site in February 2010.

==Structure==
It was situated in the west of Kent, off the [[A21 road (England)|A21]], north of the [[River Medway]], south of [[Hildenborough]]. There was around 155,000 sq ft of laboratories and office buildings. The north part of the site contained office buildings, and the South part of the site only contained laboratories.

The [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of [[Optical disc|optical media]] is essential because it is a resource in libraries, and stores audio, video, and computer data to be accessed by patrons. While optical discs are generally more reliable and durable than older media types, (magnetic tape, LPs and other records) environmental conditions and/or poor handling can result in lost information. This article will introduce the different types of optical media discs and offer a discussion of strategies for preservation of these materials.&lt;ref&gt;Pohlmann, K. C. (1992). ''The compact disc handbook''. Madison, Wisconsin: A-R Editions INC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of media==
The two broad types of optical discs are [[Compact Disc]]s (CDs) and [[DVD]]s. Data is retrieved by both CDs and DVDs by devices that focus a laser light beam against the reflective layer allowing data to be read. The data layer, supported by the [[polycarbonate]] substrate can be metallic or dye-based, depending on the disc type.

The reflective and data layers of CDs are just below the label and a thin sheet of polycarbonate substrate. A much thicker layer of the substrate supports and protects the bottom of the disc. The reflective and data layers of double-sided DVDs are in the center of the disc structure, housed between two equal layers of polycarbonate substrate. Because the data layer of CDs is more exposed than double-sided DVDs, a thin lacquer layer is used to protect the surface of the CD. The top of a CD is delicate and fragile; the bottom is merely a transparent protective covering.&lt;ref name="Bennett"&gt;Bennett, H. (2003). [http://www.osta.org/technology/cdqa12.htm Understanding CD-R and CD-RW.] Cupertino California: Optical Storage Technology Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

For preservation purposes: Gold CD-R (Compatible Disc-Recordable) and DVD-R (Digital Video Disc-Recordable or Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable) discs are preferred by experts over aluminium and silver for reliable long-term backup storage—the reflective layer of the optical disc is gold.

Permanent and long-term storage are distinct. “[D]igital archiving experts commonly acknowledge that no carrier is permanent. Instead, one must maintain data transferred to storage and provide access and ensure integrity of the information for the long-term.” As technology changes data can be migrated from an older to a newer type of media to avoid media failure or “format obsolescence”—a real threat for technology when it is no longer supported. If the machine required to play and read the discs is not kept in working order and maintained, data loss may result.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Kevin. (2006) [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001477/147782E.pdf ''Memory of the World Programme: Sub-Committee on Technology: Risks Associated with the Use of Recordable CDs and DVDs as Reliable Storage Media in Archival Collections–Strategies and Alternatives'']. pp. 3–4. Paris: UNESCO. Accessed on October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Risks involved with optical media are covered below.

Issues which affect data longevity of nominally archival-grade discs include the following: dye failure (discs with premium organic and pthalocyanine-based long-life dyes are more suitable); bonding failure (premium bonding agents and edge-to-edge coverage improve longevity); scratches,minimised by careful handling and a scratch-resistant coating; production quality (some factories have better quality control standards, and discs from a batch known to be good may be more reliable than another batch).&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Ronald W. (December 6, 2006) [''Document on Using CD’s and DVD’s for Long Term Storage.''] Online posting. The Archives &amp; Archivists (A&amp;A) List. Accessed on October 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Testing is required since conditions vary from machine to machine and from disc to disc; environmental control is required to prevent damaging conditions. When these conditions are met it is believed that the life of an archival-quality CD-R or DVD-R can be as long as 100 years, compared to the typical five to ten years for non-archival quality optical discs. The [[ISO 9660]] standard specifies a stable room temperature of 18 - 23&amp;nbsp;°C (64-73&amp;nbsp;°F) with relative humidity of 30% to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;The University of the State of New York. ''Guidelines for Ensuring the Long-Term Accessibility and Usability of Records Stored as Digital Images: Government Records Technical Information Series''. p. 5. Albany: University of the State of New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping multiple copies of discs is necessary for added protection. “One Master, stored under optimal conditions, one Working copy to be used for access purposes or copying, and one Safety copy to be stored at a different location.”&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Kevin. (2006) [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001477/147782E.pdf ''Memory of the World Programme: Sub-Committee on Technology: Risks Associated with the Use of Recordable CDs and DVDs as Reliable Storage Media in Archival Collections–Strategies and Alternatives'']. p. 11. Paris: UNESCO. Accessed on October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Institute of Conservation]] the container most suitable for storage is a rigid high-quality case made from inert polyester placed vertically.&lt;ref&gt;ICON Conservation Register. (2006) [http://www.conservationregister.com/caring.asp?id=4 ''Caring for Digital and Electronic Media''] Accessed on October 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is still speculation on how reliable optical media is. There are no accepted standards for blank discs and recording devices, so acceptable performance cannot be relied upon.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Kevin. (2006) [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001477/147782E.pdf ''Memory of the World Programme: Sub-Committee on Technology: Risks Associated with the Use of Recordable CDs and DVDs as Reliable Storage Media in Archival Collections–Strategies and Alternatives'']. pp. 6–7. Paris: UNESCO. Accessed on October 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The longevity of rewritable formats—CD-RW, DVD-RAM, DVD-RW and DVD+RW—is less well known; they are also susceptible to accidental overwriting.

==Optical disc types==
[[CD-ROM]]s/[[DVD-ROM]]s (read-only-memory) are commercial grade discs and use a metallic data layer created using a molding machine that stamps pits (depressions) and lands (flat surfaces) into a polycarbonate substrate base. The metal layer is then applied to the base, creating the data layer. While aluminium is most frequently used, it can potentially oxidize and lose data, a process sometimes called "[[disk rot]]". For archival discs, silver or gold layers are preferred because of longer life expectancies and better reflectivity.
DVD-ROMs can also support a double layer of data, using two metal layers, one semi-reflective and the other fully reflective. Laser light beams can read the two layers separately. If both sides of a DVD are used, double-layer technology provides four data layers.

[[CD-R]]s/[[DVD-R]]s (recordable) are recordable, write-once discs which use [[photosensitive]] organic dye just below the reflective layer; the dye undergoes a chemical change when exposed to specific laser light beams, creating bits (marks) containing data.

Dyes used in DVD-Rs and CD-Rs include [[Phthalocyanine]] (greenish) [[Cyanine]] (blue) and [[Azo compound|Azo]] (dark blue). Silver, silver alloys and gold are used as reflective layers on recordable CDs and DVDs. Both gold and silver will outlast the organic dyes, which will decay over time. Aluminium is not used because it may cause reactions with the dyes.

[[CD-RW]]/[[DVD-RW]]s (rewritable) are recordable, erasable and re-recordable discs that use a [[phase changing film]] data layer that reacts to heat. Laser light beams melt bits into the film to create data. These bits can be erased and re-recorded by adjusting the temperature of the laser. Rewritable CDs and DVDs usually use aluminium reflective layers, because the phase changing film degrades faster than aluminium [[oxidize]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/contents.html Byers, F. (2003). Care and handling of CDs and DVDs: A guide for librarians and archivists.] Council on Library and Information Resources and National Institute of Standards and Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Blu-ray Disc]]s/[[HD DVD]]s represent a new generation of optical media. Both disc types use unique blue-violet laser beams to read data, and are not compatible with equipment for other formats. Blu-ray Discs and HD DVDs are incompatible, and were engaged in a [[format war]] until Toshiba announced its discontinuation of the HD DVD format on February 19. 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Toshiba Corporation (2008). [http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm ''Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses''] Accessed on July 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of HD DVDs is similar to normal DVDs, with the data layer protected by layers of substrate on each side. The structure of Blu-ray discs is more similar to CDs, with the information stored directly beneath the surface. Early Blu-ray discs were easily damaged, but a protective layer that made them less delicate was developed.

==Damage to optical discs==
Optical discs are not subject to wear as they are read without mechanical contact with the surface, but are susceptible to scratches from handling. The risk of scratching is minimised by handling discs only by their edges and the center hole or hub.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. (2002). [https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/record.html Cylinder, disc and tape care in a nutshell.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Machines used to read discs can damage them if mechanically faulty.

===Scratches===
====Scratches on the laser-reading side of an optical disc====
Data recorded on discs has [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]], so that [[error detection and correction]] can compensate for some degree of damage.
The depth and width of scratches as well as the direction in which scratches on the bottom run all determine whether or not the data on the optical disc will be readable. Small scratches on the substrate generally have no effect on the readability of a disc as the laser is reading through the substrate to the data layer. If a scratch is deep or wide enough to affect laser focus, error correction is usually possible, but scratches can be too deep and wide or too close together for error correction to be successful. If a scratch runs along a track or is deep enough to scratch the data layer, data may be lost.

====Scratches on the top of an optical disc====
Because a CD's reflective metal layer and data layer are both directly beneath the thin lacquer surface of the label, data can be destroyed by even a small scratch on the top of a CD. The instrument used to label CDs should be seriously considered. Pens or markers with hard tips, or with solvents that can affect the protective layers, can scratch or damage the data layer; water-based felt-tip pens are safest.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; The data layer of a double-sided DVD is in the middle of the disc, surrounded by the substrate on both sides so scratches to either side are equivalent.

===Environmental considerations===
Optical discs can be damaged by exposure to extreme temperatures; direct sunlight may overheat the disc or damage the data layer with [[UV ray]]s{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. Exposure to heat and light have different effects on discs with data and metal layers of different composition. In all optical discs high temperatures can cause the substrate to soften and the disc to warp. Ambient heat, heat build-up, and light do little to damage the data layer of a ROM disc as it is made of aluminium; the only known problem occurring with the prolonged exposure of ROM discs to light is "clouding" or "coloring" of the polycarbonate substrate. CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R, CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW and DVD-RAM discs are all affected by exposure to ambient heat as well as heat build-up due to direct sunlight. A CD-R’s data layer is made of dye that degrades at high temperatures, becoming less transparent so that pits and lands are read incorrectly, making the data unreadable. UV rays in sunlight are energetic enough to produce a [[photochemical reaction]] that changes the optical properties of the dye.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; RW and RAM discs' data layers are composed of a phase-changing film that is even more sensitive to heat than the dye found in R discs, so that they degrade even faster when subjected to ambient heat or direct sunlight. The phase-changing film in RW and RAM discs is not light-sensitive, and UV rays do not affect the optical properties of the film. After being exposed to freezing temperatures a disc’s separate layers may warm at different speeds, causing separation of the layers. If heated or cooled significantly a disc should be allowed to return to room temperature before use.

The polycarbonate substrate of discs exposed to high humidity or immersion may absorb some water, and should be allowed to dry out in a less humid environment before being used. After drying discs should be usable unless minerals left behind from the water react with the components of the disc, damaging the layers and making it unreadable, as sometimes happens.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt;

==Cleaning of optical discs ==
Optical media discs often require professional preventative or routine cleaning to ensure data accuracy and accessibility; those with no professional experience may scratch the disc surface in their attempt to clean the disc. Build up of dust and oily contaminants on the disc surface, and fingerprints can typically impede the laser beam’s ability to penetrate the substrate to read the data layer, and more often impede writing. Minor interferences with reading is handled by error correction technology. If an audio CD (with a much lower accuracy threshold than a data disc) becomes dirty, it can be cleaned safely with a dry, soft lint-free cloth, holding the disc by the edges or by the center hole. Light dirt that is not removed by this method can be removed with a cloth dampened with water or a suitable optical disc-cleaning fluid. It has been advised that excess dust be blown off an optical disc before reading, to avoid buildup of dust in the reader, particularly on the laser.&lt;ref name="Henderson"&gt;Henderson, K. L., &amp; Henderson, W. T. (1991). ''Conserving and preserving materials in nonbook formats''. Urbana-Champaign, Illinois: University of Illinois&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage of optical discs==
Individual storage containers protect optical discs from scratches and dust. It has been recommended that discs be stored vertically, if possible in a cabinet or drawer less susceptible to changes in temperature or humidity. For long-term storage it has been advised that any paper inside the case—liner, booklet—be removed to minimise the collection and retention of moisture inside the case.&lt;ref name="Henderson"/&gt;

==Repair and reclamation of data from optical discs==
If scratches on the laser-reading side of an optical disc prevent it from being read, it may be possible to recover all or most of the content once, and transfer it to another storage medium. There are software packages that analyse data on a damaged storage medium and can recover some or all otherwise inaccessible information.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt; Commercial companies offer data recovery services.

Also, the disc itself can be repaired. There are various machines that will repair discs by polishing, buffing or grinding the playable surface. Usually the disc will appear like new and most importantly the data can once again be read by the laser. Some game shops, pawnbrokers and supermarkets provide a disc repair service. However, since this is an ablative process in which a layer of the substrate is removed, it is only safe to do a few times before risking the loss of the whole disc.

[[File:codex ephremi.jpg|thumb|350px|The ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'', a Greek manuscript of the Bible from the 5th century, is a palimpsest.]]

In [[textual studies]], a '''palimpsest''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|l|ɪ|m|p|s|ɛ|s|t}}) is a [[manuscript]] page, either from a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]] or a [[book]], from which the text has been scraped or washed off so that the page can be reused for another document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=California|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parchment#History|Pergamene]] (now known as [[parchment]]) was made of lamb, calf, or goat kid skin (best made in ancient [[Pergamon]]) and was expensive and not readily available, so in the interest of economy a pergamene often was re-used by scraping the previous writing. In colloquial usage, the term ''palimpsest'' is also used in [[architecture]], [[archaeology]], and [[geomorphology]] to denote an object made or worked upon for one purpose and later reused for another, for example a [[monumental brass]] the reverse blank side of which has been re-engraved.

== Etymology ==

The word "palimpsest" derives from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:palimpsestus#Latin|palimpsestus]]'', which derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:en:παλίμψηστος#Ancient Greek|παλίμψηστος]] (''palímpsēstos'', "again scraped"), a compound word that literally means "scraped clean and ready to be used again". The Ancient Greeks used wax-coated tablets, like scratch-pads, to write on with a stylus, and to erase the writing by smoothing the wax surface and writing again. This practice was adopted by [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]], who wrote (literally scratched on letters) on [[Wax tablet|wax-coated tablets]], which were reuseable; [[Cicero]]'s use of the term "palimpsest" confirms such a practice.

== Development ==
[[File:Georgian paliphsest V-VI cc.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Georgian language|Georgian]] palimpsest from the 5th or 6th century]]

Because [[parchment]] prepared from animal hides is far more durable than [[paper]] or [[papyrus]], most palimpsests known to modern scholars are parchment, which rose in popularity in [[Western Europe]] after the 6th century. Where papyrus was in common use, reuse of writing media was less common because papyrus was cheaper and more expendable than costly parchment. Some papyrus palimpsests do survive, and Romans referred to this custom of washing papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Suetonius]], [[Augustus]], "though he began a tragedy with great zest, becoming dissatisfied with the style, he obliterated the whole; and his friends saying to him, What is your Ajax doing? He answered, My Ajax met with a sponge." (''Augustus'', 85). Cf. a letter of the future emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] to his friend and teacher [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]] (''ad M. Caesarem'', 4.5), in which the former, dissatisfied with a piece of his own writing, facetiously exclaims that he will "consecrate it to water (''lymphis'') or fire (''Volcano'')," i.e. that he will rub out or burn what he has written.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing was washed from parchment or [[vellum]] using milk and [[oat bran]]. With the passing of time, the faint remains of the former writing would reappear enough so that scholars can discern the text (called the ''scriptio inferior'', the "underwriting") and decipher it. In the later [[Middle Ages]] the surface of the vellum was usually scraped away with powdered [[pumice]], irretrievably losing the writing, hence the most valuable palimpsests are those that were overwritten in the early Middle Ages.

Medieval [[codex|codices]] are constructed in "gathers" which are folded (compare "[[wikt:folio|folio]]", "leaf, page" [[ablative case]] of [[Latin]] folium), then stacked together like a newspaper and sewn together at the fold. Prepared parchment sheets retained their original central fold, so each was ordinarily cut in half, making a [[quarto]] volume of the original folio, with the overwritten text running perpendicular to the effaced text.

== Modern decipherment ==
Faint legible remains were read by eye before 20th-century techniques helped make lost texts readable. To read palimpsests, scholars of the 19th century used chemical means that were sometimes very destructive, using [[tincture]] of [[gall]] or, later, [[ammonium bisulfate]]. Modern methods of reading palimpsests using [[ultraviolet]] light and photography are less damaging.

Innovative [[Digitization|digitized images]] aid scholars in deciphering unreadable palimpsests. Superexposed photographs exposed in various light spectra, a technique called "multispectral filming", can increase the contrast of faded ink on parchment that is too indistinct to be read by eye in normal light. For example, [[multispectral imaging]] undertaken by researchers at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] recovered much of the undertext (estimated to be more than 80%) from the ''[[Archimedes Palimpsest]]''. At the [[Walters Art Museum]] where the palimpsest is now conserved, the project has focused on experimental techniques to retrieve the remaining text, some of which was obscured by overpainted icons. One of the most successful techniques for reading through the paint proved to be [[X-ray]] [[fluorescence]] imaging, through which the iron in the ink is revealed. A team of imaging scientists and scholars from the United States and Europe is currently using spectral imaging techniques developed for imaging the ''Archimedes Palimpsest'' to study more than one hundred palimpsests in the library of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="imaging"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/in-the-sinai-a-global-team-is-revolutionizing-the-preservation-of-ancient-manuscripts/2012/08/30/1c203ef4-ca1f-11e1-aea8-34e2e47d1571_story.html|title=In the Sinai, a global team is revolutionizing the preservation of ancient manuscripts|publisher=Washington POST Magazine|date= September 8, 2012|accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery ==

A number of ancient works have survived only as palimpsests.&lt;ref&gt;The most accessible overviews of the transmission of texts through the cultural bottleneck are Leighton D. Reynolds (editor), in ''Texts and Transmission: A Survey of the Latin Classics'', where the texts that survived, fortuitously, ''only'' in palimpsest may be enumerated, and in his general introduction to textual transmission, ''Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature'' (with N.G. Wilson).&lt;/ref&gt; Vellum manuscripts were over-written on purpose mostly due to the dearth or cost of the material. In the case of Greek manuscripts, the consumption of old [[codex|codices]] for the sake of the material was so great that a synodal decree of the year 691 forbade the destruction of manuscripts of the [[Scriptures]] or the [[church father]]s, except for imperfect or injured volumes. Such a decree put added pressure on retrieving the vellum on which secular manuscripts were written. The decline of the vellum trade with the introduction of paper exacerbated the scarcity, increasing pressure to reuse material.

Cultural considerations also motivated the creation of palimpsests. The demand for new texts might outstrip the availability of parchment in some centers, yet the existence of cleaned parchment that was never overwritten suggests that there was also a spiritual motivation, to sanctify pagan text by overlaying it with the word of God, somewhat as pagan sites were overlaid with Christian churches to hallow pagan ground. Or the pagan texts may have merely appeared irrelevant.

Texts most susceptible to being overwritten included obsolete legal and liturgical ones, sometimes of intense interest to the historian. Early Latin translations of Scripture were rendered obsolete by Jerome's [[Vulgate]]. Texts might be in foreign languages or written in unfamiliar scripts that had become illegible over time. The codices themselves might be already damaged or incomplete. [[Christian heresy|Heretical]] texts were dangerous to harbor—there were compelling political and religious reasons to destroy texts viewed as heresy, and to reuse the media was less wasteful than simply to burn the books.

Vast destruction of the broad [[quarto]]s of the early centuries took place in the period which followed the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], but palimpsests were also created as new texts were required during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The most valuable [[Latin]] palimpsests are found in the codices which were remade from the early large folios in the 7th to the 9th centuries. It has been noticed that no entire work is generally found in any instance in the original text of a palimpsest, but that portions of many works have been taken to make up a single volume. An exception is the ''Archimedes Palimpsest'' (see below). On the whole, early medieval scribes were thus not indiscriminate in supplying themselves with material from any old volumes that happened to be at hand.

'''Parliamentary informatics''' is the application of information technology to the documentation of legislative activity. The principal areas of concern are the provision, in a form conveniently readable to humans or machines, of information and statistics about:

* individual legislators
* particular legislative proposals
* votes thereon
* text of legislation

Parliamentary informatics is carried on both by officials of legislatures and by private for-profit and non-profit actors, with motivations ranging from the administration of parliaments to lobbying and facilitating democratic discourse.

The division of activities between official and unofficial activity differs widely between polities, even within a single country. There exists substantial overlap with disciplines such as [[psephology]] and, as far as the text of successfully enacted legislation is concerned, [[legal informatics]] in general.

The use of parliamentary informatics is also a rapidly growing trend in parliamentary monitoring. In a September 2011, joint report from the [[National Democratic Institute]] and [[World Bank Institute]], a survey of parliamentary monitoring organisations (PMOs) found that parliamentary informatics are used by approximately 40 percent of PMOs worldwide. The report states, "These tools can automatically aggregate and organize information from parliamentary websites and other information sources, generate visualizations (such as political finance maps), and create new platforms for citizens to interact with MPs or participate in parliamentary monitoring and policy analysis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndi.org/files/governance-parliamentary-monitoring-organizations-survey-september-2011.pdf] ''Strengthening Parliamentary Accountability, Citizen Engagement and Access to Information: A Global Survey of Parliamentary Monitoring Organizations'', National Democratic Institute and World Bank Institute. Accessed 14 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==

Access to parliamentary information is the most significant issue in parliamentary informatics; access may be inhibited technologically through the provision of parliamentary information in a form not amenable to processing by machines, or legally, by copyright or other protection of the parliamentary record.

Ultimately, it may be possible to provide citizens with a comprehensive overview of all the legislation going through parliaments everywhere in the world, which would allow the tracking of the implementation of international treaties and of general legislative trends.

In a September 2011 report from the [[National Democratic Institute]] and [[World Bank Institute]] on parliamentary monitoring organisations, open data is cited as a fundamental issue for further development. The report explains, "While they have proven effective in many instances, the most useful informatics tools require the availability of parliamentary data in machine-readable or "open data" formats, which remains a challenge in many contexts."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Albania ===
Une Votoj (in English, "I vote") is a website that provides information about the Parliament of [[Albania]]. The site structures Parliamentary plenary and committee sessions and agendas, and summaries of the proceedings. It also provides biographical notes about elected members, attendance and voting records. It was established in 2005, and is presently run by [[Mjaft!]], an Albanian non-governmental civil society movement.

=== Australia ===
OpenAustralia.org is a community-funded site which was launched in June 2008 and automatically collects and publishes in an easy-to-read format the transcripts of all [[Australian Government]] House of Representatives and Senate debates, questions, discussions and notices. OpenAustralia.org also made available the Register of Senators' and Members' Interests online for the first time ever in Australia. The site was developed in Australia by the [[OpenAustralia Foundation]], adapted from the UK site [[TheyWorkForYou]] built by [[mySociety]]. The site allows comment and discussion against debates and allows users to track the level of participation of Member of the House in debates, including statistics on their appearances in the House – so citizens can keep track of their representatives and be fully informed and involved with their Member's performance in the House. Within weeks of being launched OpenAustralia attracted a lot of attention and positive feedback from both the public and government and is set to pave the way for closer working relationships between government and citizens.

The OpenAustralia Foundation also produces [https://theyvoteforyou.org.au They Vote For You], a website which tracks how every MP voted on every division in the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]].

=== Africa ===
"Africa i-Parliaments" is the portal of the regional initiatives of the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (UNDESA) aimed at strengthening the role of African Parliaments in fostering democracy and good governance by developing common information services and tools, and building information management capabilities with the objective of making Parliaments i-nterconnected, i-nformed i-ndependent, or in short, i-Parliaments.
 
The project includes two main initiatives:

Akoma Ntoso (Architecture for Knowledge-Oriented Management of African Normative Texts using Open Standards and Ontologies) proposes an XML document schema providing sophisticated description possibilities for several Parliamentary document types (including bills, acts and parliamentary records, etc.). It aims to standardise simple, technology-neutral representations of Parliamentary Documents to improve inter-Parliamentary co-operation and reduce the costs of Parliamentary IT support systems. Akoma Ntoso defines a set of recommendations and guidelines for e-Parliament services in a Pan-African context and provides an enabling framework for the effective exchange of machine readable Parliamentary Documents such as legislation, debate record, minutes, etc. The work will provide the basis for the [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] [[Legal XML]] LegalDocumentML project.&lt;ref name=oasis-akoma-ntoso/&gt;

Bungeni – Parliamentary Information System is an end-to-end suite of applications that provides a world-leading solution for drafting, managing, consolidating and publishing legislative and other parliamentary documents. Bungeni aims to increase the efficiency of parliamentary activities and make Parliaments more open and accessible to citizens—virtually allowing them "inside the Parliament" or Bungeni, the Kiswahili word for "inside the Parliament".

'''Point-defence''' (or '''point-defense'''; see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]) is the  defence of a single object or a limited area, e.g. a ship, building or an airfield, now usually against air attacks and [[guided missile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=First Strike!: The Pentagon's Strategy for Nuclear War |last=Aldridge |first=Robert C. |year=1983 |publisher=[[South End Press]] |isbn=978-0-89608-154-3 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Point-defence weapons have a smaller range in contrast to [[area-defence]] systems and are placed near or on the object to be protected.

Point-defence may include:
* short-ranged [[interceptor aircraft]]
* [[Close-in weapon system]]s on ships
* land-based short-ranged [[anti-aircraft]] guns or [[surface-to-air missile]] systems
* [[Active protection system]]s on tanks or other armoured fighting vehicles

[[Coastal artillery]] to protect harbours is similar conceptually, but is generally not classified as point-defence. Similarly, passive systems—[[electronic countermeasures]], decoys, [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]], [[flare]]s, [[barrage balloon]]s—are not considered point-defence.

== Examples ==
* [[Bachem Ba 349]] ''Natter'' – vertical take-off rocket powered manned interceptor (prototypes only)
* [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] – World War II era German rocket powered [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]].
* [[Goalkeeper CIWS]] – Gun [[CIWS]] in current service by the Dutch navy.
* [[Kashtan CIWS]] – Gun-Missile CIWS in current service by the Russian navy.
* [[RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile|RIM-116 RAM]] – Missile CIWS in current use by the US Navy.

'''Print design''', a subset of [[graphic design]], is a form of [[visual communication]] used to convey information to an audience through intentional aesthetic design printed on a tangible surface, designed to be printed on paper, as opposed to presented on a digital platform. A design can be considered print design if its final form was created through an imprint made by the impact of a stamp, seal, or dye on the surface of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;"print, n. and adj.2." OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 30 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There are several methods used to create print design artworks, spanning more than five hundred years. Printing technologies available throughout history heavily influenced the style of designs created by [[graphic designer]]s at the time of production, as different methods of creating print design offer varying features.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hollis, Richard''. Graphic Design: A Concise History''. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the emergence of the design and printing technologies of the twentieth and twenty-first century such as the [[Inkjet printing|inkjet printer]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], and [[Adobe InDesign]], print design relied on mechanical technologies such as the letterpress and lithography.

=== Letterpress ===
[[File:Letterpress from earliest days of printing (25794045595).jpg|thumb|Letterpress from the earliest days of printing]]
[[File:15020-Virgil Scott Letterpress Exhibit 4677 (16217955040).jpg|thumb|Metal type blocks arranged for printing with a letterpress]]
The [[Letterpress printing|letterpress]], perfected in the mid fifteenth century by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] (1398-1468) through the combined use of the printing press, oil-based inks, and cast metal type, remained the most common and efficient method of printing until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Eskilson, Stephen. ''Graphic Design: A New History''. New Haven: Yale UP, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Used frequently with [[typography]] design and type layout, the letterpress operates through the stamping of type and photo-engraved metal blocks on paper. The metal blocks are arranged in a frame by the printer, and the text columns and etchings are separated by vertical or horizontal metal bars; it is even possible to arrange the blocks at an angle using a letterpress.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Becker, Lutz, and Richard Hollis. ''Avant-Garde Graphics 1918-1934'': From the Merrill C. Berman Collection. London: Hayward Gallery, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; With the letterpress, print design and graphics remained black and white print on paper until the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The letterpress was the first technology that allowed for mass production and distribution of printed material at a large scale, and because of this, quickly replaced the slow processes of [[woodblock printing]] and hand copying of print design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Lithography ===
[[File:Klingenberg Lithostein.jpg|thumb|Lithographic stone artwork]]
[[Lithography]], introduced at the end of the nineteenth century, allowed for the use of color in prints and allowed artists to print on larger surfaces than the letterpress. Additionally, lithography enabled artists to draw their own lettering on designs, which was not possible with the letterpress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The design was drawn directly onto the stone by the artist, and then transferred onto the surface of the paper.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Uses ==
Print design remains prevalent in society through all forms of communicative design. The importance of printed visual design was highlighted during the first world war, as posters helped to inform and instruct the audience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A short list of print design's uses today includes:
* [[Poster]]s
* [[Brochure]]s
* Flyers
* [[Packaging and labeling|Packaging labels]]
* [[Business card]]s
* [[Book cover]]s
* Book design and layout
* [[Magazine]]s
* [[Banner]]s
* Receipts
* [[Shopping bag]]s

'''Renaissance studies''' (also ''Renaissance and Early Modern Studies'') is the interdisciplinary study of [[the Renaissance]] and [[early modern period]]. The field of study often incorporates knowledge from history, art history, literature, music, architecture, history of science, philosophy, classics, and medieval studies.

==Centers and Universities with Renaissance studies==
Renaissance studies programs exist at several universities, ether an independent field of study or as a subset of [[medieval studies]].

'''Rural history''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of historical research which focuses on the history of rural societies. At its inception, the field focused on the [[economic history]] of agriculture. Since the 1980s it has become increasingly influenced by [[social history]]. It can be considered an equivalent of [[urban history]].

A number of [[academic journal]]s and [[learned society|learned societies]] exist to promote rural history.

==History==
Rural history emerged as a distinct discipline from [[History of agriculture|Agricultural history]] in the 1980s and was inspired by the French [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] which favoured integrating economic, social and political history.{{sfn|Burchardt|2007|p=469}} Initially focused predominantly on the social history of rural life and later became increasingly interested in [[cultural history]].{{sfn|Burchardt|2007|p=477}}

In [[Europe]], the study of rural history is supported by the European Rural History Organisation (ERHO).

==National studies==

===Britain===
Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of English rural history and focuses on  an "orthodox" school dealing chiefly with the economic history of agriculture. The orthodox historians made "impressive progress" in quantifying and explaining the growth of output and productivity since the agricultural revolution. A challenge came from a dissident tradition that looked chiefly at the negative social costs of agricultural progress, especially enclosure. In the late 20th century there arose a new school, associated with the journal ''Rural History''. Led by Alun Howkins,&lt;ref&gt;Alun Howkins, ''Death of Rural England: A Social History of the Countryside since 1900'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; it links rural Britain to a wider social history. Burchardt calls for a new countryside history, paying more attention to the cultural and representational aspects that shaped 20th-century rural life.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Burchardt, "Agricultural History, Rural History, or Countryside History?" ''Historical Journal'' 2007 50(2): 465-481&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:03 sendia.jpg|thumb|Farmers from the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]]]
{{main|History of agriculture in the United States}}
In the U.S. most rural history has focused on the South—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a "new rural history" of the North as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the "women's sphere." These findings strongly contrast with those in the old [[Frontier Thesis|frontier history]] as well as those found in the new urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Hal S. Barron, "Rediscovering the Majority: The New Rural History  of the Nineteenth-Century North," ''Historical Methods,'' Fall 1986, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization came in the 20th century, with the arrival of mechanization, the model T, and the agricultural agent—as well as radio.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Craig, ''Out of the Dark: A History of Radio and Rural America'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
Rural history has been a major specialty of French scholars since the 1920s, thanks especially to the central role of the [[Annales School]].  Its journal ''Annales'' focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution: The Annales School 1929–89'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialised journals==
A number of [[academic journal]]s exist with a specific focus on rural history. These include:

*''[[Agricultural History (journal)|Agricultural History]]'' (1927–). United States.
*''[[Agricultural History Review]]'' (1953–). United Kingdom.
*''[[Histoire &amp; Sociétés Rurales]]'' (1990–). France.

== History and development  ==
The sex robot has evolved from sex doll precursors that stem back as far as the 17th century, during which Dutch sailors created hand sewn masturbation puppets made of cloth, leather, and old clothes. Many scholars consider this creation to be the direct predecessor of modern sex dolls. Much of the inspiration for creating the modern sex doll came from mannequin-based art created by [[Man Ray]] and [[Salvador Dali]]. Man Ray claimed that [[surrealists]], including himself and Dali, infused their work with eroticism and personally "violated" their mannequins. For example, Dali’s ''[[Rainy Taxi]]'' centered on a female mannequin whose half undressed body was crawling with live snails.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Julie. A (Straight, Male) History of Sex Dolls. The Atlantic , 6 Aug. 2014, https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/a-straight-male-history-of-dolls/375623/.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1968, sex dolls were first advertised in pornographic magazines and became available for purchase via mail. These sex dolls were inflatable with air; consisting of penetration areas at the mouth, vagina, and anus. However, due to their inflatable nature, these dolls were subject to deterioration and were not sustainable for constant use. By the 1970’s, materials such as latex and silicone were widely used in the manufacturing of sex dolls to facilitate enhanced durability and a greater resemblance to a human.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Anthony. ''The Sex Doll: A History''. McFarland, 2010. p 31. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4794-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The realism of sex robots greatly accelerated in the late 1990s. In 1997, Matt McMullen began constructing lifelike, tin-cure silicon mannequins called [[RealDoll]]s that were ‘realistic, posable, and life-sized’. McMullen received much criticism about the anatomical correctness of his mannequins; using this as motivation to create a more enhanced version. In 2009, McMullen switched to using platinum material, instead of tin-cure silicon, to further enhance the durability and lifelike nature of the doll. Consequently, all other sex doll manufacturers have followed suit. Many manufacturers, including McMullen, believed that companionship is a critical part of the sex bot dynamic and that incorporating AI into them is the next step.&lt;ref&gt;Leclercq, Cy. AI Sex Dolls Are Just around the Corner. The Next Web , 2018, thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/11/25/ai-sex-dolls-just-around-corner/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Matt McMullen Interview for The Sex Robots Are Coming.” 4 Press, Channel Four Television Corporation, 14 Nov. 2017, www.channel4.com/info/press/news/matt-mcmullen-interview-for-the-sexbots-are-coming.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, various new models have been constructed to hold conversations, remember important facts, and express various emotions. One such model is "Harmony", created by Matt McMullen, which is customizable by using a mobile app, where users can choose from "thousands of possible combinations of looks, clothes, personalities and voices to make your perfect companion".&lt;ref&gt;Your Perfect Companion in the Palm of Your Hands.

In 2014, [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]], the chess champion and author of ''[[Love and Sex with Robots]]''&lt;ref name=Gurley2015/&gt; said in an interview with ''[[Newsweek]]'' that "I believe that loving sex robots will be a great boon to society ...

In 2017, Matt McMullen created a sex doll called "Harmony" which has the capability of learning about the preferences, wants, and desires of the owner. Furthermore, Harmony can smile, blink and frown in a nearly humanlike fashion. She can hold a conversation with you, tell jokes, remember your food preferences, and the names of your siblings. The cost of Harmony is said to be roughly $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;Maras, Marie-Helen, and Lauren R. Shapiro. "CHILD SEX DOLLS AND ROBOTS: MORE THAN JUST AN UNCANNY VALLEY."

He subsequently added a different colored wig and changed her personality by using the app on his handheld device that controls the robot. He named this sex doll ‘Solana’ and considers it to be the sister of Harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Trout , Christopher. “There’s a New Sex Robot in Town: Say Hello to Solana.” Engadget , [[Oath Tech Network]], 10 Jan. 2018, www.engadget.com/2018/01/10/there-s-a-new-sex-robot-in-town-say-hello-to-solana/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
In September 2015, Kathleen Richardson of [[De Montfort University]] and Erik Billing of the [[University of Skövde]] created the ''{{vanchor|Campaign Against Sex Robots}}'', calling for a [[Ban (law)|ban]] on the creation of anthropomorphic sex robots.&lt;ref name="bbc-sexrobots"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34118482|title=Intelligent machines: Call for a ban on robots designed as sex toys |date=15 September 2015|access-date=7 September 2016|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other articles:

There is considerable speculation about this technology coming from experts in the fields of philosophy, sociology, and the natural sciences. Scholars such as Chandrshekhar Shrivastava believe that sex robots will facilitate "social isolation" and that sexual relations with robots will "desensitize humans to intimacy and empathy".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Shrivastava, Chandrshekhar. “Close Encounter: Rise of the Sex Robots.” Infotrac Newsstand, Athena Information Solutions Pvt. Ltd., 10 Aug. 2017, go.galegroup.com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;u=msu_main&amp;id=GALE|A500225399&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;authCount=1.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Chauntelle Tibbals, "Nothing can replace the joy, sorrow, passion, and pain of an actual, unpredictable human interaction." Kathleen Richardson, the director of the campaign against sex robots,&lt;ref&gt;Richardson , Kathleen. Campaign Against Sex Robots, Sept. 2015, campaignagainstsexrobots.org/.&lt;/ref&gt; firmly believes that we should "start cultivating better relations between each other and leave sex robots to the dustbin of bad ideas". She further argues that only when interacting with another human can we experience our humanity and our identity, as opposed to interacting with a robot.&lt;ref&gt;Spitznagel, Eric. "The Sex Robots Are Coming." Men's Health, June 2016, p. 144. Academic OneFile, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A460469860/AONE?u=msu_main&amp;sid=AONE&amp;xid=93301ef8&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sex robots that have been created, as of 2018, primarily resemble women with exaggerated characteristics. Kathleen Richardson argues that these sex robots facilitate a powerful attitude towards women's bodies as commodities, and promote a non-empathetic interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Kathleen. “Sex Robot Matters: Slavery, the Prostituted, and the Rights of Machines.” IEEE Technology and Society Magazine, 7 June 2016, ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/document/7484884/.&lt;/ref&gt; Experts argue that improving the gender diversity of those involved in developing this sex technology could help reduce possible harm, such as the objectification of women.&lt;ref&gt;“Interactions between Humans and Robots May Eventually Include Sex.” Let’s Talk about Sex Robots, Macmillan Publishers Limited , 10 July 2017, www-nature-com.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/news/let-s-talk-about-sex-robots-1.22276.&lt;/ref&gt; In Barcelona, a sex doll brothel allows men to act out their fantasies where they can choose from a selection of flexible silicone dolls and request that they be dressed in whatever outfit the man prefers. Many scholars, including Kathleen Richardson, argue that this ‘reinforces the idea that women are property’, rather than human-beings with free will.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Scholars such as Robert Sparrow argue that the creation of realistic female sex robots, with the ability to refuse consent, further facilitates a [[rape culture]]. He believes that sex with these robots represents the 'rape of a woman' and may increase the rate of rape in society, while also facilitating a general ‘disrespect for women’ in society.&lt;ref&gt;Sparrow, R. Int J of Soc Robotics (2017) 9: 465. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi-org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/10.1007/s12369-017-0413-z&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a sex robot called 'Frigid Farah', where its personality is described as 'reserved and shy', has caught the attention of several scholars. The manufacturer claimed that if "you touched her in a private area, more than likely, she will not be too appreciative of your advance". Many scholars view this as indulging rape fantasies and facilitating a rape culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legislation==
The Curbing Realistic Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic Robots (CREEPER) Act, sponsored by [[Daniel M. Donovan, Jr.]], was passed by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on 13 June 2018. The bill would amend the federal obscenity statute, {{usc|18|1462}} to criminalize importation and transportation for interstate commerce any "anatomically-correct doll, mannequin, or robot, with the features of, or with features that resemble those of, a minor, intended for use in sexual acts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr4655/text|title=H.R. 4655: CREEPER Act of 2017|publisher=govtrack}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Goodlatte]] stated that "these dolls create a real risk of reinforcing pedophilic behavior and they desensitize the user causing him to engage in sicker and sicker behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailywire.com/news/31832/creeper-act-congress-ban-child-sex-robots-james-barrett|title='CREEPER ACT': Congress To Ban Child Sex Robots|author=Barrett, James|date=14 June 2018|publisher=Daily Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and the United Kingdom already have such bans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://donovan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/donovan-introduces-creeper-act-ban-child-sex-dolls|title=Donovan Introduces "CREEPER Act" to Ban Child Sex Dolls|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential benefits ==
Proponents of sex robots believe that sex robots have the potential to provide a valuable service for people who are elderly or disabled and provide them with emotional support say, for example, when the spouse of an elderly person dies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, scholars such as Hojjat Abdollahi argue that these robots can act as "robot companions" that aid elderly people with dementia or depression. After conducting a study on many elderly patients, it was found that elderly individuals were interested in having a robot as their companion and their interest did not decay over time. He further explains that these patients established meaningful rapport with the robot companion and that they greatly valued the presence of the robot.&lt;ref&gt;Abdollahi, Hojjat, et al. A Pilot Study on Using an Intelligent Life-like Robot as a Companion for Elderly Individuals with Dementia and Depression. Humanoid Robotics , Nov. 2017, ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/document/8246925/.&lt;/ref&gt; The robot companion ‘Paro’, created by Takanori Shibata, has been used since 2009 as a therapeutic machine for the elderly suffering with dementia as well as those suffering from depression and anxiety. Paro is designed to respond to touch, remember faces, and learn certain actions that promote a favorable reaction in the patient. Although Paro was not designed to be a sex robot specifically, Paro is an example of how intelligent machines could become a suitable therapeutic option.&lt;ref&gt;Korn, Oliver, et al. Social Robots. A Workshop on the Past, the Present and the Future of Digital Companions. Offenburg University of Applied Sciences, 2017, affective-lab.org/social-robots-a-workshop/&lt;/ref&gt; New York Times columnist Ross Douthat has suggested that sex robots could solve the problem of [[inceldom]] in society.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2018/05/02/trending-is-the-robot-in-lost-in-space-hot-or-not/&lt;/ref&gt;

The main discussion revolved around the debate of where we draw the line with regard to cyber love and relationships and what the future of love and sex with robots has in store. Additional topics of discussion during the conference included humanoid robots, robot emotions, roboethics, and philosophical approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Love and Sex with Robots, Advances in Computer Entertainment, 2014 loverobots.mixedrealitylab.org/#topics.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 a second conference scheduled for November 2015 in [[Malaysia]] was declared illegal by the Malaysian [[Inspector-general of police#Malaysia|Inspector-General of Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tan|first=Tarrence|title=IGP declares ‘Sex with Robots’ conference illegal|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/10/13/igp-declares-sex-with-robots-conference-illegal/|work=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|date=13 October 2015|access-date=7 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913183656/http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2015/10/13/igp-declares-sex-with-robots-conference-illegal/|archive-date=2017-09-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reese|first=Hope |title=Academic conference on 'Love and Sex with Robots' abruptly cancelled after being declared illegal|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/academic-conference-on-love-and-sex-with-robots-abruptly-cancelled-after-being-declared-illegal/|work=[[TechRepublic]]|date=21 October 2015|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hale-Stern|first=Kaila|title=The annual Love and Sex With Robots Conference has been canceled|url=https://gizmodo.com/the-annual-love-and-sex-with-robots-conference-has-been-1738032832|work=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=Gawker Media|date=22 October 2015|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second conference was eventually held in December 2016 chaired by [[Kate Devlin|Dr. Kate Devlin]] at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loveandsexwithrobots.org/|title=Third International Congress on Love and Sex with Robots: London, 19-20 Dec 2017 | website = loveandsexwithrobots.org | publisher = Love and Sex with Robots Committee | accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devlin also founded the UK's first ever [[sex tech]] [[hackathon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Tech Hack II |url=http://goldsmiths.tech/sex|website=Hacksmiths|publisher=Goldsmiths Tech Society|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; also held in 2016 at Goldsmiths.

In 2016, a discussion of these issues was held at the 12th [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]] TC9 Human Choice &amp; Computers Conference, entitled "Technology and Intimacy: Choice or Coercion?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Dean | first= Jon |title= First ever conference in to sex robots to ask the big questions |url= https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/worlds-first-ever-conference-sex-8771592 |work=[[Daily Mirror]]|date= 5 September 2016|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Cheshire|first=Tom |url=http://news.sky.com/story/can-sex-robots-replace-relationships-with-human-beings-10568346|title=Can 'Sex Robots' replace human relationships?|date=7 September 2016|work=[[Sky News]]|publisher=|language=en-GB|access-date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conference was coordinated by Dr. David Kreps from Salford University. The overall aim of the conference was to 'scrutinize the journey from impersonal monolithic technology towards the intimate intertwining of devices and the self'. A prospective outlook on how these technologies will evolve was closely examined. Some of the main themes discussed during the conference were intimacy, personalization, material culture, and sexual relationships with robots.&lt;ref&gt;“Technology and Intimacy: Choice or Coercion?” HCC12 , Ifip, 2016, hcc12.net/cfp/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2018, the 13th [[International Federation for Information Processing|IFIP]] TC9 Human Choice &amp; Computers Conference "This Changes Everything" will be held in Poznan, Poland. The conference will be led and directed by David Kreps, Kai Kimppa, Louise Leenen, and Charles Ess. The discussion will be focused on the societal and ethical implications posed by artificial intelligence, privacy concerns, and how such technologies have significantly shifted computational strategies and altered the world we live in.&lt;ref&gt;13th IFIP TC9 Human Choice and Computers Conference: ‘This Changes Everything.’”HCC13, IFIP, 2018, hcc13.net/call-for-papers/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Intimacy with robots, artificial intelligence, and other human-constructed items are saturated in the media landscape. They provoke questions about what is love, why people crave the need for affection, and challenge pre-existing beliefs of what it means to be human.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;Wiseman, Eva. “Sex, Love and Robots: Is This the End of Intimacy?” ''The Guardian'', Guardian Media Group, 13 Dec. 2015, www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/13/sex-love-and-robots-the-end-of-intimacy. DOA: February 25, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally published in 1886, the novel ''[[The Future Eve|Tomorrow's Eve]]'' centers around a fictionalized Edison, who creates a female robot for his lonely patron. While the robot's beauty is apparent, the robot lacks the emotional capabilities to fulfill that hole in his heart.&lt;ref&gt;De Fren, Allison. “The Anatomical Gaze in Tomorrow's Eve.” ''Science Fiction Studies'', vol. 36, no. 2, 2009, pp. 235–265. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40649958.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'' questions common notions about consciousness. A sentient robot is created with a violent outcome, rebelling against her creators. Throughout the story, ''Ex Machina'' appeals to empathize with the robot as a victim of a man with a [[god complex]]. Responding to the protagonist's uncertainty about her fate if she does not live up to her creator's standards, the robot, Ava, responds "Why is it up to anyone?" about whether or not she lives. This questions the audience's underlying belief about whether or not a robot is entitled to a free life like other conscious beings.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, Alex, director. Ex Machina. Universal Studios, 2015. DOA February 27, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''[[Lars and the Real Girl]]'' explores the idea of a romantic attachment to artificial human-like items. Ultimately, the film concludes with the protagonist "murdering" his sex doll lover in a river: emphasizing the projection of one's idealized lover onto an inanimate object.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41722">[[Human sexuality|Sexuality]] can be inscribed in a multidimensional model comprising different aspects of human life: [[biology]], [[Human reproduction|reproduction]], [[culture]], [[entertainment]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and [[love]].&lt;ref name= DelRe &gt;Del Re G., Bazzo G., ''Programma di educazione sessuale e relazionale-affettiva''. In  Veglia F., (2004) ''Manuale di educazione sessuale'', Vol. I, Erickson, Trento.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decades, a growing interest towards sexuality and a greater quest to acknowledge a “[[right to sexuality]]” has occurred both in [[society]] and [[individual]]s. The consequence of this evolution has been a renewed and more explicit call for intervention from those who suffer, or think they suffer from alterations of their sexual and relational sphere.

This has produced an increased attention of [[medicine]] and [[psychology]] towards [[sexual dysfunction]]s and the problems they cause in individuals and couples. Science has gradually adjusted already existing research tools, mostly used in other fields of [[clinical research]], to the field of [[sexology]], so completing and increasing the number of tools in the “toolkit” of various branches of sexological [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]].&lt;ref name= Boccadoro &gt;Boccadoro L., Carulli S., (2008) ''Il posto dell'amore negato. Sessualità e psicopatologie segrete''[http://www.sexology.it]. Edizioni Tecnoprint, Ancona. {{ISBN|978-88-95554-03-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological measurements cannot be considered as accurate as physical ones (weight, height, mass, etc.), as the former evaluate those aspects and variables pertaining to an "individual" whose ''individuality'' refers to his/her own psychological, personological and environmental constituents: [[emotion]]s, expressiveness, senses, feelings and experiences which can greatly vary according to the subjects and change in the short period or depending on different settings, even in the same individual.

What is expected of [[Psychometrics|psychological measurements]] is "sufficient" accuracy and reliability, i.e. capability to express an indication or focus which clinicians can use as a “[[Medical guideline|guideline]]” to rapidly and accurately deepen the aspects highlighted by the measurements and check them together with their patients.&lt;ref name= DeRogatis_1 &gt;DeRogatis L.R., ''Assessment of sexual function/dysfunction via patient reported outcomes''. International Journal of Impotence Research, 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose, several statistical validation indexes of [[Psychological testing|psychodiagnostic tests]] are provided: from [[standardization]] to various constructions of [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] (internal, external, face, construct, convergent, content, discriminant, etc.).

There are several sexual dysfunctions and each of them has a different cause. Therefore, the field of [[sexology]] provides different psychological evaluation devices in order to examine the various aspects of the discomfort, problem or dysfunction, regardless of whether they are individual or relational ones.&lt;ref name=Basile &gt;Basile Fasolo C. et Veglia F., (1999) ''Disturbi sessuali''. In Conti L. (a cura di), ''Repertorio delle scale di valutazione in psichiatria'', S.E.E., Firenze.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of [[Psychological testing|psychodiagnostic reactives]] is certainly wide and heterogeneous, nevertheless, the number of tests specifically meant for the field of sexology is quite limited. The following list (in alphabetical order) is not exhaustive but shows the best known and/or most used reactives in the field of sexological and relational psychodiagnosis.

=== ASEX (Arizona Sexual Experience Scale) ===

* '' ASEX - Arizona Sexual Experience Scale'' &lt;ref name= McGahuey &gt;McGahuey C.A., Gelenberg A.J., Laukes C.A., Moreno F.A., Delgado P.L., McKnight K.M., Manber R., ''The Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX): reliability and validity''. Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, 26, 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

This test is intended for the assessment of [[sexual dysfunction]]s in psychiatric patients and people with health problems (men and women). It particularly evaluates modifications and alterations of [[sexual function]]s in relation to the intake of medicines or psychotropic substances.&lt;br /&gt;
This self-report questionnaire can be both administered by a clinician or self-administered. It is made up of 5 items rated on a 6-point Likert scale.
Each item explores a particular aspect of sexuality: 1. Sexual drive, 2. Arousal, 3a. Penile erection; 3b. Vaginal lubrication, 4. Ability to reach orgasm, 5. Satisfaction from orgasm. &lt;br /&gt;
Only one item of the scale has a male and a female version (3a – 3b). &lt;br /&gt;
This test provides good [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] indexes with a Cronbach's coefficient alpha of 0,90 and correlation (at intervals of 1 and 2 weeks) with r = 0,80. The “validity of the construction” has been evaluated by several studies through differences in the scores obtained by sample groups (dysfunctional patients) and control groups.&lt;ref name= Soykan_a &gt;Soykan A., ''The reliability and validity of Arizona sexual experiences scale in Turkish ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis''. International Journal of Impotence Research, 16, 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Soykan_b &gt;Soykan A., Boztaş H., Idilman R., Ozel E.T., Tüzün A.E., Ozden A., Ozden A., Kumbasar H., ''Sexual dysfunctions in HCV patients and its correlations with psychological and biological variables''. International Journal of Impotence Research,17 ,2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Sukan &gt;Sukan M., Maner F., ''The problems in sexual functions of vitiligo and chronic urticaria patients''. Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, 33, 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Convergent and discriminant validity have been measured comparing the results obtained by ASEX with those obtained by other tests. Particularly, it has been found a significant correlation between ASEX and BISF (Brief Index of Sexual Functioning),&lt;ref name= Taylor &gt;Taylor J.F., Rosen R.C., Leiblum S.R., ''Self-report assessment of female sexual function: Psychometric evaluation of the brief index of sexual functioning for women''. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 23, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; while little correlation has been noticed between ASEX and HRSD - [[Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression]] and BDI - [[Beck Depression Inventory]].

=== ASKAS (Aging Sexuality Knowledge and Attitudes Scale) ===

* ''ASKAS - Aging Sexuality Knowledge and Attitudes Scale'' &lt;ref name= White_a &gt;White C.B., ''A Scale for the Assessment of Attitudes and Knowledge Regarding Sexuality in the Aged.'' Paper presented at the 89th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association, Los Angeles, CA, August 24–26, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

This questionnaire is aimed at knowing sexuality and sexual attitudes in the [[Old age|elderly]]. It is made up of 61 items divided into two subscales: “''Knowledge subscale''”, a 35-item scale with “True/False” and “I don't know” answers and “''Attitudes subscale''” which is composed of  26 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale. Both subscales provide good reliability indexes (from 0,97 to 0,72) for Cronbach's alpha, test-retest and split half methods measured on different types of groups: ''[[Nursing]] home resident'', ''Community older adults'', ''Family of older adults'', ''Persons who work with older adults'', ''Nursing home staff''. &lt;br /&gt;
According to several studies carried out by the same author, sexual behaviour and attitudes during older age reflects those adopted during younger age, in fact:
* those people who were sexually active during youth tend to maintain this behaviour during older age;
* negative attitudes towards sex learned during youth can significantly affect the ability to have good sexuality during older age.
ASKAS has been used to study the effects of [[Sex education|sexual education]] on the attitudes of [[nursing home]] residents, their relatives and nursing home staff towards sexuality in the elderly. It has been noted that, after receiving sexual education, nursing home staff and relatives were more tolerant towards [[sexual intercourse]] in older age. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the sexual activity and satisfaction in those elderly people who had been given sexual education.&lt;ref name= White_b&gt;White C.B., Catania J.A., ''Psychoeducational Intervention for Sexuality with the Aged, Family Members of the Aged and People Who Work with the Aged''. International Journal of Aging and Human Development, 15, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
An Italian [[Statistical survey|survey]] carried out through a translated version of ASKAS among general practitioners has found that almost the entire sample (N=95) knew that sexuality is a lifelong need and it is not hazardous to elderly people's health, but, at the same time, it has revealed a lot of fallacies, confusion, stereotypes and lack of accurate knowledge of sexuality in old men and old women.&lt;ref name= Capodieci_a &gt;Capodieci S., Canu B., ''Il medico di base e il complesso del figlio di Noè.'' Rivista di Sessuologia, 13-4, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

International Psychogeriatrics, 20, 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; have confirmed that this test can be used in order to assess elderly people and to survey their relatives and those professionals ([http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/helping_profession ''helping profession'']) working close to them: doctors, psychologists and social workers.

=== BSRI (Bem Sex-Role Inventory) ===

* ''BSRI – [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]]'' &lt;ref name=Bem_a&gt;Bem S.L. (1972), ''[[Bem Sex-Role Inventory|The measurement of psychological androgyny]]''. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 42, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
Self-administering [[questionnaire]] (60 items in all) measures masculinity (20 items), femininity (20 items), [[Androgyne|androgyny]] (20 items), using the masculinity and femininity scales.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The concept of psychological androgyny implies that it is possible for an individual to be both compassionate and assertive, both expressive and instrumental, both feminine and masculine, depending upon the situational appropriateness of these various modalities".&lt;ref name= Bem_b&gt;Bem S.L. (1976), ''Sex typing and androgyny: Further explorations of the expressive domain''. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 34, 1016.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== DAS (Dyadic Adjustment Scale) ===

* ''DAS - Dyadic Adjustment Scale'' &lt;ref name=Spanier&gt;Spanier G.B., ''Measuring dyadic adjustment: new scales for assessing the quality of marriage and similar dyads''. Journal of Marriage and Family, 38, 15, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
This scale is made up of 32 items which explore 4 interdependent dimensions in order to evaluate relational adaptation between husband and wife: ''agreement'' between husband and wife on important matters, ''cohesion'' of the couple on common activities, ''satisfaction'' of the couple with the progress of their [[Intimate relationship|relationship]], ''expression'' of satisfaction with their affective and sexual life.

=== DIQ (Diagnostic Impotence Questionnaire) ===

* ''DIQ - Diagnostic Impotence Questionnaire'' &lt;ref name=Cole&gt;Cole M., Dryden W., (1989) ''Sex Problems: Your Questions Answered''. MacDonald, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
This questionnaire (35 item) evaluates the different components in male [[erectile dysfunction]]: Vascular (V), Neurogenic (N), Hormonal (H), Psychogenic (P).
The scores of V-N-H components provide information about those organic factors responsible for the dysfunction; the scores of P component indicate the influence of the psychogenic component. If the total score of V-N-H components is higher than the score of P component, then the organic etiology prevails over the psychogenic one (and vice versa).
This device is useful in the [[Impotence#Diagnosis|clinic setting]]. However, due to the fact that it is not validated nor [[Structured interview|standardised]], it must be used carefully in [[research]]es and [[Screening (medicine)|screenings]].

=== DSFI (Derogatis Sexual Function Inventory) ===

* ''DSFI - Derogatis Sexual Function Inventory'' &lt;ref name=Derogatis&gt;Derogatis L.R., (1978) ''Derogatis Sexual Function Inventory (revised ed.)''. Clin. Psychometrics Res., Baltimore.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
A [[Structured interview|standardised]] self-evaluation [[questionnaire]] made up of 258 items (245 in the original version published in 1975). It produces 9 sexual dimensions (information, experience, sexual drive, attitudes, affectivity, sexual gender and role, sexual fantasies, body image and sexual satisfaction), a dimension about psychopathological symptoms (anxiety, depression and somatizations) and an SFI index (''sexual functioning index''). Due to the high number of items, it requires a considerable amount of time to be filled in.

=== EDITS (Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction) ===

* ''EDITS - Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction'' &lt;ref name=Althof&gt;Althof S.E. et Corty E.W., (1998) ''EDITS - Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction''. University Hospitals of Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
A self-evaluation [[questionnaire]] on erectile dysfunction which is meant for male patients (13 items) and their partners (5 items). It explores achievements, perceived satisfaction, and treatment effectiveness.
The items meant for male patients study expectations, effectiveness, side effects and their willingness to continue with the treatment. The items meant for their partners explore the changes occurred in the couple's sexual activity and allow to notice the concordance between the subjective answers of the patients and the objective ones provided by theirs partners.

=== EPES (Erotic Preferences Examination Scheme) ===

* ''EPES - Erotic Preferences Examination Scheme'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://individual.utoronto.ca/ray_blanchard/index_files/EPES.html Paraphilia scales from Kurt Freund's Erotic Preferences Examination Scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;
This is one of the oldest self-report questionnaire measures of the various paraphilias listed in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).

The EPES includes scales for sexual masochism (11 items), sexual sadism (20 items), fetishism (8 items), cross-gender fetishism—transvestism (11 items), autogynephilia—a man’s tendency to be erotically aroused by the thought or image of himself as a woman (8 items), pedophilia (18 items), hebephilia—the erotic preference for pubescent, as opposed to prepubescent, children (9 items), voyeurism (6 items), and exhibitionism (13 items). The alpha reliability coefficients for these scales run from .74 to .98.

The EPES is not copyrighted and can be used without special permission.

=== FACES (Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales) ===

* ''FACES - Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales'' &lt;ref name=Olson&gt;Olson D.H., Russel C.S., Sprenkle D.H., ''Circumplex model of marital and family systems''. Family Process, 22, 69, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
This scale is made up of 111 items exploring family relationships (children above 12 included) with regard to 4 degrees of “''cohesion''”, i.e. emotional link between family members (regressed, attached, parted, disengaged) and 4 degrees of “''adaptability''” (chaotic, flexible, structured, rigid) i.e. capability of family members to reorganize in response to changes in the situations involving the family.
A first revision (1993) called ''FACES-II'' reduced the scale to 30 items, whereas a second one (1995) called ''FACES-III'' further reduced the number of items to 20.

* ''GRIMS - Golombok Rust Inventory of Marital State'' &lt;ref name=Rust_a&gt;Rust J., Bennum I., Crowe M., Golombok S., ''The Golombok-Rust Inventory of Marital State (GRIMS)''. Journal of Family Therapy, 12, 45, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
A 28-item questionnaire which is intended to analyse the features of dyadic relationships. It is often used in marriage [[Counseling psychology|counselling]] and couple's therapy. This [[Self-report inventory|inventory]] shows good psychometric features and is often used together with ''GRISS'' which is its individual version.

=== GRISS (Golombok Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction) ===

#
It consists of two questionnaires (i.e. a male and a female questionnaire) with 28 items each. It studies sexual dysfunctions in heterosexual subjects. It provides a total score and subscales scores: intercourse frequency, incommunicability, dissatisfaction, avoiding sexual intercourse, absence of sexuality, [[anorgasmia]] and [[vaginismus]] (only in the female version), [[Erectile dysfunction|impotence]] and [[premature ejaculation]] (only in the male version).
It is provided with good psychometric features and is easy to administer due to the limited number of items. However, this feature limits its illustrative and diagnostic function.

=== HSAS (Hendrick Sexual Attitude Scale) ===

* ''HSAS - Hendrick Sexual Attitude Scale'' &lt;ref name=Hendrick&gt;Hendrick S. et Hendrick C., (1987) ''Multidimensionality of sexual attitudes''. Journal of Sex Research, 23, 502-526.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
A 43-item self-evaluation scale which explore subjects' attitude towards sexuality. The scale examines 4 sexuality-related factors: permissiveness, sexual practices, community (i.e. participation and involvement) and instrumentalism (i.e. pleasure-oriented sexuality).

This device shows a good reliability and internal consistency of the global score in comparison to the sub-dimensions.

=== MMPI-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory) ===

* ''MMPI-2 - Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory'' &lt;ref name= Sellbom &gt;Sellbom, M., Ben-Porath, Y. S., Baum, L. J., Erez, E., &amp; Gregory, C. (2008). ''Predictive validity of the MMPI-2 Restructured Clinical (RC) Scales in a batterers' intervention program''. Journal of Personality Assessment, 90. 129-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Main article:'' [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI]]

A test published in 1942 by the ''[[University of Minnesota]]'', it was revised  in 1989 when the current version [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory#MMPI-2 RF|MMPI-2]] was created (last release Restructured Form in 2003).
The MMPI-2 is made up of a considerable number of items (567) which explore several features of personality pertaining psychology and psychiatry. There are also an abridged version (370 items) and a version called [[MMPI-A]] of 478 items (350 items in a short form) aimed at evaluating adolescent between the age of 14 and 18.&lt;br /&gt;
The dimensions taken into account are divided into: ''Basic Scales'' (which evaluate the most relevant features of personality), ''Content Scales'' (which analyse different variables of personality), ''Supplementary Scales'' (which further investigate some of the issues in the basic scales), ''Validity Scales'' (which define the degree of sincerity and accuracy in filling the questionnaire).&lt;br /&gt;
The evaluation of '''''sexual''''' and '''''relational''''' settings takes into account the following aspects: ''[[masculinity]]'' – ''[[femininity]]'' (i.e. those aspects typically viewed as  masculine or feminine, considered as a whole), ''masculine and feminine'' ''[[gender role]]'' (i.e. perception of gender role), ''marital distress and family discord'' (i.e. conflicts within the couple), ''[[Extraversion and introversion|social introversion]]'' (i.e. difficulties in social relations).&lt;br /&gt;
[[MMPI-2#Criticism and controversy|Criticisms of this device]] relate to the amount of time required to fill it in (60–120 minutes) and to the fact that some of the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory#RC and Clinical Scales|Restructured Clinical]] Scales, although regarded as clearer and easier to interpret, raised some controversies in the academic world because they have been modified compared to those in the original version.

#
This test is made up of two questionnaires (i.e. a male and a female questionnaire) with 24 pairs of items each. They measure the dominance and willingness within the couple. Its [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] has been improved thanks to a revision by Scott-Heyes (1982) whose title is ''RSMPT - Ryle/Scott-Heyes Marital Patterns Questionnaire.''&lt;ref name=Scott-Heyes&gt;Scott-Heyes G., ''Analysis and revision of Ryle’s Marital Patterns Test''.

#
:''Main article:'' [[SESAMO]] (Sexrelational Test)
[[Image:Graf1 Sesamo test.jpg|thumb|SESAMO Sexrelational Test diagram's example]]
A [[Structured interview|standardised]] and [[Validity (statistics)|validated]] self-administering and self-evaluation [[questionnaire]]. It studies the dysfunctional aspects in individual and couple [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] besides family, social, affective and relational aspects. 
It consists of two questionnaires (i.e. a male and a female questionnaire) which are divided in two subsections each: one for singles and one for people with a partner.
The number of items in each questionnaire is variable: 135 items for singles and 173 for people with a partner. The explored dimensions are 16 for singles and 18 for people living a dyadic situation.
This questionnaire can be directly self-administered on the computer (''[[self-assessment]]''); after that the software elaborates the questionnaire and produces a report made up of 9 sections. Each of these sections has several levels of further diagnostic analysis.
A short version of this questionnaire, called ''Sexuality Evaluation Schedule [[Psychological evaluation|Assessment]] Monitoring'',&lt;ref name=Boccadoro_b&gt;Boccadoro L., (1996) ''SESAMO: Sexuality Evaluation Schedule Assessment Monitoring. Questionario Sessualità''. [http://www.giuntios.it O.S.], Firenze. IT\ICCU\CFI\0327719.&lt;/ref&gt; has a lower number of items and can be administered only through the paper and pencil method.
The disadvantages of this evaluation/research tool are the time required for filling in the questionnaire and the fact that the complete [[Case report form|Report]] can be elaborated only by the software.

=== SESII–W (Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women) ===

This test investigates [[sexual arousal]] and [[Sexual inhibition|inhibition]] in women through a 115-item questionnaire rated on a 4-point Likert scale. &lt;br /&gt;
The areas concerning '''sexual arousal''' are: ''Arousability'' (arousal and sexual stimulation); ''Sexual power dynamics'' (power dynamics in sexuality); ''Smell'' (arousing smells); ''Partner characteristics''; ''Setting'' (unusual or unconcealed settings). &lt;br /&gt;
'''Sexual inhibition''' factors are: ''Relationship importance''; ''Arousal contingency'' (arousal-related factors); ''Concerns about sexual function'' (concerns about the consequences of [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]). &lt;br /&gt;
This test is based on the conditioning of sexual response: sexual arousal is controlled by the balance of several factors, all of which contribute to arousal or inhibition.&lt;ref name= Basson &gt;Basson R., ''The female sexual response: A different model''. Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy, 26, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Validation of this test is based on a sample of 655 women with an average age of 33.09. Statistical calculations have provided a good reliability measured by test-retest method and good discriminant and convergent [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] determined through the consistency of the results obtained by this test with those obtained by BIS/BAS - ''Behavioral Inhibition Scale/Behavioral Activation Scale'',&lt;ref name= Carver &gt;Carver C.S., White T.L., ''Behavioral inhibition, behavioral activation, and affective responses to impending reward and punishment: The BIS/BAS scales''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5497">The '''Thomas More Institute''' (TMI) is a secular academic institution located in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada that offers a program of university level studies in the [[liberal arts]]. There is an option to earn a Bachelor of Arts in affiliation with [[Bishop's University]].

== History ==
TMI was founded in Montreal in 1945 by a group of people, most of them in their twenties, including [[Charlotte Tansey]], Martin O'Hara, Stan Machnik, and Veronica Smyth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2dEtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3EgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=tansey%20machnik&amp;pg=2269%2C586577 "Spirit of Girl in Twenties Spells Success for Adult Education Inst."], ''Manitoba Ensign'', February 4, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Fitterman, [http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20100906.OBCHARLOTTTETANSEYATL/BDAStory/BDA/deaths "Dedicated to the pursuit of lifelong learning: Founder of Thomas More Institute for Adult Education had fierce vision and passion for knowledge]", ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', September 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim was to provide opportunities for lifelong learning and liberal arts education for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview|url=http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/overview/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915102954/http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/overview/|archivedate=2013-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, TMI established the Workers' School, which offered evening classes in "Human Rights and Labour Unions," "The Rise of Labour Movements," and "Talking at Meetings," training workers to become union members.  The Institute received a federal charter in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a0wwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fagFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=thomas-more-institute&amp;pg=5401%2C4209821 "Thomas More Institute Gets Federal Charter"], ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', May 20, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, annually, the Institute has more than 600 registrations and 35-40 new courses. The adult students are of all ages, from those in their early 20s to several over 90 years of age.

== Teaching method ==
TMI’s teaching is inspired by the [[Socratic method]]. Instead of lectures, TMI offers discussions guided by trained leaders and based upon carefully chosen and sequenced texts representing different perspectives on the questions each group has come together to explore. 
Although they may have special knowledge in a particular field the leaders do not lecture; the text is the professor. The discussion team only asks questions to channel the conversation.  Participants learn to listen to one another; people of all ages and all backgrounds coming together to exchange their views on what a reading means to them. TMI’s method requires critical thinking, clear references to common terms, and respect for alternate views. The challenge in TMI courses is not for students to agree, or come to a consensus, but to embrace new ways of thinking that go beyond individual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching Philosophy|url=http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/teaching-philosophy/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916080355/http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/about-2/teaching-philosophy/|archivedate=2013-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seniors' Outreach Program ==
In 1977, TMI launched an outreach program to take courses to seniors’ residences and centres in response to some of the Institute’s original discussion leaders and students no longer having the mobility to come to courses downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seniors' Program|url=http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/courses/seniors-program/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915102449/http://www.thomasmore.qc.ca/courses/seniors-program/|archivedate=2013-09-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program continues to organize discussion groups on history, literature, science, and other liberal arts topics in residences and meeting places of older adults throughout the Montreal area.

== Lonergan ==
[[Bernard Lonergan]], the Canadian philosopher, theologian, and economist, taught at TMI (beginning with a 1945 lecture series called "Thought and Reality"&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QokxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=naUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=thomas-more-institute&amp;pg=1494%2C2598168 "Thomas More Institute is 40 Years Old"], ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', August 18, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick E. Crowe, ''Developing the Lonergan Legacy: Historical, Theoretical, and Existential Themes'' ([[University of Toronto Press]], 2004), {{ISBN|978-0802089380}}, p.44 &amp; passim.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=wOSrpMSUm6QC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;ots=vmSth8LCgX&amp;dq=%22Thomas%20More%20Institute%22%20%22thought%20and%20reality%22%201945&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Thomas%20More%20Institute%22%20&amp;f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;) and significantly shaped the learning and questioning experience offered by the Institute. TMI is also home to a large collection of Lonergan documents, including lecture notes and audio tapes, which are being digitized with the help of the [http://www.lonergan-lri.ca/ Lonergan Research Institute]. Every fall, TMI organizes a Listening to Lonergan lecture series, co-sponsored by [[Concordia University]] and the Thomas More Research Institute.
