'''Agricultural geography''' is a subdiscipline of [[human geography]] concerned with the spatial relationships found between agriculture and humans. 

== Focus ==
It is traditionally considered the branch of [[economic geography]] that investigates those parts of the [[Earth's surface]] that are transformed by humans through [[primary sector]] activities for consumption. It thus focuses on the different types of structures of agricultural landscapes and asks for the cultural, political, and environmental processes that lead to these spatial patterns. While most research in this area concentrates rather on production than on consumption,&lt;ref&gt;Laingen, C. &amp; L. Butler Harrington (2013): Agricultural Geography. ''Oxford Bibliographies''. [[Oxford University Press]]. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/OBO/9780199874002-006 DOI 10.1093/OBO/9780199874002-006]&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction can be made between [[nomothetic]] (e.g. distribution of spatial agricultural patterns and processes) and [[idiographic]] research (e.g. human-environment interaction and the shaping of agricultural landscapes). The latter approach of agricultural geography is often applied within [[regional geography]].

&lt;/ref&gt;
) is an Argentina-born feminist and anti-trafficking activist. After a police raid at the brothel where she was being sexually exploited in 2012, she began advocating for the abolition of prostitution. She attracted media attention in Argentina when she sued her exploiters and the city where the brothel was located. She became known worldwide when the U.S. Department of State gave her an award for her anti-trafficking activism.

== Childhood and family ==
Kinan's family had enough money to provide her a good education, but her life began to spiral downhill when her father began to abuse her mother. Kinan has said that her mother, along with her grandmother and her aunts, were prostituted.&lt;ref name="historia"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.laretaguardia.com.ar/2015/03/la-historia-de-alika-kinan-del-trabajo.html | dead-url=no | title=La historia de Alika Kinán, del trabajo sexual a la trata en primera persona | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731230249/http://www.laretaguardia.com.ar/2015/03/la-historia-de-alika-kinan-del-trabajo.html | archive-date=2017-07-31 | date=2015-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has described how her father used to tell stories after dinner about how he met her mother and how he rescued her from the ''zulo''.&lt;ref name="desprender"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marcha.org.ar/alika-kinan-estoy-tratando-de-desprenderme-del-lugar-de-victima-es-todo-un-proceso/ | title=Alika Kinan: "Estoy tratando de desprenderme del lugar de víctima. Es todo un proceso" | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620210439/http://www.marcha.org.ar/alika-kinan-estoy-tratando-de-desprenderme-del-lugar-de-victima-es-todo-un-proceso | dead-url=no | archive-date=2017-06-20 | date=2015-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Zulo'' is a word with many meanings. In this context, it could mean either a small, wretched apartment, or a brothel.) Kinan was raped at age fourteen. Her parents separated when she was fifteen and her younger sister was nine, and her father stopped supporting the family.&lt;ref name="esclava"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/esclava-sexual-justicia-alika_0_1346265427.html/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428174854/http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/esclava-sexual-justicia-alika_0_1346265427.html | dead-url=no | date=2015-04-26 | title=Fui una esclava sexual durante 20 años y ahora busco justicia | archive-date=2015-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abandoned by parents, enters sex work ==
A year later Kinan's mother went to [[Buenos Aires]], leaving her to care for her sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; (According to some sources, Kinan's mother took Kinan and her sister to [[Buenos Aires]] and Kinan later returned to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="incomoda"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://revistaharoldo.com.ar/nota.php?id=180 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-15 | title=Las incómodas verdades de Alika Kinan | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802204533/http://revistaharoldo.com.ar/nota.php?id=180  | archive-date=2017-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Kinan tried cooking and selling a local pastry but couldn't earn enough to support herself and her sister. Her father refused to help her.&lt;ref name="esclava" /&gt; Reportedly, he told her "You know what you have to do," implying that she should become a prostitute.&lt;ref name="incomoda" /&gt; She worked for someone for three months but received no pay. A friend suggested working at Aries, a brothel run out of a private apartment.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

Kinan remembers her decision to enter sex work:

{{quote |text=My grandmother was a prostitute, my mom and my aunts too, it's like being in that situation seems natural. When my mom leaves I'm left in charge of my sister, who is a lot younger than me. There came a time when we did not have anything to eat, we had nowhere to live, it was an extreme situation, I was left with a small child and I was facing that situation. It was then that a girl makes me an offer in a place X, and tells me that we could go to a private apartment where they were hosting bachelor parties, it was like a massage place, it all seemed very strange. At that time I did not go, until the situation was so extreme that I was up to my neck and one day I found myself ringing the bell at the place that had been pointed out to me.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Kinan was seventeen at the time.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; She remembers her first client as being grotesquely fat and smelling like talcum powder.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; She still remembers the odor:

{{quote |text=on the subject of the massages, there are those strange scents that stay with you for life. It's very disgusting. It's those memories that you try to bury under everything else.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

After that, she worked at bachelor parties and continued seeing individual clients. She received 40% of the clients' fees, which was enough to rent a place for her and her sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While still underage, she attracted the attention of the police and spent more time hiding from them than servicing clients,&lt;ref name="aislada"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cosecharoja.org/alika-kinan-amenazas | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-04 | title=Alika Kinan esta aislada y declarara en Camara Gesell | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428184203/http://cosecharoja.org/alika-kinan-amenazas | archive-date=2017-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would have reduced the amount of money she could earn to support herself and her sister. She says

{{quote |text=... when I was younger, I tried to avoid the police because there was a follow-up, a payment of fines, but I was still underage and if the police caught me it would be worse.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

At one point during this period, Kinan seems to have also been supporting her father. She says that he lived with her and asked her for money. He also threatened to get a lawyer and take her younger sister away from her.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

== Ushuaia ==
Up to this time, Kinan had been moving back and forth between [[Cruz del Eje]] and the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; Another woman recommended that she move to [[Ushuaia]], in [[Argentina]]'s [[Tierra del Fuego]] region.&lt;ref name="marea"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-9654-2015-04-24.html | dead-url=no | date=2015-04-24 | title=Contra viento y marea | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608172723/https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/las12/13-9654-2015-04-24.html | archive-date=2016-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinan was told that she would get many clients who paid well in dollars, and she could keep 50% of the clients fees, as opposed to the 40% that she kept in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]].

{{ quote | text=She said to me "I was in the south, you earn very good money, there are fishing boats, many foreigners, you can charge in dollars, you earn double because you are paid best."  ... they gave you 40%, and so I went to Ushuaia where they did not deduct so much.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

Different sources report her age at this time as fifteen,&lt;ref name="distinguida"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://noticias.unsam.edu.ar/2017/07/05/alika-kinan-distinguida-heroina-en-estados-unidos-por-su-lucha-contra-la-trata | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-03 | title=Alika Kinan, distinguida "Heroína" en Estados Unidos por su lucha contra la trata | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170805105401/http://noticias.unsam.edu.ar/2017/07/05/alika-kinan-distinguida-heroina-en-estados-unidos-por-su-lucha-contra-la-trata | archive-date=2017-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eighteen,&lt;ref name="honoree"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/29/534709918/state-department-honoree-was-trapped-in-a-brothel-for-nearly-20-years | dead-url=no | date=2017-06-29 | title=State Department Honoree Was Trapped In A Brothel For Nearly 20 Years | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703221203/http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/29/534709918/state-department-honoree-was-trapped-in-a-brothel-for-nearly-20-years | archive-date=2017-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; nineteen&lt;ref name="sobrevivio"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/sobrevivio-la-trata-y-es-querellante-contra-sus-proxenetas |dead-url=no | date=2016-11-10| title=Sobrevivió a la trata y es querellante contra sus proxenetas | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114132159/http://www.cba24n.com.ar/content/sobrevivio-la-trata-y-es-querellante-contra-sus-proxenetas | archive-date=2016-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or twenty.&lt;ref name="incomoda" /&gt; She was born in 1976&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; and went to [[Ushuaia]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; If she arrived before her birthday on 24 June, she would have been nineteen. If she arrived after her birthday, she would have been twenty. But in either case she was likely to be closer to her twentieth birthday than her nineteenth. A plane ticket was sent to her and in [[Ushuaia]] she began work at a nightclub called Sheik where, as promised, she kept 50% of the clients' fees. After a while she rented a place and sent for her sister, paying for her school, English classes, computers, clothing, and food.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

(Various sources give the name of the nightclub as "El Sheikh", "El Sheik", "Sheikh", and "Sheik". Photographs of the nightclub show a sign saying "Sheik", so that is the name used in this article.)

== Marriage ==
According to Kinan's ex-husband, Miguel Pascual, they met in 1996, the same year she arrived in [[Ushuaia]]. She had already changed employers and was working at the nightclub Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="sola"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-no-esta-sola-comienza-el-juicio-en-tierra-del-fuego | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-04 | title=Alika no está sola: comienza el juicio en Tierra del Fuego | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109001257/https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-no-esta-sola-comienza-el-juicio-en-tierra-del-fuego | archive-date=2016-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid her managers extra to spend extra time with her, but she wasn't informed&lt;ref name="denouncer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/11/15/argentina-alika-kinan-from-victim-to-denouncer-of-a-trafficking-network | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-03 | title=Argentina: Alika Kinan, from victim to denouncer of a trafficking network | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729225407/http://www.thedawn-news.org/2016/11/15/argentina-alika-kinan-from-victim-to-denouncer-of-a-trafficking-network | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as she comments, "... obviously I did not see any of it."&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; Pascual served three yearlong tours of duty on a ship that supplied [[Spain]]'s Antarctic bases. He and Kinan saw each other during those three years when his boat docked in [[Ushuaia]].&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; He told her he wanted her to be his life partner.&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; Kinan was apparently in danger at the time:

{{quote |text=People from Rio Grande had come looking for me with guns, I went with a boy a little bigger than I, who suggested that I go on vacation with him, he was very insistent and the truth that I had to run from here because at any moment some pimp with guns was going to create a bad situation ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In a different interview, she didn't mention the pimps with guns, but she indicated a similar degree of desperation:

{{ quote | text=The point is that this guy left a lot of money every time he came, always paid in dollars - it's the time of 1 to 1 [The Argentine peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar at one to one.] and I said that in order to leave that place I was going wherever he went. I was not in love. I submitted.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

So he took her on vacation in [[Barcelona]] where his family had businesses and drove Mercedes, and she ended up staying with him in Spain and bringing her sister over.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

In Kinan's description of the marriage, she worked at businesses owned by her husband's family. One source says that he collected half her wages,&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; another says that he collected all of her wages.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; She wasn't allowed to use the car and was required to function as the maid. To support her sister, she secretly sold her eggs. (It must have been extremely difficult to hide this from her husband without a car.&lt;ref name="eggDonation"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation#The_egg_donor.27s_process_in_detail | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-01 | title=Egg donation - Wikipedia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127132005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_donation | archive-date=2017-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) She says her husband quickly became violent.

{{ quote | text=... I was faced with a violent guy, a family where violence was naturalized. I remember that the first time he hit me was the few months I went with him, and the first thing I did was tell the mother, because he had smashed the remote control in my face, and she asked me "but what did you do?" Then I realized I was to the oven. [An Argentine idiom indicating being in a bad situation from which there is no escape.]&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

A few days before the start of the trial, Pascual gave a very different description of their marriage, which he described as "hell from the first day." He claims that it was she who assaulted him, and that he defended himself without hitting her.

{{ quote | text=She tried to hit me two times, I am a master of martial arts, and both times I took her by the hair and back, and I put her on her knees ... Both times I immobilized her when she tried to hit me, but she never hit me.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; }}

Kinan says that at some point after the birth of their second child, her husband sent her to a brothel.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; Her husband denies the accusations of forced labor and forced prostitution.

{{ quote | text=At no time was she forced. She worked in Spain with my brother in a transport company. She has lied about me, about my mother saying that she forced her to work.

[The eldest daughter] was in Buenos Aires saying that her mother had been mistreated and forced into prostitution in Spain, and that never happened. I can give names of the companies in which she worked and I have a thousand witnesses.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; }}

Over nine years they had three children. According to Kinan, one night when the oldest was eight, she refused to do her homework and her father hit her hard enough to cause bleeding. Kinan decided that she needed to leave [[Spain]] and persuaded her husband to take them all back to [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; According to her husband, Miguel Pascual, they moved to [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] in [[Argentina]] in 2008, and separated in 2010. At that point he returned to Spain&lt;ref name="redito"&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2016/11/alika-usa-mis-hijas-para-sacar-redito.html | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-02 | title=Alika usa mis hijas para sacar redito economico | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106142803/http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2016/11/alika-usa-mis-hijas-para-sacar-redito.html | archive-date=2016-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kinan returned to [[Ushuaia]] and Sheik to support herself and her children.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt;

As with Kinan, there are some discrepancies in different versions of Pascual's story. At one point he said that he and Kinan separated, and he continued sending money for their daughters until he discovered that she had returned to sex work.&lt;ref name="redito"/&gt; In another account he claimed to be present when she made the phone call to Sheik to ask about returning to sex work. In this telling, they separated because she was returning to sex work, and he later stopped sending money because she married another man whom she was supporting.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt;

== Brothel work ==
Following the police raid at the Black &amp; White nightclub/brothel, news outlets published information about the brothel's operations. Much of this information relates to aspects of brothel operation that aren't described in news reports describing Sheik. Kinan worked at Black &amp; White immediately before leaving for [[Spain]]. This section uses information about both Sheik and Black &amp; White to give a more complete picture of the working conditions that Kinan would have encountered.

Alika Kinan's experience at the two brothels were probably common for sex workers across the southern Cone area. Descriptions of brothels in two Chilean cities not far from [[Ushuaia]] and in [[Ushuaia]] itself closely match the business operations of Sheik and Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="otherMenus"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.erraticrock.com/information/information-articles-1/just-exploring-other-menus | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-16 | title=Just Exploring Other Menus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729110434/http://www.erraticrock.com/information/information-articles-1/just-exploring-other-menus |archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Information and employees seem to have moved more or less freely between the six brothels of [[Ushuaia]], which were located within a few blocks of each other.&lt;ref name="commercialized"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/commercialized-sexual-activity | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-19 | title=Commercialized sexual activity  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708233852/http://www.patagonia-argentina.com/en/commercialized-sexual-activity | archive-date=2017-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When many of [[Ushuaia]]'s sex workers migrated to [[Punto Arenas]] in [[Chile]] after the police raids shut down the brothels in [[Ushuaia]],&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; it was a one-time group migration, but it probably followed a path previously forged by individual sex workers moving between the two cities. No two businesses operate in exactly the same way, but these two brothels can be taken as a rough proxy for legally regulated brothels in [[Patagonia]].

=== Management ===
==== Sheik ====
The primary manager at Sheik was Pedro Montoya, who was involved with the brothel throughout its existence. During an earlier period, his co-manager was his wife Claudia Quiroga, who owned the property where the brothel was located. The on-site supervisor under Quiroga was Corina Sánchez.

At the time of the police raid, Quiroga and Sánchez were no longer involved. The co-manager was Montoya's girlfriend Ivana Claudia García, and the on-site supervisor was Lucy Alberca Campos. García's brother Jorge Etcheverry worked as a recruiter for the brothel.

During the trial, Kinan described how the managers used surveillance cameras to monitor the women:

{{ quote | They ordered us where to position ourselves, how we should sit, because Claudia operated the cameras wherever you were. When the phone rang you knew it was Claudia who was watching who was coming in, who had to get on the phone, if you were standing, if you had gone to the bathroom a lot, because they monitored even the times you went to the bathroom. Everything was monitored.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

One woman was described by the managers as "like the fish, you use everything but the head."&lt;ref name="chicas"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/chicas-vulnerables-victimas-negocio-ushuaia_0_Hy5W6y-bl.html | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-09 | title=Chicas pobres y vulnerables, las víctimas del negocio de la trata en Ushuaia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729214706/https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/chicas-vulnerables-victimas-negocio-ushuaia_0_Hy5W6y-bl.html | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Equivalent to the American expression "butterface" or the Australian expression "prawn.") This was cited at the trial as an example of the managers' contempt toward the women.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; At the trial, one of the police witnesses said that the managers mislead the women in order to recruit them, and then belittled them for their poverty and poor education.&lt;ref name="finalizo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://banderafueguina.com.ar/noticia/1402/finalizo-la-tercera-jornada-de-juicio-con-la-declaracion-de-una-de-las-mujeres-r | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-10 | title=Finalizó la tercera jornada de juicio con la declaración de una de las mujeres rescatadas del Sheik | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803130104/http://banderafueguina.com.ar/noticia/1402/finalizo-la-tercera-jornada-de-juicio-con-la-declaracion-de-una-de-las-mujeres-r | archive-date=2017-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinan remembers the following scene:

{{ quote | text=Even the female owner, the girlfriend of the trafficker always told me that she was going to teach me how to work, then she would knock me against the bar and say "give it to me, baby, bring me money, give it to me" and hit the bar hard. I remember that I jumped a few leaps ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

On the other hand, Kinan felt that the managers were

{{ quote | text=The family I had never had, the one that never cared for me, I said that they took care of me, gave me housing. That's why I made the decision to return. I thought that corresponded because I had to be working and these people gave me housing, they cared for me, because if something happened, I cut a finger or had to go to the doctor they accompanied me ... they took care that I did not spread disease, that I did not catch any infection, I did not catch the flu. When the snowy season began, they would tell me to go get the vaccine or take something so I would not get sick.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

As Kinan points out, it was good business to keep workers healthy and productive. The feeling that the managers were her family is not surprising, given that between the age of sixteen, when she was left to support herself and her sister, and the age of thirty six, when the police raided Sheik, the brothels of [[Ushuaia]] and her husband were the only ones who concerned themselves about her health, housing, and financial support.

==== Black &amp; White ====
The primary manager at Black &amp; White was Victor Morales, nicknamed "Jefe". His daughter seems to have been second in command. Other people involved in some sort of managerial capacity included his ex-wife, his current girlfriend, and his son.
&lt;ref name="clanMorales"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Sheik, Black and White had security cameras. One woman was so unnerved by their presence that she left shortly after arrival.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

=== Workers ===
==== Sheik ====
There were seven women working at Sheik at the time of the police raid, three from the Dominican Republic, one from Paraguay, and three from Argentina.&lt;ref name="operativo"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2012/10/operativo-de-gendarmeria-en-el-sheik.html | dead-url=no | date=2012-10-09 | title=Operativo de Gendarmeria en El Sheik | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115023424/http://cronicasfueguinas.blogspot.com/2012/10/operativo-de-gendarmeria-en-el-sheik.html | archive-date=2015-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of them were supporting children with no assistance from the fathers. Most of them hadn't finished formal basic education and had no good alternatives to sex work.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; One of the women had only the clothes she was wearing when she moved to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
Black &amp; White's web site promised twenty-five women. During the police investigation the number of women employed varied from twelve to twenty. At the time of the raid it employed eighteen women. The majority of them were from the Dominican Republic,

Most of them were in their twenties. A woman who was thirty eight said that Morales was initially reluctant to hire her because of her age.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the women who were described, one had left home and was struggling to support herself, one had debts, and two had been doing sex work in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]] and came to [[Ushuaia]] for the job. One of the women was mentally ill and her condition prompted the police to end the investigation and raid the brothel.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One of the women interviewed by the prosecutors during the Black &amp; White investigation testified that she had been seventeen years old when Morales recruited her. She said that he brought her to [[Ushuaia]] along with two other underage girls. When they arrived at the house they would live in, they found other employees of the brothel who were also underage.

However, at the time of the police raid, all of the women employed by the brothel were legally adults.

=== Government involvement in the brothels ===
When a sex worker first arrived at [[Ushuaia]], she would first be taken to the police station where the provincial police would take her finger prints,
&lt;ref name="fallo"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
open a file on her, and ensure that she had no criminal record.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; The city government then set up a health book that recorded her medical examinations.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; The city of [[Ushuaia]] required the women to undergo regular examinations, involving tests for HIV and [[sexually transmitted infection]]s and analysis of vaginal discharges.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; There were no examinations at Sheik during the period of police surveillance. The women were probably relieved; a witness at the trial testified that the inspectors mocked and humiliated the women they were examining.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; The owner of Sheik testified during the trial that there were two to three inspections per month,&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; and listed inspections to confirm that the business permits were in order, that there was a fire extinguisher, and that the entertainers had their sanitary pads.
&lt;ref name="socio"&gt;
{{cite news 
| title= Caso Alika Kinan: "Yo soy el socio minoritario de las señoritas"

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city continued the police registration and medical inspections of women in the local brothels after the time Argentina's anti-trafficking law was passed in 2008 (see the article [[Human trafficking in Argentina]]) until the first brothel raids in 2012. In addition, one source says that the city charged for inspections and the renewal of a woman's health book,&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; which occurred quarterly.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt;

This matches a historical pattern in [[Argentina]]'s [[Patagonia]] region. Municipal governments, strongly influenced by local businessmen, wanted to use their powers of regulation to maintain their tax bases and were opposed to too much interference in the brothel business. The provincial police had other funding sources and wanted to restrict brothel activities in unprofitable ways. The municipal government of Rio Gallegos was founded in 1912, and by 1914 there was already conflict between the city and the police of Santa Cruz province over the regulation of brothels.
&lt;ref name="rioGallegos"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[Ushuaia]], the conflict was between the municipal government and the federal justice system. About the same time as the police raid on Sheik, the city council of [[Ushuaia]] was advised that it should pass a law closing the remaining nightclubs.

=== Recruitment ===
==== Sheik ====
None of the women working at Sheik were from [[Ushuaia]]. Some came from elsewhere in Argentina and some came from other countries.&lt;ref name="dia03"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-3 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-09 | title=Juicio de Alika.

Pedro Montoya, the owner, testified that all the women came from other brothels, either in [[Ushuaia]] or elsewhere.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; Kinan herself worked at two brothels in [[Ushuaia]]. Montoya said that he got calls from women asking to work at Sheik.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; Montoya and his girlfriend and business partner Ivana Claudia García were responsible for recruitment, but García seems to have done most of the recruiting with help from her brother, whose sole function at the nightclub was recruiter.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/fecha-juicio-oral-emblematico-trata_0_BJlV0IN6.html | title=Tiene fecha el juicio oral de un emblemático caso de trata | dead-url=no |date=2016-09-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728144115/https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/fecha-juicio-oral-emblematico-trata_0_BJlV0IN6.html | archive-date=2017-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
Women were recruited from various provinces, including [[Santiago del Estero]], [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], and [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], as well as from outside the country. Between 2009 and 2012, Victor Morales published more than 100 ads in [[Buenos Aires]] newspapers.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Two of the ads running in the newspaper Clarin offered waitresses 20,000 pesos per month, and dancers 10,000 pesos per month. Both offered travel expenses to [[Ushuaia]], lodging, and relocation expenses.
&lt;ref name="rescataron"&gt;
{{cite news 
| title= Rescataron a 15 mujeres de una red de trata en Ushuaia

| archive-date= 2017-07-30 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The women who were recruited with these ads discovered that once they had arrived at [[Ushuaia]], they were expected to repay the travel costs. Morales was more honest with a sex worker he recruited through an ad and told her during their initial contact that she would repay him with the money from her sessions with clients.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt; One of the sources who saw transcripts of the police wire taps put it this way:

{{ quote | text= According to the degree of naivety of the person who needed the job, [Morales] revealed more or less data.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; }}

While this approach may have helped persuade more women to travel to [[Ushuaia]], it also meant that some left as soon as they arrived.

Police telephone taps recorded the following conversation:

{{ quote | text=Nancy: Clearly, and the work is?

Victor: Well the work you mix with the public, you are not forced to prostitute yourself if you don't want, that is what you choose, when and how, yes? And the price, at least I put a price that from there up, you can charge more or equal, but not less, that are three hundred pesos fifteen minutes, four hundred the half hour, and five hundred an hour, and then the part, Let's say that it closes to me, that it serves me, the others let's say is a consequence, if you want to do it, you do and if you do not want to do it you do not do it, those are the services yes, but the drinks cost one hundred ...&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; }}

Morales wasn't telling her that both the city and provincial governments would label her a prostitute, the provincial police would fingerprint her, check her criminal record, and open a file on her, or that the city would periodically inspect her genitals, test her for STIs, and maintain a record of the results.

A women who had worked as a professional dancer answered one of Morales' ads for dancers. While Morales explains about selling drinks to "Nancy" in the transcript above, the dancer didn't learn about it until her first night in the nightclub. That was also when she learned that she was expected to make herself available for sexual sessions with the clients. When she objected to working in a brothel, one of the female managers slapped her and fined her four hundred pesos for talking back. She said that one night she hid in a bathroom and the managers beat her and forced her back to the bar.&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt;

In contrast, eleven of the eighteen women at the brothel when the police raided it told investigators that they were there by their own choice. They didn't feel that they had been tricked or that they were being exploited.&lt;ref name="prueba"/&gt;

Over a period of two years, the city of [[Ushuaia]] issued seventy health books to Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Since each health book represents a new employee, the nightclub was recruiting about three new employees every month. Assuming that the nightclub employed an average of eighteen women over that two year time period, the average period of employment would be about six months. Once the nightclub hired a woman, it would need to recruit her replacement six months later.

In addition to ads, women were recruited through informal networks. One woman contacted Morales through a friend. Another was recruited through contacts at Madaho's, a well known bar (strip joint

) in the [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]] neighborhood of [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

=== Living conditions ===
==== Sheik ====
During the trial, lawyers for the [[complainant]] described the women living in rooms off the main hall of the nightclub,&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; which they described as small, dirty, bad smelling, and visited by rats. Kinan described their quarters as a ''zulo'' (a cramped, impoverished living space) lacking hot water, with 2 people sharing a room.&lt;ref name="derogar"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eldiario.com.ar/sociedad/kinan-ldquohay-que-derogar-los-coacutedigos-de-contravencioacutenrdquo-1.htm# | dead-url=no | date=2017-03-26 | title=Kinan: "Hay que derogar los códigos de contravención" | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326165843/http://www.eldiario.com.ar/sociedad/kinan-ldquohay-que-derogar-los-coacutedigos-de-contravencioacutenrdquo-1.htm | archive-date=2017-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a bell in the area of the rooms activated at the bar which was rung to signal to the woman that a client had entered the nightclub.&lt;ref name="conocera"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-el-29-de-noviembre-se-conocera-la-sentencia | dead-url=no | access-date=2017-07-08 | title=Alika Kinan: el 29 de noviembre se conocerá la sentencia | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802011922/https://www.enperspectiva.com.ar/alika-el-29-de-noviembre-se-conocera-la-sentencia/ | archive-date=2017-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each room had its own entrance separate from the nightclub's main entrance and each of the women had their own key.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt;

Prior to the raid on Black &amp; White, the women serviced their clients in their rooms. Testimony at the trial described them using bleach to remove blood and semen stains from their mattresses.&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; In addition to sharing a room with a coworker, each woman was also bringing clients into her room an average of two to three times a night. (See Money section.) With two women in a room, that would be a minimum of four client visits per room per night. There wouldn't have been much privacy.

A post on a monger board made in 2006 says that Sheik had four bedrooms, which matches with other testimony. However, the post says that Sheik had eighteen women working there at the time.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
If they were all living at the brothel, that would be four women in each of two rooms and five women in each of the other two, with a corresponding number of client visits to each room every night. Even if some of the women were living and servicing their clients off-site, it would have been pretty crowded.

==== Black &amp; White ====
Unlike Sheik, the women at Black &amp; White lived off-site. They shared a house with coworkers and paid 300 pesos rent per month.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; Rent for one room in [[Ushuaia]] can go as high as 15,000 pesos per month,&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; so the rent charged by Black &amp; White was not unreasonable for shared living space. The nightclub had two rooms where the women and their clients had their sessions,&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; so the women weren't bringing clients into their living space.

While the women at Sheik had keys to their living quarters, one witness reported being barred from leaving the house where Black &amp; White's employees lived. She said that there were three men who lived in the house who transported them between the house and the nightclub. When she wanted to walk out of the house onto the street in order to have a phone conversation with relatives without house mates around, the men prevented her from leaving.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt;

In contrast, Kinan was working at Black &amp; White during all but a few months of the first three years she lived in [[Ushuaia]]. During this period she rented a place for her sister to live in, which suggests that she was free to travel around the city and conduct business.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; The dancer who objected to being tricked into working at a brothel sometimes left the house on her own and was allowed to use a computer with Internet access.&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt;

One of the women was mentally ill, and the prosecutors said that she was imprisoned. From the prosecutors statements, it's impossible to tell if the brothel recruited her inadvertently and didn't know how to care for her properly while they figured out how to get rid of her, or if they were taking advantage of her illness in some way.

=== Interaction with clients ===
==== Sheik ====
The city is far enough south that during the summer there is daylight twenty four hours a day. The premises opened at 8 pm.&lt;ref name="sinFin" /&gt; The police testimony at the trial described women arriving at the nightclub from the living quarters.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; The women were required to be on duty from 11 pm to 6 am, and received one day off each week.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; (In one interview, Kinan said that the work shift started at 11:30 pm.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;) However, Kinan testified that shifts could extend to 8 am or even 2 pm.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; There was a listing near the bar with prices for drinks and women. The women were available for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; Police witnesses said that men started arriving at the nightclub around midnight, and women would leave with the men, returning alone.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; When a customer left the nightclub with a woman, he had to pay the nightclub the price of a cup or half a cup, depending on how long the woman was going to be gone. (The nightclub paid 20 pesos for a drink and charged the customers 150 pesos, which the owner himself described as "cheating the customers".)&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt;

When the women first arrived at [[Ushuaia]], the nightclub seems to have given them names to use while working. Kinan was given the name "Carla".&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; The women wore shorts or dresses while working, with tops, exaggerated high heels, and carefully styled hair. Clothing was brightly colored. Police officers described the clothing as scanty and less than is normally worn in a pub.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; (This may be an exaggeration. The [https://www.diomedia.com/stock-photo-prostitutes-in-ushuaia-argentina-image8281289.html two sex workers in a photo taken at the Black &amp; White Club] in [[Ushuaia]] look like any two women at a bar.)

Women were not allowed to wear the same clothes two days in a row and were required to smell like imported perfume. According to the owner Montoya, they were to be "fine whores".

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nightclub Black &amp; White had been raided about six months before the police raid at Sheik. Prior to the raid at Black &amp; White, the women at Sheik had serviced their clients in the rooms where they lived. After the raid at Black &amp; White, the women and their clients left Sheik and either went to the client's home or to a hotel room.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

Women who were menstruating were required to stanch the flow with a sponge to avoid getting the client dirty.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

Kinan described her clients as

{{ quote | text=politicians, municipal officials, government officials, even a commissioner would come and get me. Also those of fishing vessels and foreign tourists. And those who were going to ski that left the women in the hotels.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; }}

Until the raids, ''quecos'', or tours of the brothels, were an accepted male pastime.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ushuaiaLists"/&gt;

Women could be fined for refusing a client, for client complaints, or "delaying too much" with a client (i.e. going over the allotted time).&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt; For poor single women supporting children, the fines were coercive. If a woman tried to avoid a fine by accepting a client with a bad reputation and showed displeasure during an abusive session, she could end up earning less if the client complained and she was fined. The women's ability to manage or negotiate client behavior was considerably reduced. Even the fine for "delaying too much" placed her at the client's mercy. Kinan describes the result:

{{ quote | text=... you find yourself with a crazy boy, a healthy son of the patriarchy, who breaks your ass, who leaves the vagina hanging, with everything that indicates an aggressive sexual act ... I could not handle them when they removed the condom, they would put me on all fours and they would break me. There are no women with rights inside a brothel.
&lt;ref name="extrema"&gt;

| archive-date= 2017-07-28 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The nightclub had installed bells in the women's rooms that they could ring if they needed help, for example if a client became violent. However, Kinan testified that often no one would come, the excuse being that the manager was busy with customers.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; In addition, women were expected to encourage clients to buy them the nightclub's overpriced drinks. The constant consumption of alcohol further reduced the women's ability to handle badly behaved clients. Kinan tells the following story, which illustrates the combined effects of coercive fines, too much alcohol, and managerial indifference:

{{ quote | text=One day I was smoking a cigarette and I see one of the girls, very young, Correntina, 18, who goes with an old man we already knew was terrible, a degenerate. Then I tell the manager not to let her go with that degenerate because she was very little. And he says, "Well, well, you're going to work." I say "poor girl," but I finished my cigarette and left, but then I see that he starts asking for the Fresita champagne, and takes seven in a period of an hour and a half, got drunk, a terrible state. I am very motherly, I always tried to take care of my companions, then I see that he is going to ask for the keys of the room where they had sex, and I tell the manager not to give them to him. But he leaves and I continue with what I was doing, I am preoccupied with my own work and I forget, it wasn't my job to monitor her, nor to take care of her, I had to take care of myself, for that there were the managers and so on. Then it was like five o'clock in the morning and the little girl appeared crying, she was still very drunk, and she says "he took me without a condom", and she tells me that she had fallen asleep from her drunkenness and he had raped her, I didn't know if there were one, five, or how many they had put into the room, and the manager only told her to take a bath in order to go to the hospital to ask for the pill the day after. And nobody saw anything, nobody heard anything, everything was covered because he was a customer and customers had to be taken care of.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In at least one instance, the managers punished a women who used a bottle to defend herself against four clients who wanted to rape her. The information source doesn't say what the punishment was, only that it lasted a month. Her offense was failing to serve the clients well.
&lt;ref name="juicio"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of condoms, if a client was too forceful during penetration and tore one, the women got a syringe full of vinegar in the vagina.&lt;ref name="derogar"/&gt;

In regard to her experience with violent clients, Kinan says:

{{ quote | text= I have fought, my whole mouth is broken, because I fought to survive, with guys, with girls, guys might have paid me for a hotel and then they wanted to get me the same money they had given me because I do not know they did not like me, or they took too long and I had to go because I had to respond to a house, before the traffickers. [She had to return to the brothel.] Then they told me that they did not pay me anything or that I stayed until they told me. You have to endure rapes, consented or not, it is still a rape, if you are about to [be killed] you have to consent to a rape.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

==== Black &amp; White ====
The brothel operated from midnight to 6 am. According to an employee, the nightclub had the same clients found at Sheik: "... policemen, high-ranking officials, gendarmes and municipal personnel."&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; The fines were similar to the fines imposed at Sheik, and a client complaint or a session that went over its allotted time could cost a woman over half of her share of the earnings from the session.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt;

=== Alcohol and drugs ===
{{ quote | text=Alcohol and drugs were good options to be able to make this situation more bearable.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

... we were forced to consume alcohol, we had to drink a lot, we used drugs to resist the long nights.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt; }}

Aside from numbing effects of alcohol, the women were being paid to sell and consume drinks. The drinks the women persuaded the men to buy were an important source of income for both the women and the brothel. When a woman approached a potential client, she would tell him to buy her a drink.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; If a women averaged two to three sessions per night (see Money section), that suggests that a woman's clients bought her at least two drinks on the average night. Since she was getting a share of the earnings from the drinks, it was in her interest, financially if not in terms of health, to persuade clients to buy her more. According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, drinking more than three drinks per night or seven drinks per week is high-risk drinking for a woman.
&lt;ref name="highRiskDrinking"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brothels didn't sell drugs as part of their business, but they were present. They show up in Kinan's interviews as part of the environment she worked in. If a client paid for an hour with a woman and wanted her to do a line of coke with him, the ever-present threat of fines and the pressure to keep the client happy would have made it hard to refuse. Stimulants would also counter the effects of alcohol and help the woman stay alert enough to continue working into the morning.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt;

=== Money ===
==== Sheik ====
Police officers who entered Sheik undercover said that women would approach the clients and tell them to buy them a drink, which was paid for at the bar.&lt;ref name="chicas"/&gt; When the women and their clients conducted their sessions at a hotel, payment for the room was made at the bar.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt; However, the women seem to have collected the payment for their services directly from the clients and paid the nightclub's share to the manager.&lt;ref name="dia03"/&gt; As mentioned in the Ushuaia section above, the women turned half of the money over to the nightclub.

The nightclub kept all the money for the first five drinks a woman persuaded customers to buy in one night, and then split the proceeds with the woman for all successive drinks. Kinan said that an average night for one woman was eighteen drinks and eight sessions with clients.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; (The Black &amp; White section below gives an estimate of two to three clients per night.) Given the high price of the drinks, the women's share of the proceeds from their sale was probably an important source of income for them.

Reportedly, they were forced to buy clothes, shoes, jewelery, perfumes and condoms from the nightclub. Women were fined for taking too long to come when the bell was rung, for not cleaning, for taking longer than the client paid for, for taking a day off, for refusing to have sex with a client, and for a number of other offences.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dia05"/&gt;

Kinan described how the managers maintained the ''libro de pases''. In the brothel trade, a ''pase'' is a session in which a prostitute provides sexual services to a client. A ''libro de pases'' is basically a log of the brothel's business activities.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

==== Black &amp; White ====
The recruitment pitch quoted above gives minimum prices for sessions of between 300 and 500 pesos, depending on the time involved. Actual prices were between 600 and 800 pesos. The women kept 60% to 70% of the fee. Black &amp; White had the same system of fines as Sheik, with fines for being late, not cleaning, and going over the time the client had paid for, and so on. Most fines were around 300 pesos. The women where charged 400 pesos for each of the city's health inspections.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt; The brothel transported women to [[Ushuaia]] by buying their airline tickets, and the women paid the brothel back from their earnings.

According to the testimony of the managers, each women generated 900 pesos a night in earnings for the brothel.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Since the brothel was keeping 30% to 40% of the client fees, and the women were charging between 600 and 800 pesos, and the brothel was earning money from the drinks the women sold, then the women were probably averaging two to three men per night, less than half of Kinan's estimate. That would have made traffic through the two brothel bedrooms a lot more manageable.

When the nightclub was raided, none of the women had more than fifteen pesos with them. Their earnings were held by the Morales family, "for safety."&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; If they didn't have access to a bank, the house where they lived and where they had no control over who their house mates were was probably not a secure place to keep large sums of cash. Banking with the Morales family was probably more secure than cash under the mattress.

=== Credit and debt bondage ===
Claudia Quiroga, who managed Sheik at an earlier time, paid for the airline tickets that brought the women to [[Ushuaia]], bought clothes, paid for lodging, and the women paid her back from their earnings. Kinan described this as credit extended from Quiroga personally,&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; and the owner testified at his trial that the manager at the time of the police raid paid for the women's airplane tickets out of her salary.&lt;ref name="dia04"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-4 | dead-url=no | date=2016-11-11 | title=Juicio de Alika. Día 4 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807045002/http://lasrojas.com.ar/juicio-de-alika-dia-4/ | archive-date=2017-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably, the women would have repaid the manager and not the nightclub. This seems to show the managers personally making loans to the sex workers. On the other hand, the managers who made loans were part owners, and there may have been no clear line between their money and the nightclub's money.

At least some of the women who worked at Sheik arrived in such a state of poverty that the nightclub or its managers had to extend credit for the airplane fare, clothes for the women to wear while working, and housing. The employees would not have been able to work at Sheik and the nightclub would not have been able to recruit and keep employees without making loans to them.

Kinan has said "Every time we said we wanted to leave, we were told that we could not because we had debts,"&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; which suggests that employees were bound to the nightclub by [[debt bondage]]. Furthermore, the nightclub held the women's documentation,&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; which may have made it difficult to travel or leave the nightclub. However, Kinan was working at the Black &amp; White in 1996, which means she changed employer just a few months after she started working at Sheik.&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt; Without an accounting of the women's debts and a record of their movement between employers and into and out of the city, it's impossible to know how bound to their employers the women were.

[[Debt bondage]] usually involves high interest rates, which sometimes cause the debt to grow faster than it can be paid off. However, none of the available information on loans made to Sheik's employees mention interest. That, plus the personal nature of the loans, suggests that the nightclub wasn't making money off the loans. On the other hand, it's entirely possible that managers tried to stop women from leaving before they had repaid loans owed to the managers personally.

The many and intrusive fines could have been a cause of debt bondage. If the fines were levied often enough they could have caused the women's debts to grow faster than they could pay them off. But again, the women seemed to move between brothels on their own initiative. The fines seemed to be more effective as a means of control while the women were employed than as a means of keeping them from leaving employment.

When Kinan first arrived in [[Ushuaia]], the city was at the end of a manufacturing boom. Factory wages in [[Ushuaia]] were twice as high as they were in [[Buenos Aires]]. [[Baumol's cost disease]] indicates that service wages, including sex work wages, would also be doubled. But the cost of living was three times as high, meaning that both factory and service workers were earning less in real terms.&lt;ref name="trouble"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=122 | dead-url=no | date=1995-07-02 | title=Trouble in world's southernmost city | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729131819/http://www.luxner.com/cgi-bin/view_article.cgi?articleID=122 | archive-date=2017-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During both periods that Kinan was working in [[Ushuaia]] as a sex worker, the cost of living was higher than more northern parts of Argentina. Anyone moving there for higher wages would discover that they were having trouble retaining the extra money they were earning. When the women at Sheik complained about not being able to hold on to a single peso, their complaints may have been due as much to the cost of living as to the fines and costs the brothel was imposing on them.

=== Children ===
{{ quote | text=I arranged for my daughters to be cared for away from me, so that they would not see the mother they had.

[After the raid] all I wanted was to be with my daughters&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

Aside from feelings of shame, it simply would not have been possible to raise children in the brothel. The shared living spaces, the presence of clients and the sexual services provided in the living spaces, the working hours that extended to 6 am or later, and the sale of alcohol all ruled out the presence of children.

All of the women were mothers and all of them were living apart from their children. When Kinan's life was turned upside down by the police raid, her first impulse was to return to her children. A full understanding the situation of Kinan and her coworkers would require an accounting of child care costs, knowing who provided child care and on what terms, and the complex of contradictory feelings they had toward their job and their children. That information isn't available.

=== Leaving employment ===
==== Sheik ====
As mentioned in the Recruitment section, sex workers in [[Ushuaia]] were recruited from all over Latin America, and Sheik itself had at least one recruiter. None of the available sources talk about leaving employment, but the presence of a recruiter shows that recruitment required more effort than the managers could devote to it on their own. Sheik employed only seven women and wasn't expanding its workforce, which indicates that women were leaving as fast as they were being recruited. As the city of the world closest to Antarctica, [[Ushuaia]] is isolated, has a harsh climate, and a small population. It doesn't attract a lot of people, making it necessary for the brothels to recruit from many countries to replace women leaving the city.

According to Kinan, women who behaved badly passed to other businesses where working conditions were worse.&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; The owner of Sheik testified during the trial that he had had problems with Kinan and another woman and had intended to fire them.&lt;ref name="dia04"/&gt; However, he never did, which suggests that he would have had trouble replacing them.

As mentioned above, Kinan changed employers once and left the brothel to move to [[Spain]]. The owner of Sheik reported hiring from other brothels and getting phone calls from women who wanted to work for him. If the constant debts and the withholding of documentation were intended to bind the workers to their employers, the measures weren't entirely successful.

==== Black &amp; White ====
If, as indicated in the Recruitment section above, Black &amp; White was recruiting three new employees every month, then it was also losing three employees every month. Women were leaving six months after they were hired. Victor Morales' less-than-honest recruitment pitch resulted in some women leaving as soon as they arrived. The woman who was unnerved by the security cameras simply lifted the chain and walked out the door.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One might imagine that the women who stayed would be the ones who had previous experience with sex work and were used to the work, but that's not necessarily the case. The two sex workers recruited from [[Rosario]] left at the first opportunity.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt;

One of the women taken into custody during the raid was about to be transferred to another province because "she was a problem for the owner," according to one of her coworkers.
&lt;ref name="saltena"&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another woman was told that she was going to be sent to [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="rossi"/&gt; There's no mention of anyone actually being sent to another location, so these may have been empty threats made in an attempt to control someone's behavior.

While employed, the women didn't have possession of their earnings, which were held by the Morales family.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; This gave the managers an obvious way of collecting debts, provided the debt wasn't larger than the money the family held. In theory, the managers could have tried to prevent women from leaving the brothel by threatening to withhold their earnings, but none of the women appear to have complained about this happening. The fact that the cycle of recruitment and exit was so routine suggests that their exits were usually mutually agreed upon and the women left with their money.

The brothel held the identification documents of its employees. Almost all of them were at the bar in the nightclub, although a few were held in the owner's home.&lt;ref name="clanMorales"/&gt; Getting a certificate of loss of documentation from the police is a matter of routine. The government of Argentina currently promises to provide replacement DNI cards within fifteen days of receiving an application. In the days of the ''libreta'' it reportedly could be done in a week to six weeks if there were no problems. Someone leaving the brothel and leaving their ID booklet behind could probably get a replacement.

The underage immigrant sex worker mentioned earlier that Morales recruited to work at the brothel doesn't seem to have been bound to the brothel when the managers held her documentation. When Morales recruited her, she was a seventeen year old immigrant from Paraguay who had been doing sex work prior to meeting him. She worked for him for two and a half years before leaving and making her way back to [[Buenos Aires]]. Several months after returning to [[Buenos Aires]] and just shortly before the police raid on Black &amp; White, Morales showed up on her doorstep asking her to come back to the brothel.&lt;ref name="polemicas"/&gt; She was clearly an employee that Morales wanted to keep, but either he returned her documentation when she wanted to leave, or lack of documentation didn't stop her from leaving and traveling across the country. If she returned to [[Buenos Aires]] without documentation, she either had it replaced or managed without it.

At both Sheik and Black &amp; White, fines, debt, and confiscating ID documentation may have helped managers control employee behavior, but they don't seem to have been particularly effective in preventing women from leaving. The ones that stayed the longest seemed to be the ones that had the worst job prospects. Alika Kinan and the Paraguayan immigrant both started sex work at seventeen because they couldn't support themselves any other way. Both came to [[Ushuaia]] in search of better paid sex work. Both left after working in the brothels for roughly three years. Kinan returned after eleven years of marriage left her with three children and no better job prospects. Length of employment seems to have had more to do with poverty and lack of alternative jobs than anything else.

=== Self-image ===
Immediately after the police raid at Sheik, all of the women denied being victims of trafficking and stated that they were sex workers who had been hired to do sex work.&lt;ref name="procesaron"/&gt; Two of them, Alika Kinan and another woman who has not been publicly identified, changed their minds and testified as victims during the trial, which occurred four years after the raid.

Kinan described herself and her coworkers at the time of the police raid:

{{ quote | text=We felt like criminals.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

When the rescue occurs I deny that I am a victim of trafficking, I said that I was not a victim and that I wanted to leave. I had just been taken from where I was and was my only source of income. At that time I had four daughters and I wanted to run and look for them and I felt guilty, I felt that I had committed a crime ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

On her work:

{{ quote | text=The concept I had was that the bitch is the one who goes to bed with someone and does not charge, so I'm a prostitute because I lie down and I charge, inside everything I was proud of that.

== Victim ==
In October 2012 Argentinian authorities raided Sheik.&lt;ref name="esclava" /&gt; Kinan and six other people retained were determined by the prosecuting authorities to be trafficking victims.&lt;ref name="denouncer" /&gt; This made her angry, but she gradually came to agree. She says that the thing that led her to change her mind was a question from the prosecutor's secretary:

{{ quote | text=If you analyze your history, that of your mother, that of your grandmother, that of your aunts, what do you think Is it going to be the destiny of your daughters?&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

This was followed by what she describes as a long, agonizing process of self-reflection.

{{ quote | text= The first year is terrible, it is a process of denial, you can not believe everything that is happening to you, you are trying to reconcile at a family level, a series of things, and it is not easy.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

The city of [[Ushuaia]] supplied her with housing for one month and twenty days.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; The house had been declared uninhabitable by the Ministry of Social Development several months previously.

At one point Kinan says her family almost died from fumes from a faulty water heater. The authorities response was to shut off the gas, leaving them without heating.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; (Mean temperature in [[Ushuaia]] in the warmest month of the year is below 50&amp;nbsp;°F.) When the city tried to evict her at the end of the term,&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; she turned to the María de los Angeles Foundation (founded by the mother of [[Marita Verón]]) for help, and the foundation's lawyers informed her that she was entitled to decent housing, work, subsidies, and to be reinserted into society.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; Kinan said:

{{ quote | text=I go back to the prosecution and I tell them that I was pressured to recognize myself as a victim and that now nobody wanted to represent me, that I had no psychologist and was in a house without heating. They destroyed me, made me recognize something that I never wanted to recognize, and when I recognize it, it turns out that I do not have the rights.&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt; }}

Through the intervention of governor Fabiana Ríos, Kinan was granted a plot of land by the city of [[Ushuaia]] and a subsidy of 250,000 pesos to build a house. She signed a contract for 259,224 pesos for the house construction, but the contractor was apparently unable to carry out the contract. As the Court of Accounts was setting a deadline and threatening to sue for return of the subsidy, the State Attorney filed a case for eviction, to remove Kinan and her family from the temporary housing she was living in until the new house was built.

Her lawyer claimed that the necessary documents had been filed a month previously. He pointed out that it's not possible to build a house in [[Ushuaia]] for 250,000 pesos, and the prefab housing company Kinan signed a contract with couldn't meet the city's documentation requirements. In the end, he was able to stave off the eviction, but Kinan's temporary house continued to be unheated.

Kinan became a [[complainant]] in the criminal case against her managers, and simultaneously filed a civil suit against her ex-managers and the municipality of [[Ushuaia]].&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; The legal theory behind the civil suit seems to have been the following: The city conducted regular medical exams on each sex worker in the city's brothels and recorded the results in a book the city maintained for each sex worker. In doing this with each of the city's prostitutes, the city regularized prostitution and became legally complicit in any trafficking that occurred. When her ex-managers were convicted of trafficking in the criminal case, the city became liable for the harm Kinan suffered as a prostitute under the city's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt;

A social worker writing the initial report on Kinan concluded that she had not been a victim because she had not been submissive. When Kinan came to view herself as a victim, she made a claim to the authorities for her rights as a victim of [[trafficking]], but was not recognized. She appealed to the courts, which refused her because the judge held that she had consented. At the next level of appeal, the [[appellate court]] found that there was a possibility that she had been a [[trafficking]] victim, but since she had not declared herself a victim when her employer was raided, she could not do so now.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; None of the available sources describe how this was resolved, but eventually she was recognized as a victim.

== Leadup to trial ==
On November 19, 2011, a woman from [[Tucumán province]] in [[Argentina]] filed a complaint, claiming that she had been exploited in a brothel called Sheik in [[Ushuaia]]. She claimed that she lived there with other women, between the ages of twenty one and twenty eight, who were natives of Argentine, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia. On April 12, 2012, the head of Prosecutor's Office for Trafficking and Exploitation of Persons filed a formal complaint in the Federal Court of Ushuaia against the brothel.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After an investigation, the National Gendarmerie raided the nightclub on October 8, 2012.&lt;ref name="operativo"/&gt;

The lead up to the trial involved the usual legal maneuvering. Originally there were six defendants, but three were dismissed by the investigating judge. The first of these was Claudia Quiroga, Pedro Montoya's ex-wife, who owned the property where Sheik was located and had been Montoya's business partner. The second was Corina Sánchez, who had been the on-site supervisor. These two were no longer involved with the brothel at the time of the raid. The third person dismissed from the trial was Jorge Etcheverry, recruiter and brother of Ivana García, Montoya's girlfriend and business partner when the raid occurred.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt;

Kinan's lawyer objected to the dismissals. The investigating judge had postponed Kinan's testimony repeatedly, and eventually dismissed the three without evidence from Kinan. Her lawyer insisted that Kinan could "provide evidence, new data, more information regarding these accused and what their responsibility is."&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; She appealed the dismissals, but they were sustained and the trial headed for the court date with only three defendants.

A week before the trial began, Kinan's sister and ex-husband began criticizing her publicly. The sister, Maria Fernanda, who still lives in Europe, sent Kinan's ex-husband a video&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; of a sexual scene in which the female was purportedly one of Kinan's daughters. It was later proved that the video did not involve her daughter.
&lt;ref name="necesitan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Kinan's sister claimed that she had received it from someone in [[Ushuaia]]. Maria Fernanda said there was no truth in her sister's claims and she was concerned for her nieces. Kinan's ex-husband released the video to a journalist and claimed that his daughters were at risk. He was living in Scotland and said he couldn't afford to travel to [[Ushuaia]], but offered to testify against his ex-wive via videoconference.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;

She also began getting threats.&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; On a street in downtown [[Ushuaia]], a group of people shouted ""Be careful what you are going to say at the trial." She received threats and insults on her cell phone and through her Facebook account. The trial prosecutor called the threats "a well organized operation." The week before the trial she felt so threatened that she kept herself and her family in the house.
&lt;ref name="amenazan"&gt;

The police guarded her house until the beginning of the trial, and she joined a witness protection program.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;

On a positive note, she got a new personal lawyer for the trial, a woman she felt she could trust: Marcela Rodríguez, the coordinator of the Counseling and Sponsorship Program for Victims of Trafficking in Persons of the Office of the Ombudsman. And a large number of number of social and feminist organizations organized in her support.&lt;ref name="amenazan"/&gt;

== Trial ==
Because she continued to receive threats during the trial, Kinan's protectors restricted her movement and communication. One observer pointed out that the people eventually convicted of trafficking her were not detained and enjoyed complete freedom of movement and communication.&lt;ref name="unaVezMas"/&gt;

Argentina doesn't have separate civil and criminal courts, and the civil and criminal cases against Kinan's managers at the nightclub Sheik were carried out simultaneously before the same panel of judges. During the trial, Kinan testified in a Gesell chamber, so that the accused were not able to witness her testimony.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt; A witness known only as "F" testified under the same conditions.&lt;ref name="finalizo"/&gt;

=== Criminal trial ===
The defendants were charged with violating [[Argentina]]'s anti-trafficking law. The law has a four part test for trafficking: recruitment; transport; receiving and/or harboring persons; and exploitation. (See [[Human trafficking in Argentina]].) The prosecution claimed that the defendants recruited by advertising in media, they transported their victims by advancing money for their plane tickets, and they received and harbored them by meeting them at the airport and bringing them to the brothel and housing them there. To show exploitation they claimed that the victims had characteristics of social vulnerability when recruited, and that they were bound to the brothel by debts and rules that compromised their ability to leave when they chose.&lt;ref name="procesaron"/&gt;

The prosecutors argued that requiring the women to use a sponge during menstruation was proof that the women weren't working willingly. (Many independent escorts use a sponge so their clients won't know that they're menstruating, and some prefer the sponge to the usual tampons and sanitary napkins. However, women vary a lot in the pain they experience during menstruation. Even a woman who usually doesn't have problems may have a bad month. Escorts participating in a discussion of this on an on-line forum said that forcing women to work when they feel bad or need rest is exploitative, even if the sponge itself isn't a problem.
&lt;ref name="sponge0"&gt;

| access-date= 2017-08-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Kinan's lawyer argued that the defendants' actions violated the 1949 UN protocol on trafficking, which [[Argentina]] has signed. (See [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]].) She pointed out that under the protocol, a victim's consent is immaterial.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;

Montoya's lawyer made the following arguments:

{{ quote | text=[The night club was a] duly authorized establishment and the accusation of sex in exchange for money has not been proven and there were no places where they had sex. There is no concrete proof of these federal crimes.&lt;ref name="vigencia"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

He pointed out that Montoya had faced a similar charge in the provincial court in 2011 and the case had been dismissed.

{{ quote | text=... now the same complaint has been reissued in Federal, therefore we will ask for acquittal.&lt;ref name="vigencia"/&gt; }}

Excerpts from Pedro Montoya's testimony:

{{ quote | text=I am being tried for a crime that I consider to be aberrant. I do not consider that I have deviated from the law. I do not see them as victims but rather as majority partners. I am the minority partner of the ladies.

[Trafficking] is a fashionable crime.

This is a trade in which we take advantage of both of a man's needs, because the man needs to go to a place to look for company. The public goes and the women act as psychologists ... Sometimes men went after spending forty days on board.

The girl is in the capacity of entertainer because they are to entertain and be a companion of a person. It is a service of accompaniment or entertainment that is framed in the Collective Agreement of Work according to an ordinance of the Deliberating Council.

[Clients] had to pay the value of a glass for the time that they were going to be absent from the place ... I consider relationships outside the nightclub to be an agreement between two people, it is not my problem.

There was no [criminal] organization here at all. This business made me tired, it caused me psychophysical discomforts and even losses sometimes.&lt;ref name="socio"/&gt;

I asked my lawyer and he answered that we were not guilty of any crime and we were under the ordinances in force, subject to inspections, of all the Armed Forces, Gendarmerie, Police, Migrations, Public Ministry of Labor, Sadaic, Capif, DGR Province and, of course, Municipality Of Ushuaia, licensing organs that always inspected the commercial activity carried out. I always thought I was doing a lawful job.&lt;ref name="vigencia"/&gt; }}

=== Civil trial ===
A team of psychologists and psychiatrists asserted that Kinan suffered from [[PTSD]] which caused sleep disorders and made her afraid of embracing and of touching things that had passed through many hands, such as money. They recommended psychological counseling three times a week for twenty years, which would cost 2,496,000 pesos at current prices. In addition, scars on her face and missing teeth were physical evidence of the violence she had suffered. The experts testified that Kinan is expected to be 70% incapacitated.&lt;ref name="conocera"/&gt;

The municipality of [[Ushuaia]] argued that it had no legal liability because any laws and international treaties violated by the brothel's actions fell under the jurisdiction of the federal and provincial governments, and the city's actions had all been consistent with law. It also pointed out that it was cooperating with a foundation created by Alika Kinan for the purpose of assisting victims of trafficking.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;

The doctor from Ushuaia Regional Hospital who issued the health books testified. When asked if she ever issued health books to men, she said she only issued them to women and "sex change."&lt;ref name="finalizo"/&gt;

== Outcome of trial ==
On 30 November 2016, the court decided in Kinan's favor. The city of [[Ushuaia]] was ordered to pay Kinan 780,000 [[Argentine peso|pesos]] (about US$47,000.) The owner of Sheik received a [[prison sentence]] of seven years and a fine of 70,000 pesos. His girlfriend/business partner got a three-year [[suspended sentence]] and a fine of 30,000 pesos. The woman who managed the club received a three-year [[suspended sentence]].

As part of the suspended sentences, the court placed restrictions on where the two women could reside, required them to avoid overconsumption of alcohol, and ordered them to refrain from using narcotics.

The [[prosecutor]] stated that even though the penalties were less than the prosecution had requested, the [[verdict]] was a change in the way the [[judicial system]] viewed [[sex trafficking]].&lt;ref name="sentencia"/&gt;

== Epilogue ==
On 1 December 2016, the court published the grounds for its decision. At that point the convicted exercised their right of [[appeal]] and remained free. Kinan continues to feel anxiety over the outcome and she's also still getting threats.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The protective personnel provided by the government Program for Rescue were withdrawn.&lt;ref name="unaVezMas"/&gt;

The [[Ushuaia]] city counsel ended the licensing of brothels in 2013, effectively putting them all out of business.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; Many of the women left to continue [[sex work]] elsewhere. Most of them went to [[Punta Arenas]] in [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="denouncer"/&gt; A ferry service connects [[Punta Arenas]] with the island of [[Tierra del Fuego]] where [[Ushuaia]] is located, making it easy to move there. The brothels of southern [[Chile]] are active, operate similarly to the ones driven out of [[Ushuaia]],&lt;ref name="otherMenus"/&gt; and [[Punta Arenas]] is visited by the same types of ships that gave [[Ushuaia]] many of its customers for its sex business.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;

The women left, but they've been replaced. There are still places where you can rent a room for an hour. There's a wider variety of business models, but the dominant one is reportedly the private apartment. While Kinan and her coworkers lived two to a room, the new model is three to an apartment. If sex workers in [[Ushuaia]] benefited from closing the brothels, it was primarily from the change in housing; they now have hot water. Women still come from the same places far away from [[Ushuaia]], but they rotate in and out faster. Advertising is done on the web, where the pictures and names change, but the phone numbers stay the same. Periodically, the police raid an apartment and liberate its occupants, rendering them homeless until they can reconnect with their pimps. While they are working for their pimps, they are plagued by the same system of debts that plagued Kinan and her coworkers. When the police liberate them, they become homeless mothers with no way of supporting their children.&lt;ref name="privados"/&gt; Kinan believes that the official count of rescued women is inflated because many of the women have been rescued one or more times previously.

{{ quote | text=Why do the victims relapse? Because they have no resources, because there are no public policies, because politicians make policy under the banner of "Not One Less" but they haven't filed even one bill that protects women. The trafficking law came without legs, it doesn't function. I am grateful because it rescued me and freed me from a brothel, helped me grow as a militant and empower me. But after I was released, after being told that I was a victim all these years and that I had to go home with my daughters I thought "What do I live for? What I do?" The Law of Trafficking doesn't work without public policies, that is to say, access to housing, therapeutic psychological support for victims of trafficking, reintegration into genuine work and access to education.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt; }}

Kinan currently works at the National University of San Martín, in Buenos Aires, doing research and giving lectures on human trafficking, and organizes activities related to the same topic.

== Kinan on sex work ==
Kinan is an abolitionist opposed to decriminalization. She believes that trafficking can only be abolished by giving women the things that she herself has struggled for.

{{ quote | text=I always insist, when you ask me if I am an abolitionist, yes, I am because I am convinced that if a woman in a state of vulnerability, who is being sexually exploited, you give her or she is given a series of instruments to defend herself in life, education, a well-paid job, not one in the informal economy where she earns little, decent housing where she can support her family even though she is single, I'm sure that woman does not prostitute herself, I'm totally convinced she does not arrive at prostitution. Then, by that point, I consider myself an abolitionist ...&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; }}

In Kinan's view, women enter sex work because they lack housing, jobs, and education. But she also views sex workers as trapped by not understanding that they are victims and have rights.

{{ quote | text=Because you are very afraid, you are not sure if you are a victim or you are not a victim, you don't become aware if you are a victim, if you knew that you were a victim, you would ask for help immediately. Social myth is "Why don't these women who are locked up ask for help at the time? Why don't they come out screaming that they are in these places where they are being exploited sexually, if as a society we know this is wrong?" Because the victims do not know, because they have a great ignorance about international treaties signed by our country, there is a great ignorance that our country is abolitionist.&lt;ref name="carne"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

For Kinan, the alternative to abolishing sex work is regulating it. Her experience of regulation was the medical exams at [[Ushuaia]], where physicians authorized by the city ridiculed and disparaged the sex workers they were examining. This combined with similar treatment from clients leads her to place regulators and clients in interlocking roles.

{{ quote | text=The Municipality set up the sanitary notebooks, very much like Senasa or bromatological analysis. [SENASA is the federal food safety agency in Argentina.] Did you see when you go to buy meat in the supermarket? There you walk down the aisle and you see that everything has passed through sanitary inspections, and that the meat is fit for human consumption. And you are one more piece of meat. The client of prostitution enters the premises and says I'm having a ribeye, or a piece of beef, a hamburger. You feel like the merchandise that has given up its own will, to be consumed, to be raped.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Kinan wants to attack commercialized sex in three steps. First is the end of government regulation and shutting down sex-related businesses via the existing anti-trafficking law. The next step is to eliminate the commodity being sold by giving women the resources that make it unnecessary for them to turn to sex work for survival.

{{ quote | text=At the moment the most important thing is to be able to conjoin the Law of Trafficking with real public policies, that restore the rights of the victims in terms of housing and labor solutions. And the supportive therapy and the ability to provide them with education.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Failure to take this step means that women return to their traffickers.

{{ quote | text=When we talk about Human Rights, it is wonderful that we have the closure of brothels, which are clandestine and non-clandestine centers of torture and sexual exploitation, but what do we do to avoid having the same victim show up in later raids, as has happened?&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

The final step is to eliminate the buyer by criminalizing the client, but this must proceed from the second step described above, which Kinan calls "the restoration of rights."

{{ quote | text=We have a lot of work ahead of us, regarding the restoration of rights, of women who are victims of trafficking and from there to be able to advance in a direct line on the criminalization of the client of prostitution.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

Argentina has a union of sex workers called Ammar that is part of CTA, a trade union federation. As a sex worker, Kinan saw herself as a strong woman doing a difficult job, but she now believes that viewpoint is a part of victimization.

{{ quote | text=I saw myself as a strong woman who had come there because I had no choice, a concept that is also part of the crime of trafficking, because that is what you are made to believe when you enter the circuit.&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt; }}

She has no sympathy for Ammar or other sex worker rights organizations, viewing them as essentially the same as the managers at the brothels where she worked.

{{ quote | text=For me Ammar is a union and acts as such, these women have never stood at the street corners, none of them are kept in the brothels as victims, but they have presided over brothels and have presided over women. My personal opinion is that they are trying to take care of their backs for future raids that are made for the crime of trafficking. It is not innocent that they have gone from claiming rights and guarantees as autonomous prostitutes and today demand the reopening of brothels. Argentina and the Constitution are abolitionist, where clearly we are not going to allow prostitution to exist on behalf of others.&lt;ref name="carne"/&gt; }}

== Discrepancies ==
Part of Alika Kinan's story is the fact that news sources report things about her that are contradicted by other sources. Since there's no way of knowing why different information is being reported a different times, nothing in this section should be taken as evidence that anyone is intentionally being untruthful.

=== Age of arrival at Ushuaia ===
In at least two different interviews, Kinan has apparently said that she was eighteen years old when she arrived at [[Ushuaia]].
&lt;ref name="desesperado"&gt;
{{ cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; Another source said she was fifteen.&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt; She was reportedly born on June 24, 1976.&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; She has said that she was thirty six when Sheik was raided in 2012,&lt;ref name="desesperado"/&gt; and in 2017 she said that she was forty one,&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; both of which would be consistent with a 1976 birth date. Various sources state that she came to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik in 1996.&lt;ref name="juicio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desesperado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="marea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sinFin"/&gt; So she was either nineteen or twenty, and in either case closer to her twentieth birthday than her nineteenth.

=== Time in sex work ===
One source says Kinan was trapped by prostitution for twenty years.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt; Another says that she was trapped in a brothel for nearly twenty years.&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; Another claims that she was "a victim of trafficking networks and male clients for two decades."
&lt;ref name="mundial"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
And another says she was "a victim of forced prostitution for 16 years."&lt;ref name="distinguida"/&gt;

She did sex work in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] for three years, worked in brothels in [[Ushuaia]] for three years, and after returning to [[Ushuaia]] from [[Spain]], worked in one brothel for another two years. These three time periods add up to about eight years.

=== Number of brothels ===
When news reports say that Kinan was trapped in a brothel for twenty years, they're referring to the brothel named Sheik. In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], she worked at a brothel named Aries.&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; In [[Ushuaia]], she worked at both Sheik&lt;ref name="aislada"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calvario"/&gt; and Black &amp; White.&lt;ref name="redito"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sola"/&gt;

=== Entrapment ===
On the subject of entrapment, a writer familiar with the details of Kinan's history wrote that "Alika Kinan was not kidnapped or cheated..."&lt;ref name="incomoda"/&gt;

One news report says that she was held prisoner.
&lt;ref name="heldInBrothel"&gt;
{{ cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The sources cited use the word "trapped" in a context implying some sort of physical coercion. In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] she didn't live in the brothel. The brothel work paid for the place she rented for herself and her younger sister.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While working at Black &amp; White she rented another place for her sister, indicating that she could travel around the city and conduct business.&lt;ref name="esclava"/&gt; While working at Sheik, she had keys to the entrance to her living quarters. She worked under abusive and expolitative conditions, compelled by poverty and the need to support people dependent on her. But she has ruled out physical coercion in two different interviews.&lt;ref name="extrema"/&gt;&lt;ref name="desprender"/&gt;

As far as trickery or deceptive recruiting is concerned, in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] there was no need for the brothel to recruit her. She and her sister were starving, she was desperate, and she had no alternatives. She went to [[Ushuaia]] to work at Sheik because they paid better.&lt;ref name="historia"/&gt; It's not clear why she moved from Sheik to Black &amp; White, but at Sheik she kept fifty percent of the client fees and at Black &amp; White she kept sixty to seventy percent. Also, the women at Black &amp; White didn't have to entertain their clients in their living quarters.&lt;ref name="fallo"/&gt;

=== Number of clients per night ===
In 2015 a news report said that Kinan had up to ten or twelve clients a night.&lt;ref name="heroina"/&gt; In 2016 she estimated an average of eight clients per night.&lt;ref name="tieneFecha"/&gt; In 2017, she told one interviewer that she had seen fifteen to thirty men per night,&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; and she told another that she had twenty to thirty men per night.&lt;ref name="heroina"/&gt;

As stated in the Money section above, brothel revenue data indicates that the women working in the brothels were averaging two to three clients per night.

=== Isolation ===
According to NPR, the women working in the brothel couldn't make friends outside the brothel.&lt;ref name="honoree"/&gt; In [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], Kinan actually did have friends outside the brothel. At both brothels in [[Ushuaia]], she appears to have had freedom of movement outside the brothels. However, [[Ushuaia]] was a small city, everyone knew what she did for a living, and sex work has a lot of stigma. She probably was socially isolated, but mostly because of the stigma associated with her work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4488">[[Image:Grosen adarra jotzen.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Blowing an ox horn in a Basque festival]]

The '''blowing horn''' or '''winding horn''' is a sound device that is usually made of or shaped like an animal horn, arranged to blow from a hole in the pointed end of it. This rudimentary device had a variety of functions in many cultures, in most cases reducing its scope to exhibiting, celebratory or group identification purposes ([[signal instrument]]). On the other hand, it has kept its function and profile in many cattle raising, agricultural and [[hunter-gatherer society|hunter-gatherer societies]].

==Types==
[[Image:Hungary Jaszbereny Lehel.jpg|thumb|The horn attributed to the 10th-century [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] chiefrain [[Lehel]], kept in [[Jászberény]], [[Hungary]].]]

The oldest ones were wood and animal horns (usually ovids and bovids). The earliest findings in Europe are [[Bronze Age]] metal horns, the strength of which resulted in its better endurance of the rigours of time. As a result, previous traces of other materials have vanished, so the oldest surviving animal horn dates back to the [[Late Iron Age]] in [[Visnum]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ancientmusic.co.uk/ancientinstruments/Blowing_Horns.html | title = Blowing horns | publisher = Ancient Music | accessdate = 2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As big horned animals are rarely found in Scandinavia, blowing horns are often made from wood, wound birch bark or bout, called a "lur".

==Uses==
Many horns have been used as sounding cries by ancient societies. A modern day descendant of the horn, the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]], is used to call out orders in military camps.  The hunting horn was used to communicate on a hunt and is still used today in some places.

In [[Biscay]], territory of the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]], following  an old tradition, a practice is being restored to blow the horn from five mountains in the province once a year. These mountains, namely '''[[Gorbea]]''' (4,859&amp;nbsp;ft.), '''Sollube''' (2,251&amp;nbsp;ft),  '''[[Oiz]]''' (3,376&amp;nbsp;ft.), '''[[Ganekogorta]]''' (3,274&amp;nbsp;ft) and  '''Kolitza''' (2,884&amp;nbsp;ft) are dubbed the ''montes bocineros'', meaning the 'hornblower mounts'. According to historic evidence, up to the late 16th century the Biscayne were summoned to the General Council of the Domain of Biscay to be held in the town of [[Gernika]] by playing horns from the summits.

A like function may be attributed to the ''[[pututu]]'', the sound instrument from the [[Andes]]. The device, usually made of a shell or hollowed out cow horn, is used to summon people to a meeting or a festival. In the [[Inca]] period, the messengers spreading throughout Empire known as ''[[chaski]]'' carried along a ''pututu'', which was blown to herald their arrival to a particular place.

In the [[United States]], it is common for a traditional horn to be blown to signify the serving of a buffet. This is a typical lunch time tradition in [[Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.schoolnutrition.org/uploadedFiles/School_Nutrition/101_News/MediaCenter/PressReleases/Press_Release_Articles/Press_Releases/SavedbytheLunchBell.pdf|title=Calling Lunch |publisher=Kentucky Nutrition Council|accessdate=2012-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cheap [[plastic]] [[vuvuzela]]s achieved fame and controversy in the hands of [[Association football|football]] supporters during the [[2010 World Cup]] in [[South Africa]].

==Religion==
One of the more widespread uses for blowing horns today is the [[shofar]], a ram or Kudu horn with a hole drilled through it. The shofar is used mainly for Jewish ceremonies such as [[Rosh Hashana]]. Horns are sometimes used in the other two abrahamic religions also.

Similarly, the [[dungchen]] is a ritual horn used in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In [[modern paganism]] the blowing horn is used to call the Horned God.

The '''Centre for Cross-Cultural Research on Women''' ('''CCCRW''') was established to advance research on women internationally. Prior to the centre being officially created seminars were started in 1972 by academic women (mainly anthropologists) presenting research on women and in particular the universal inferior status of women. This was at the time when the feminist movement was active and the seminars attracted large audiences in what was still male dominated Oxford. It was felt that anthropologists were not looking at research questions such as the place and role of women in society as well as the feminist issues raised from those questions. The centre gave opportunity and space for women researchers to present their findings in public. These seminars have continued weekly every term since 1972 as detailed below. From presenting early papers at the Centre many of the participants have gone onto senior posts in academia and beyond. The founding Director of CCCRW was [[Shirley Ardener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Women|url=https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/series/cross-cultural-perspectives-on-women/|website=www.bloomsbury.com|accessdate=15 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 the CCCRW was formally established at Queen Elizabeth House, the University of Oxford’s International Development Centre. QEH had been the venue for most of the seminars from 1972. Members felt that a public event should mark the beginning of the newly formed Centre and in 1984 the first Commemorative Lecture in celebration of pioneering women anthropologists was given. This was in honour of [[Phyllis Kaberry]] with two other women anthropologists, [[Barbara Ward]] and [[Audrey Richards]], also being commemorated. Details of the lectures from 1984 are given below.

Visiting Fellows formed an important part of the Centre’s programme since its inception. Fellows had their own research plans and follow individualised research or study programmes, with appointed facilitators according to their research needs. They attended seminars, lectures and workshops, and these provide useful opportunities for cross-cultural exchange of research ideas. Fellows were fully integrated into the social activities of the Centre and QEH more generally. They visited the Centre for up to one academic year or for as little as a month, depending on available funding and research time. Issues researched broadly concern with gender, culture and development. The Centre has had over 100 Visiting Fellows. 

Also included in its activities are workshops and conferences, which resulted in many publications (there was a monograph series first with [[Berg Publishers|Berg]] then [http://www.berghahnbooks.com/browse/bysubject/gender-studies Berghahn Books]). The topics discussed in seminars since its beginning is very varied  with relevance to everyday life in many countries and cultures.

In 2002 the name was changed to the [[International Gender Studies Centre]]. [http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/igs The IGS website summarises much of this history] but never mentions the former name.

In July 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2017-02/NEWSLETTER--OCT-2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;, IGS/CCCRW ended its long association with Queen Elizabeth House and moved to [[Lady Margaret Hall]] (LMH).

Molecules that serve in such roles typically are readily [[diffusion|diffusible]] organic [[organic chemical|substances]] of low [[molecular weight|molecular mass]] that derive from [[secondary metabolism|secondary metabolic pathway]]s, but also include [[peptides]]. Chemical ecological processes mediated by semiochemicals may be intraspecific (occurring within a species) or [[Interspecies communication|interspecific]] (occurring between species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Law, JH; Regnier, FE | year=1971 | title=Pheromones |journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume=40 | pages=533–548 | doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.40.070171.002533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical Ecology of Plants ==
Chemical ecology in plants is the study that integrates the chemistry and biological properties of the plants and their interaction with the environment (i.e. microorganisms, phytophagous insects) and their antagonists. Chemical ecology in plants mainly focuses on how plants fight against herbivory by producing various [[Phytochemical|phytochemical compounds]]. This results from the chemistry of the plants and also various chemical relationships that plants with other subgroups such as fungi and bacteria through various [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyer|first=Lee A.|last2=Philbin|first2=Casey S.|last3=Ochsenrider|first3=Kaitlin M.|last4=Richards|first4=Lora A.|last5=Massad|first5=Tara J.|last6=Smilanich|first6=Angela M.|last7=Forister|first7=Matthew L.|last8=Parchman|first8=Thomas L.|last9=Galland|first9=Lanie M.|date=2018-05-25|title=Modern approaches to study plant–insect interactions in chemical ecology|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-018-0009-7.pdf|journal=Nature Reviews Chemistry|language=En|volume=2|issue=6|pages=50–64|doi=10.1038/s41570-018-0009-7|issn=2397-3358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of the primary aerial parts of terrestrial plants is covered by a thin waxy structure known as the [[cuticle]], which has the crucial [[Autecology|autecological]] functions and also plays an important role as an interface in trophic interactions. The cuticle is composed of the cuticular layer and the cuticle proper, which is covered by [[Epicuticular wax|epicuticular waxes]]. Whereas the [[cutin]] fraction is a polyester-type [[biopolymer]] composed of hydroxyl and hydroxy epoxy fatty acids, the cuticular waxes are a complex mixture of long-chain [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] and cyclic compounds. These highly [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] compounds determine the [[Hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic]] quality of the plant surface and together with the microstructure of the waxes, vary in a species-specific manner. The physiochemical characteristics contribute to certain optical features, limit transpiration and influence adhesion of particles and organisms, and as a result prevents it from undergoing [[wilting]]. Apart from that the cuticle acts like a skin for plants which prevents any mechanical damage to them from the external sources which either living organisms or any other abiotic component.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Müller|first=Caroline|last2=Riederer|first2=Markus|title=Plant Surface Properties in Chemical Ecology|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10886-005-7617-7.pdf|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|language=en|volume=31|issue=11|doi=10.1007/s10886-005-7617-7.pdf|issn=0098-0331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various ways in which chemical ecology can be evidenced in plants, such as the relationship between [[Fungus|fungi]] and plants is called [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizae]]. Fungi produces a chemical which [[Decomposition|decomposes]] organic matter to which enable the plant roots to increase its surface area to obtain to those nutrients through the help of the [[Root hair|root hairs]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs-rsc-org.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/en/content/articlepdf/2015/np/c4np00166d|title=Memorial University Libraries - Proxy Login|website=pubs-rsc-org.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interactions with Microorganisms ===
The most important thing that makes it possible for [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] to interact with the plants is their ability to establish themselves on the plants surface. In order for the living organisms to establish onto the surface of the plants they need to break the hydrophobic layer of the plant. To do this, the microorganisms secrete special fluids which break down the fats from the cuticle. As a result they are able to establish themselves over the surface.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Growth in Plants ===
Most of the [[Hormone|hormones]] in plants are concentrated on their tips. The [[Auxin|auxin hormones]] are responsible for growth of plants and are stimulated by certain stimulus such as light. This phenomenon is called [[phototropism]]. This growth enables the plant to obtain essentials such as sunlight which is very necessary for the [[photosynthesis]].  Therefore, the cuticle is one of the fundamental parts of the plant due to its physical and chemical properties such as waxy and thin like structure that enables it to be adapted to various mechanism such as [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobicity]], interactions with microorganisms and growth of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=GsAJUo2BsTMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=chemical+ecology+plants&amp;ots=zzhqQ3bDBB&amp;sig=m9pFUkXLX9fFPTtEhqCpaEWV1l0#v=onepage&amp;q=chemical%20ecology%20plants&amp;f=false|title=Chemical Ecology|last=Sondheimer|first=Ernest|date=2012-12-02|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780323154666|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Chlaenius Plate 10 Eisner et al 1963.png|thumb|Series from a study by [[Thomas Eisner|Eisner]] and colleagues investigating [[Chemical defense|defensive]] spray in [[Bombardier beetle|bombardier beetles]].

=== Plant-Insect Interaction ===
The chemical ecology of plant-insect interaction is a significant subfield of chemical ecology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mithfer|first=Axel|title=Chemical Ecology of Plant–Insect Interactions|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9781444301441.ch9|work=Molecular Aspects of Plant Disease Resistance|pages=261–291|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444301441.ch9|isbn=9781444301441|access-date=2018-08-21|last2=Boland|first2=Wilhelm|last3=Maffei|first3=Massimo E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dyer|first=Lee A.|last2=Philbin|first2=Casey S.|last3=Ochsenrider|first3=Kaitlin M.|last4=Richards|first4=Lora A.|last5=Massad|first5=Tara J.|last6=Smilanich|first6=Angela M.|last7=Forister|first7=Matthew L.|last8=Parchman|first8=Thomas L.|last9=Galland|first9=Lanie M.|date=2018-05-25|title=Modern approaches to study plant–insect interactions in chemical ecology|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-018-0009-7|journal=Nature Reviews Chemistry|language=En|volume=2|issue=6|pages=50–64|doi=10.1038/s41570-018-0009-7|issn=2397-3358}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, plants and insects are often involved in a chemical [[evolutionary arms race]]. As plants develop chemical defences to herbivory, insects which feed on them evolve immunity to these poisons, and in some cases, re-purpose these poisons for their own [[Chemical defense|chemical defence]] against predators. One of the more well-known examples of this is the [[monarch butterfly]], the caterpillars of which feed on the [[Asclepias|milkweed]] plant. Milkweeds contain [[cardenolide]] toxins, but monarch butterfly caterpillars have [[Evolutionary arms race|evolved]] to remain unaffected by the toxin. Instead, they sequester the toxins during their larval stage and the poison remains in the adult, making it unpalatable to predators. Many other such examples of this exist, including ''[[Manduca sexta]]'' (hawkmoth) caterpillars which actively sequester [[nicotine]] found in the [[Nicotiana|tobacco plant]];&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the [[Utetheisa ornatrix|Bella moth]], which secrets a [[quinone]]-containing froth from its head when disturbed by a potential predator obtained from feeding on ''[[Crotalaria]]'' species as a caterpillar.

== Marine Chemical Ecology ==
Marine Chemical Ecology is how organic life in the marine environment use chemicals to eat, interact, reproduce and survive, ranging from microscopic phytoplankton to the many species of crustaceans, sponges, coral and fish.

=== Defence ===
The use of chemicals are often used a means of survival for marine organisms. Some [[Crustacean|crustaceans]] and [[Mesograzer|mesograzers]] use particular [[algae]] and seaweeds as a means of deterrence by covering their bodies in the these plants. These plants produce [[Alcohol|alcohols]] such as pachydictyol-A and dictyol-E, which prevent the [[predation]] of the crustacean. When this seaweed is absent, or another seaweed without these alcohols are worn, the rate that these crustaceans are eaten is much higher. Other crustaceans use their natural defences in conjuncture with produced chemicals to defend themselves. Chemicals within their urine help coordinate them into groups. This combined with their spikes make them a much harder target for predators&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hay|first=Mark E.|date=2009|title=Marine Chemical Ecology: Chemical Signals and Cues Structure Marine Populations, Communities, and Ecosystems|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3380104/|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=1|pages=193–212|issn=1941-1405|pmc=3380104|pmid=21141035}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Others secrete [[mucus]] or [[Toxin|toxins]] that make it difficult for predators to eat them, such as the [[Pardachirus marmoratus]] that use a toxin capable of paralyzing the jaws of a would-be predator. Simply being a certain colour can serve as a defence mechanism, such as some [[Zoantharia|zoanthids]] displaying a wide range of colours. This suggests that they may be toxic to eat, whether they are or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakus|first=Gerald J.|last2=Targett|first2=Nancy M.|last3=Schulte|first3=Bruce|title=Chemical ecology of marine organisms: An overview|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01638991.pdf|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|doi=10.1007/bf01638991.pdf|issn=0098-0331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction ===
The release of chemicals are very important to coordinate marine organisms to reproduce. Some processes are relatively simple, such as attracting one individual to another. Male [[Lamprey|lampreys]] attract ovulating females by emitting a bile that can be detected many metres downstream. Other processes can be more complex, such as the mating habits of crabs. Due to the fact that mating can only be done shortly after the female [[Moulting|moults]] from her shell, [[Pheromone|pheromones]] are produced before and after the moulting process. Male crabs will find and defend the potential mate until the shell has moulted. However due to the cabalistic tendencies of crabs, an additional pheromone is produced to suppresses this urge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Dominance ===
Determining dominance among crustaceans are very closely tied to chemical cues. When crustaceans fight to determine dominance they release urine, which helps to determine the victor. After a fight as concluded both individuals will recognize each other in the future through urine, remembering who is the dominant of the two and thereby avoiding a fight. This can also have an impact on future fights. When an individual is exposed to the urine of a dominant crustacean they will act more submissive, and the opposite effect when they are exposed to the urine of a subdominant individual. When individuals are unable to communicate through urine fights can be more unpredictable, resulting in longer fights.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[ecology]], '''climax community''', or '''climatic climax community''', is a historic term for a biological [[Community (ecology)|community]] of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]] which, through the process of [[ecological succession]]  in the development of vegetation in an area over time, have reached a [[steady state]]. This equilibrium was thought to occur because the climax community is composed of species best adapted to average conditions in that area.  The term is sometimes also applied in [[soil]] development. Nevertheless, it has been found that a "steady state" is more apparent than real, particularly if long-enough periods of time are taken into consideration. Notwithstanding, it remains a useful concept.

The idea of a single climax, which is defined in relation to regional climate, originated with [[Frederic Clements]] in the early 1900s. The first analysis of succession as leading to something like a climax was written by [[Henry Chandler Cowles|Henry Cowles]] in 1899, but it was Clements who used the term "climax" to describe the idealized endpoint of succession.&lt;ref&gt;Cowles, Henry Chandler. 1899. The Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan. Botanical Gazette 27(2): 95-117; 27(3): 167-202; 27(4): 281-308; 27(5): 361-391.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frederic Clements' use of "climax"== 
Clements described the successional development of an ecological communities comparable to the [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] development of individual [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Frederic E. 1916. Plant Succession: An Analysis of the Development of Vegetation. Washington D.C.: Carnegie Institution of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Joel B. 1992. An Entangled Bank: The Origins of Ecosystem Ecology. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a "[[superorganism]]" and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist [[Arthur Tansley]] developed this idea with the "polyclimax"—multiple steady-state end-points, determined by [[edaphic]] factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable, because by definition climax [[vegetation]] is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. [[Henry Gleason]]'s early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation, were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both [[theoretical ecology]] and in vegetation management.  Clements's terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, [[plagioclimax]] and disclimax continued to be used to describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.

Though the views are sometimes attributed to him, Clements never argued that climax communities must always occur, or that the different species in an ecological community are tightly integrated physiologically, or that plant communities have sharp boundaries in time or space. Rather, he employed the idea of a climax community—of the form of vegetation best adapted to some idealized set of environmental conditions—as a conceptual starting point for describing the vegetation in a given area. There are good reasons to believe that the species best adapted to some conditions might appear there, when those conditions occur. But much of Clements's work was devoted to characterizing what happens when those ideal conditions do not occur. In those circumstances, vegetation other than the ideal climax will often occur instead. But those different kinds of vegetation can still be described as deviations from the climax ideal. Therefore, Clements developed a very large vocabulary of theoretical terms describing the various possible causes of vegetation, and various non-climax states vegetation adopts as a consequence. His method of dealing with ecological complexity was to define an ideal form of vegetation—the climax community—and describe other forms of vegetation as deviations from that ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, Christopher. 2007. Method and Metaphysics in Clements’s and Gleason’s Ecological Explanations. Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 38(1): 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing usage of "climax"==
Despite the overall abandonment of climax theory, during the 1990s use of climax concepts again became more popular among some [[theoretical ecologist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Roughgarden, Jonathan, Robert M. May and Simon A. Levin, editors. 1989. Perspectives in Ecological Theory. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors and nature-enthusiasts continue to use the term "climax" in a diluted form to refer to what might otherwise be called mature or [[old growth|old-growth]] communities. The term "climax" has also been adopted as description for a late successional stage for marine macroinvertebrate communities.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg R., S. Agrenius, B. Hellman, H. C. Nilsson, and K. Norling. 2002. Recovery of marine benthic habitats and fauna in a Swedish fjord following improved oxygen conditions. Marine Ecology Progress Series 234: 43-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some contemporary ecologists still use the term "disclimax" to describe an [[ecosystem]] dominated by [[invasive species]] that competitively prevent the re-introduction of once native species. This concept borrows from Clement's earliest interpretation of climax as referring to an ecosystem that is resistant to colonization by outside species. The term disclimax was used in-context by Clements (1936), and despite being an [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] phenomenon which prevents the facilitation and succession to a true climax community, it is one of the only examples of climax that can be observed in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, Frederic E. 1936. Nature and Structure of the Climax. Journal of Ecology. Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 252-284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. 1984. Prairie and plains disclimax and disappearing butterflies, in the central United States. Atala. Vol. 10-12, pp. 20-30&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Communication Research Reports''''' is a quarterly [[peer-reviewed]] academic journal covering [[communication studies]]. It was established in 1984 and is published by [[Routledge]].

The journal specializes in the publication of reports-style manuscripts using social scientific methods (such as quantitative data analysis). The most common type of manuscripts published are research reports, which often feature "scales, causal models, novel correlations, and immediate observations — constitute the 'nuts and bolts' of human communication..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowman |first1=Nicholas |title=Research Reports as the "Nuts and Bolts" of Communication Research |journal=Communication Research Reports |date=13 April 2016 |volume=33 |issue=2 |page=87 |doi=10.1080/08824096.2016.1174536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the journal was rated as the third-most central to the field of [[human communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=Darrin J |last2=Bolkan |first2=San |last3=Holmgrem |first3=Jennifer |last4=Tutzauer |first4=Frank |title=Central journals and authors in communication using a publication network |journal=[[Scientometrics (journal)|Scientometrics]] |date=January 2016 |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=91–104 |doi=10.1007/s11192-015-1774-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abstracting and indexing==

'''Conceptual art''', sometimes simply called '''conceptualism''', is [[art]] in which the [[concept]](s) or [[idea]](s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], technical, and material concerns. Some works of conceptual art, sometimes called [[Installation art|installations]], may be constructed by anyone simply by following a set of written instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302213039/http://www.franklinfurnace.org/history/flow/lewitt/lewitt.html|title=Wall Drawing 811 – Sol LeWitt|archivedate=2 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was fundamental to American artist [[Sol LeWitt]]'s definition of Conceptual art, one of the first to appear in print:

{{quotation|In conceptual art the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sol LeWitt]] "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art", ''Artforum'', June 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Godfrey, author of ''Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas)'' (1998), asserts that conceptual art questions the nature of art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Conceptual Art (Art &amp; Ideas) |author=Godrey, Tony |year=1988 |isbn= 978-0-7148-3388-0 |publisher=London: Phaidon Press Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; a notion that [[Joseph Kosuth]] elevated to a definition of art itself in his seminal, early manifesto of conceptual art, ''Art after Philosophy'' (1969). The notion that art should examine its own nature was already a potent aspect of the influential art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]'s vision of Modern art during the 1950s. With the emergence of an exclusively language-based art in the 1960s, however, conceptual artists such as [[Art &amp; Language]], [[Joseph Kosuth]] (who became the american editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]), and [[Lawrence Weiner]] began a far more radical interrogation of art than was previously possible (see [[Conceptual art#Language and/as art|below]]). One of the first and most important things they questioned was the common assumption that the role of the artist was to create special kinds of [[physical art|material objects]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Kosuth, ''Art After Philosophy'' (1969). Reprinted in Peter Osborne, ''Conceptual Art: Themes and Movements'', Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art &amp; Language, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]: Introduction (1969). Reprinted in Osborne (2002) p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Burn, Mel Ramsden: "Notes On Analysis" (1970). Reprinted in Osborne (2003), p. 237. E.g. "The outcome of much of the 'conceptual' work of the past two years has been to carefully clear the air of objects."&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s, in popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "conceptual art" came to denote all [[contemporary art]] that does not practice the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=tateconceptual&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211013930/http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/turnerprize/history/issue_conceptual.htm ''Turner prize history: Conceptual art'' Tate gallery] tate.org.uk. Accessed August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It could be said that one of the reasons why the term "conceptual art" has come to be associated with various contemporary practices far removed from its original aims and forms lies in the problem of defining the term itself. As the artist [[Mel Bochner]] suggested as early as 1970, in explaining why he does not like the epithet "conceptual", it is not always entirely clear what "concept" refers to, and it runs the risk of being confused with "intention". Thus, in describing or defining a [[work of art]] as conceptual it is important not to confuse what is referred to as "conceptual" with an artist's "intention".

==History==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|[[Marcel Duchamp]], ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]],'' 1917. Photograph by [[Alfred Stieglitz]]]]
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|[[Art &amp; Language]], ''[[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]'' Vol.3 Nr.1, 1974]]
The French artist [[Marcel Duchamp]] paved the way for the conceptualists, providing them with examples of prototypically conceptual works — the [[readymade]]s, for instance. The most famous of Duchamp's readymades was ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), a standard urinal-basin signed by the artist with the pseudonym "R.Mutt", and submitted for inclusion in the annual, un-juried exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York (which rejected it).&lt;ref&gt;
Tony Godfrey, Conceptual Art, London: 1998. p. 28
&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic tradition does not see a commonplace object (such as a urinal) as art because it is not made by an artist or with any intention of being art, nor is it unique or hand-crafted. Duchamp's relevance and theoretical importance for future "conceptualists" was later acknowledged by US artist [[Joseph Kosuth]] in his 1969 essay, ''Art after Philosophy'', when he wrote: "All art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in nature) because art only exists conceptually".

In 1956 the founder of [[Lettrism]], [[Isidore Isou]], developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. This concept, also called ''Art esthapériste'' (or "infinite-aesthetics"), derived from the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] – quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually. The current incarnation ({{as of | 2013}}) of the Isouian movement, Excoördism, self-defines as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

In 1961 the term "concept art", coined by the artist [[Henry Flynt]] in his article bearing the term as its title, appeared in a proto-[[Fluxus]] publication ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henryflynt.org/aesthetics/conart.html|title=Essay: Concept Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, it assumed a different meaning when employed by [[Joseph Kosuth]] and by the English [[Art and Language]] group, who discarded the conventional art object in favour of a documented critical inquiry, that began in [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] in 1969, into the artist's social , philosophical and psychological status. By the mid-1970s they had produced publications, indices, performances, texts and paintings to this end. In 1970 ''Conceptual Art and Conceptual Aspects'', the first dedicated conceptual-art exhibition, took place at the [[New York Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html Artlex.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516162830/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/conceptualart.html |date=2013-05-16 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of formalism and of the commodification of art==
Conceptual art emerged as a movement during the 1960s – in part as a reaction against [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as then articulated by the influential [[New York City|New York]] [[art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]]. According to Greenberg [[Modern art]] followed a process of progressive reduction and refinement toward the goal of defining the essential, [[formalism (art)|formal]] nature of each medium. Those elements that ran counter to this nature were to be reduced. The task of painting, for example, was to define precisely what kind of object a painting truly is: what makes it a painting and nothing else. As it is of the nature of paintings to be flat objects with canvas surfaces onto which colored pigment is applied, such things as [[figurative art|figuration]], 3-D [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] illusion and references to external subject matter were all found to be extraneous to the essence of painting, and ought to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that conceptual art continued this "dematerialization" of art by removing the need for objects altogether,&lt;ref&gt;
Lucy Lippard &amp; John Chandler, "The Dematerialization of Art", ''Art International'' 12:2, February 1968. Reprinted in Osborne (2002), p. 218
&lt;/ref&gt;
while others, including many of the artists themselves, saw conceptual art as a radical break with Greenberg's kind of formalist Modernism. Later artists continued to share a preference for art to be self-critical, as well as a distaste for illusion. However, by the end of the 1960s it was certainly clear that Greenberg's stipulations for art to continue within the confines of each medium and to exclude external subject matter no longer held traction.&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
Conceptual art also reacted against the [[commodification]] of art; it attempted a subversion of the gallery or museum as the location and determiner of art, and the art market as the owner and distributor of art. [[Lawrence Weiner]] said: "Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There's no way I can climb inside somebody's head and remove it." Many conceptual artists' work can therefore only be known about through documentation which is manifested by it, e.g. photographs, written texts or displayed objects, which some might argue are not in themselves the art. It is sometimes (as in the work of [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], [[Yoko Ono]], and Weiner himself) reduced to a set of written instructions describing a work, but stopping short of actually making it—emphasising the idea as more important than the artifact. This reveals an explicit preference for the "art" side of the ostensible dichotomy between art and [[craft]], where art, unlike craft, takes place within and engages historical discourse: for example, Ono's "written instructions" make more sense alongside other conceptual art of the time.

==Language and/as art==
Language was a central concern for the first wave of conceptual artists of the 1960s and early 1970s. Although the utilisation of text in art was in no way novel, only in the 1960s did the artists [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Edward Ruscha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |title=Ed Ruscha and Photography |author= |date=March 1 – June 1, 2008 |work= |publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago |accessdate=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181852/http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/exhibition/ruscha |archive-date=31 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]], and [[Art &amp; Language]] begin to produce art by exclusively linguistic means. Where previously language was presented as one kind of visual element alongside others, and subordinate to an overarching [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] (e.g. [[Synthetic Cubism]]), the conceptual artists used language in place of brush and canvas, and allowed it to signify in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Rorimer, ''New Art in the Sixties and Seventies'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001; p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Of Lawrence Weiner's works Anne Rorimer writes, "The thematic content of individual works derives solely from the import of the language employed, while presentational means and contextual placement play crucial, yet separate, roles."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"&gt;Rorimer, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The British philosopher and theorist of conceptual art [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] suggests that among the many factors that influenced the gravitation toward language-based art, a central role for conceptualism came from the turn to linguistic theories of meaning in both Anglo-American [[analytic philosophy]], and [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralism|post structuralist]] [[Continental philosophy]] during the middle of the twentieth century. This [[linguistic turn]] "reinforced and legitimized" the direction the conceptual artists took.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Osborne, Conceptual Art: Themes and movements, Phaidon, London, 2002. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne also notes that the early conceptualists were the first generation of artists to complete degree-based university training in art.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne (2002), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne later made the observation that contemporary art is ''post-conceptual''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Villa Sucota in [[Como]] on July 9, 2010. It is a claim made at the level of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement).

The American art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] points to the example of [[Roy Ascott]] who "powerfully demonstrates the significant intersections between conceptual art and art-and-technology, exploding the conventional autonomy of these art-historical categories." Ascott, the British artist most closely associated with [[cybernetic art]] in England, was not included in Cybernetic Serendipity because his use of [[cybernetic]]s was primarily conceptual and did not explicitly utilize technology. Conversely, although his essay on the application of cybernetics to art and art pedagogy, "The Construction of Change" (1964), was quoted on the dedication page (to Sol Lewitt) of [[Lucy R. Lippard]]'s seminal ''Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972'', Ascott's anticipation of and contribution to the formation of conceptual art in Britain has received scant recognition, perhaps (and ironically) because his work was too closely allied with art-and-technology. Another vital intersection was explored in Ascott's use of the thesaurus in 1963 [http://telematic.walkerart.org/timeline/timeline_shanken.html], which drew an explicit parallel between the taxonomic qualities of verbal and visual languages – a concept would be taken up in Joseph Kosuth's ''Second Investigation, Proposition 1'' (1968) and Mel Ramsden's ''Elements of an Incomplete Map'' (1968).

==Conceptual art and artistic skill==
[[Image:An Oak Tree (conceptual art installation).jpg|thumb|300px|''[[An Oak Tree]]'' by [[Michael Craig-Martin]]. 1973]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"By adopting language as their exclusive medium, Weiner, Barry, Wilson, Kosuth and Art &amp; Language were able to sweep aside the vestiges of authorial presence manifested by formal invention and the handling of materials."&lt;ref name="Rorimer, p. 76"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An important difference between conceptual art and more "traditional" forms of art-making goes to the question of artistic skill. Although skill in the handling of traditional media often plays little role in conceptual art, it is difficult to argue that no skill is required to make conceptual works, or that skill is always absent from them. [[John Baldessari]], for instance, has presented realist pictures that he commissioned professional sign-writers to paint; and many conceptual performance artists (e.g. [[Stelarc]], [[Marina Abramović]]) are technically accomplished performers and skilled manipulators of their own bodies. It is thus not so much an absence of skill or hostility toward tradition that defines conceptual art as an evident disregard for conventional, modern notions of authorial presence and of individual artistic expression.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Contemporary influence==
The first wave of the "conceptual art" movement extended from approximately 1967 to 1978. Early "concept" artists like [[Henry Flynt]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], and [[Ray Johnson]] influenced the later, widely accepted movement of conceptual art. Conceptual artists like [[Dan Graham]], [[Hans Haacke]], and [[Lawrence Weiner]] have proven very influential on subsequent artists, and well known contemporary artists such as [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]] or [[Tracey Emin]] are sometimes labeled "second- or third-generation" conceptualists, or "[[post-conceptual]]" artists.

Many of the concerns of the conceptual art movement have been taken up by contemporary artists. While they may or may not term themselves "conceptual artists", ideas such as anti-commodification, social and/or political critique, and ideas/information as medium continue to be aspects of contemporary art, especially among artists working with [[installation art]], [[performance art]], [[net.art]] and [[electronic art|electronic]]/[[digital art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptual Art – The Art Story|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-conceptual-art.htm|website=theartstory.org|publisher=The Art Story Foundation|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1917 : ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], described in an article in ''[[The Independent]]'' as the invention of conceptual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensher |first=Philip |title=The loo that shook the world: Duchamp, Man Ray, Picabi |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/the-loo-that-shook-the-world-duchamp-man-ray-picabi-784384.html |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' (''Extra'') |date=2008-02-20 |pages=2–5 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1953 : [[Robert Rauschenberg]] creates ''[[Erased De Kooning Drawing]]'', a drawing by [[Willem de Kooning]] which Rauschenberg erased. It raised many questions about the fundamental nature of art, challenging the viewer to consider whether erasing another artist's work could be a creative act, as well as whether the work was only "art" because the famous Rauschenberg had done it.
* 1955 : Rhea Sue Sanders creates her first text pieces of the series ''pièces de complices'', combining visual art with poetry and philosophy, and introducing the concept of complicity: the viewer must accomplish the art in her/his imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bénédicte Demelas: Des mythes et des réalitées de l'avant-garde française. Presses universitaires de Rennes, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1956 : [[Isidore Isou]] introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
* 1957: [[Yves Klein]], ''Aerostatic Sculpture (Paris)''. This was composed of 1001 blue balloons released into the sky from [[Galerie Iris Clert]] to promote his ''Proposition Monochrome; Blue Epoch'' exhibition. Klein also exhibited 'One Minute Fire Painting' which was a blue panel into which 16 firecrackers were set. For his next major exhibition, ''The Void'' in 1958, Klein declared that his paintings were now invisible and to prove it he exhibited an empty room.
* 1958: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Das Theater ist auf der Straße''/''The theater is on the street''. The first [[Happening]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-morsbroich.de/index.php?id=vorschau&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_mbausstellungen_pi1%5Bexhibition%5D=40&amp;ftu=17c0865f7589ebcedf2cba1501860715|title=Vorschau – Museum Morsbroich|author=ChewingTheSun|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1960: [[Yves Klein]]'s action called ''A Leap Into The Void'', in which he attempts to fly by leaping out of a window. He stated: "The painter has only to create one masterpiece, himself, constantly."
* 1960: The artist Stanley Brouwn declares that all the shoe shops in Amsterdam constitute an exhibition of his work.
* 1961: [[Wolf Vostell]] ''Cityrama'', in Cologne was the first Happening in Germany.
* 1961: [[Robert Rauschenberg]] sent a telegram to the [[Galerie Iris Clert]] which said: 'This is a portrait of [[Iris Clert]] if I say so.' as his contribution to an exhibition of portraits.
* 1961: [[Piero Manzoni]] exhibited ''[[Artist's Shit]]'', tins purportedly containing his own [[feces]] (although since the work would be destroyed if opened, no one has been able to say for sure). He put the tins on sale for their own weight in gold. He also sold his own breath (enclosed in balloons) as ''[[Corpo d'aria|Bodies of Air]]'', and signed people's bodies, thus declaring them to be living works of art either for all time or for specified periods. (This depended on how much they are prepared to pay). [[Marcel Broodthaers]] and [[Primo Levi]] are amongst the designated 'artworks'.
* 1962: Artist Barrie Bates rebrands himself as [[Billy Apple]], erasing his original identity to continue his exploration of everyday life and commerce as art. By this stage, many of his works are fabricated by third parties.&lt;ref name="Byrt"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrt|first=Anthony|title=Brand, new|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/brand-new/|work=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1962: [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude|Christo]]'s ''Iron Curtain'' work. This consists of a barricade of oil barrels in a narrow Paris street which caused a large traffic jam. The artwork was not the barricade itself but the resulting traffic jam.
* 1962: [[Yves Klein]] presents ''[[Zone de Sensibilité Picturale Immatérielle|Immaterial Pictorial Sensitivity]]'' in various ceremonies on the banks of the Seine. He offers to sell his own 'pictorial sensitivity' (whatever that was, he did not define it) in exchange for gold leaf. In these ceremonies the purchaser gave Klein the gold leaf in return for a certificate. Since Klein's sensitivity was immaterial, the purchaser was then required to burn the certificate whilst Klein threw half the gold leaf into the Seine. (There were seven purchasers.)
* 1962: [[Piero Manzoni]] created ''The Base of the World'', thereby exhibiting the entire planet as his artwork.
* 1962: FLUXUS Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in [[Wiesbaden]] with, [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Nam June Paik]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Fluxus at 50''. Stefan Fricke, Alexander Klar, Sarah Maske, Kerber Verlag, 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-700-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1963: [[George Brecht]]'s collection of Event-Scores, ''[[Water Yam (artist's multiple)|Water Yam]]'', is published as the first ''Fluxkit'' by [[George Maciunas]]. 
* 1963: Festum Fluxorum Fluxus in [[Düsseldorf]] with [[George Maciunas]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Dick Higgins]], [[Nam June Paik]], [[Ben Patterson]], [[Emmett Williams]] and others.
* 1963: [[Henry Flynt]]s article ''Concept Art'' is published in ''[[An Anthology of Chance Operations]]''; a collection of artworks and concepts by artists and musicians that was published by [[Jackson Mac Low]] and [[La Monte Young]] (ed.). ''An Anthology of Chance Operations'' documented the development of [[Dick Higgins]] vision of [[intermedia]] art in the context of the ideas of [[John Cage]] and became an early [[Fluxus]] masterpiece. Flynt's "concept art" devolved from his idea of "cognitive nihilism" and from his insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics.
* 1964: [[Yoko Ono]] publishes ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings]]''. An example of Heuristic art, or a series of instructions for how to obtain an aesthetic experience.
* 1965: [[Art &amp; Language]] founder Michael Baldwin ''Mirror Piece''. Instead of paintings, the work is showing a variable number of mirrors that challenge both the visitor and [[Clement Greenberg]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tate|title=Art &amp; Language – Conceptual Art, Mirrors and Selfies {{!}} TateShots|date=2016-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-klDfurJM5Y|accessdate=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1965: A complex conceptual art piece by [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] called ''Still and Chew''. He invites art students to protest against the values of [[Clement Greenberg]]'s ''Art and Culture'', much praised and taught at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in London, where Latham taught part-time. Pages of Greenberg's book (borrowed from the college library) are chewed by the students, dissolved in acid and the resulting solution returned to the library bottled and labelled. Latham was then fired from his part-time position.
* 1965: with ''Show V, immaterial sculpture'' the Dutch artist [[Marinus Boezem]] introduced Conceptual Art in the Netherlands. In the show various air doors are placed where people can walk through them. People have the sensory experience of warmth, air. Three invisible air doors, which arise as currents of cold and warm are blown into the room, are indicated in the space with bundles of arrows and lines. The articulation of the space which arises is the result of invisible processes which influence the conduct of persons in that space, and who are included in the system as co-performers.
* [[Joseph Kosuth]] dates the concept of ''[[One and Three Chairs]]'' in the year 1965. The presentation of the work consists of a chair, its photo and a blow up of a definition of the word "chair". Kosuth has chosen the definition from a dictionary. Four versions with different definitions are known.
* 1966: Conceived in 1966 ''The Air Conditioning Show'' of [[Art &amp; Language]] is published as an article in 1967 in the November issue of ''Arts Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/air-conditioning-show-air-show-frameworks-1966-67-al0481|title=Air-Conditioning Show / Air Show / Frameworks 1966–67|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966: [[N.E. Thing Co.]] Ltd. (Iain and Ingrid Baxter of Vancouver) exhibited ''Bagged Place'' the contents of a four-room apartment wrapped in plastic bags. The same year they registered as a corporation and subsequently organized their practice along corporate models, one of the first international examples of the "aesthetic of administration".
* 1967: [[Mel Ramsden]] first ''100% Abstract Paintings''. The painting shows a list of chemical components that constitute the substance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macba.cat/en/exhibition-art-language-uncompleted/1/exhibitions/expo|title=ART &amp; LANGUAGE UNCOMPLETED|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1967: [[Sol LeWitt]]'s ''Paragraphs on Conceptual Art'' were published by the American art journal ''[[Artforum]]''. The ''Paragraphs'' mark the progression from Minimal to Conceptual Art.
* 1968: Michael Baldwin, [[Terry Atkinson]], [[David Bainbridge]] and [[Harold Hurrell]] found [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/culture/stories/2003/04/art-and-language.shtml|title=BBC – Coventry and Warwickshire Culture – Art and Language|website=www.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1968: [[Lawrence Weiner]] relinquishes the physical making of his work and formulates his "Declaration of Intent", one of the most important conceptual art statements following LeWitt's "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art." The declaration, which underscores his subsequent practice reads: "1. The artist may construct the piece. 2. The piece may be fabricated. 3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership."
* Friedrich Heubach launches the magazine ''Interfunktionen'' in Cologne, Germany, a publication that excelled in artists' projects. It originally showed a Fluxus influence, but later moved toward Conceptual art.
* 1969: The first generation of New York [[alternative exhibition space]]s are established, including [[Billy Apple]]'s APPLE, Robert Newman's Gain Ground, where [[Vito Acconci]] produced many important early works, and 112 Greene Street.&lt;ref name="Byrt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Terroni|first=Christelle|title=The Rise and Fall of Alternative Spaces|url=http://www.booksandideas.net/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-Alternative.html|work=books&amp;ideas.net|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1969: [[Robert Barry (artist)|Robert Barry]]'s ''Telepathic Piece'' at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, of which he said 'During the exhibition I will try to communicate telepathically a work of art, the nature of which is a series of thoughts that are not applicable to language or image'.
* 1969: The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]] is published in May. It is subtitled as ''The Journal of conceptual art'' and edited by Terry Atkinson, David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell. [[Art &amp; Language]] are the editors of this first number, and by the second number and until 1972, [[Joseph Kosuth]] will join and become the american editor.
* 1969: [[Vito Acconci]] creates ''Following Piece'', in which he follows randomly selected members of the public until they disappear into a private space. The piece is presented as photographs.
* The English journal ''Studio International'' published [[Joseph Kosuth]]´s article "Art after Philosophy" in three parts (October–December). It became the most discussed article on "Conceptual Art".
* 1970: [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]] join [[Art &amp; Language]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
* 1970: Painter [[John Baldessari]] exhibits a film in which he sets a series of erudite statements by Sol LeWitt on the subject of conceptual art to popular tunes like "Camptown Races" and "Some Enchanted Evening".
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] exhibits a series of photographs which were taken every two minutes whilst driving along a road for 24 minutes.
* 1970: [[Douglas Huebler]] asks museum visitors to write down 'one authentic secret'. The resulting 1800 documents are compiled into a book which, by some accounts, makes for very repetitive reading as most secrets are similar.
* 1971: [[Hans Haacke]]'s ''Real Time Social System''. This piece of [[systems art]] detailed the real estate holdings of the third largest landowners in New York City. The properties were mostly in Harlem and the [[Lower East Side]], were decrepit and poorly maintained, and represented the largest concentration of real estate in those areas under the control of a single group. The captions gave various financial details about the buildings, including recent sales between companies owned or controlled by the same family. The Guggenheim museum cancelled the exhibition, stating that the overt political implications of the work constituted "an alien substance that had entered the art museum organism". There is no evidence to suggest that the trustees of the Guggenheim were linked financially to the family which was the subject of the work.
* 1972: [[Art &amp; Language|The Art &amp; Language Institute]] exhibits ''Index 01'' at the [[Documenta 5]], an installation indexing text-works by [[Art &amp; Language]] and text-works from [[Art &amp; Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. 
* 1972: [[Antonio Caro]] exhibits in the National Art Salon (Museo Nacional, Bogotá, Colombia) his work: ''Aquinocabeelarte'' (Art does not fit here), where each of the letters is a separate poster, and under each letter is written the name of some victim of state repression.
* 1972: [[Fred Forest]] buys an area of blank space in the newspaper ''Le Monde'' and invites readers to fill it with their own works of art.
* [[General Idea]] launch ''File'' magazine in Toronto. The magazine functioned as something of an extended, collaborative artwork.
* 1973: [[Jacek Tylicki]] lays out blank canvases or paper sheets in the natural environment for the nature to create art.
* 1974: [[Cadillac Ranch]] near [[Amarillo]], Texas.
* 1975–76: Three issues of the journal ''The Fox'' were published by [[Art &amp; Language]] in New York by. The editor was [[Joseph Kosuth]]. ''The Fox'' became an important platform for the American members of [[Art &amp; Language]]. Karl Beveridge, Ian Burn, [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], Andrew Menard, Mel Ramsden and Terry Smith wrote articles which thematized the context of contemporary art. These articles exemplify the development of an institutional critique within the inner circle of Conceptual Art. The criticism of the art world integrates social, political and economic reasons.
* 1976: facing internal problems, members of [[Art &amp; Language]] separate. The destiny of the name [[Art &amp; Language]] remaining in Michael Baldwin, Mel Ramsden and Charles Harrison hands.
* 1977: [[Walter De Maria]]'s ''Vertical Earth Kilometer'' in [[Kassel]], Germany. This was a one kilometer brass rod which was sunk into the earth so that nothing remained visible except a few centimeters. Despite its size, therefore, this work exists mostly in the viewer's mind.
* 1977: [[John Fekner]] creates hundreds of environmental and conceptual outdoor works consisting of stenciled words, symbols, dates and icons spray painted in New York, Sweden, Canada, England and Germany.
* 1986: [[Art &amp; Language]] are nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].
* 1989: [[Christopher Williams (American artist)|Christopher Williams]]' ''Angola to Vietnam'' is first exhibited. The work consists of a series of black-and-white photographs of glass botanical specimens from the [[Botanical Museum]] at [[Harvard University]], chosen according to a list of the thirty-six countries in which political disappearances were known to have taken place during the year 1985.
* 1990: [[Ashley Bickerton]] and [[Ronald Jones (Interdisciplinarian)|Ronald Jones]] included in "Mind Over Matter: Concept and Object" exhibition of ”third generation Conceptual artists” at the Whitney Museum of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDA113CF93AA25753C1A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Brenson | title=Review/Art; In the Arena of the Mind, at the Whitney | date=19 October 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1993: [[Matthieu Laurette]] established his artistic birth certificate by taking part in a French TV game called ''Tournez manège'' (The Dating Game) where the female presenter asked him who he was, to which he replied: 'A multimedia artist'. Laurette had sent out invitations to an art audience to view the show on TV from their home, turning his staging of the artist into a performed reality.

A '''cryophorus''' is a glass container containing [[liquid water]] and [[water vapor]]. It is used in [[physics]] courses to demonstrate rapid [[freezing]] by [[evaporation]]. A typical cryophorus has a bulb at one end connected to a tube of the same material. When the liquid water is manipulated into the bulbed end and the other end is submerged into a freezing mixture (such as [[liquid nitrogen]]),  the gas pressure drops as it is cooled.  The liquid water begins to evaporate, producing more water vapor. Evaporation causes the water to cool rapidly to its [[freezing point]] and it solidifies suddenly.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Wollaston's cryophorus was a repurposed "pulse glass".&lt;br&gt;

The "pulse glass" or "pulse hammer" (German: ''Pulshammer'') was a toy / novelty that had existed in Germany since the 1760s and perhaps earlier.  In 1767 [[Benjamin Franklin]] visited Germany, saw a pulse hammer, and in 1768, improved it.  See:
*  [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-15-02-0091#BNFN-01-15-02-0091-fn-0013-ptr Benjamin Franklin's letter to John Winthrop of 2 July 1768]

Franklin's pulse glass consisted of two glass bulbs connected by a U-shaped tube; one of the bulbs was partially filled with water in equilibrium with its vapor.  Holding the partially filled bulb in one's hand would cause the water to flow into the empty bulb. For videos of Franklin's pulse glass in operation, see:
*  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-Yei5vBsxM Pulse Glass]
*  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbiMGsE0h8k Franklin's pulse glass]
Wollaston was familiar with the pulse glass's construction:  from (Wollaston, 1813), p. 73:  "The mode of effecting this [i.e., expelling air from the cryophorus] is well known to those who are accustomed to blow glass."&lt;br&gt;
In the case of Franklin's pulse glass, water in the filled bulb was caused to evaporate by heating the water in the filled bulb.  In the case of Wollaston's cryophorus, water in the filled bulb was caused to evaporate by cooling and condensing the water vapor in the empty bulb.&lt;br&gt;

'''''De Natura Deorum''''' ('''''On the Nature of the Gods''''') is a philosophical dialogue by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] orator [[Cicero]] written in 45 BC. It is laid out in three books, each of which discusses the theology of different Roman and [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]. The dialogue uses a discussion of [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]], [[Stoicism|Stoic]], and [[Platonism|skeptical (Platonist)]] theories to examine fundamental questions of [[theology]].

==Writing==
''De Natura Deorum'' belongs to the group of philosophical works which Cicero wrote in the two years preceding his death in 43 BC.&lt;ref name="brooks1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states near the beginning of ''De Natura Deorum'' that he wrote them both as a relief from the political inactivity to which he was reduced by the supremacy of [[Julius Caesar]], and as a distraction from the grief caused by the death of his daughter [[Tullia (daughter of Cicero)|Tullia]].&lt;ref name="brooks1"/&gt;

The dialogue is supposed to take place in Rome at the house of [[Gaius Aurelius Cotta]].&lt;ref name="brooks4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue he appears as pontiff, but not as consul.&lt;ref name="brooks4"/&gt; He was made pontiff soon after 82 BC, and consul in 75 BC, and as Cicero, who is present at the dialogue as a listener, did not return from Athens till 77 BC, its fictional date can be set between the years 77 and 75 BC, when Cicero was about thirty years of age, and Cotta about forty-eight.&lt;ref name="brooks4"/&gt;

The book contains various obscurities and inconsistencies which demonstrate that it was probably never revised by Cicero, nor published until after his death.&lt;ref name="brooks5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the content, Cicero borrowed largely from earlier Greek sources.&lt;ref name="brooks5"/&gt; However, the hasty arrangement by Cicero of authorities who themselves wrote independently of one another means that the work lacks cohesion,&lt;ref name="brooks7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and points raised by one speaker are sometimes not countered by subsequent speakers.&lt;ref name="brooks6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The dialogue is on the whole narrated by Cicero himself, though he does not play an active part in the discussion. [[Gaius Velleius]] represents the Epicurean school, [[Quintus Lucilius Balbus]] argues for the Stoics, and [[Gaius Cotta]] speaks for Cicero's own [[Academic skepticism]]. The first book of the dialogue contains Cicero's introduction, Velleius' case for the Epicurean theology and Cotta's criticism of Epicureanism. Book II focuses on Balbus' explanation and defense of Stoic theology. Book III lays out Cotta's criticism of Balbus' claims. Cicero's conclusions are ambivalent and muted, "a strategy of civilized openness";&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''[[The Swerve: How the World Became Modern]]'', 2011:69ff.&lt;/ref&gt; he does, however, conclude that Balbus' claims, in his mind, more nearly approximate the truth (3.95).

===Book 1===
In Book 1 Cicero visits the house of Cotta the [[Pontifex Maximus]], where he finds him with Velleius &amp;ndash; a Senator and Epicurean, and Balbus supporter of the Stoics. Cotta himself is an Academic, and he informs Cicero that they were discoursing on the nature of the gods. Velleius had been stating the sentiments of [[Epicurus]] upon the subject.&lt;ref name="dunlop244"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velleius is requested to go on with his arguments after recapitulating what he had already said.&lt;ref name="dunlop244"/&gt; The discourse of Velleius consists of three parts: a general attack on [[Platonist]] and Stoic cosmology; a historical review of the earlier philosophers; and an exposition of Epicurean theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rackham|first=H.|title=Cicero: De Natura Deorum; Academica|page=xvi|publisher=Loeb Classical Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Velleius raises the difficulty of supposing the creation of the universe to have taken place at a particular period of time, and questions the possible motive of a God in undertaking the work.&lt;ref name="brooks6"/&gt; The historical section (10-15), is full of inaccuracies and mis-statements, of which it is likely that Cicero himself was ignorant, since he has Cotta later praise this account.&lt;ref name="brooks7"/&gt; The purpose however is for Velleius to show that the Epicurean idea of God as a [[Divine happiness|perfectly happy]], [[God and eternity|eternal being]], possessed of reason, and in human form, is the only tenable one, and the other differing opinions is regarded as proof of their worthlessness.&lt;ref name="brooks7"/&gt; In the remainder of the book, Cotta attacks the positions of Velleius with regard to the form of the gods, and their exemption from creation and providence.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 2===
In Book 2, Balbus gives the Stoics position on the subject of the gods.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"/&gt; He alludes to the magnificence of the world, and the prevalence of belief, and refers to the frequent appearance of the gods themselves in history.&lt;ref name="dunlop245"/&gt; After referring to the practice of [[divination]], Balbus proceeds to the "four causes" of [[Cleanthes]] as to how the idea of the gods is implanted in the minds of people: (1) a pre-knowledge of future events; (2) the great advantages we enjoy from nature; (3) the terror with which the mind is affected by thunder, tempests, and the like; (4) and the order and regularity in the universe. Balbus further contends that the world, or universe itself, and its parts, are possessed of reason and wisdom.&lt;ref name="dunlop246"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finally discusses the creation of the world, the [[Divine providence|providence]] of the gods, and denies "that a world, so beautifully adorned, [[Teleological argument|could be formed by chance]], or by a fortuitous concourse of atoms."&lt;ref name="dunlop246"/&gt; The problem of [[Problem of evil|how to account for the presence of misery]] and disaster in a world providentially governed is only hurriedly touched upon at the end of the book.&lt;ref name="brooks8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book 3===
In book 3 Cotta refutes the doctrines of Balbus.&lt;ref name="dunlop247"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of this book, probably more than one third, has been lost.&lt;ref name="brooks8"/&gt; Cotta represents the appearances of gods as idle tales.&lt;ref name="dunlop248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a gap in the text, following which Cotta attacks the four causes of Cleanthes.&lt;ref name="dunlop248"/&gt; Cotta refutes the Stoic ideas on reason attributed to the universe and its parts.&lt;ref name="dunlop249"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dunlop|1827|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten chapters (16-25) are devoted to a disproportionately lengthy discussion of [[mythology]], with examples multiplied to an inordinate extent.&lt;ref name="brooks9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There follows another major gap in the text, at the end of which Cotta is seen attacking the doctrine of providential care for humans.&lt;ref name="dunlop249"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brooks9"/&gt; Cicero states "The conversation ended here, and we parted. Velleius judged that the arguments of Cotta were the truest, but those of Balbus seemed to me to have the greater probability."&lt;ref name="dunlop249"/&gt;

==Influence==
The Christian writers [[Tertullian]], [[Minucius Felix]], [[Lactantius]], and [[Augustine]] were acquainted with ''De Natura Deorum'', and their arguments against polytheism were largely borrowed from it.&lt;ref name="brooks10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1896|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work, alongside ''[[De Officiis]]'' and ''[[De Divinatione]]'', was highly influential on the [[philosophes]] of the 18th century. [[David Hume]] was familiar with the work and used it to style his own ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Holden|first=Thomas|title=Spectres of Fasle Divinity: Hume's Moral Atheism|year=2010|page=28|publisher=Oxford Universoty Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] described ''De Natura Deorum'' and the ''[[Tusculan Disputations]]'' as "the two most beautiful books ever produced by the wisdom of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;'Les deux plus beaux ouvrages qu’ait jamais écrits la sagesse qui n’est qu’humaine' [Voltaire, "Cicéron", ''Dictionnaire philosophique'' (1764); ''Œuvres complètes'' (Garnier) 18:181]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811 a fourth book was 'discovered' and published by one 'P. Seraphinus' in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref name="farrer"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Farrer|first=James Anson|title=Literary Forgeries|pages=10-12|year=1907|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this forgery Cicero asserts many points compatible with Christian and Catholic dogma, and even argues in favour of an authority equivalent to the Papacy.&lt;ref name="farrer"/&gt;

==Scholarship==
This work, although not written by an orthodox Epicurean or Stoic, is important because it supplements the scant primary texts that remain from Epicureans and Stoics discussing their views on religion and theology. In particular, heated scholarly debate has focused on this text's discussion at 1.43-44 of how the Epicurean gods may be said to "exist"; David Sedley, for example, holds that Epicureans, as represented in this text and elsewhere, think that "gods are our own graphic [[Ideal (ethics)|idealization]] of the life to which we aspire",&lt;ref&gt;[[David Sedley]], ''Epicurus’ Theological Innatism.'' In Fish and Saunders 2011: 29-52&lt;/ref&gt; whereas David Konstan maintains that "the Epicurean gods are real, in the sense that they exist as atomic compounds and possess the properties that pertain to the concept, or prolēpsis, that people have of them."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Konstan]], ''Epicurus on the Gods''. In Fish and Saunders 2011: 53-71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
* There is in fact no subject upon which so much difference of opinion exists, not only among the unlearned but also among educated men; and the views entertained are so various and so discrepant, that, while it is no doubt a possible alternative that none of them is true, it is certainly impossible that more than one should be so. (''{{lang|la|Res enim nulla est, de qua tantopere non solum indocti, sed etiam docti dissentiant; quorum opiniones cum tam variae sint tamque inter se dissidentes, alterum fieri profecto potest, ut earum nulla, alterum certe non potest, ut plus una vera sit}}'') (I, 5)
* We, on the contrary, make blessedness of life depend upon an untroubled mind, and exemption from all duties. (We think a happy life consists in tranquility of mind). (''{{lang|la|Nos autem beatam vitam in animi securitate et in omnium vacatione munerum ponimus}}'') (I, 53)
* For time destroys the fictions of error and opinion, while it confirms the determinations of nature and of truth. (''{{lang|la|Opinionis enim commenta delet dies, naturae iudicia confirmat}}'') (II, 2)
* Because all the sick do not recover, therefore medicine is not an art. (''{{lang|la|Ne aegri quidem quia non omnes convalescunt, idcirco ars nulla medicina est}}'') (II, 12)
* Things perfected by nature are better than those finished by art. (''{{lang|la|Meliora sunt ea quae natura quam illa quae arte perfecta sunt}}'') (II, 87)
* Just as it is better to use no [[Ancient Rome and wine|wine]] whatever in the [[Ancient Rome and wine#Medical uses|treatment of the sick]], because it is rarely beneficial and very often injurious, than to rush upon evident calamity in the hope of an uncertain recovery, so, I incline to think, it would have been better for the human race that that swift movement of thought, that keenness and shrewdness which we call reason, since it is destructive to many and profitable to very few, should not have been given at all, than that it should have been given so freely and abundantly. (''{{lang|la|Ut vinum aegrotis, quia prodest raro, nocet saepissime, melius est non adhibere omnino quam spe dubiae salutis in apertam perniciem incurrere, sic haud scio, an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum celerem cogitationis, acumen, sollertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam pestifera sit multis, admodum paucis salutaris, non dari omnino quam tam munifice et tam large dari.}}'') (III, 69)

'''Deane Keller''' (December 14, 1901 &amp;ndash; April 12, 1992) was an [[United States|American]] [[artist]], [[academic]], [[soldier]], [[art restorer]] and [[preservationist]]. He taught for forty years at [[Yale University]]'s [[Yale School of Art|School of Fine Arts]] and during [[World War II]] was an officer with the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]].

==Biography==
Keller was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Deane Keller, Painter And Art Teacher, 91 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 April 1992 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/17/obituaries/deane-keller-painter-and-art-teacher-91.html  |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Albert Galloway Keller]], was a member of the junior faculty at Yale; but during young Deane's formative years, his father would become the first [[William Graham Sumner]] Professor of Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Albert G.

As a student at Yale, he earned degrees in history and science in 1923.  Further studies led to a B.F.A. from the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; Keller was awarded the [[Rome Prize|Gran Prix de Rome]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1926"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |title=Two Get Awards in Art Competition; Grand Prix de Rome Fellowships Go to Deane Keller and Joseph Kissilewski |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 May 1926 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1926/05/05/archives/two-get-awards-in-art-competition-grand-prix-de-rome-fellowships-go.html |accessdate=28 January 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Fellow of  the [[American Academy in Rome]] (FAAR) for three years.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; After returning from Rome in 1929, Keller began his career as a member of the Yale faculty.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/mssa.ms.1685  |title=Deane Keller papers |website=Yale University Manuscripts and Archives |publisher=Yale University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic career was interrupted by the Second World War, when he was asked by School of Fine Arts dean [[Theodore Sizer (art historian)|Theodore Sizer]] to serve as a fine arts officer in the U.S. Army's [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]]. At war's end, he returned to teach at Yale's School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt; In total, Keller taught at Yale for forty years, retiring in 1979, and was also professor emeritus of painting at the [[Paier College of Art]].&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt;

Keller married Katherine Parkhurst Hall in 1938. He had two sons, [[Deane G. Keller]], 1940 – 2005, and William Keller, born in 1950.&lt;ref name="Yale_archive"/&gt;

One of Keller's most significant wartime undertakings was his attempt to preserve the murals of the [[Camposanto]], a medieval cemetery in Pisa. In July 1944, an American shelling started a fire that caused the frescoes to fracture.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt; Keller organized art experts and enlisted men to protect the mural pieces and protect the cemetery from further damage.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt; Restoration of the frescoes has continued for seventy years.  In recognition of his preservation efforts, an urn containing Keller's ashes was interred in the Camposanto in 2000.&lt;ref name="Taft School" /&gt;

==Honors==
* [[Rome Prize|Gran Prix de Rome]], 1926.&lt;ref name="nyt1926"/&gt;
* [[Legion of Merit]], 1946 (United States).
* [[British Empire Medal]], 1926 (United Kingdom).
* [[Crown of Italy Partisan Medal]], 1946 (Italy).
* [[Medal of the Opera]], Commune of Pisa
* [[Order of St John Lateran]], 1946. (Vatican).

Keller was posthumously recognized for his wartime activities. He was the first to enter Pisa liberated from Nazi, 02 Sept.1944, with the partisan Pierino Fornaciari, liaison officer, with whom he rescued many art works, in particular in the [[Camposanto Monumentale]]. His remains were apportioned and interred in New Britain, Connecticut and the [[Camposanto Monumentale]] in [[Pisa]]; that site is identified with an engraved marble slab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| author-last1=Berge |author-first1=Robert |author-last2=Cohen |author-first2=Bonni |author-last3=Newnham |author-first3=Nicole |title=The Rape of Europa |date=2006 |medium=film |publisher=Oregon Public Broadcasting |url=https://www.pbs.org/therapeofeuropa/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his academic career, Keller was a prolific portrait painter. He was known as the "unofficial portraitist of the Yale faculty," completing over 160 portrait commissions for the university, including faculty, corporation board members, and two presidents. With one of his portrait subjects, [[Thomas G. Bergin]], Keller worked in collaboration by illustrating the book, ''On Sepulchers''.&lt;ref&gt;Foscolo, Ugo. Bergin, Thomas G., translator.

}}'''Deborah Swackhamer''' is an [[environmental chemist]] and professor emerita at the [[University of Minnesota]] in Minneapolis. Swackhamer has applied her expertise in studying the effects of exposure to toxic chemicals, as well as the processes that spread those chemicals, to developing policies that address exposure risks.

== Education and early career ==
Swackhamer received her Bachelor's degree in [[Chemistry]] from [[Grinnell College]] in Iowa in 1976. She then received her Masters of Science from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1981, where she studied [[Water chemistry|Water Chemistry]]. In 1985, she earned her PhD in [[Oceanography]] and [[Limnology]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] with a thesis entitled "Role of water-particle partitioning and sedimentation in controlling the fate and transport of PCBs in lakes" in the laboratory of David E. Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|title=Role of water-particle partitioning and sedimentation in controlling the fate and transport of PCBs in lakes|date=1985-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236422302_Role_of_water-particle_partitioning_and_sedimentation_in_controlling_the_fate_and_transport_of_PCBs_in_lakes}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCB, or [[polychlorinated biphenyl]], is a chlorine compound that was once widely found in dielectric and coolant fluids used in electronics. PCBs are now widely considered an environmental contaminant as they've been shown to cause a variety of adverse health effects, including cancer, fertility complications, and neurologic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/pcbs/learn-about-polychlorinated-biphenyls-pcbs|title=Learn about Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10|date=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swackhamer's thesis research focused on better understanding how PCBs were transported in bodies of water, using Lake Michigan as a model for her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1987-01-01|title=Distribution and Characterization of PCBs in Lake Michigan Water|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0380133087716244|journal=Journal of Great Lakes Research|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=24–36|doi=10.1016/S0380-1330(87)71624-4|issn=0380-1330|last1=Swackhamer|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Armstrong|first2=David E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|last2=ARMSTRONG|first2=DE|date=1986-09-01|title=Estimation of the atmospheric and nonatmospheric contributions and losses of polychlorinated biphenyls to Lake Michigan on the basis of sediment records of remote lakes|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278869708|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|volume=20|issue=9|pages=879–883|doi=10.1021/es00151a005|pmid=22263819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|last2=E.

Following her doctorate, Swackhamer became a postdoctoral research associate at [[Indiana University]] in Chemistry and Public &amp; Environmental Affairs, working in [[Ronald A. Hites]]'s group from 1985 to 1987. There, she worked to develop a method for quantitating the insecticide [[toxaphene]] in environmental samples using [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah L.|last2=Charles|first2=M.

== Research ==
In 1987, Swackhamer joined the [[University of Minnesota]] faculty where she continued her research of studying the process that affect the behavior and fate of organic contaminants that are resistant to degradation and remain in the environment for a long time, known as "persistent organic compounds." Her research has more specifically centered on PCBs, [[dioxins]], and pesticides in the [[Great Lakes]] region. For instance, her group found that the high water concentrations of the pesticide [[toxaphene]] in [[Lake Superior]] are the result of colder temperatures and lower sedimentation rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swackhamer|first=Deborah|last2=Schottler|first2=Shawn|last3=F.

Her group has also modeled annual and seasonal fluxes of toxaphene from water to air and sediment, finding that toxaphene contamination will persist far into the future in the Great Lake region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R.

Swackhamer has also studied the impact of these environmental contaminants on animals in lake populations. She has been part of research efforts that have uncovered reproductive complications in male fathead minnows exposed to wastewater treatment byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=B Barber|first=Larry|last2=E Lee|first2=Kathy|last3=Swackhamer|first3=Deborah|last4=Schoenfuss|first4=Heiko|date=2007-05-01|title=Reproductive responses of male fathead minnows exposed to wastewater treatment plant effluent, effluent treated with XAD8 resin, and an environmentally relevant mixture of alkylphenol compounds|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6474278|journal=Aquatic Toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)|volume=82|issue=1|pages=36–46|doi=10.1016/j.aquatox.2007.01.003|pmid=17331597}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lehr|first=R.A.|last2=Swackhamer|first2=Deborah|last3=Ankley|first3=Gerald|date=2002-01-01|title=Potential endocrine disruption in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to wastewater effluent|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287596616|journal=45.

== Public service and leadership ==
Swackhamer has lent her expertise to serving on a number of environmental advisory boards. Starting in 2000 to 2013, she joined the Science Advisory Board of the [[International Joint Commission]] of the United States and Canada, which provides scientific advice to the Commission and the Water Quality Board under the [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]]. During her tenure, she co-authored a report on emerging issues of the Great Lakes to identify issues of importance for the next 25 years, as well as opportunities for sustaining progress under the Great Lakes Quality Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/330179/publication.html|title=Expert consultation on emerging issues of the Great Lakes in the 21st century : report of the Great Lakes Science Advisory Board to the International Joint Commission / Edited by Peter Boyer, Allan Jones and Deborah Swackhamer. : E95-2/3-2006E-PDF - Government of Canada Publications - Canada.ca|last=Services|first=Government of Canada, Public Services and Procurement Canada, Integrated Services Branch, Government Information Services, Publishing and Depository|website=publications.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges identified included climate change, chemical contaminants, and changes to the biological community surrounding the Great Lakes. In 2003, Swackhamer became the director of the University of Minnesota's Water Resources Center. She served as the director of University of Minnesota’s Water Resources Center. From 2006 to 2012, she was a member of the board of directors, National Institutes of Water Resources (NIWR), serving as its president from 2010 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://niwr.info/about/past-presidents|title=NIWR :: Past Presidents|website=niwr.info|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Swackhamer was appointed to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] Board of Environmental Science and Toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/global/best/Board-Members|title=BEST Board Members|website=dels.nas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2003 to 2012, Swackhamer was a member of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Advisory Board, and served as its Chair from 2008 to 2012. She later served as Chair of the EPA's Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC), an independent an external panel of experts that advises the agency's office of science. Her three-year term began in the spring of 2015, however, she was prematurely dismissed from her position following her testimony to the [[United States House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology]] in June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/scientist-tells-her-story-latest-partisan-battle-house-science-panel|title=Scientist tells her story in latest partisan battle on House science panel|date=2017-06-28|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/epa-accused-interfering-top-science-adviser-s-congressional-testimony-n777916|title=EPA accused of interfering with top science adviser's congressional testimony|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/us/politics/epa-official-pressured-scientist-on-congressional-testimony-emails-show.html|title=E.P.A.

In her testimony, she stressed the need for the role of bipartisan support for environmental protections, the capacity to produce robust scientific research at the state level, and the importance of environmental regulations for public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://docs.house.gov/meetings/SY/SY18/20170523/106025/HHRG-115-SY18-Wstate-SwackhamerD-20170523.pdf|title=Written Testimony submitted by Deborah L.

Nevertheless, EPA leadership tried to interfere with her testimony in advance of the hearing, which raised concerns among the House Democrats, who alleged that such interference was "inappropriate and may have violated federal regulations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scientist-epa-pressured-me-to-change-testimony-to-congress/|title=Scientist says EPA staff pressured her to change testimony to Congress|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the pressure, Swackhamer did not change her testimony and was subsequently dismissed. Following her dismissal, she told ''[[The New York Times]]'': "The Board of Scientific Counselors had 68 members two months ago [in April 2018]. It will have 11 come Sept. 1. They’ve essentially suspended scientific activities by ending these terms.”

Dissolved organic carbon is abundant in [[Marine ecosystem|marine]] and [[Freshwater ecosystem|freshwater]] systems and is one of the greatest cycled reservoirs of [[organic matter]] on [[Earth]], accounting for the same amount of [[carbon]] as the [[atmosphere]] and up to 20% of all organic carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hedges|first=John I.|title=Global biogeochemical cycles: progress and problems|journal=Marine Chemistry|date=3 December 1991|volume=39|pages=67–93| url=http://www.ic.ucsc.edu/~mdmccar/ocea213/readings/discuss_2_Hedges/Hedges_1992_MarChem_global_biogeochem_cycles_progress_problems.pdf|doi=10.1016/0304-4203(92)90096-s}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, [[organic carbon]] compounds are the result of [[decomposition]] processes from dead organic matter including [[Plant|plants]] and [[Animal|animals]]. Dissolved organic carbon can originate from within or external to the [[body of water]]. DOC originating from within the body of water is known as autochthonous DOC and typically comes from [[Aquatic plant|aquatic plants]] or [[algae]], while DOC originating external to the body of water is known as allochthonous DOC and typically comes from [[Soil|soils]] or [[Plant|terrestrial plants]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kritzberg|first=Emma S.|last2=Cole|first2=Jonathan J.|last3=Pace|first3=Michael L.|last4=Granéli|first4=Wilhelm|last5=Bade|first5=Darren L.|date=2004-03|title=Autochthonous versus allochthonous carbon sources of bacteria: Results from whole-lake13C addition experiments|url=https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.4319/lo.2004.49.2.0588|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=49|issue=2|pages=588–596|doi=10.4319/lo.2004.49.2.0588|issn=0024-3590}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When water originates from land areas with a high proportion of organic soils, these components can drain into rivers and lakes as dissolved organic carbon.

== Measurement ==
The dissolved fraction of organic [[carbon]] is an operational classification. Many researchers use the term "dissolved" for compounds below 0.45 [[micrometer]]s, but 0.22 micrometers is also common, saving [[colloid]]al for higher concentrations. A practical definition of dissolved typically used in [[Ocean chemistry|marine chemistry]] is all substances that pass through a GF/F filter. The recommended measure technique is the [[Total organic carbon#High temperature catalytic oxidation|HTCO]] technique after filtration on pre-combusted glass fiber filters, typically GF/F filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ijgofs.whoi.edu/Publications/Report_Series/reports.html|title=Protocols for the Joint Global Ocean Flux studies (JGOFS) core measurements|author1=Knap, A. Michaels|author2=A. Close|author3=A. Ducklow|author4=H. Dickson, A.|publisher=JGOFS|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Dissolved organic carbon is a food supplement, supporting growth of [[microorganism]]s and plays an important role in the global [[carbon cycle]] through the [[microbial loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirchman |first1=David L. |last2=Suzuki |first2=Yoshimi |last3=Garside |first3=Christopher |last4=Ducklow |first4=Hugh W. |title=High turnover rates of dissolved organic carbon during a spring phytoplankton bloom |journal=Nature |date=15 August 1991 |volume=352 |issue=6336 |pages=612–614 |doi=10.1038/352612a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v352/n6336/abs/352612a0.html |bibcode=1991Natur.352..612K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some organisms (stages) that do not feed in the traditional sense, dissolved matter may be the only external food source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaeckle | first1 = W.B. | last2 = Manahan | first2 = D.T. | year = 1989 | title = Feeding by a "nonfeeding" larva: uptake of dissolved amino acids from seawater by lecithotrophic larvae of the gastropod ''Haliotis rufescens'' | url = | journal = Marine Biology | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 87–94 | doi = 10.1007/BF00391067 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, dissolved carbon is an indicator of organic loadings in streams, as well as supporting terrestrial processing (e.g., within soil, forests, and wetlands) of organic matter. Dissolved organic carbon has a high proportion of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) in first order streams compared to higher order streams. In the absence of extensive [[wetland]]s, [[bog]]s, or [[swamp]]s, baseflow concentrations of DOC in undisturbed watersheds generally range from approximately 1 to 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L carbon. Carbon concentrations considerably vary across ecosystems. For example, the [[Everglades]] may be near the top of the range and the middle of oceans may be near the bottom. Occasionally, high concentrations of organic carbon indicate anthropogenic influences, but most dissolved organic carbon originates naturally.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

The ''BDOC fraction'' consists of organic [[molecule]]s that [[heterotrophic]] [[bacteria]] can use as a source of energy and carbon. Some subset of DOC constitutes the precursors of disinfection byproducts for drinking water. Biodegradable dissolved organic carbon can contribute to undesirable biological regrowth within water distribution systems.{{citation needed|date = November 2017}}

==Distribution==
[[File:Vertical Dissolved Organic Carbon Distribution.PNG|thumb|A diagram showing the basic composition of dissolved organic matter in the ocean.|alt=]]

More precise measurement techniques developed in the late 1990s have allowed for a good understanding of how dissolved organic carbon is distributed in marine environments both vertically and across the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharp|first=Jonathan H.|title=Marine dissolved organic carbon: Are the older values correct?|journal=Marine Chemistry|date=6 August 1996|volume=56|issue=3–4|pages=265–277|doi=10.1016/S0304-4203(96)00075-8|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304420396000758}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now understood that dissolved organic carbon in the ocean spans a range from very [[labile]] to very [[refractory]]. The labile dissolved organic carbon is mainly produced by marine organisms and is consumed in the surface ocean, and consists of sugars, proteins, and other compounds that are easily used by marine bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sondergaard|first=Morten|author2=Mathias Middelboe|title=A cross-system analysis of labile dissolved organic carbon|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|date=9 March 1995|volume=118|pages=283–294|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/118/m118p283.pdf|doi=10.3354/meps118283|bibcode=1995MEPS..118..283S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refractory dissolved organic carbon is evenly spread throughout the water column and consists of high molecular weight and structurally complex compounds that are difficult for marine organisms to use such as the lignin, pollen, or humic acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruber|first=David F.|author2=Jean-Paul Simjouw |author3=Sybil P. Seitzinger |author4= Gary L. Taghon |title=Dynamics and Characterization of Refractory Dissolved Organic Matter Produced by a Pure Bacterial Culture in an Experimental Predator-Prey System|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=June 2006|volume=72|issue=6|pages=4184–4191|doi=10.1128/AEM.02882-05|url=http://aem.asm.org/content/72/6/4184.full |pmid=16751530 |pmc=1489638}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the observed vertical distribution consists of high concentrations in the upper water column and low concentrations at depth.

In addition to vertical distributions, horizontal distributions have been modeled and sampled as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansell|first=Dennis A.|author2=Craig A. Carlson |author3=Daniel J. Repeta |author4= Reiner Schlitzer |title=Dissolved Organic Matter in the Ocean: A Controversy Stimulates New Insights|journal=Oceanography|date=2009|volume=22|issue=4|pages=202–211|doi=10.5670/oceanog.2009.109|url=https://darchive.mblwhoilibrary.org/handle/1912/3183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the surface ocean at a depth of 30 meters, the higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations are found in the South Pacific Gyre, the South Atlantic Gyre, and the Indian Ocean. At a depth of 3000 meters, highest concentrations are in the North Atlantic Deep Water where dissolved organic carbon from the high concentration surface ocean is removed to depth. Since the time scales of horizontal motion along the ocean bottom are in the thousands of years, the refractory dissolved organic carbon is slowly consumed on its way from the North Atlantic and reaches a minimum in the North Pacific.

== Interaction with metals ==
Dissolved organic carbon is also extremely important in the transport of [[metal]]s in aquatic systems.  Metals form extremely strong [[Coordination complex|complexes]] with dissolved organic carbon, enhancing metal solubility while also reducing metal [[bioavailability]].

The '''Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia''' or '''[http://www.eria.org ERIA]''' is an international organization established in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2008 by a formal agreement among Leaders of 16 countries in the East Asian region to conduct research activities and make policy recommendations for further economic integration in the East Asia. '''ERIA''' works very closely with both the ASEAN Secretariat and 16 Research Institutes to undertake and disseminate policy research under the three pillars, namely “Deepening Economic Integration”, ”Narrowing Development Gaps”, and “Sustainable Development” and provide analytical policy recommendations to Leaders and Ministers at their regional meetings. ERIA provides intellectural contributions to East Asian Community building and serves as a Sherpa international organization. ERIA ranks 32nd among the world's "Top 85 International Economics Think Tanks" according to the 2016 Global Go To Think Tanks Index Report conducted by University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eria.org/2016%20Global%20Go%20To%20Think%20Tank%20Index%20Report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Establishment ==
ERIA was established by a formal agreement among Leaders of 16 countries in the East Asian at the 3rd East Asia Summit&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asean.org/21127.htm Chairman's Statement of the 3rd East Asia Summit Singapore, 21 November 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316152924/http://www.asean.org/21127.htm |date=16 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Singapore on 21 November 2007. The inaugural ERIA Governor Board meeting was held at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 3 June 2008. A formal agreement was reached between Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the ASEAN Secretariat to recognize ERIA as an international organization on 30 December 2008. As for the preparation for the establishment of ERIA, IDE-JETRO has been appointed to undertake a role as the temporary secretariat of ERIA at ERIA Expert Meeting in manila, March 2007 towards its official establishment.

== History ==
The inaugural meeting of the ERIA was held on 3 June 2008 in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://enews.mcot.net/view.php?id=3122 ASEAN chief calls for '2nd Fukuda Doctrine' for Asia's future] [http://www.pia.gov.ph/default.asp?m=12&amp;r=&amp;y=&amp;mo=&amp;fi=p080603.htm&amp;no=13 ERIA governing board to meet at ASEAN Secretariat on June 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 it was said that ERIA was working on a master plan for Asia. The plan aims to maximize industrialization through the development of much needed infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.inquirer.net/money/topstories/view/20091006-228725/East-Asia-bloc-seen-to-fuel-global-growth East Asia bloc seen to fuel global growth]&lt;/ref&gt;

* January, 2007  The proposal to establish ERIA was welcomed by all leaders in East Asia at 2nd East Asia Summit in Sebu.
* November, 2007  Establishment of ERIA was agreed at the 3rd East Asia Summit in Singapore.
* June 3, 2008 ERIA Inaugural meeting (1st Governing Board Meeting) was held.
* December 30, 2008 ERIA was recognized as International Organization.

=== Establishment of ERIA approved ===
*The formal establishment of ERIA was agreed upon by all the leaders at the 3rd East Asia Summit on November 21, 2007 in Singapore.
:'''Excerpt from Chairman's Statement of the 3rd East Asia Summit（Paragraph 13）'''
:We agreed to the establishment of the Economic Research Institute of ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) to be accommodated temporarily at the ASEAN Secretariat. We welcomed the report submitted to us by the Expert Group, which focuses on research topics of strategic interest to the EAS countries. We encouraged the Expert Group to continue its research work and we looked forward to practical policy recommendations to further regional integration and strengthen partnerships in East Asia.

=== Inauguration of ERIA ===
*The inauguration was held at the ASEAN Secretariat on June 3, 2008 in Indonesia. Attendees included board members nominated from 16 countries in East Asia. ERIA launched as a full-fledged research activity body.

:'''The Statement on the Establishment of ERIA'''
:1. The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) will be temporarily accommodated at the ASEAN Secretariat.
:2．ERIA shall function as an independent research institute but shall maintain and develop strong communication ties with policy-making process. The results of its research works shall produce concrete and tangible policy recommendations that shall meet the needs of Ministerial and National Leader’s meetings.
:3．ERIA shall maintain its highest academic standards in its research activities and provide a tripartite-type forum for policy dialogue and interactions among researchers, policymakers, and civil society.

ERIA's works are divided into 3 fields, doing research works, disseminating its works, and providing policy recommendations.

=== Research Works ===
:ERIA's Research Works aims to pursue three pillars of research issues, "Deepening Economic Integration", "Narrowing Development Gaps", and "Sustainable Development".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eria.org/research/activities.html|title=Research Activities {{!}} ERIA|last=|first=|date=|website=Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific research items in FY2010 are listed below.([http://www.eria.org/publications/latest_publications/index.html Latest Publications])

==== Deepening Economic Integration ====
::ERIA will conduct policy studies to promote deepening economic integration through the [[liberalization]] and [[wikt:facilitation|facilitation]] of [[trade]] and investments as well as the improvement of business environment in collaboration with business community in the region, paying special attention to the improvement of cross border business transactions and behind-the-border issues including investment environment and various non-[[tariff]] measures.  The following are the research projects reflecting the regional needs of ASEAN and East Asia;
::*Extend and elaborate more the analysis on linkages between real and financial economies, providing rigorous analysis pursuing [[financial market]] integration through market and institutional reform strategies.
::*Provide assessment on the current fiscal position, the impact of the stimulus package provided to cope with the last financial crisis, and potential fiscal risk as consequences of stimulus issuance both in medium and long term.
::*Continue to support ASEAN Economic [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] Meeting by further developing AEC/ERIA scorecards in cooperation with the ASEAN High Level Task Force and ASEAN Secretariat through rigorous analysis based on objective data collection and the application of quantitative methodologies.
::*Conduct the analysis of safety and environment [[standardization]] and conformity assessment in East Asian countries and propose a desirable system, focusing on accessible design and green technology.

==== Narrowing Development Gaps ====
::ERIA will continue to pursue deepening [[economic integration]] and narrowing development gaps at the same time, by applying a comprehensive approach to cover regional connectivity, maximize regional [[Economic growth|growth]], and expand regional domestic [[demand]]. The following research projects are planned;
::*Provide intellectual support for drafting ASEAN Connectivity Master Plan, which enables ASEAN to come up with coordinated direction to promote sectoral efforts to achieve ASEAN Community Building by the year 2015, focusing on connectivity aspects of various economic and social activities.
::*Further develop and deepen the analysis on various regional industrial corridor projects including [[Mekong]]-India Industrial Corridor project and Indonesia Economic Development Corridor project, [[Brunei Darussalam]]-[[Indonesia]]-[[Malaysia]]-[[Philippines]] East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) and [[Indonesia]]-[[Malaysia]]-[[Thailand]] Growth Triangle (IMT-GT), in cooperation with ASEAN Secretariat, [[Asian Development Bank]], and related institutions and countries. This project will include the expansion and sophistication of the geographical simulation analysis focusing on the effect of logistics improvements, and also include the promotion of [[infrastructure]] projects on PPP basis related to various industrial corridors.
::*Conduct studies to stimulate [[innovation]] in the region utilizing varying potentialities in East Asia, which provides resources for raising the level of economic activities in this region.
::*Target the expansion of middle class in East Asia, further develop research works toward developing safety nets such as [[social insurance]] and enhancing the [[education]] system in East Asia building upon the stocktaking works of FY 2009, and deepen the analysis in fields like economic and social implications of prolonged low-fertility rate and [[rapid aging]], reforming civil service [[pensions]], issues of unorganized labor and strengthening rural [[social protection]] systems.
::*Deepen a study on the development of [[small and medium-sized enterprises]]. This project will intend to improve economic efficiency in East Asia through the productivity enhancement and networking of SMEs, including the measures for outsourcing or sharing of common administrative and research operations.

==== Sustainable Economic Development ====
::The ERIA will support interdisciplinary efforts for [[Environmental policy|environment]] and [[energy]] issues for [[sustainable development]] in the [[region]] through comprehensive analyses and policy reviews. The projects will include the following;
::*In view of the commitment made by participating countries of the World Summit on Sustainable Development to minimize adverse effects of chemical production and use by 2020, to analyze economic and social impacts of different approaches for the chemical management, surveying current chemical management system and industrial structure in each East Asian country, and studying economic and social impacts.
::*Continue research on [[Reduce, Reuse, Recycle|3R]] (reduce, [[reuse]], and [[recycling]]) policies focusing on the importance of recycling [[statistics]], to identify different indicators and definitions of recycling rates and to propose strategies on how to develop a statistical system to evaluate [[policy]] impact, which will provide the basis for coordination among [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s, industrial standards for recycled goods, and [[Eco-|eco]]-industrial parks
::*Deepen research on energy efficiency, [[biomass]], and [[bio-fuels]] for [[energy]] [[security]] in [[East Asia]]. This project will be a continuation of past three years’ project and intend to conduct comprehensive surveys and propose agreeable policy framework for international cooperation.
::*Building upon the result of the evaluation of the impact of [[energy market]] integration in East Asian region, conduct research works on the issues of energy market integration including energy security, reform of energy pricing regime, [[liberalization]] of [[domestic policy|domestic]] energy market system, and [[investment]] and trans border [[trade]] of energy.

=== ERIA Outreach ===
:The Public relations Division of ERIA is responsible for disseminating and sharing the findings of ERIA’s research through publications, capacity building activities, and the holding of public symposia and seminar.
==== Publications ====
:The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA) produces books, research reports, discussion papers, and policy briefs to share and disseminate its research findings and policy recommendations to stakeholders and interested public. 
:These publications cover a wide range of subject matter on deepening economic integration, narrowing development gaps, and sustainable development – the three pillars under which ERIA conducts research. ERIA is also highly involved in energy-related research. 
:ERIA also co-publishes with international academic and professional printing houses. 

:Publications can be found at http://www.eria.org/publications/index.html

==== Capacity Building ====
:The Capacity Building Programme links ERIA’s research, researchers and wider networks to government officials in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Viet Nam. Acting as a bridge between ERIA materials and emerging ideas, or through the provision of technical assistance to support analysis and policy modelling, the programme supports the development of better policy and policy regulations. 

:Since the inception of the Capacity Building Programme, nearly 50 activities have taken place, with around 150 government officials benefitting through the programme since 2015. In addition to responding to special requests from the participating countries, regular activities take place around five components.

==== Seminar and Symposia ====
:Seminars and Symposia will be held with the aim of nurturing a sense of community in the region, seeking inputs from stakeholders, as well as promoting ERIA and disseminating ERIA related research findings. Various joint seminars and symposia will be held together with leading research institutes in and out of the East Asian region, including those in [[United States]] and [[Europe]].

=== Providing Policy Recommendations ===
:One of the most important ERIA's works is providing policy recommendations to leaders, ministers in ASEAN and EAS through [[East Asia Summit]] and ASEAN Summit, and another related meetings. As ERIA's mission expands by receiving instructions and task-outs from Summits and Ministerial Meetings, ERIA's role as the "Center of Excellence" in ASEAN and [[East Asia]] becomes increasingly important.
*:At the 5th East Asia Summit and the 17th [[ASEAN Summit]] held on October 2010 in [[Vietnam]]
:Heads of government of [[ASEAN]] Member States commended ERIA's contribution in "Comprehensive [[Asia]] [[International development|Development]] Plan (CADP)" and "Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity".
*:At the 16th ASEAN Transport Ministers Meeting held on November 2010 in [[Brunei Darussalam]]
:The Ministers expressed their high appreciation to the ERIA for its valuable support in conducting the Final Report on the ASEAN Strategic Transport Plan (ASTP) 2011-2015.

== Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East-Asia  ==
The ERIA is tasked with reviewing the proposed [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]] or CEPEA, the Japanese proposed [[trade bloc]] involving the 16 nations of the East Asia Summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU0803/S00068.htm Japanese Economists To Address NZ Business Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was decided at the [[Third East Asia Summit]] that the ERIA report on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership in East-Asia would be received at the [[Fourth East Asia Summit]].  The Fourth EAS was delayed for almost a year by reason of difficulties in the host nation [[Thailand]].

With the subsequent change of government in Japan, and the discussion by the new administration of the [[East Asia Community]] the future of CEPEA is not yet clear.

Subsequently the [[Fourth East Asia Summit]] supported further development on trading groupings based around the 13 country [[ASEAN Plus Three]] and the 16 country [[East Asia Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-08_EAS%20Statement.pdf Chairman’s Statement of the 4th East Asia Summit Cha-am Hua Hin, Thailand, 25 October 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127213111/http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-08_EAS%20Statement.pdf |date=27 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the subsequent [[APEC]] conference [[Australia]] announced a million Australian dollars in funding to ERIA to support research into the 16 country bloc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trademinister.gov.au/releases/2009/sc_091113.html Australia providing $1 million to boost regional integration]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Engineer in Training''', or '''EIT''', is a professional designation from the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES) used in the United States to designate a person certified by the state as having completed two requirements:
* Completed a minimum of three years of post-secondary school at an [[ABET, Inc.|ABET]]-accredited engineering program, or related science curriculum approved by the Board – Many states allow for  the substitution of several years of engineering experience in place of the engineering degree requirement.
* Passed the NCEES six-hour&lt;ref name=format&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncees.org/exams/fe-exam/|title=NCEES FE exam}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fundamentals of Engineering exam|Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination]]

Once an individual has passed the exam the state board awards that person an Engineer-in-Training (EIT) or an Engineer Intern (EI) designation. EIT and EI are equivalent variations in nomenclature that vary from state to state. Receiving an EIT designation is one step along the path toward [[Professional Engineer]] (PE) licensure.

==Clarification of the term==
"Engineer Intern"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201063039/http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |archivedate=2016-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; term could be possibly misleading term as it may imply that the engineer is still in college and is working merely in an intern position.

An Engineer-in-Training does engineering work, such as design, under the supervision and direction of a Professional Engineer, who are exclusively able to perform certain tasks, such as stamp and seal designs and offer services to the public.&lt;ref name="NCEES Licensure"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Licensure |url=http://www.ncees.org/Licensure.php |publisher=National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying |work=NCEES.org |accessdate=2013-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101230715/https://ncees.org/Licensure.php |archivedate=2012-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, an ''E.I.T.'' designation means that the person has completed the educational requirement of their P.Eng but has yet to accrue enough work experience (or has yet to apply for a P.Eng). An EIT can perform engineering work under the supervision of a professional engineer. With the exception of New Brunswick, PEO (Ontario) and OIQ (Quebec), EITs are allowed to use the title "Engineer" as long as they also include the EIT designation in either their name or their title. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engineerscanada.ca/frequently-asked-questions-for-engineers-in-training-and-members-in-training |title=Frequently Asked Questions for Engineers-in-Training and Members-in-Training |accessdate=2015-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712153507/http://www.engineerscanada.ca/frequently-asked-questions-for-engineers-in-training-and-members-in-training |archivedate=2015-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of the designation==
In the United Kingdom and the United States of America, having an EIT designation shows an understanding of fundamental engineering principles, as EITs have passed the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam. Canadian engineering has no equivalent to the FE exam for an EIT level.

==EIT designation as a part of PE licensure==
Each state's statutes delineate the requirements for the experience and education needed to become a PE once EIT or EI certification has been earned. The requirements vary depending on the State and the licensing board, but for most engineers the process typically includes the following steps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ncees.org/engineering/engineering-licensure/|title=NCEES engineering licensure|work=NCEES|access-date=2018-04-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
# Graduate from an [[ABET]]-accredited four-year university engineering program.
# Pass the 6-Hour Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination to receive an Engineer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201063039/http://ncees.org/audience-landing-pages/students/ |archivedate=2016-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intern (EI) enrollment or Engineer-in-Training (EIT) certification. The FE exam was an 8-hour exam prior to 2014. Some states such as Kansas and New York use the designation of IE (Intern Engineer), but is essentially the same as EI or EIT. Some states such as Iowa have no EIT or EI designation or certification available through their engineering boards. One just states s(he) passed the FE. An EI/EIT is not a requirement to take the PE exam; passing the FE is a requirement.
# Accumulate a set amount of engineering experience, typically under the direction of a PE. In most states the requirement is four years, but in others the requirement is lower.
# Pass the 8-hour [[Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam]] to receive a PE designation&lt;ref name="NCEES Licensure" /&gt;
In California, passing two additional exams is required to gain PE licensure. A seismic exam and a surveying exam, are in addition to the FE and PE exams for civil engineers.

'''''Eureka!''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[educational]] [[television series]] which was produced and broadcast by [[TVOntario]] in 1980 and 1981. The series was narrated by [[Billy Van]], and featured a series of [[animated]] vignettes which taught [[physics]] lessons to children. It is currently available online.

==Synopsis==

Eureka! is a series of animated shorts that illustrate concepts in physics. Each program takes a simple and direct approach to the subject matter; while the basic concepts are explained in a voice-over, cartoon characters and a variety of animated objects demonstrate the principles on the screen. Constant review and reinforcement make the message clear; as a result, the study of physics becomes easy and accessible - even to viewers without a solid background in the subject. Basic formulae and concepts are introduced with a recap of what was learnt in the previous episode to build knowledge on a topic and create connections.

==Production==

Animation - Grafilm Productions Inc.

Design - Joe Meluck

Educational Consultants - John Kuropatwa, Paul Henshall, Bryan Kaufman, Ernie McFarland, Michael Broschart

Unit Manager - Vickie Gilchrist

'''Gender inequality''' is the idea and situation that [[men]] and [[women]] are not equal. Gender inequality refers to unequal treatment or perceptions of individuals wholly or partly due to their [[gender]]. It arises from differences in [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Gender systems]] are often [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] and hierarchical. Gender inequality stems from distinctions, whether empirically grounded or socially constructed. Women lag behind men in many domains, including education, labor market opportunities and political representation and in pay.

==Natural gender differences==
{{main|Gender differences in humans}}
Natural differences exist between the sexes base on biological and anatomic factors, most notably differing reproductive roles. Biological differences include [[chromosome]]s and [[hormone|hormonal]] differences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Wood, Julia. Gendered Lives. 6th. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a natural difference also in the relative physical strengths (on average) of the sexes, both in the lower body and more pronouncedly in the upper-body, though this does not mean that any given man is stronger than any given woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maughan RJ, Watson JS, Weir J |year=1983 |title=Strength and cross-sectional area of human skeletal muscle |url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/338/1/37.abstract |journal=The Journal of Physiology |volume=338 |issue=1 |pages=37–49 |pmid=6875963 |pmc=1197179 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014658}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frontera, Hughes, Lutz, Evans |year=1991 |title=A cross-sectional study of muscle strength and mass in 45- to 78-yr-old men and women |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/2/644 |journal =J Appl Physiol |volume=71 |issue=2|pages=644–50 |pmid=1938738|doi=10.1152/jappl.1991.71.2.644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Men, on average, are taller, which provides both advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref name="Samaras 2007 33–61"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Human body size and the laws of scaling |last= Samaras|first= Thomas|year=2007 |publisher=Nova Science|location=New York|isbn= 978-1-60021-408-0|pages= 33–61|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PCU0RwDI6c4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women live significantly longer than men,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html|title=Life expectancy at birth, Country Comparison to the World|publisher=US [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|date=n.d.|website=CIA World Factbook|accessdate=12 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not clear to what extent this is a biological difference - see [[Life expectancy#gender differences|Life expectancy]].

{{Main|Gender pay gap}} 
The gender pay gap is the average difference between men's and women's aggregate [[wage]]s or [[salary|salaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-08-01|title=Using education to reduce the wage gap between men and women|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053535711000370|journal=The Journal of Socio-Economics|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=412–416|doi=10.1016/j.socec.2011.04.006|issn=1053-5357|last1=Miki|first1=Malul|last2=Yuval|first2=Fany}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap is due to a variety of factors, including differences in education choices, differences in preferred job and industry, differences in the types of positions held by men and women, differences in the type of jobs men typically go into as opposed to women (especially highly paid high risk jobs), differences in amount of work experiences, difference in length of the work week, and breaks in employment. These factors resolve 60% to 75% of the pay gap, depending on the source. Various explanations for the remaining 25% to 40% have been suggested, including women's lower willingness and ability to negotiate salary and [[sexual discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |author=CONSAD Research Corporation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Patten, Eileen|website=Pew Research Center|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/on-equal-pay-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-gender-pay-gap/|title=On Equal Pay Day, key facts about the gender pay gap|date=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Blau&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Francine D.

[[Human capital]] theories refer to the education, knowledge, training, experience, or skill of a person which makes them potentially valuable to an employer. This has historically been understood as a cause of the gendered wage gap but is no longer a predominant cause as women and men in certain occupations tend to have similar education levels or other credentials. Even when such characteristics of jobs and workers are controlled for, the presence of women within a certain occupation leads to lower wages. This earnings discrimination is considered to be a part of pollution theory. This theory suggests that jobs which are predominated by women offer lower wages than do jobs simply because of the presence of women within the occupation. As women enter an occupation, this reduces the amount of prestige associated with the job and men subsequently leave these occupations. The entering of women into specific occupations suggests that less competent workers have begun to be hired or that the occupation is becoming [[deskilling|deskilled]]. Men are reluctant to enter female-dominated occupations because of this and similarly resist the entrance of women into male-dominated occupations.&lt;ref name="Stratification"&gt;Massey, Douglas. "Categorically Unequal: The American Stratification System." NY: Russell Sage Foundation, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=October 2012}}

The gendered income disparity can also be attributed in part to [[occupational segregation]], where groups of people are distributed across occupations according to ascribed characteristics; in this case, gender.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Occupational gender segregation can be understood {{who|date=October 2012}} to contain two components or dimensions; horizontal segregation and vertical segregation. With horizontal segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as men and women are thought to possess different physical, emotional, and mental capabilities. These different capabilities make the genders vary in the types of jobs they are suited for. This can be specifically viewed with the gendered division between manual and non-manual labor.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} With vertical segregation, occupational sex segregation occurs as occupations are stratified according to the power, authority, income, and prestige associated with the occupation and women are excluded from holding such jobs.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

As women entered the workforce in larger numbers since the 1960s, occupations have become segregated based on the amount femininity or masculinity presupposed to be associated with each occupation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Census data suggests that while some occupations have become more gender integrated (mail carriers, bartenders, bus drivers, and real estate agents), occupations including teachers, nurses, secretaries, and librarians have become female-dominated while occupations including architects, electrical engineers, and airplane pilots remain predominately male in composition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Based on the census data, women occupy the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service sector]] jobs at higher rates than men. Women’s overrepresentation in service sector jobs, as opposed to jobs that require managerial work acts as a reinforcement of women and men into traditional [[gender role]]s that causes gender inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, Charles, E. Social Inequality. 6th. Boston: Pearson Education, Inc., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

“The gender wage gap is an indicator of women’s earnings compared with men’s. It is figured by dividing the average annual earnings for women by the average annual earnings for men.” (Higgins et al., 2014) 
Scholars disagree about how much of the male-female wage gap depends on factors such as experience, education, occupation, and other job-relevant characteristics. Sociologist Douglas Massey found that 41% remains unexplained,&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt; while CONSAD analysts found that these factors explain between 65.1 and 76.4 percent of the raw wage gap.&lt;ref name="CONSAD wage gap"&gt;{{cite web|author1=CONSAD research corp. |title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women |url=http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |accessdate=30 October 2015 |date=12 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CONSAD also noted that other factors such as benefits and overtime explain "additional portions of the raw gender wage gap".

The [[glass ceiling]] effect is also considered a possible contributor to the gender wage gap or income disparity. This effect suggests that gender provides significant disadvantages towards the top of job hierarchies which become worse as a person’s career goes on. The term glass ceiling implies that invisible or artificial barriers exist which prevent women from advancing within their jobs or receiving promotions. These barriers exist in spite of the achievements or qualifications of the women and still exist when other characteristics that are job-relevant such as experience, education, and abilities are controlled for. The inequality effects of the glass ceiling are more prevalent within higher-powered or higher income occupations, with fewer women holding these types of occupations. The glass ceiling effect also indicates the limited chances of women for income raises and promotion or advancement to more prestigious positions or jobs. As women are prevented by these artificial barriers, from either receiving job promotions or income raises, the effects of the inequality of the glass ceiling increase over the course of a woman’s career.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, Seth Ovadia and Reeve Vanneman. "Social Forces: The Glass Ceiling Effect." Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statistical discrimination (economics)|Statistical discrimination]] is also cited as a cause for income disparities and gendered [[inequality in the workplace]]. Statistical discrimination indicates the likelihood of employers to deny women access to certain occupational tracks because women are more likely than men to leave their job or the labor force when they become married or pregnant. Women are instead given positions that dead-end or jobs that have very little mobility.&lt;ref name="Burstein, Paul 1994"&gt;Burstein, Paul. "Equal Employment Opportunity: Labor Market Discrimination and Public Policy." Edison, NJ: Aldine Transaction, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Third World countries such as the Dominican Republic, female entrepreneurs are statistically more prone to failure in business. In the event of a business failure women often return to their domestic lifestyle despite the absence of income. On the other hand, men tend to search for other employment as the household is not a priority.&lt;ref&gt;Sherri Grasmuck and Rosario Espinal. "Market Success or Female Autonomy?" Sage Publications, Inc, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gender earnings ratio suggests that there has been an increase in women’s earnings comparative to men. Men’s plateau in earnings began after the 1970s, allowing for the increase in women’s wages to close the ratio between incomes. Despite the smaller ratio between men and women’s wages, disparity still exists. Census&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/ Census]&lt;/ref&gt; data suggests that women’s earnings are 71 percent of men's earnings in 1999.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Cotter, David, Joan Hermsen, and Reeve Vanneman. The American People Census 2000: Gender Inequality at Work. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gendered wage gap varies in its width among different races. Whites comparatively have the greatest wage gap between the genders. With whites, women earn 78% of the wages that white men do. With African Americans, women earn 90% of the wages that African American men do.

There are some exceptions where women earn more than men: According to a survey on gender pay inequality by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], female workers in the Gulf state of [[Bahrain]] earn 40 percent more than male workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedior.com/hr-portal/recruitment-news/women-earn-less-than-men-across-the-globe.html?c=3052 Women 'earn less than men across the globe'], Vedior, 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a report by the International Labor Organization (ILO) reveals the wage gap between Cambodian women factory workers and other male counterparts. There was a $25 USD monthly pay difference conveying that women have a much lower power and being devalued not only at home but also in the workplace.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/5050/theresa-de-langis/what's-woman-worth-wages-and-democracy-in-cambodia|title=What's a woman worth?: wages and democracy in Cambodia|date=2015-02-01|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional education and careers===
The gender gap also appeared to narrow considerably beginning in the mid-1960s. Where some 5% of first-year students in professional programs were female in 1965, by 1985 this number had jumped to 40% in law and medicine, and over 30% in dentistry and business school.&lt;ref&gt;Goldin, Claudia, and Lawrence F. Katz. "On The Pill: Changing the course of women's education." The Milken Institute Review, Second Quarter 2001: p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the highly effective [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] was available, women planning professional careers, which required a long-term, expensive commitment, had to "pay the penalty of abstinence or cope with considerable uncertainty regarding pregnancy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |last2=Katz |first2=Lawrence F. |year=2002 |title=The Power Of The Pill: Contraceptives And Women's Career And Marriage Decisions |url= |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=110 |issue=4 |page=731 |doi=10.1086/340778|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.6514 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control over their reproductive decisions allowed women to more easily make long-term decisions about their education and professional opportunities. Women are highly underrepresented on boards of directors and in senior positions in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719161242/http://www.catalyst.org/etc/Catalyst_Written_Testimony_To_JEC_With_Appendix.pdf|date=July 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, with reliable birth control, young men and women had more reason to delay marriage. This meant that the marriage market available to any women who "delay[ed] marriage to pursue a career... would not be as depleted. Thus the Pill ''could'' have influenced women's careers, college majors, professional degrees, and the age at marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |year=2006 |title=The Quiet Revolution That Transformed Women's Employment, Education, And Family |url= |journal=American Economic Review |volume=96 |issue=2|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies on sexism in science and technology fields have produced conflicting results. Corinne et al. found that science faculty of both sexes rated a male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than an identical female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corinne |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=Science faculty's subtle gender biases favor male students |journal=PNAS |volume=109|issue= 41|pages=16474–16479|doi=10.1073/pnas.1211286109 |pmid=22988126 |pmc=3478626}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams and Ceci, however, found that science and technology faculty of both sexes "preferred female applicants 2:1 over identically qualified males with matching lifestyles" for tenure-track positions.&lt;ref name="Williams and Ceci STEM sexism"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Wendy|last2=Stephen|first2=Ceci|title=National hiring experiments reveal 2:1 faculty preference for women on STEM tenure track|journal=PNAS|date=28 April 2015|volume=112|issue=17|pages=5360–5365|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360.abstract|accessdate=30 October 2015|pmid=25870272|doi=10.1073/pnas.1418878112|pmc=4418903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies show parents are more likely to expect their sons, rather than their daughters, to work in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics field – even when their 15-year-old boys and girls perform at the same level in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;What Lies Behind Gender Inequality in Education? 2015, s.n., S.l.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender inequality in relationships====
Gender equality in relationships has been growing over the years but for the majority of relationships, the power lies with the male.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Hooff|first=Jenny H.|title=Rationalising inequality: heterosexual couples' explanations and justifications for the division of housework along traditionally gendered lines|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=19–30|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even now men and women present themselves as divided along gender lines. A study done by Szymanowicz and Furnham, looked at the cultural stereotypes of intelligence in men and women, showing the gender inequality in self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szymanowicz|first=Agata|author2=Adrian Furnham|title=Do intelligent women stay single? Cultural stereotypes concerning the intellectual abilities of men and women|journal=Journal of Gender Studies|date=March 2011|volume=20|issue=1|pages=43–54|doi=10.1080/09589236.2011.542019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study showed that females thought if they revealed their intelligence to a potential partner, then it would diminish their chance with him. Men however would much more readily discuss their own intelligence with a potential partner. Also, women are aware of people’s negative reactions to IQ, so they limit its disclosure to only trusted friends. Females would disclose IQ more often than men with the expectation that a real true friend would respond in a positive way. Intelligence continues to be viewed as a more masculine trait, than feminine trait. The article suggested that men might think women with a high IQ would lack traits that were desirable in a mate such as warmth, nurturance, sensitivity, or kindness. Another discovery was that females thought that friends should be told about one’s IQ more so than males. However, males expressed doubts about the test’s reliability and the importance of IQ in real life more so than women. The inequality is highlighted when a couple starts to decide who is in charge of family issues and who is primarily responsible for earning income. For example, in Londa Schiebinger’s book, "Has Feminism Changed Science?", she claims that "Married men with families on average earn more money, live longer and happier, and progress faster in their careers," while "for a working woman, a family is a liability, extra baggage threatening to drag down her career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, statistics had shown that "only 17 percent of the women who are full professors of engineering have children, while 82 percent of the men do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attempts in equalizing household work====
Despite the increase in women in the labour force since the mid-1900s, traditional gender roles are still prevalent in American society. Women may be expected to put their educational and career goals on hold in order to raise children, while their husbands work. However, women who choose to work as well as fulfill a perceived gender role of cleaning the house and taking care of the children. Despite the fact that different households may divide chores more evenly, there is evidence that supports that women have retained the primary caregiver role within familial life despite contributions economically. This evidence suggest that women who work outside the home often put an extra 18 hours a week doing household or childcare related chores as opposed to men who average 12 minutes a day in childcare activities.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Ellen, and Jennifer Marshall. Issues of Gender. New York: Pearson Education, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; One study by van Hooff showed that modern couples, do not necessarily purposefully divide things like household chores along gender lines, but instead may rationalize it and make excuses.&lt;ref name="van Hooff 2011 19–30"/&gt;  One excuse used is that women are more competent at household chores and have more motivation to do them. Another is that some say the demands of the males’ jobs is higher.

There was a study conducted at an "urban comprehensive school". They were asked questions regarding their views in sexual inequality. Many parents were for the equal pay for men and women. They also were in favor for men to help with the housework. In this study, the majority of the people who were interviewed wanted gender equality and more people wants a change in gender roles. Where men stay home, cleans, and cooks while the women can work and help support the family.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Gender roles have changed drastically over the past few decades. In the article, it says that in 1920-1966, there was data recorded that women spent the most time care-tending with the home and family. There was a study made with the gender roles with the males and females, The results showed that as women spend less time in the house, men have taken over the role as the mother. The article also said that women who work spend less time within the house and with their children if they have any. Furthermore, men are taking the roles of women in the homes and its changing as time goes on. Robin A. Douthitt, the author of the article, "The Division of Labor Within the Home: Have Gender Roles Changed?" concluded by saying, "(1) men do not spend significnatly more time with chil- dren when their wives are employed and (2) employed women spend signifi- cantly less time in child care than their full-time homemaker counterparts, over a 10-year period both mothers and fathers are spending more total time with children." (703).{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Gender inequalities in relation to technology====
One survey showed that men rate their technological skills in activities such as basic computer functions and online participatory communication higher than women.  However, it should be noted that this study was a self-reporting study, where men evaluate themselves on their own perceived capabilities.  It thus is not data based on actual ability, but merely perceived ability, as participants' ability was not assessed. Additionally, this study is inevitably subject to the significant bias associated with self-reported data.&lt;ref&gt;Eszter Hargittai, What Causes Variation in Contributing to Participatory Web Sites?&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrary to such findings, a carefully controlled study that analyzed data sets from 25 developing countries led to the consistent finding that the reason why fewer women access and use digital technology is a direct result of their unfavorable conditions and ongoing discrimination with respect to employment, education and income.&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"/&gt; When controlling for these variables, women turn out to be more active users of digital tools than men. This turns the alleged digital gender divide into an opportunity: given women's affinity for ICT, and given that digital technologies are tools that can improve living conditions, ICT represents a concrete and tangible opportunity to tackle longstanding challenges of gender inequalities in developing countries, including access to employment, income, education and health services.

=== Property inheritance ===
Many countries have laws that give less inheritance of ancestral property for women compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.womanstats.org/substatics/Property%20Rights%20in%20Law%20and%20Practice%20for%20Women_2011tif_wmlogo3.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], {{Quran-usc|4|11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural marginalization ===
Gender inequalities often stem from social structures that have institutionalized conceptions of gender differences.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Marginalization]] occurs on an individual level when someone feels as if they are on the fringes or margins of their respective society. This is a social process and displays how current policies in place can affect people. For example, media advertisements display young girls with easy bake ovens (promoting being a housewife) as well as with dolls that they can feed and change the diaper of (promoting being a mother).

=== Gender stereotypes ===
{{main|Gender stereotypes}}
{{see also|Category:Feminism and the arts}}
Cultural stereotypes, which can dictate specific roles, are engrained in both men and women and these [[stereotype]]s are a possible explanation for gender inequality and the resulting gendered wage disparity. Women have traditionally been viewed as being caring and nurturing and are designated to occupations which require such skills.{{clarify|date=September 2012}}{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} While these skills are culturally valued,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} they were typically associated with domesticity, so occupations requiring these same skills are not economically valued.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Men have traditionally been viewed as the main worker in the home, so jobs held by men have been historically economically valued and occupations predominated by men continue to be economically valued and earn higher wages.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2012}}

Gender Stereotypes influenced greatly by gender expectations, different expectations on gender influence how people determine their roles, appearance, behaviors, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Annual Review of Psychology Gender Stereotypes|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|volume = 69|pages = 275–298|last=Ellemers|first=Naomi|date=27 September 2017|doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011719|pmid = 28961059}}&lt;/ref&gt; When expectations of gender roles deeply rooted in people's mind, people' values and ideas started to be influenced and leading to situation of stereotypes, which actualize their ideas into actions and perform different standards labelling the behaviors of people. Gender stereotypes limit opportunities of different gender when their performance or abilities were standardizing according to their gender-at-birth, that women and men may encounter limitations and difficulties when challenging the society through performing behaviors that their gender "not supposed" to perform. For example, men may receive judgments when they trying to stay at home and finish housework and allow their wives to go out and work instead, as men are expected to be work outside for earning money for the family.  The traditional concepts of gender stereotypes are being challenged nowadays in different societies and improvement could be observed that men could also be responsible for housework, women could also be construction worker in some societies. It is still a long process when traditional concepts and values have deep-rooted in people's mind, that higher acceptance towards gender roles and characteristics is homely to be gradually developed.

===Biological fertilisation stereotypes===
Bonnie Spanier coined the term hereditary inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schiebinger|first=London|title=Has Feminism Changed Science|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0674005440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her opinion is that some scientific publications depict human fertilization such that sperms seem to actively compete for the "passive" egg, even though in reality it is complicated (e.g. the egg has specific active membrane proteins that select sperm etc.)

===Sexism and discrimination===
Gender inequality can further be understood through the mechanisms of [[sexism]]. [[Discrimination]] takes place in this manner as men and women are subject to prejudicial treatment on the basis of gender alone. Sexism occurs when men and women are framed within two dimensions of social cognition.

Discrimination also plays out with networking and in preferential treatment within the economic market. Men typically occupy positions of power within the job economy. Due to taste or preference for other men because they share similar characteristics, men in these positions of power are more likely to hire or promote other men, thus discriminating against women.&lt;ref name="Stratification"/&gt;

Starr conducted a study in the US that found that the prison sentences that men serve are on average 63% longer than those that women serve when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history.

In the 2013 [[Academy Awards]], 140 men were nominated for an award, but only 35 women were nominated.

[[Lina Wertmuller]] (1976), [[Jane Campion]] (1994), [[Sofia Coppola]] (2004), and [[Kathryn Bigelow]] (2012) were the only four women to be nominated for Best Director, with Bigelow being the first woman to win for her film ''[[The Hurt Locker]]''. 77%  of the Academy Awards' voters are male.&lt;ref name="Gender Inequality in Film"/&gt;

A group of Hollywood actors have launched their own social movement titled #AskMoreOfHim. This movement is built on the basis of men speaking out against sexual misconduct against females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/18/02/harvard-edcast-ask-more-him|title=Harvard Edcast Ask More of Him|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A number of male activists, specifically in the film industry, have signed an open letter explaining their responsibility in the ownership of their actions, as well as calling out the actions of others. The letter has been signed and supported by Friends actor David Schwimmer, shown above, among many others. The Hollywood Reporter published their support saying, “We applaud the courage and pledge our support to the courageous women — and men, and gender non-conforming individuals — who have come forward to recount their experiences of harassment, abuse and violence at the hands of men in our country. As men, we have a special responsibility to prevent abuse from happening in the first place...

== Impact and counteractions ==
Gender inequality and discrimination are argued to cause and perpetuate poverty and [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] in society as a whole.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Nicola Jones, Rebecca Holmes, Jessica Espey 2008.

Gender Equity Indices seek to provide the tools to demonstrate this feature of [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Poverty has many different factors, one of which is the gender wage gap.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Women are more likely to be living in poverty and the wage gap is one of the causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2016/demo/p60-256.html|title=Income and Poverty in the United States: 2015|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many difficulties in creating a comprehensive response.&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Nicola Jones and Rebecca Holmes 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4943&amp;title=gender-politics-social-protection Gender, politics and social protection]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is argued{{By whom|date=March 2016}} that the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) fail to acknowledge gender inequality as a cross-cutting issue.  Gender is mentioned in MDG3 and MDG5: MDG3 measures gender parity in education, the share of women in wage employment and the proportion women in national legislatures.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  MDG5 focuses on maternal mortality and on universal access to reproductive health.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;  These targets are significantly off-track.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

Addressing gender inequality through [[social protection]] programmes designed to increase [[Gender equity|equity]] would be an effective way of reducing gender inequality, according to the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI).&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Researchers at the ODI argue for the need to develop the following in social protection in order to reduce gender inequality and increase growth:&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;
* Community childcare to give women greater opportunities to seek employment
* Support parents with the care costs (e.g. South African child/disability grants)
* Education stipends for girls (e.g. Bangladesh’s Girls Education Stipend scheme)
* Awareness-raising regarding [[gender-based violence]], and other preventive measures, such as financial support for women and children escaping abusive environments (e.g. NGO pilot initiatives in Ghana)
* Inclusion of programme participants (women and men) in designing and evaluating social protection programmes
* Gender-awareness and analysis training for programme staff
* Collect and distribute information on coordinated care and service facilities (e.g. access to [[micro-credit]] and micro-entrepreneurial training for women)
* Developing monitoring and evaluation systems that include sex-disaggregated data
The ODI maintains that society limits governments' ability to act on economic incentives.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

NGOs tend to protect women against gender inequality and [[structural violence]].

During war, combatants primarily target men.  Both sexes die however, due to disease, malnutrition and incidental crime and violence, as well as the battlefield injuries which predominately affect men.&lt;ref&gt;Ormhaug ''et al'' say "In a widely respected study on war mortality in Kosovo, Spiegel and Salama (2000) found that men were 8.9 times more likely to die from war-related trauma than women, which coincides with men being systematically targeted."&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2009 review  of papers and data covering war related deaths disaggregated by gender concluded "It appears to be difficult to say whether more men or women die from conflict conditions overall."&lt;ref name="Ormhaug"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Armed Conflict Deaths Disaggregated by Gender |author=Christin Ormhaug, in collaboration with Patrick Meier and Helga Hernes|publisher=PRIO|date=23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio also depends on the type of war, for example in the [[Falklands War]] 904 of the 907 dead were men.  Conversely figures for war deaths in 1990, almost all relating to civil war, gave ratios in the order of 1.3 males per female.

Another opportunity to tackle gender inequality is presented by modern [[information and communication technologies]]. In a carefully controlled study,&lt;ref name="HilbertGend2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Martin|date=November–December 2011|title=Digital gender divide or technologically empowered women in developing countries? A typical case of lies, damned lies, and statistics|journal=[[Women's Studies International Forum]]|volume=34|issue=6|pages=479–489|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2011.07.001|postscript=.|ref=harv}} [http://martinhilbert.net/DigitalGenderDivide.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; it has been shown that women embrace digital technology more than men.  Given that digital information and communication technologies have the potential to provide access to employment, education, income, health services, participation, protection, and safety, among others ([[ICT4D]]), the natural affinity of women with these new communication tools provide women with a tangible bootstrapping opportunity to tackle social discrimination.

Gender inequality is a result of the persistent discrimination of one group of people based upon gender and it manifests itself differently according to race, culture, politics, country, and economic situation.  It is furthermore considered a causal factor of violence against women.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}   While gender discrimination happens to both men and women in individual situations, discrimination against women is an entrenched, global pandemic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], rape and violence against women and girls is used as a tool of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gettleman|first=Jeffrey|title=Rape Epidemic Raises Trauma of Congo War|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/world/africa/07congo.html?ref=congothedemocratirepublicof|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  In Afghanistan, girls have had acid thrown in their faces for attending school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Filins|first=Dexter|title=A School Bus for Shamsia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23school-t.htm|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011|date=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considerable focus has been given to the issue of gender inequality at the international level by organizations such as the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), and the [[World Bank]], particularly in developing countries.  The causes and effects of gender inequality vary geographically, as do methods for combating it.

===Asia===
{{See also|Sex-selective abortion}}
One example of the continued existence of gender inequality in Asia is the "[[Missing women of China|missing girls]]" phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kristoff|first=Nicholas D.|title=The Women's Crusade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/magazine/23Women-t.html|date=August 23, 2009|website=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many families desire male children in order to ensure an extra source of income. In China, females are perceived as less valuable for labor and unable to provide sustenance." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Kevin|title=The Missing Girls from China|journal=Harvard International Review|date=Fall 2014 – Winter 2015|volume=36|issue=2|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, gender inequality also reflected in educational aspect in rural China . Gender inequality existed because of gender stereotypes in rural China, families may consider that is useless for girls to acquire knowledge at school because they will marry someone one day and their major responsibility is to take care of housework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hannum|first=Emily|last2=Kong|first2=Peggy|last3=Zhang|first3=Yuping|title=Family sources of educational gender inequality in rural China: A critical assessment|journal=International Journal of Educational Development|volume=29|issue=5|pages=474–486|doi=10.1016/j.ijedudev.2009.04.007|pmid=20161037|pmc=2753976|year=2009|url=http://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/12627}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people have expectations on the gender roles, that considering marriage is the major goals of a girl's life in rural China, gender inequality easily existed to limit the rights and opportunities of women.

=== Cambodia ===
A Cambodian said, "Men are gold, women are white cloth", emphasizing that women had a lower value and importance compared to men.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt; In Cambodia, approximately 15% (485,000 hectares) of land was owned by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/Jordan_Mar2012/Presentations/Panel%201.a/Panel%201.a_3_Cambodia.pdf|title=Measuring Women Status And Gender Statistics in Cambodia Through the Surveys and Census|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asian culture, there is a stereotype that women usually have lower status than men because males carry on the family name and hold the responsibilities to take care of the family. Females have a less important role, mainly to carry out domestic chores, and taking care of husbands and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coedu.usf.edu/zalaquett/mcdp/Asian%20handout.htm|title=Characteristics of  the Traditional Asian Family|website=www.coedu.usf.edu|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also the main victims of  poverty as they have little or no access to education, low pay and low chances owning assets such as lands, homes or even basic items.&lt;ref name="opendemocracy.net"/&gt;

=== Europe ===
The Global Gender Gap Report put out by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) in 2013 ranks nations on a scale of 0 to 1, with a score of 1.0 indicating full gender equality. A nation with 35 women and 65 men in political office would get a score of 0.538 as the WEF is measuring the gap between the two figures and not the actual percentage of women in a given category. While Europe holds the top four spots for gender equality, with [[Iceland]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] ranking 1st through 4th respectively, it also contains two nations ranked in the bottom 30 countries, [[Albania]] at 108 and [[Turkey]] at 120. The [[Nordic countries|Nordic Countries]], for several years, have been at the forefront of bridging the gap in gender inequality. Every Nordic country, aside from [[Denmark]] who is at 0.778, has reached above a 0.800 score. In contrast to the Nordic nations, the countries of Albania and Turkey continue to struggle with gender inequality. Albania and Turkey failed to break the top 100 nations in 2 of 4 and 3 of 4 factors, respectively. However, despite the disparity, European nations continue to make advances in the many factors that are used to determine a nation's gender gap score.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Western Europe ====
[[Western Europe]], a region most often described as comprising the non-communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylemanual.natgeo.com/home/E/europe-geographical-and-political|title=EUROPE, GEOGRAPHICAL AND POLITICAL - National Geographic Style Manual|website=stylemanual.natgeo.com|access-date=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; has, for the most part been doing well in eliminating the gender gap. Western Europe holds 12 of the top 20 spots on the Global Gender Gap Report for overall score. While remaining mostly in the top 50 nations, four Western European nations fall below that benchmark. [[Portugal]] is just outside of the top 50 at number 51 with score of 0.706 while Italy (71), Greece (81) and Malta (84) received scores of 0.689, 0.678 and 0.676, respectively.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

==== Eastern Europe ====
A large portion of [[Eastern Europe]], a region most often described as the former communist members of post-WWII Europe,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; resides between 40th and 100th place in the Global Gender Gap Report. A few outlier countries include [[Lithuania]], which jumped nine places (37th to 28th) from 2011 to 2013, [[Latvia]], which has held the 12th spot for two consecutive years, Albania and Turkey.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013" /&gt;

===India===
{{main|Gender inequality in India}}
India ranking remains low in gender equality measures by the World Economic Forum, although the rank has been improving in recent years.&lt;ref name="The Global Gender Gap Report 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2011.pdf 2011 Gender Gap Report] World Economic Forum, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; When broken down into components that contribute the rank, India performs well on political empowerment, but is scored near the bottom with China on [[sex selective abortion]]. India also scores poorly on overall female to male [[literacy]] and health rankings. India with a 2013 ranking of 101 out of 136 countries had an overall score of 0.6551, while Iceland, the nation that topped the list, had an overall score of 0.8731 (no gender gap would yield a score of 1.0).&lt;ref name="Global Gender Gap Report 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Gender Gap Report 2013|url=http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=31 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331190253/http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap|archivedate=31 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender inequalities impact India's sex ratio, women's health over their lifetimes, their educational attainment, and economic conditions. It is a multifaceted issue that concerns men and women alike.

The labor force participation rate of women was 80.7% in 2013.&lt;ref name=undp&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Development Report for 2012|url=https://data.undp.org/dataset/Table-4-Gender-Inequality-Index/pq34-nwq7|publisher=United Nations Development Project|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Lockwood of the [[Society for Human Resource Management]], the world's largest human resources association with members in 140 countries, in a 2009 report wrote that female labor participation is lower than men, but has been rapidly increasing since the 1990s. Out of India's 397 million workers in 2001, 124 million were women, states Lockwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perspectives on Women in Management in India|author=Nancy Lockwood|publisher=Society for Human Resource Management|year=2009|url=http://www.shrm.org/Research/Articles/Articles/Documents/09-0677_India_Women_Ldrshp_FNL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India is on target to meet its [[Millennium Development Goal]] of gender parity in education before 2016.&lt;ref name="in.one.un.org"&gt;http://in.one.un.org/task-teams/gender-equality-and-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}  UNICEF's measures of attendance rate and Gender Equality in Education Index (GEEI) attempt to capture the quality of education.&lt;ref&gt;Unterhalther, E.

=== United States ===
{{main|Gender inequality in the United States}}
The [[World Economic Forum]] measures gender equity through a series of economic, educational, and political benchmarks.  It has ranked the United States as 19th (up from 31st in 2009) in terms of achieving gender equity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=World Economic Forum|year=2009|volume=Global Gender Gap Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The US Department of Labor has indicated that in 2009, "the median weekly earnings of women who were full-time wage and salary workers was... 80 percent of men's".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Stats on Women Workers |url=http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |website=U.S. Department of Labor |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426194948/http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/main.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Justice found that in 2009, "the percentage of female victims (26%) of intimate partner violence was about 5 times that of male victims (5%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Crime Victimization Survey, 2010|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The United States ranks 41st in a ranking of 184 countries on maternal deaths during pregnancy and childbirth, below all other industrialized nations and a number of developing countries"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEDAW 2011 website|url=http://www.cedaw2010.org/index.php/about-cedaw/cedaw-by-the-numbers|accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and women only represent 20% of members of Congress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==== Political affiliations and behaviors ====
Existing research on the topic of gender/sex and politics has found differences in political affiliation, beliefs, and voting behavior between men and women, although these differences vary across cultures. Gender is omnipresent in every culture, and while there are many factors to consider when labeling people "Democrat" or "Republican"—such as race and religion—gender is especially prominent in politics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Croucher|first=Stephen M.|last2=Spencer|first2=Anthony T.|last3=McKee|first3=Connie|date=2014-03-15|title=Religion, Religiosity, Sex, and Willingness to Express Political Opinions: A Spiral of Silence Analysis of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election|journal=Atlantic Journal of Communication|volume=22|issue=2|pages=111–123|doi=10.1080/15456870.2014.890001|issn=1545-6870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying gender and political behavior poses challenges, as it can be difficult to determine if men and women actually differ in substantial ways in their political views and voting behavior, or if biases and stereotypes about gender cause people to make assumptions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ditonto|first=Tessa M.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Allison J.|last3=Redlawsk|first3=David P.|date=2013-05-14|title=Gender Stereotypes, Information Search, and Voting Behavior in Political Campaigns|journal=Political Behavior|language=en|volume=36|issue=2|pages=335–358|doi=10.1007/s11109-013-9232-6|issn=0190-9320}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, trends in voting behavior among men and women have been proven through research.

Research shows that women in postindustrial countries like the United States, Canada, and Germany primarily identified as conservative before the 1960s; however, as time has progressed and new waves of feminism have occurred, women have become more left-wing due to shared beliefs and values between women and parties more on the left.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Inglehart|first=Ronald|last2=Norris|first2=Pippa|date=2000-01-01|title=The Developmental Theory of the Gender Gap: Women's and Men's Voting Behavior in Global Perspective|journal=International Political Science Review / Revue Internationale de Science Politique|volume=21|issue=4|pages=441–463|jstor=1601598|doi=10.1177/0192512100214007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in these countries typically oppose war and the death penalty, favor gun control, support environment protection, and are more supportive of programs that help people of lower socioeconomic statuses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Voting behaviors of men have not experienced as drastic of a shift over the last fifty years as women in their voting behavior and political affiliations. These behaviors tend to consistently be more conservative than women overall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These trends change with every generation, and factors such as culture, race, and religion also must be considered when discussing political affiliation. These factors make the connection between gender and political affiliation complex due to intersectionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidate gender also plays a role in voting behavior. Women candidates are far more likely than male candidates to be scrutinized and have their competence questioned by both men and women when they are seeking information on candidates in the beginning stages of election campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Democrat male voters tend to seek more information about female Democrat candidates over male Democrat candidates. Female Republican voters tend to seek more information about female Republican candidates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For this reason, female candidates in either party typically need to work harder to prove themselves competent more than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Challenges to women in politics ====
Overall, [[politics in the United States]] are dominated by men, which can pose many challenges to women who decide to enter the political sphere.  As the number of women participants in politics continue to increase around the world, the gender of female candidates serves as both a benefit and a hindrance within their campaign themes and advertising practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Yu-Kang|date=2014|title=Gender stereotypes as a double-edged sword in political advertising Persuasion effects of campaign theme and advertising style|url=|journal=International Journal of Advertising|doi=10.2501/IJA-33-2-203-234|pmid=|access-date=|volume=33|issue=2|pages=203–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching challenge seems to be that—no matter their actions—women are unable to win in the political sphere as different standards are used to judge them when compared to their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hillary Clinton in the News: Gender and Authenticity in American Politics|last=Parry-Giles|first=Shawn|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Champaign|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area in particular that exemplifies varying perceptions between male and female candidates is the way female candidates decide to dress and how their choice is evaluated. When women decide to dress more masculine, they are perceived as being "conspicuous." When they decide to dress more feminine, they are perceived as "deficient."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flicker|first=Eva|date=2013|title=Fashionable (dis-)order in politics: Gender, power and the dilemma of the suit|url=|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|doi=10.1386/macp.9.2.201_3|pmid=|access-date=|volume=9|issue=2|pages=201–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, women in politics are generally expected to adhere to the masculine standard, thereby validating the idea that gender is binary and that power is associated with masculinity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Charles|first=Nickie|date=2014-07-01|title=Doing Gender, Practising Politics: Workplace Cultures in Local and Devolved Government|journal=Gender, Work &amp; Organization|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=368–380|doi=10.1111/gwao.12042|issn=1468-0432}}&lt;/ref&gt; As illustrated by the points above, these simultaneous, mixed messages create a "double-bind" for women. Some scholars go on to claim that this masculine standard represents symbolic violence against women in politics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Political knowledge is a second area where male and female candidates are evaluated differently and where political science research has consistently shown women with a lower level of knowledge than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Kathleen|date=2011-01-01|title=Do Women and Men Know Different Things? Measuring Gender Differences in Political Knowledge|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=73|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1017/S0022381610000897|issn=0022-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for this finding is the argument that there are different areas of political knowledge that different groups consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpini|first=Michael|last2=Keeter|first2=Scott|year=1993|title=Measuring Political Knowledge: Putting First Things First|jstor=2111549|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1179–1206|doi=10.2307/2111549|pmid=|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this line of thought, scholars are advocating the replacement of traditional political knowledge with gender-relevant political knowledge because women are not as politically disadvantaged as it may appear.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A third area that affects women's engagement in politics is their low level of political interest and perception of politics as a "men's game."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Robert G.|date=2005-12-01|title=Religion, Race, and Gender Differences in Political Ambition|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X05050154|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=null|issue=4|pages=577–596|doi=10.1017/S1743923X05050154|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite female candidates' political contributions being equal to that of male candidates, research has shown that women perceive more barriers to office in the form of rigorous campaigns, less overall recruitment, inability to balance office and family commitments, hesitancy to enter competitive environments, and a general lack of belief in their own merit and competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawless|first=Jennifer|last2=Fox|first2=Richard|date=2008|title=Why are women still not running for public office?|url=|journal=Issues in Governance Studies|volume=16|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male candidates are evaluated most heavily on their achievements, while female candidates are evaluated on their appearance, voice, verbal dexterity, and facial features in addition to their achievements.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Steps needed for change ====
Several forms of action have been taken to combat institutionalized sexism. People are beginning to speak up or "talk back" in a constructive way to expose gender inequality in politics, as well as gender inequality and under-representation in other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender in Communication: A Critical Introduction|last=DeFrancisco|first=Victoria Pruin|last2=Palczewski|first2=Catherine Helen|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4522-2009-3|location=Los Angeles|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers who have delved into the topic of institutionalized sexism in politics have introduced the term "undoing gender." This term focuses on education and an overarching understanding of gender by encouraging "social interactions that reduce gender difference."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some feminists argue that "undoing gender" is problematic because it is context-dependent and may actually reinforce gender. For this reason, researchers suggest "doing gender differently" by dismantling [[gender norm]]s and expectations in politics, but this can also depend on culture and level of government (e.g. local versus federal).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another key to combating institutionalized sexism in politics is to diffuse gender norms through "gender-balanced decision-making," particularly at the international level, which "establishes expectations about appropriate levels of women in decision-making positions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Santos|first=Maria|last2=Amancio|first2=Ligia|last3=Alves|first3=Helder|date=2013|title=Gender and politics: The relevance of gender on judgments about the merit of candidates and the fairness of quotas|url=|journal=Portuguese Journal of Social Science|doi=10.1386/pjss.12.2.133_1|pmid=|access-date=|volume=12|issue=2|pages=133–149|hdl=10071/14575}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with this solution, scholars have started placing emphasis on "the value of the individual and the importance of capturing individual experience." This is done throughout a candidate's political career—whether that candidate is male or female—instead of the collective male or female candidate experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDermott|first=Rose|date=2013-03-01|title=A Feminist Scientific Approach to the Analysis of Politics and Gender|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X12000761|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=9|issue=1|pages=110–115|doi=10.1017/S1743923X12000761|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five recommended areas of further study for examining the role of gender in U.S. political participation are (1) realizing the "intersection between gender and perceptions"; (2) investigating the influence of "local electoral politics"; (3) examining "gender socialization"; (4) discerning the connection "between gender and political conservatism"; and (5) recognizing the influence of female political role models in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Richard L.|date=2011-03-01|title=Studying Gender in U.S. Politics: Where Do We Go from Here?|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S1743923X10000589|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=7|issue=1|pages=94–99|doi=10.1017/S1743923X10000589|issn=1743-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that gender is intricately entwined in every societal institution, gender in politics can only change once gender norms in other institutions change, as well.

[[File:Good housekeeping 1908 08 a.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' is one of several [[periodical]]s related to homemaking]]
[[File:Title page of OUR HOME CYCLOPEDIA, printed 1889.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of ''Our Home Cyclopedia: Cookery and Housekeeping,'' published in Detroit, Michigan, in 1889]]
'''Homemaking''' is a mainly [[American English|American]] term for the management of a [[home]], otherwise known as '''housework''', '''[[housekeeping]]''', or '''household management'''.  It is the act of overseeing the organizational, day-to-day operations of a house or estate, and the managing of other domestic concerns. 
A person in charge of the homemaking, who is not employed outside the home, is in the U.S. called a '''homemaker''', a  term for a [[housewife]] or a [[househusband]]. The term "homemaker", however, may also refer to a [[social worker]] who manages a household during the incapacity of the housewife or househusband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/homemaker |title=homemaker - definition of homemaker by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housework is not always a lifetime commitment; many, for economic or personal reasons, return to the workplace. In previous decades, there were many mandatory courses for the young to learn the skills of homemaking.  In high school, courses included [[cooking]], [[nutrition]], [[home economics]], [[family and consumer science]] (FACS), and [[food and cooking hygiene]]. This last one may underlie the tradition that a homemaker is portrayed wearing an [[apron]]. More recently, most of these courses have been abolished, and many youths in high school and college would be more likely to study child development and the management of children's behavior.

==Household tools==
{{main|Domestic technology|:Category:Home appliances|:Category:Cleaning tools}}
The method and function of housework are different in the industrial world and in other countries, with the balance of convenience, labor-saving devices and easier methods being in the industrial homemaker's favor. The reason for this is that mechanical [[invention]] has been applied extensively to different tasks of the home. Inventors have developed mechanical labor-saving devices not only for the shop and office, but also for the home. There are, on the market, thousands of household tools, devices and equipment for every domestic need. It only remains for the homemaker to choose between them.

Another reason for the great supply and demand for household labor savers in the industrial world is that the homemaker has to face the increasingly complex problem of scarce [[domestic help]]. With cheap labor, the need for the mechanical replacers of labor, or "mechanical servants," will not be keenly felt, however, the majority of homemakers perform their own household tasks. It is to this class of homemakers who are actively concerned in domestic work that the labor-saver and improved modern [[tool]] most appeal. The homemaker's time and effort are worth conserving by every means. Homemakers should, therefore, be eager to buy and use all the household tools that will save their strength and time and liberate them from household drudgery.

While some homemakers are "handy" with tools, the fact remains that most homemakers are unfamiliar with the different principles involved in mechanical tools and devices. The homemaker, however, is called to have knowledge of the principles of applied mechanics. Courses in school physics unfortunately leave a student with little practical knowledge that can be applied to domestic equipment. The gaining of knowledge concerning domestic tools may lead the homemaker to purchase good quality equipment, which may assist in saving time and labor.

==Housekeeping==
[[File:dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[vacuum cleaner]]]]
[[Housekeeping]] by the homemaker is the care and control of property, ensuring its maintenance and proper use and appearance. A [[home]] is a place of residence.&lt;ref name="defhome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/home |title='Home' - Definitions from Dictionary.com|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a private home a [[maid]] or [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] might be employed to do some of the housekeeping. Housework is work done by the act of housekeeping. Some housekeeping is housecleaning and some housekeeping is home chores. Home chores are housework that needs to be done at regular intervals,&lt;ref&gt;Gove, Philip et al. 1961. ''Webster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language'' Unabridged. Springfield, Massachusetts: G &amp; C Merriam Company&lt;/ref&gt; Housekeeping includes the budget and control of expenditures, preparing meals and buying food, paying the heat bill, and cleaning the house.&lt;ref&gt;Ansley, Clark et al. 1935. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia in One Volume''. Morningside Heights, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooking===
{{main|Cooking}}
{{See also|List of food preparation utensils|Diet (nutrition)|Cuisine|Cookbook}}
Most modern-day houses contain [[Sanitation|sanitary facilities]] and a means of [[Cooking|preparing food]]. A [[kitchen]] is a room or part of a room used by the Homemaker for [[cooking]], [[food preparation]] and food preservation. In the West, a modern kitchen is typically equipped with a [[stove]], an oven, a [[sink]] with hot and cold running water, a [[refrigerator]] and [[kitchen cabinet]]s. Many homemakers use a [[microwave oven]], a [[dishwasher]] and other electric appliances like [[blender]] and convection [[cooker]] and automatic appliances like [[rotimatic]] and automatic cookers. The main function of a kitchen is cooking or preparing food but it may also be used for [[dining]] and [[entertaining]].

[[Cooking]] is the process of preparing [[food]] with or without [[heat]], making and selecting, measuring and combining ingredients in an ordered procedure for producing safe and edible food. The process encompasses a vast range of methods, tools and combinations of [[ingredient]]s to alter the [[flavor]], appearance, texture, or [[digestion|digestibility]] of food. Factors affecting the final outcome include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual doing the actual cooking.

The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, social and religious diversity throughout the nations, races, creeds and tribes across the globe. Applying heat to a food usually, though not always, [[chemistry|chemically]] transforms it, thus changing its flavor, texture, consistency, appearance, and nutritional properties. Methods of cooking that involve the boiling of [[liquid]] in a receptacle have been practised at least since the 10th millennium BC, with the introduction of [[pottery]].

===Cleaning===
[[Housecleaning]] by the homemaker is the systematic process of making a home neat and clean. This may be applied more broadly that just an individual home, or as a metaphor for a similar "clean up" process applied elsewhere such as a procedural reform. In the process of housecleaning general cleaning activities are completed, such as disposing of [[rubbish]], storing of belongings in regular places, cleaning dirty surfaces, [[dust]]ing and [[Vacuum cleaner|vacuuming]]. The details of this are various and complicated enough that many books have been published on the subject. How-to sites on the internet have many articles on housecleaning. Tools include the [[vacuum cleaner]], [[broom]] and [[mop]]. Supplies such as [[Detergent|cleaning solutions]] and sponges are sold in grocery stores and elsewhere. Professional cleaners can be hired for less frequent or specialist tasks such as cleaning blinds, rugs, and sofas. Professional services are also offered for the basic tasks. Safety is a consideration because some cleaning products are [[toxic]] and some cleaning tasks are physically demanding. ''[[Green cleaning]]'' refers to cleaning without causing pollution. The history of housecleaning has links to the advancement of technology.

Outdoor housecleaning chores include removing leaves from rain gutters, washing windows, sweeping doormats, cleaning the pool, putting away lawn furniture, and taking out the trash.&lt;ref&gt;Smallin, Donna. 2006. ''Cleaning Plain &amp; Simple''. Storey Publishing, North Adams, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laundry===
{{see also|Ironing}}
[[File:Waschvollautomat Constructa 1950er.jpg|thumb|left|A 1950s [[washing machine]]]]

[[Laundry]] refers to the act of [[washing]] [[clothing]] and [[linen]]s, the place where that washing is done, and/or that which needs to be, is being, or has been laundered. Various chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in [[soaproot]] or yucca-root used by Native American tribes. [[Soap]], a compound made from [[lye]] (from wood-ash) and [[fat]], is an ancient and very common laundry aid. Modern [[washing machine]]s typically use powdered or liquid [[laundry detergent]] in place of more traditional soap. Once clean, the clothes have been wrung out — twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or clotheslines to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass.

Washing machines and dryers are now fixtures in homes around the world. In some parts of the world, including the USA, Canada, and Switzerland, [[apartment building]]s and [[dormitory|dormitories]] often have laundry rooms, where residents share washing machines and dryers. Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a [[Currency detector|coin slot]]. In other parts of the world, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial [[laundromat]].

A [[clothes dryer]] is a household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load of [[clothing]] and other [[textiles]], generally shortly after they are cleaned in a washing machine. Most dryers consist of a rotating [[drum]] called a tumbler through which heated air is circulated to [[evaporate]] the moisture from the load. The tumbler is rotated relatively slowly in order to maintain space between the articles in the load. In most cases, the tumbler is belt-driven by an [[induction motor]]. Using these machines may cause clothes to shrink, become less soft (due to loss of short soft fibers/ lint) and fade. For these reasons, as well as environmental concerns, many people use open air methods such as a [[clothes line]] and [[clotheshorse]].

[[starch|Laundry starch]] is used in the [[laundry|laundering]] of [[clothing|clothes]]. Starch was widely used in [[Europe]] in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and [[Ruff (clothing)|ruffs]] of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. During the 19th century and early 20th century, it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men's [[shirt]]s and the ruffles of girls' [[petticoat]]s by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being [[ironing|ironed]]. Aside from the smooth, crisp edges it gave to clothing, it served practical purposes as well. [[dust|Dirt]] and [[sweat]] from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing, and would easily wash away along with the starch. After each laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today the product is sold in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] for home use.

==Maintenance==
{{main|Maintenance, repair and operations}}
Homemakers that follow [[predictive maintenance]] techniques determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach offers cost savings over routine or time-based maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted. Homemakers that follow [[preventive maintenance]] methods ensure that household equipment and the house are in satisfactory operating condition by providing for inspection, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects.

===Home maintenance===
{{main|Home repair|Home improvement|Home automation| Handyman}}
[[Home maintenance]] involves the diagnosis and resolution of problems in a home, and is related to home maintenance to avoid such problems. Many types of maintenance are "[[Do it yourself]]" (DIY) projects. Maintenance is not necessarily the same as [[home improvement]], although many improvements can result from repairs or maintenance. Often the costs of larger repairs will justify the alternative of investment in full-scale improvements. It may make just as much sense to upgrade a home system (with an improved one) as to repair it or incur ever-more-frequent and expensive maintenance for an inefficient, obsolete or dying system. For a DIY project, also useful is the established limits on  time and money investments before a repair (or list of repairs) become overwhelming and discouraging, and less likely to ever be completed.

===Lawn maintenance===
{{main|Lawn care | Gardening}}
Homemakers that have a lawn responsibility adhere to seasonal [[lawn care]] practices, which vary to some extent depending on the [[climate zone]] and type of [[grass]] that is grown (whether cool season or warm season varieties). Various recognized method used by homemakers in lawn care are observed in any area. In spring or early summer, homemakers seed, sod, or sprig a yard when the ground is warmer. In Summer lawn mowers are used at high cutting for cool season grass, and lower cutting for warm season lawns. In autumn, lawns are mown by homemakers at a lower height and thatch build-up that occurs in warm season grasses are removed.&lt;ref&gt;Lawn experts are divided in their opinions on this.&lt;/ref&gt; Homemakers do add sandy [[loam]] and apply fertilizer, containing some type of wetting agent. Cool season lawns are planted in the autumn with adequate rainfall. Lawn care in the winter is minimal, requiring only light feedings of organic material, such as green-waste compost, and minerals to encourage earthworms and beneficial microbes.

==Management==
Household management by the homemaker is the act of overseeing the [[organizing (management)|organizational]], financial, and day-to-day operations of a house or estate. It differs from [[housekeeping]], which consists of the physical maintenance and cleaning of a house.

Also common in the U.S are homemaking parties which involve a group of people doing household work instead of hanging out with their friends.

===House organization===
House organization or home organization includes interior design which is making the home aesthetically pleasing; and de-cluttering which is removing unnecessary things from the house.

====Interior design====
Interior design is making the home aesthetically pleasing. Its activities include arranging furniture,  having plants inside the house, and more.

====De-cluttering====
Household de-cluttering involves putting things in their proper place after they have been used.  "Cleaning up your mess" might involve removing glasses or eating utensils from the living room if you have eaten a meal there in front of the television.  If several people have done that over a few days and not removed their glasses, dishes and utensils from the living room, the living room is considered to be "cluttered" with dishes.  The dishes are out of place because they belong in the kitchen, washed and put away in the cupboards. That is the most common example of clutter in a modern American household.

There is another definition of clutter, which refers to having simply too many things and not enough room for all of it.  Sometimes as happens in Asian households, the items are necessary, but the house is simply too small, and ingenious methods are needed to organize everything so that unsightly clutter does not result.  However, removing unneeded or no longer necessary objects from a household or home is also an aspect of de-cluttering. Objects can be [[Gift|given away]] to friends or [[Charitable organization|charitable]] organizations, [[selling|sold]] as [[second-hand]], [[Recycling|recycled]] or [[Waste management|thrown away]].

Extreme forms of an inability to de-clutter is a behavioral aspect of [[compulsive hoarding]]. On the other end, a society that relies overly much on generating and then disposing of [[waste]] is referred to as [[throw-away society]].

===Household purchasing===
{{Main|Purchasing | Household budget | Shopping}}
Household [[purchasing]] refers to homemaker's attempt to acquire goods or services to accomplish the goals of the household. Though there are several households that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process, processes can vary greatly between households. Typically the word “purchasing” is not used interchangeably with the word “[[procurement]]”, since procurement typically includes other concepts. Home makers decide the market goods that the household will buy, such as the [[groceries]] which have been bought at a [[grocer]]'s.

Another important purchase handled by homemakers is the power source used for appliances. Home or other building heating may include boilers, [[furnace]]s, and [[water heater]]s. [[Compressed natural gas]] is used in [[rural]] homes without connections to [[plumbing|piped]]-in [[public utility]] services, or with portable [[Grill (cooking)|grills]]. However, due to being less economical than [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], LPG (Propane) is the dominant source of rural gas for natural gas-powered ranges and/or ovens, natural gas-heated [[clothes dryer]]s, [[HVAC|heating]]/[[air conditioning|cooling]] and [[central heating]]. The amount of usages is determined by factors such as [[natural gas prices]].

===Servants===
{{main|Maid|Butler|Domestic worker}}
Homemakers may manage household workers or "[[domestic worker]]s".

==Work strategies==
{{main|Household|Employment}}
In [[sociology]], ''household work strategy'' is the [[division of labour]] between members of a household, whether implicit or the result of explicit decision–making, with the alternatives weighed up in a simplified type of [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref name="essex-pahl"&gt;[http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204011627/http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm |date=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DivisionsLabour"&gt;''Divisions of Labour'' Ray Pahl (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a plan for the relative deployment of household members' time between the three domains of [[employment]]:
# in the ''[[market economy]]'', including home-based self-employment second jobs, in order to obtain money to buy goods and services in the market;
# ''domestic production work'', such as cultivating a vegetable patch or raising chickens, purely to supply food to the household; and
# ''domestic consumption work'' to provide goods and services directly within the household, such as cooking meals, child–care, household repairs, or the manufacture of clothes and gifts.
Household work strategies may vary over the life-cycle, as household members age, or with the economic environment; they may be imposed by one person or be decided collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-householdworkstrategy.html|title=Household work strategy|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Household production==
Homemaking is described by economists as "household production".   Household production has been defined as "the production of the goods and services by the members of a household, for their own consumption, using their own capital and their own [[unpaid work |unpaid labor]]. Goods and services produced by households for their own use include accommodation, meals, clean clothes, and child care. The process of household production involves the transformation of purchased intermediate commodities into final consumption commodities. Households use their own capital and their own labor."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ironmonger, D. |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/mlb/wpaper/759.html |title=Household Production and the Household Economy |publisher=Ideas.repec.org |date=2000-02-02 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goods and services created at the household level are generally consumed within the country within which they were produced, and hence contribute to "Domestic Consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/domestic-consumption|title=Domestic Consumption|publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wages for housework==
The [[Wages for housework|International Wages for Housework Campaign]] was a global, social movement co-founded in 1972 in [[Padua]], Italy, by author and activist [[Selma James]]. The Campaign was formed to raise awareness of how housework and [[childcare]] are the base of all industrial work and to stake the claim that these unavoidable tasks should be compensated as paid, wage labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Selma|title=Is Transformation Possible? They Say We Can't. We Must.|jstor=20838923|work=Off Our Backs|publisher=Off Our Backs. Inc|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demands for the Wages for Housework formally called for economic compensation for domestic work but also used these demands to more generally call attention to the affective labors of women, the reliance of capitalist economies on exploitative labor practices against women, and leisure inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nplusonemag.com/more-smiles-more-money|title=More Smiles? More Money|work=nplusonemag.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[List of home appliances|Many home appliances]] have been invented that make housework faster or more effective compared to before the industrial revolution.  These include:
* [[Washing machine]]
* [[Clothes dryer]]
* [[Dishwasher]]
* [[Sewing machine]]
* [[Vacuum cleaner]]
* [[Small electrics]] like the [[electric mixer]], [[blender]], [[toaster]], and [[coffee maker]]
* [[Microwave oven]]
* [[Refrigerator]], reducing the number of grocery trips or the amount of food preservation work to do

[[Utilities]] can potentially eliminate work like gathering and chopping firewood, shovelling coal, fetching water from outdoors, and heating cold tap water.

Historian Ruth Schwartz Cowan claims that homemakers in the 1800s performed about 50–60 hours of work per week, and that this is the same as the 1990s.  She says that labor-saving devices have been used to make the same amount of time do more work, such as by vacuuming a rug instead of sweeping it, or washing fabrics more frequently.  Modern parents also more frequently transport their children after-school activities, and doctors no longer make house calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines//epi1088.htm |title=No. 1088: Housework |website=Uh.edu |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Greek hoplite.png|right|thumb|A Greek hoplite, armed with spear and shield]]
'''Hoplology''' is a science that studies human combative behavior and performance.

==Etymology and history of the term==
The word ''hoplology'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hoplos'' (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ὅπλον ''hóplon'', a wooden shield carried by some warriors in ancient Greece.  The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.&lt;ref name="hacc1" /&gt;  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F.

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of "arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial" (Burton, 1884),&lt;ref&gt;Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+swords&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20swords&amp;f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently as "the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity" (Draeger, 1982).&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"&gt;International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Sid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as "the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours."&lt;ref&gt;Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The International Hoplology Society==
Founded by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) (1922-1982), the International Hoplology Society ("IHS") exists to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems.

Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, carries on the hoplological tradition as director of IHS. He is a leading authority on combative behavior and performance. He has trained in numerous Asian and Western martial arts from a young age. He has spent a lifetime studying hoplology and related areas, including functional conditioning for combat. He currently trains military and law enforcement around the world in these areas. He works closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP).

In recent years, with the advent of the [[Modern Army Combatives]] (MAC) Program in the [[US Army]] and the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP), there has been a rapid growth in both scientific and academic research. With [[Matt Larsen]], the father of the MAC program, as a catalyst, research departments are growing at universities across the United States. One of the first such programs was at [[Kansas State University]]; the program is currently defunct.&lt;ref&gt;The Collegian - [http://www.kstatecollegian.com/news/modern-combatives-program-cancelled-due-to-budget-concerns-1.2165227 Modern combatives program cancelled due to budget concerns] published by The Collegian Feb 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accouterments and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"/&gt;

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.&lt;ref name="Meron Langsner"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBmoVChMI7uLa-eaKxwIVSNEUCh0JCAfT#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false|author=Meron Langsner|title=Text &amp; Presentation, 2006|publisher=McFarland, 5 Feb 2007, 260 pages, (edited by Stratos E. Constantinidi), {{ISBN|0786455411}}, ''Volume 3 of The Comparative Drama Conference Series''|accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While hoplology is still in its infancy, it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as [[combative psychology]], [[killology]], [[anthropology]], and [[military history]].

==The hoplological view on violence==
The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side "…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy." (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=September 2016}}

A '''housing development''' is a structured [[real estate development]] of residential buildings.  Popular throughout the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], they are often areas of high-density, low-impact residences of [[single-family detached home]]s, and often allow for separate ownership of each [[housing unit]], for example through [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]. A housing development is "often erected on a tract of land by one builder and controlled by one management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=dictionary.com|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/housing-development|title=housing development|accessdate=Sep 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several different housing types. All of which housing developers can choose to develop. They can range from Single Detached, Duplex, Triplex, Multiplex/Big House, Side Attached, Stacked Rowhouse, Small Apartment, Low-rise Apartment, Mid-rise Apartment, Apartment over Commercial, High-Rise Apartment.&lt;ref name=corridor&gt;http://www.corridordevelopment.org/pdfs/Housing%20Types/Housing_Types_Sheets.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the different housing types will have their distinctive characteristics, density ranges, number of units, and floors.&lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

==  Housing Types ==
=== Single Detached ===
This type of housing will be detached from other housing types. This type of unit houses lower densities. Lawns are an option for this kind of design, with distinctive public and private spaces. A single detached can have up to three floors. Some of the common names for a singled detached housing type is "House, Cottage, Villa, Bungalow"&lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

=== Duplex, Triplex ===
This type of housing can have two or three dwelling units in a detached building. The units could be together or separate depending on the location of the duplex. A duplex will also have an option for a yard in order to keep their private space. This type of housing will allow for higher density housing compared to the single detached units. Duplex, and Triplex can account for 2-3 units, and have up to 3 floors. Some of the common names for Duplex, Triplex are "Semi-detached, Double House, Accessory unity, Ancillary unit, Carriage unit, Twin Home." &lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

=== Big house, Multiplex ===
Big house, Multiplex can come in many forms, it can have a single or muli-level unit. Just like the duplex, it can have multiple floors, up to 3 floors. It can account for up to 5 units as well. This type of housing will have a higher density than single detached housing. Some of the common names for the big house, multiplex are Quadruplex, Mansion townhomes, back to back semi-detached, Grand house &lt;ref name=corridor/&gt;

'''Johanna Drucker''' (born May 30, 1952) is an American author, book artist, visual theorist, and cultural critic. Her scholarly writing documents and critiques visual language: [[letterform]]s, [[typography]], [[visual poetry]], [[art]], and lately, digital aesthetics. She is currently the Martin and Bernard Breslauer Professor in the Department of Information Studies at the [[UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies|Graduate School of Education and Information Studies]] at [[UCLA]].

==Biography==
Johanna Ruth Drucker was born in 1952 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family, the daughter of Barbara (née Witmer) and Boris Drucker (1920–2009). Her father was a [[cartoonist]] whose works were published in diverse publications as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.syr.edu/digital/exhibits/c/cartoonists/drucker.htm Boris Drucker], ''Draw Your Own Conclusions: Political Cartooning Then and ?'', Syracuse University Libraries; [https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=boris-drucker&amp;pid=123106498 Boris Drucker: Obituary], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 17, 2009, on [[Legacy.com]]; [http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/resources/longbox/20819 Boris Drucker, 1920-2009], The Comics Reporter, January 20, 2009; Johanna Drucker, "Biographical Essay," ''[http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/spring-2006/pay-attention.html Don't Pay Any Attention to Him, He's 90% Water: The Cartooning Career of Boris Drucker]'', New York: Joseph I. Lubin House of Syracuse University, 2006, pp. 9-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker earned her B.F.A. from the [[California College of Arts and Crafts]] in 1973 and her Ph.D. from the [[University of California Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] in 1986. She was previously the Robertson Professor of Media Studies at the [[University of Virginia]], and has been on the faculties of [[State University of New York at Purchase|Purchase College, SUNY]], [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of Texas, Dallas]]. She has also been the Digital Humanities Fellow at the [[Stanford Humanities Center]], Digital Cultures Fellow at [[UC Santa Barbara]], and Mellon Faculty Fellow in Fine Arts at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{dead link|url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/files/drucker/drucker_cv.pdf|date=May 2017}} CV]&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==Research==
Drucker's research focuses on alphabet historiography, modeling interpretation for electronic scholarship, digital aesthetics, the history of visual information design, history of the book and print culture, history of information, and critical studies in visual knowledge representation. Most recently, her scholarship has focused on information visualization, "which draws heavily on models from the empirical sciences, where approaches based on representation and transparency prevail." In contrast to this approach, Drucker stresses the rhetorical and performative nature of visualization, with emphasis on interpretation. She contends that digital tools should be used to "design graphic forms that inscribe subjectivity and affective judgment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/members/drucker UCLA GSE&amp;IS faculty page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207223133/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/members/drucker |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===

====1990s====
In her first book, ''Theorizing Modernism: Visual Art and the Critical Tradition'' (1994), Drucker maps [[visual arts]] discourses through a rigorous examination of the rhetoric of 19th and 20th century critical writing and art practice. In the process, she theorizes the modernist tradition of visual art through a rhetoric of representation rather than from a formalist or historical approach, particularly regarding [[space]], the ontology of the object, and the production of [[subjectivity]]. In ''The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art'' (1994), Drucker contends that much art criticism of [[Futurism]], [[Dada]], and [[Cubism]] has failed to appreciate the fundamental materiality of these movements in relation to both visual and poetic forms of representation. Drucker emphasized, for the first time, the extent to which typographic activity furthered debates about the very nature and function of the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/essays/drucker.html "Book Review:  The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923" Modernism/Modernity 2.3 (1995) 173-175]&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing with her interest in letterform, Drucker's next book, ''The Alphabetic Labyrinth: The Letters in History and Imagination'' (1995) analyzes the history of the alphabet, not just as a collection of arbitrary signs, but as the direct visual embodiment of meaning in relation to intellectual movements. For example, she shows how modern typefaces, first developed in the late 18th century, embody Enlightenment philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500280683.mxs The Alphabetic Labyrinth: Books:Thames and Hudson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705162529/http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500280683.mxs |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting her focus to [[artist books]], ''Century of Artists' Books'' (1995) is the first full-length analysis of the development of artists' books as a 20th-century art form, exploring their structure, form, and conceptualization. Analyzing such artistic luminaries as [[William Morris]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Max Ernst]], Drucker considers the book as metaphor, poem, and narrative or non-narrative sequence by situating its historical, theoretical, sociological, and technical aspects within 20th century avant-garde art movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granarybooks.com/books/drucker2/drucker2.html Johanna Drucker "The Century of Artists' Books]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Figuring the Word: Essays on Books, Writing, and Visual Poetics'' (1998) is a collection of selected critical essays by Drucker previously published in literary and scholarly journals. The book begins with a discussion of her work as a [[book artist]] and an account of what led her to pursue her scholarly interests. She provides close readings of contemporary language artists and the use of language in cyberspace.

====2000s====
In collaboration with Brad Freeman, Drucker produced ''Nova Reperta'' (2000), inspired by illustrations by the sixteenth-century Flemish artist Johannes [[Stradanus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Tate|title=To Figure Out What Is Happening: An Interview with Johanna Drucker|journal=The Journal of Artists' Books|date=Spring 2007|volume=21|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on ''Nova Reperta'' was originally begun by Drucker and Freeman in 1993, who planned to include the work in the exhibition ''Science and the Artist's Book''&lt;ref group=notes&gt;''[http://www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Science-and-the-Artists-Book/ Science and the Artist's Book]''&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drucker|first=Johanna|author2=Brad Freeman|title=Nova Reperta: New Inventions and Discoveries|journal=The Journal of Artists' Books|date=Fall 1999|volume=12|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She collaborated again with Freeman on ''Emerging Sentience'' (2001), a work that reflects Drucker's interest in the literature of artificial intelligence and the development of digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Tate|title=To Figure Out What Is Happening: An Interview with Johanna Drucker|journal=The Journal of Artists' Books|date=Spring 2007|volume=21|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sweet Dreams: Contemporary Art and Complicity'' (2005), Drucker calls for a revamp of the academic critical vocabulary to something more befitting new forms and practices in [[contemporary art]], especially as it engages with material culture. Considered at the cutting edge of art criticism, ''Sweet Dreams'' details the clear departure of artists from modernist avant-garde movements and shows the ways in which art criticism can shift its terms and sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/165043.html Sweet Dreams by Johanna Drucker]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Graphic Design History: A Critical Guide'' (2008) is an edited volume that traces the social and cultural role of visual communication from prehistory to the present, from logos to posters, from the political to the commercial, from early writing to digital design. The book details the ways in which designers have historically shaped graphic forms and effects. Taking up evolving issues of methodology in the burgeoning field of [[digital humanities]], ''SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Speculative Computing'' (2009) emphasizes the visual over the written system, the generative over the descriptive, and aesthetic subjectivity over analytic objectivism by building on the collective intellectual ferment of digital humanities as it developed at the [[University of Virginia]], one of the universities where the field of digital humanities first developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=bio&amp;bookkey=353566 Johanna Drucker: SpecLab]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010s====
In ''Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production'' (2014), Drucker fuses digital humanities, media studies, and graphic design history to provide a descriptive critical language for the analysis of graphical knowledge and outline the principles by which visual formats organize meaningful content, particularly the [[graphical user interface]].

==Artistic activity==
Drucker is internationally renowned for her book art, which touches on a variety of themes, especially "the exploration of the conventions of narrative prose and the devices by which it orders, sequences, and manipulates events according to its own logic" as well as "the use of experimental typography to expand the possibilities of prose beyond the linear format of traditional presentation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/drucker/chron.html A Chronology of Books from 1970 to 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work has been exhibited at universities, libraries, galleries, and museums throughout the world, including [[Museum of Arts and Design]], [[Cooper-Hewitt Museum]], [[National Museum of Women in the Arts]], [[New York Public Library]], [[Scripps College]], [[Walter Phillips Gallery]], [[University of Virginia]], [[Smith College]], [[Yale University]], [[Rutgers University]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], [[Purdue University]], [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Wisconsin]], [[Houston Public Library]], [[San Francisco Center for the Book]], [[SUNY]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Pomona College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], [[Art Institute of Chicago]], [[California College of Arts and Crafts]], [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)]], Istvan Kiraly Museum in [[Budapest]], [[Barnard College]], and [[Parsons School of Design]].

'''Juana María Rodríguez''' is a professor of Ethnic Studies, Gender and Women's Studies, and Performance Studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Her scholarly writing in [[queer theory]], [[critical race theory]], and [[performance studies]] highlights the intersection of race, gender, sexuality and embodiment in constructing subjectivity.

== Biography ==
Born Juana María de la Caridad Rodríguez y Hernández in [[Placetas|Placetas, Cuba]], Rodríguez emigrated to the United States in 1963 with her family.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces''. New York: NYU Press, 2003, p. 126.
&lt;/ref&gt; She has two siblings: and her sister [[Dinorah de Jesús Rodriguez|Dinorah de Jesús Rodríguez]],an experimental filmmaker and visual artist who works between Havana and Miami, and her brother René. Rodríguez identifies as queer and bisexual, and has published work about what she terms "bisexual erasure."&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Juana María. "Queer Politics, Bisexual Erasure: Sexuality at the Nexus of Race, Gender, and Statistics." ''Lambda Nordica'' 1-2 (2016): 169–182. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and career ===
Describing herself as an "accidental academic" in reference to her working class upbringing, Rodríguez attended [[City College of San Francisco]] before graduating with a Bachelor's degree from [[San Francisco State University]] in Liberal Studies. Her graduate degrees include a Masters in English and Comparative Literature from [[Columbia University]], and a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she studied with [[Norma Alarcón]], [[Judith Butler]], VèVè A. Clark, and [[Gerald Vizenor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crg.berkeley.edu/content/faculty-profile-associate-professor-juana-mar%C3%AD-rodr%C3%ADguez-gender-womens-studies|title=FACULTY SPOTLIGHT: Associate Professor Juana María Rodríguez, Gender &amp; Women's Studies|last=CRG Editor|first=|date=Fall 2009|website=Faultlines|publisher=Center for Race and Gender|access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining the faculty at Berkeley, Rodríguez was an Assistant Professor of English at [[Bryn Mawr College]], and an Associate Professor of Women and Gender Studies at the [[University of California, Davis]] where she served as Director of the Cultural Studies Graduate Group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heymiyuki.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/beyond-the-ivory-tower-interviews-with-academics-1-with-juana-maria-rodriguez/|title=Beyond the Ivory Tower: Interviews with Academics #1 with Juana María Rodríguez|last=Baker|first=Miyuki|date=November 30, 2015|website=|publisher=Word Press|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Berkeley, she is affiliated with the Center for Race and Gender, the Center for New Media, the Center for the Study of Sexual Culture and the [[Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society|Haas Institute for a Fair and Equitable Society]], where she was a founding member of the LGBTQ Citizen Cluster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, she was appointed to the [[University of California]] President's Advisory Committee on LGBT Students, Staff, and Faculty Member by [[Janet Napolitano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/lgbt-advisory-group-advances-recommendations-make-campuses-more-inclusive|title=LGBT advisory group advances recommendations to make campuses more inclusive|last=|first=|date=September 29, 2014|website=University of California|publisher=|access-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic contributions ==
The author of two books, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) and ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU 2014), Rodríguez has also published essays in ''[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|GLQ: a Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]]; Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory; [[Radical History Review]]; PMLA; [[MELUS]]; Profession'' and others''.'' Rodríguez's work is considered part of queer of color critique, an intervention into [[queer theory]] that argues that sexuality can not be understood or analyzed outside of the ways it is mutually constituted by race and other dimensions of difference.

=== ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ===
Rodríguez's first book, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) introduced the idea of queer ''[[latinidad]]'' as a way to disarticulate the ways that history, geography, colonialism, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, legal status, immigration status, class, color, and the politics of location exist to complicate facile notions of Latino identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In that book, Rodríguez identifies three case studies that involve different understandings of ethnic and sexual identity: activism through the queer Latino/a HIV prevention agency [[Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida]]; law through the [[Asylum in the United States|asylum]] case of Marcelo Tenorio, a gay Brazilian who was granted political asylum in the United States based on sexual persecution; and cyberspace by examining the internet chatrooms of the [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] (Internet Relay Chat) an early form of digital connectivity.

==== Queering Spanish language ====
In her chapter on the IRC, "'Welcome to the Global Stage': Confessions of a Latina Cyber-Slut" in ''Queer Latinidad'', Rodríguez documents the use of the "@" or arroba in words like Latin@, amig@s, or nostr@s seen in the Spanish language digital spaces she studied, as a "creative linguistic intervention in the highly gendered structure of Spanish." She writes, "Unlike the slash in words such as Latinos/as or amigas/os, which maintains a gender binary while attempting to be inclusive, the @ or "at sign," literally marks where an individual is at in terms of gender."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has also discussed the use of the "x" in terms such as Latinx and other approaches to the ungendering or queering of Spanish, although she also argues that gender can also be a site of pleasure and affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Sarah Hayley, and Oscar NÑ. "Latinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language." ''Latino USA''. N.p., 29 Jan. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' ===
Rodriguez's second book ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU Press 2014) looks at queer kinship practices, [[sodomy law]]s in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Latin dance]] styles, [[Television advertisement|commercials]], [[pornography]], [[burlesque]], [[San Francisco Pride|queer pride]] marches, alongside sexual practices such as [[BDSM]], [[polyamory]], daddy-play, and [[Butch and femme|butch-femme]] role playing to examine the relationship between sexual politics and sexual practices. In the book and elsewhere, she highlights how the [[Respectability politics|politics of respectability]] that surround sexuality inhibit the potential for more radical interventions into public policy and law around sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Sara. "Faculty Profile: Juana María Rodríguez on Sexuality in Public Discourse | Haas Institute." ''Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society''. N.p., 21 Mar. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, she uses the idea of [[gesture]] to emphasize non-verbal ways of communicating gendered and ethnic identity, and as a metaphor to think about activist practices that are partial, in-process and incomplete. The book features queer performance artist [[Xandra Ibarra]], and explores the taboo subject of racialized sexual violence.

==== Sexual practices ====
Rodríguez's work is often specifically praised for the ways in which it deals explicitly with queer sexual practices and forms of gender expression such as butch and femme.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dorrance, Jess. "Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings." ''Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory'' 0.0 (2016): 1–3. ''Taylor and Francis+NEJM''. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016"&gt;Dominguez, Pier. "The Potentiality of the Latina Femme Gesture." ''GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies'' 22.1 (2016): 143–145. ''glq.dukejournals.org''. Web. 10 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Tim. "No Sex Please, We're American." ''American Literary History'' (2015): ajv030. ''alh.oxfordjournals.org''. Web. 17 June 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; She frequently uses her own sexual experiences, or what she terms "sexual archives" to illuminate her ideas on racialized abjection, feminine subjection, sexual vulnerability, and femme identity. In her writing, she often references the sensory, particularly touch, as a way to articulate an embodied sexual practice and a writing practice rooted in sociality.&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dahl, Ulrika. "The Latina Femme Promise of Vulnerability and Access." ''Lambda Nordica'' 1-2 (2016): 191–196.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrido, Anahi Russo. "Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings by Juana María Rodríguez." ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'' 42.1 (2016): 296–297. ''journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)''. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; In reviews of her work, reviewers frequently remark on her lyrical use of language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Other accomplishments ==

=== Awards ===
In 2015, her book, ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' won the Alan Bray Memorial Book Prize, by the GL/Q Caucus of the [[Modern Language Association]] and was a [[27th Lambda Literary Awards|Lambda Literary Foundation Finalist for LGBT Studies]].

At the University of California, Berkeley, she has won the Social Science Division, Distinguished Teaching Award and the Graduate Assembly's Faculty Mentor Award.

=== Professional affiliations ===
A member of the [[American Studies Association]], the [[Modern Language Association]], and the [[National Women's Studies Association]], she was chair of the [[Modern Language Association]]'s Committee on the Status of Literatures of People of Color in the United States and edited a collection of essays entitled the "Affirmative Activism Project"&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Juana María. "The Affirmative Activism Project." ''Profession'' (2007): 156–167. 
&lt;/ref&gt; on diversity in higher education. She was also elected to the National Council of the [[American Studies Association]] for a three-year term in 2013.

=== Public engagement ===
A frequent public speaker and writer, Rodríguez has also published articles on the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting|Orlando Pulse]] shooting,&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Juana María. "Voices: Gay Clubs Let Us Embrace Queer Latinidad, Let's Affirm This." ''NBC News''. N.p., 16 June 2016. Web. 19 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; diversity in Higher Education,&lt;ref&gt;McGowen, Sarah.

'''''Le Guide musical''''' (English: The Music Guide) was a weekly French-language Belgian and French classical music periodical founded 1 March 1855 in Brussels by Peter Bernhard Schott (1821–1873), of the Brussels music publishing house [[Schott frères]] (Schott brothers).&lt;ref name="Sandrine" /&gt;

==Editors and history==
[[Maurice Kufferath]] (1852–1919) was editor from 1887 to 1891.&lt;ref&gt;''The Music Reviews and Criticism in Wallonia and Brussels in the Nineteenth Century'', by Henri Albert Alexander Vanhulst (born 1943) (Brussels), ''Periodica Musica'' (in French), [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]]: [[University of Maryland]] (publisher), vol. IX (1991), pp. 15–19; {{ISSN|0822-7594}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, the editorial office relocated to Paris and began publishing from both Paris and Brussels. In 1892, Otto Junne, director of [[Schott frères]], sold the periodical to Kufferath, the editor. From 1894 to 1905, Hugues Imbert (1842–1905) became editor-in-chief, then Henri de Curzon (1861–1942). Kufferath preserved the publication's Franco-Belgium character. The publication ceased publication in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Guide musical|url=http://www.ripm.org/?page=JournalInfo&amp;ABB=GMU|publisher=ripm|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Order Paper''' is a daily publication in the [[Westminster system]] of government which lists the business of [[parliament]] for that day's sitting. A separate paper is issued daily for each house of the legislature.

The Order Paper provides [[Member of Parliament|members of the legislature]] with details of what will be happening in that house, including the questions that have been tabled for departmental question sessions and members who have been selected to speak. It also gives details of when and where the [[standing committees]] and [[select committee (Westminster system)|select committee]]s will be meeting, and the list of debates to be held. Written questions tabled to ministers by members of the legislature on the previous day are listed at the back of the order paper.

British parliamentarians often wave their Order Paper during debates in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
The Donner family has produced a number of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[judge]]s. Piet Hein Donner's father, [[André Donner]], was a judge at the [[European Court of Justice]] in 1958-1979 and was part of the government commission that looked into [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld]]'s dealing with the [[Lockheed Corporation]]. His grandfather was [[Jan Donner]], who served as Minister of Justice for the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] in the first cabinet of [[Dirk Jan de Geer]] and was later president of the Dutch [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands|Supreme Court]]. His uncle [[Jan Hein Donner]], however, was a [[Grandmaster (chess)|chess grandmaster]] and author. Piet Hein Donner studied [[Law]] at the [[Free University of Amsterdam]], obtaining a degree in 1974. During his study, he joined the student society L.A.N.X. in 1968.

===Politics===
In 2006, Piet Hein Donner recorded a [[Hip hop music|rap]] song together with Meester G to explain his point of view on the [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|Dutch soft-drug policy]]. It was a reply to a song by Gerd Leers, [[Mayor]] of [[Maastricht]], (with punk band [[Heideroosjes]]), which called for a more progressive policy which would not only regulate the selling of soft drugs, but also legalise their production.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nu.nl/news/682688/11/'Don'_Donner_rapt_de_dope_van_straat.html 'Don' Donner rapt de dope van straat], NU.nl, 25 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He responded by a clarification that he was not advocating such a scenario but warning against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://eurabia.blogse.nl/log/netherlands-minister-warns-islamic-law-could-happen-via-democracy.html Netherlands: Minister Warns Islamic Law Could Happen Via Democracy], Western Resistance, 13 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu philosophy]] including [[yoga]], [[Indian medicine]] and [[Indian martial arts]], '''prana''' ({{lang-sa2|[[wikt:प्राण|प्राण]]}}, {{IAST|prāṇa}}; the [[Sanskrit]] word for "[[Energy (esotericism)|life force]]" or "vital principle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/prana|title=Prana|date=|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2015-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed from ''pra'' meaning movement and ''an'' meaning constant&lt;ref&gt;Swami Satyananda Saraswati, Prana: The Universal Life Force. Bihar School of Yoga. 1981&lt;/ref&gt;) permeates reality on all levels including in in[[Life|animate]] objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61240413|title=Sacred journey : living purposefully and dying gracefully|last=1925-1996.|first=Rama, Swami,|date=2002|publisher=Himalayan Institute Hospital Trust|isbn=8188157007|location=India|oclc=61240413}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hindu literature, prana is sometimes described as originating from the [[Sun]] and connecting the [[Mahābhūta|elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogamag.net/archives/1982/emay82/prana582.shtml|title=Prana: the Universal Life Force|author=Swami Satyananda Saraswati|publisher=Bihar School of Yoga|website=Yoga Magazine|date=September 1981|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prana is invoked and described in the [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904290374|title=Vedic yoga : the path of the Rishi|last=David,|first=Frawley,|isbn=9780940676251|edition= First|location=Twin Lakes, Wisconsin|oclc=904290374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five types of prana, collectively known as the five ''[[vāyu]]s,'' are referred to in Hindu texts. [[Ayurveda]], [[tantra]] and [[Tibetan medicine]] all describe ''praṇā vāyu'' as the basic vāyu from which the other vāyus arise.

==Early references==
The ancient concept of prana is described in many Hindu texts, including Upanishads and Vedas. One of the earliest references to prana is from the 3,000-year-old ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'', but many other Upanishads use the concept, including the [[Katha Upanisad|Katha]], [[Mundaka Upanishad|Mundaka]] and [[Prasna Upanishad]]s. The concept is elaborated upon in great detail in the practices and literature of [[hatha yoga|haṭha yoga]],&lt;ref name="Mallinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallinson|first1=James|title=The Shiva Samhita: A Critical Edition and an English Translation|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hlQRnDOr178C}} |date=2007|publisher=YogaVidya.com|location=Woodstock, New York|isbn=0971646651|edition=  1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tantra]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} and [[Ayurveda]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Prana is typically divided into constituent parts, particularly when concerned with [[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)|the human body]]. While not all early sources agree on the names or number of these divisions, the most common list from the [[Mahabharata]], the Upanishads, Ayurvedic and [[Yoga|Yogic]] sources includes five classifications, often subdivided.&lt;ref name="Sivananda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sivananda|first1=Sri Swami|title=The Science of Pranayama|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=9OCLDgAAQBAJ}} |date=2008|publisher=BN Publishing|location=|isbn=9650060200}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} This list includes Prana (inward moving energy), [[Apāna|apana]] (outward moving energy), vyana (circulation of energy), [[udana]] (energy of the head and throat), and samana (digestion and assimilation).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Early mention of specific pranas often emphasized prāṇa, apāna and vyāna as "the three breaths". This can be seen in the proto-yogic traditions of the Vratyas among others.&lt;ref name="Eliade"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|last2=Trask|first2=Willard R.|last3=White|first3= David Gordon|title=Yoga: Immortality and Freedom|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=V07l6gThaV0C}}|date=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0691142033}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|104}} Texts like the Vaikānasasmārta utilized the five pranas as an internalization of the five sacrificial fires of a [[Panchagni Vidya|panchagni]] [[homa (ritual)|homa]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="Eliade" /&gt;{{rp|111–112}}

Atharva veda mentions about Prana. ‘When they had been watered by Prana, the plants spake in concert: 'thou hast, forsooth, prolonged our life, thou hast made us all fragrant.' (Chapter 11 verse 4 – 6)’. ‘The holy (âtharvana) plants, the magic (ângirasa) plants, the divine plants, and those produced by men, spring forth, when thou, O Prâna, quickenest them (Chapter 11, verse 4 – 16). ‘When Prâna has watered the great earth with rain, then the plants spring forth, and also every sort of herb (Chapter 11 verse 4 – 17). ‘O Prâna, be not turned away from me, thou shall not be other than myself! As the embryo of the waters (fire), thee, O Prâna, do bind to me, that I may live.’ (Chapter 11, verse 4).

==Vāyus==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
One way of categorizing prana is by means of vāyus. ''Vāyu'' means "wind" or "air" in Sanskrit, and the term is used in a variety of contexts in Hindu philosophy. Prāṇa is considered the basic vāyu from which the other vāyus arise. Hence prāṇā is the collective term for the vāyus of prāṇa, apāna, uḍāna, samāna, and vyāna.&lt;ref name="Feuerstein"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="Sivananda"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} The functions of the five vāyus are as follows:&lt;ref name="Feuerstein"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Saraswati|first1=Sri Swami Sivananda|last2=Warnick|first2=Lateef Terrell|title=Kundalini Yoga: The Shakti Path to Soul Awakening|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ieGmNAEACAAJ}} |date=2010|publisher=1 Soul Publishing|isbn=9781939199133|language=en }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

==Nadi==
{{Further|Nadi (yoga)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
[[Indian philosophy]] describes prana flowing in nadis (channels). The ''[[Shiva Samhita]]'' states that 350,000 nadis are found in the human body, while other texts mention 72,000 nadis, each branching off into another 72,000.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} These nadis play an important role in the application and understanding of certain [[yoga]] practices. ''Shiva Samhita'' explains that the three most important nadis are the Ida, the Pingala, and the Sushumna, each facilitating the flow of ''praṇā vāyu'' throughout [[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)|the body]].&lt;ref name="Mallinson"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

Ida nadi relates to the left side of the body, terminating at the left [[nostril]]. Pingala nadi relates to the right side of the body, terminating at the right nostril. Sushumna nadi connects the base [[chakra]] at the base of the spine to the crown chakra at the top of the head.

The practice of [[pranayama]] can be used to balance the flow of prana within the body. When ''praṇā vāyu'' enters a period of uplifted, intensified activity, the [[Yoga|yogic]] tradition refers to it as pranotthana, a precursor to the [[Kundalini]] state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Lawrence|title=Kundalini Rising: Exploring the Energy of Awakening|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ZBYyrvPjCuAC}}|date=2009|publisher=Sounds True, Inc.|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=1591798426}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

When the mind is agitated due to our interactions with the world at large, the physical body also follows in its wake. These agitations cause violent fluctuations in the flow of Prana in the Nadis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sridhar|first=MK|date=2015|title=The concept of Jnana, Vijnana and Prajnana according to Vedanta philosophyFNx01|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/2347-5633.161024|journal=International Journal of Yoga - Philosophy, Psychology and Parapsychology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.4103/2347-5633.161024|issn=2347-5633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pranayama ==
{{Main|Pranayama}}

The word ''Prāṇāyāma'' derives from the Sanskrit words ''prāṇa'' and ''ayāma'', translating as "life force" and "expansion", respectively. It is a common term for various techniques for accumulating, expanding and working with prana. Pranayama is one of the eight limbs of yoga and is a practice of specific and often intricate breath control techniques. The dynamics and laws of Prana were understood through systematic practice of Pranayama to gain mastery over Prana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pranayama, The art and science;|last=Nagendra|first=H R|publisher=Swami Vivekananda Yoga Prakashana.|year=1998|isbn=|location=Bangalore, India|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pranayama techniques are designed to cleanse the [[nadis]], allowing for greater movement of prana. Other techniques may be utilized to arrest the breath for [[samadhi]] or to bring awareness to specific areas in the practitioner's subtle or physical body. It can also be utilized to generate inner heat as in the practice of [[tummo]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In [[Ayurveda]] and therapeutic yoga, pranayama may be utilized for many tasks, including to affect mood and aid in digestion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} [[A.G. Mohan]] stated that the physical goals of pranayama may be to recover from illness or the maintenance of health, while its mental goals are: "to remove mental disturbances and make the mind focused for meditation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohan|first1=A.G.|last2=Mohan|first2=Indra|title=Yoga Therapy: A Guide to the Therapeutic Use of Yoga and Ayurveda for Health and Fitness|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=H8YMAAAACAAJ}}|date=2004|publisher=Shambhala Publications|location=Boston|isbn=1590301315|page=135|edition=  1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Georg Feuerstein]]: "The two most important species of the life force are obviously prâna and apâna, which underlie the breathing process. Their incessant activity is seen as the principal cause for the restlessness of the mind, and their stoppage is the main purpose of breath control (prânâyâma)".&lt;ref name="Feuerstein"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}} [[Swami Yogananda]] writes, "The real meaning of Pranayama, according to Patanjali, the founder of Yoga philosophy, is the gradual cessation of breathing, the discontinuance of inhalation and exhalation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yogananda|first1=Paramahansa|title=The Essence of Kriya Yoga|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dyDiAAAACAAJ}}|date=2005|publisher=Alight Publications|location=Union City, California|isbn=1931833184|edition=  1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Qanun''' is an Arabic word ({{lang-ar|قانون}}, ''qānūn''; {{lang-ota|قانون}}, ''kānūn'', derived from {{lang-grc|κανών}} ''kanōn'', which is also the root for the modern English word "[[canon law|canon]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kanw/n|κανών|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between God and the Sultan: A History of Islamic Law|author=Knut S.

It is thus frequently translated as "dynastic law". The idea of ''kanun'' first entered the Muslim World in the thirteenth century, as it was borrowed from the [[Mongol Empire]] in the aftermath of their invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burak |first=Guy |title=The Second Formation of Islamic Law: The Ḥanafī School in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-09027-9 |pages=17–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th sultan of the Ottoman Empire, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] was known in the Ottoman Empire as Suleiman Kanuni ("the Lawgiver"), due to his code of laws. 

After the fall of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 1258, a practice known to the [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Mongols]] transformed itself into qanun, which gave power to [[caliphate|caliphs]], [[governor]]s, and sultans alike to "make their own regulations for activities not addressed by the sharia."&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"&gt;Berg, Herbert. "Islamic Law." Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History 3 (2005): 1030. In History Reference Center[database online]. Available from Snowden Library . Retrieved February 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This became increasingly important as the Middle East started to modernize, thus running into the problems of a modern state, which were not covered by sharia. The Qanun began to unfold as early as Umar I (586–644 CE).&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt; Many of the regulations covered by qanun were based on financial matters or tax systems adapted through the law and regulations of those territories Islam conquered.&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt;

The term ḳānūn derives itself from the Greek word κανών. Originally having the less abstract meaning of “any straight rod” it then later referred to any “measure or rule” in Greek. The word was then translated into and adopted by the Arabic language after the Ottoman Empire’s conquest of Egypt under Sultan [[Selim I]] (ca. 1516). In the Ottoman empire, the term ḳānūn still carried the word’s original meanings of a system of tax regulation. However, it later came to also refer to “code of regulations” or “state law”, a well-defined secular distinction to “Muslim law” known as the s̲h̲arīʿa. The ḳānūn took on significant importance during the period of modernization in the Ottoman Empire. The ḳānūn and s̲h̲arīʿa did not contradict each other concerning administrative matters, and therefore the ḳānūn was assimilated easily into Ottoman regulatory functions. The ḳānūn promulgated by Ottoman sultans also came to be used for financial and penal law. Under Sultan Mehmed II (1451-1481) the ḳānūn continued to be strictly applied for these practices. However due to the influence of [[Ebussuud Efendi|Abu ʾl-Suʿūd]], [[Grand Mufti|grand muftī]] of Istanbul from 1545 to 1574 the ḳānūn was applied to deal with matters concerning property rights as well. Previously, property rights were exclusively under the jurisdiction of the s̲h̲arīʿa. Despite this seeming contradiction, due to skillful bureaucratic operations, the ḳānūn and the s̲h̲arīʿa existed harmoniously. The ḳānūn has retained its relevance in the Middle East regarding civil, commercial, administrative, and penal laws that were inspired by originally Western legislation. It also has an influence in the ways that provisions of the s̲h̲arīʿa are reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Linant de Bellefonds, Y., Cahen, Cl., İnalcık, Halil, and Ed. “Ḳānūn”.

{{TOC right}}

==Definition==
A regional park can be a special park district covering a region crossing several jurisdiction boundaries, or a park system of a single jurisdiction, such as a province, county, or city.

==By country==

===Canada===

====Saskatchewan====
There are 101 regional parks in Saskatchewan. All parks are operated by volunteer boards.

===Italy===
{{See also|List of regional parks of Italy}}
Regional parks in Italy are administered by each [[Regions of Italy|region in Italy]], a government unit like a U.S. state.

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Regional parks of New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], regional parks are administered by [[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] rather than the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] or [[territorial authority|territorial authorities]].

===United States===

====Definitions====
In the United States, a regional park is sometimes referred to as a 'Metropolitan Park (Metropark)' or as an [[open space reserve]]. The terms ''region'' and ''metropolitan'' can have different meanings in U.S. local government agencies. Regional parks can be administered by a regional park board, a [[U.S. state|state]], [[county#United States|county]] or other units of [[local government]]. A special authority can be set up, under the joint jurisdiction of two or more government bodies or as an independent park district to administer parks. Individual parks may or may not cross governmental boundaries. The park district holds the authority, similar to fire protection districts, to manage and raise taxes to cover park acquisition and management costs.

====Midwest====
{{See also|List of county and regional parks in Minnesota}}
In Ohio, under [[Ohio Revised Code]] Chapter 1545, metro parks such as the [[Metro Parks (Columbus, Ohio)|Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks]] can have their own [[police officer|sworn police forces]] ([[park ranger|rangers]]); The [[Cleveland Metroparks]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] [[Five Rivers Metroparks]] are also in the state. Other examples of large regional park systems are the [[Huron-Clinton Metroparks]] in southeast [[Michigan]]; and the [[Three Rivers Park District]] in [[Minnesota]].

====California====
{{See also|Category:Regional parks in California}}
The [[East Bay Regional Park District]] and [[Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District]] have extensive parklands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], protecting habitat and offering recreation.

===United Kingdom===
====Scotland====
In [[Scotland]], regional parks are defined to co-ordinate the management of areas of attractive countryside that are of importance for recreation due to their proximity to population centres. The parks have been defined and are managed by [[subdivisions of Scotland|local authorities]].  Currently Scotland has three regional parks:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/safeguarding-protected-areas-and-species/protected-areas/local-designations/regional-parks|title=Regional parks|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4630">'''Robert Deutsch''' is an Israeli antiquities dealer, known for being accused and acquitted of only one forgery charge - out of six while the other charges were dropped due to being obsolete - of several biblical archaeological artifacts. 
==Trial, acquittal and subsequent lawsuit ==   
In 2004, Deutsch, [[Oded Golan]] and two others were indicted in a Jerusalem court on charges of forgery. The [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] (IAA) claimed that the four were part of a forgery ring that had been operating for more than 20 years, misleading collectors of biblical artifacts into purchasing modern day forgeries. 
In 2012, Deutsch was acquitted of all charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/outside-edge/.premium-1.591953|title='Jehoash Tablet' Returns to Owner

Following his acquittal, Dr. Robert Deutsch sued the IAA, its director Shuka Dorfman, the head of the IAA's anti-theft unit Amir Ganor, the Jerusalem District Attorney and Assistant district Attorney. Demanding $3 million in damages, the suit alleged gross negligence by the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Fox news]]|url=http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/12/03/antiques-dealer-sues-israeli-government-for-3-million-after-acquitted-forgery.html|title=Antiques dealer sues Israel for $3 million after being acquitted of forgery charges|date=December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State of Israel - Against - 1. Oded Golan, 2. Robert Deutsch, 3. Rafael Braun - deleted, 4. Shlomo Cohen - deleted, 5. Fayez al-Amla - his case is over

In the Jerusalem District Court
[17.03.2008]
Honorable Justice Aharon Farkash&lt;ref&gt;

...........


The request of the Defendant 2, Robert Deutsch (hereinafter: "the Defendant" or "Deutsch") to cancel the indictment against him, in whole or in part, on the grounds of "defense of justice".


...........

The bottom line is that I did not find grounds for the cancellation of the charges against the defendant, but I found it appropriate to state that there was no room for the harsh and harsh words that were claimed in the application against the investigators on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority or against the plaintiff, or against the State barrister Dan Bahat. Each of them fulfills his or her duties, to the best of his ability and in good faith, when he is under the supervision of his superiors. Even if the Defendant's counsel believes that there was no basis for filing an indictment against his client, it would not have been appropriate to use such harsh words and to relate to the Plaintiff and the Investigator some malicious intentions, as stated above, without any basis being laid to prove them.

...........

This being said the defendant's request to cancel the indictment against him, in whole or in part, is rejected.

_____________________________________________________

Robert Deutsch holds 99% of the stock shares of “Archaeological Center Ltd.” having registered headquarters at 26 Eliezer Kaplan, Herzlia, Israel. Deutsch is also the CEO of the Center.

During the years, both Deutsch and the Center avoided heavy tax payments while illegally claiming that the Center legitimately paid the expenses incurred during Deutsch trial in which he was charged with six criminal offenses.

The tax avoiding payment issue reached the court in several cases and appeals initiated by Deutsch started with the District Court and ended with the Supreme Court. In all these cases Deutsch and the Center actions and claims were turned down by the court while both Deutsch and/or the Center were ordered by the court to pay the significant amounts to the State as "legal expenditures" - these in addition to the taxation debts.

The '''Faculty of Chemistry (since 2014 The Institute of Chemistry)  ''' at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] is one of the leading chemistry faculties in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Donetskaya|first1= S.S.|year= 2007|title= The scientific capabilities of chemistry faculty members in Russian universities.|journal= Eko (Russian: Эко)|issue= 4|pages= 131–143|url= http://www.sibupk.nsk.su/New/05/publicat/smk_3.pdf|accessdate= 2010-01-18|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120302160600/http://www.sibupk.nsk.su/New/05/publicat/smk_3.pdf|archivedate= 2012-03-02|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Formally, the Department of Chemistry has been created as a separate entity of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg State University (then Leningrad State University)]] in 1929. However, the history of chemistry at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] began much earlier. First chemistry laboratory and lectures in chemistry were introduced at the University in 1833. One of the first professors of chemistry was Alexander Voskresensky, a doctoral student of [[Justus von Liebig]]. Voskresensky largely contributed to the growth of chemistry classes at the University. He initiated lectures in organic chemistry (1843) and promoted first scientific projects. Later, in 1868, the chemistry division hosted then by the Department of Physics and Mathematics was split into three to form the division of organic chemistry led by [[Aleksandr Butlerov]], the division of inorganic chemistry led by [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] and the division of analytical chemistry led by [[Nikolai Menshutkin]]. Since then, [[Saint Petersburg State University|the University of Saint-Petersburg]] became home to one of the most elite chemistry schools in the country. Many prominent Russian chemists began their career and/or worked there. Among them are [[Nikolay Zinin]], [[Alexey Favorsky]], [[Lev Aleksandrovich Chugaev]], Dmitry Konovalov, [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev]], [[Tishchenko reaction|Vyacheslav Tishchenko]], [[Vladimir Ipatieff]], [[Nikolay Semyonov]], [[Boris Nikolsky]], [[Mikhail Shultz]].

In the Soviet era, the Department of Chemistry continued to grow with new divisions: colloid chemistry (1939), electrochemistry (1940), chemistry of macromolecular compounds (1944), radiochemistry (1945), physical organic chemistry (1946), theory of solutions (1950), chemistry of natural compounds (1963), quantum chemistry (1967), solid state chemistry (1978).

==Campuses==
Historically, some of the first chemistry offices were located in the main building of [[Saint Petersburg State University]] called [[Twelve Collegia]]. The remainder of these is the [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] museum located on the first floor of the central part of this enormous building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Trimble|first1= R.F.|year= 1981|title= Mendeleev's Discovery of the Periodic Law|journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 58|issue= 1|pages= 28|doi= 10.1021/ed058p28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Krotikov|first1= V.A.|year= 1960|title= The Mendeleev Archives and Museum of the Leningrad University|journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 37|issue= 12|pages= 625–628|doi= 10.1021/ed037p625}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, the Department of Chemistry was headquartered at 41/43 Sredniy prospekt on [[Vasilievsky Island]], about one mile west of [[Twelve Collegia]]. In the 1980s, most of the laboratories were relocated to a more spacious building in the newly constructed campus in the suburb of [[petergof|Peterhof]].

==Divisions==
Currently, there are 14 scientific divisions in the chemistry department:

SIDE explains the effects of anonymity and identifiability on group behavior. It has become one of several [[theories of technology]] that describe social effects of [[computer-mediated communication]].

The SIDE model provides an alternative explanation for effects of anonymity and other "deindividuating" factors that classic [[deindividuation]] theory&lt;ref name="Diener"&gt;Diener, E. (1980).

The model suggests that anonymity changes the relative salience of personal vs. [[social identity]], and thereby can have a profound effect on group behavior. 

The [[Social identity theory|social identity]] model of deindividuation effects (or SIDE model) is a theory developed in [[social psychology]] and communication studies. SIDE explains the effects of [[anonymity]] and identifiability on group behavior. It has become one of several theories examining technology that describe social effects of [[Computer-mediated communication|computer-mediated]] communication. With advancing technology it is becoming increasingly researched what the effects of having the control of being incognito on the web, and also having profiles that represent ones person is doing to relationships and communication in our lives. The SIDE model provides an alternative explanation for effects of [[anonymity]] and other "deindividuating" factors that classic deindividuation theory cannot adequately explain. To understand the model of deindividuation, it is described by scholarly articles as "the situation in which individuals act in groups and do not see themselves as individuals, thereby facilitating antinormative behavior"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Kyung Kyu|last2=Lee|first2=Ae Ri|last3=Lee|first3=Un-Kon|date=July 2018|title=Impact of anonymity on roles of personal and group identities in online communities|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378720618302490|journal=Information &amp; Management|doi=10.1016/j.im.2018.07.005|issn=0378-7206}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

== Background ==

SIDE developed as a critique of deindividuation theory. Deindividuation theory was developed to explain the phenomenon that in crowds, people become capable of acts that rational individuals would not normally endorse (see also [[Crowd psychology]]). In the crowd, so it would seem, humans become disinhibited and behave anti-normatively. Early versions of deindividuation theory&lt;ref name="Zimbardo" /&gt; saw this as a consequence of reduced self-awareness and accountability. Diener&lt;ref name="Diener" /&gt; and others later focused more exclusively on loss of self as the core psychological process underlying deindividuation.

Reicher&lt;ref name="Reicher1982"&gt;Reicher, S.D. (1982)  The determination of collective behaviour.  In Tajfel (Ed.) Social Identity and Intergroup Relations  Cambridge, CUP, and Paris, Maison des Sciences de l'Homme.&lt;/ref&gt; criticized deindividuation theory for several reasons. Among others, historical evidence and case studies strongly suggested that the psychological process proposed by deindividuation theory (a loss of self) did not occur in the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;McPhail, C. (1991). ''The myth of the madding crowd.'' New York: de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] of empirical deindividuation research confirmed there was no consistent empirical evidence for the processes it proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., &amp; Spears, R. (1998). Deindividuation and anti-normative behavior: A meta-analysis. ''Psychological Bulletin, 123'', 238–259.&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary: anonymity and reduced self-awareness enhanced sensitivity to local norms. SIDE researchers concluded that there is no good empirical support for the process of deindividuation, and factors that should produce deindividuation have highly variable effects on behavior.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP"&gt;Reicher, S., Spears, R., &amp; Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. European Review of Social Psychology, 6, 161–198.&lt;/ref&gt; To account for this, SIDE proposes that there are no blanket indiscriminate effects of anonymity, but that anonymity effects are influenced by, and can only be understood through, their interaction with the social context.

Reicher&lt;ref name="Reicher1982" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reicher, S. (1987). Crowd behaviour as social action. In J. C. Turner, M. A. Hogg, P. J. Oakes, S. Reicher &amp; M. S. Wetherell (Eds.), ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;171–202). Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; also challenged the conceptualization of deindividuation as a loss of self. This process assumes that individuals have a unitary self-concept that they can be more or less aware of.  Reicher and others argued that individuals do not have a unitary sense of self. [[Social identity theory]], for instance, points out that one's sense of self is made up of personal identity and multiple social identities, all of which combine to shape one's personality.  Social identities are likely to become the basis for self-definition when that social identity is salient, such as when making comparisons between "them" and "us".  One consequence of salience is "depersonalization". Note that in research on social identity, depersonalization is not the same as deindividuation or a loss of self (cf. the entry on [[Depersonalization]] to read up on what it is not).  In social identity research, the term depersonalization refers to a switch to a group level of self-categorization in which self and others are seen in terms of their group identities.

According to [[self-categorization theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., &amp; Wetherell, M. S. (1987). ''Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory.'' Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; depersonalization makes perceptions of the outgroup more stereotypical.  Self-perceptions also shift: self and other ingroup members become interchangeable, and the individual self-stereotypes in terms of group attributes. Depersonalization thus transforms individuals into group members who regulate their behavior according to in-group norms. Importantly, and in contrast to deindividuation, the psychological state of depersonalization does not imply a loss of rationality or behavioural disinhibition; rather, the individual behaves rationally and regulates behaviour according to ingroup standards.  These ideas from social identity theory and self-categorization theory provided not only key ingredients for Reicher's critique of deindividuation theory, they are also the foundations upon which SIDE was modelled.

== Development ==

The model was first named by Lea and Spears&lt;ref name="LeaSpears1991"&gt;Lea, M., &amp; Spears, R. (1991). Computer-mediated communication, de-individuation and group decision-making. ''International Journal of Man Machine Studies, 34'', 283–301.&lt;/ref&gt; and later developed in a series of publications.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, M., &amp; Spears R. (1992). Paralanguage and social perception in computer-mediated communication. ''Journal of Organizational Computing'', ''2'', 321–341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PostmesSpearsLea1998"&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1998). Breaching or building social boundaries? SIDE-effects of computer-mediated communication. ''Communication Research'', ''25'', 689–715.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpearsLea1994"&gt;Spears, R., &amp; Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. ''Communication Research'', ''21,'' 427–459.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIDE model took Reicher's ideas about the crowd, and applied and extended them to [[computer-mediated communication]]. Early research in this domain suggested that, similar to deindividuation theory, users of online computer were prone to flaming and other disinhibitions due to a reduction in social cues.&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler, S., Siegel, J., &amp; McGuire, T. W. (1984). Social psychological aspects of computer-mediated communication. ''American Psychologist, 39,'' 1123–1134.&lt;/ref&gt; The SIDE model was developed, in first instance, to account for contradictory effects of social cues in online groups. SIDE thus assumed that effects in the crowd and in online environments showed some similar properties.

The first comprehensive statement of SIDE was by Reicher, Spears, &amp; Postmes.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP" /&gt; According to SIDE, a [[social identity approach]] can account for many of the effects observed in [[deindividuation]] research and in [[crowd psychology]], as well as in [[computer-mediated communication]].  For example, deindividuation has been found to foster group identification and to induce greater opinion polarization in small groups communicating online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Eun-Ju|title=Deindividuation Effects on Group Polarization in Computer-Mediated Communication: The Role of Group Identification, Public-Self-Awareness, and Perceived Argument Quality|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2007|volume=57|issue=2|page=385|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2007.00348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to understand effects of factors such as anonymity and reduced cues on group behavior, one needs to take the social and inter-group context into account.  SIDE argues that anonymity and social context in interaction have cognitive and strategic consequences.

== Cognitive SIDE ==

Group immersion and anonymity have cognitive consequences that affect the relative salience of personal and social identities.  These factors do not produce a loss of self as proposed by [[deindividuation]] theory.  Rather, anonymity and immersion in the group can enhance the [[salience (neuroscience)|salience]] of social identity and thereby depersonalize social perceptions of others and the self.  SIDE argues this occurs principally because (visual) anonymity obscures individual features and interpersonal differences.  As a result of the decreased visibility of the individual within anonymous groups, the process of depersonalization is accentuated, and cognitive efforts to perceive the group as an entity are amplified.  Provided that there is some basis to perceive self and others as members of one group, anonymity therefore enhances the salience of the shared [[social identity]].  The net result is that people will tend to perceive self and others in terms of stereotypic group features, and are influenced accordingly.&lt;ref name="PostmesSpearsLea1998" /&gt;

It is important to note that anonymity does not automatically or mechanically influence the salience of social identities.  An individual can be identified in such a way that it promotes a more individuated person-perception or alternatively that it promotes a stronger social categorization. In a few instances, making the individual more identifiable may strengthen social categorization. This may happen particularly in contexts within which these social categories are potentially meaningful and therefore accessible, and when group memberships are visually clearly identifiable (as is the case for gender, certain racial characteristics, disabilities, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Spears, R., Postmes, T., Lea, M., &amp; Wolbert, A. (2002). The power of influence and the influence of power in virtual groups: A SIDE look at CMC and the Internet. ''The Journal of Social Issues, 58,'' 91–108.&lt;/ref&gt;).

SIDE thus describes the cognitive process by which the salience of social identity is affected by the absence or presence of individuating information.  It is important to note that this process can only operate to the extent that some sense of groupness exists from the outset.  If individuals interact anonymously in the absence of any specific social identity or group boundaries, anonymity would have the reverse effect of accentuating one’s isolation from the group or by further obscuring group boundaries.&lt;ref name="LeaSpears1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postmes, T., Spears, R., Sakhel, K., &amp; De Groot, D. (2001). Social influence in computer-mediated communication: The effects of anonymity on group behavior. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', ''27,'' 1242–1254.&lt;/ref&gt;  Juxtaposing the two possibilities, anonymity in the group either has the effect of amplifying a shared social identity that, however rudimentary, is already in place, or it can amplify the individual independence which exists in contexts in which no shared identity is available.  The latter process, whereby anonymity provides the opportunities for people to express and develop identities independent of the social influence of the group, is further elaborated in the Strategic SIDE.

== Strategic SIDE ==

Anonymity also has strategic consequences: it affects the ability to express personal and social identities.&lt;ref name="SpearsLea1994" /&gt; Strategic concerns come into play when an out-group has more power than the ingroup, and where the norms of both groups are at odds with each other.  In such cases, the identifiability of ingroup members towards the outgroup will shift the power balance between groups: identifiability towards a more powerful outgroup limits the degree to which the ingroup's identity can be expressed freely and without sanction on those dimensions where ingroup norms conflict with out-group standards and values, and which are punishable or otherwise sanctionable. Conversely, anonymity towards a more powerful outgroup may be a convenient instrument for the ingroup to express itself on those same dimensions.

The strategic SIDE thus proposes that anonymity may be "used" by less powerful groups to express aspects of their identity. This may appear to be similar to the effects that anonymity has for [[accountability]] in classic [[deindividuation]] theory. However, unlike deindividuation theory, SIDE takes account of the inter-group context within which identifiability and anonymity occur.  By implication, a loss of accountability does not result in the disinhibited or random anti-normative behaviour of individuals that deindividuation theory is concerned with.  Rather, according to SIDE, anonymity affects the ability for a group to express its identity, and thus to engage in targeted and ingroup normative behaviour, thereby changing power relations between groups.  The close connection between identity expression and power proposed by SIDE may explain the patterned and targeted behaviour of crowds whose violent actions (if they occur) are very often symbolic, not random.&lt;ref name="SIMoDP" /&gt;

In addition to anonymity between groups, SIDE also considers strategic effects of anonymity within groups. Here, SIDE has particularly explored the consequences of anonymity (as well as isolation) from other ingroup members: On the one hand this deprives individual group members of social support from their fellows, and this may hinder their ability to express their ingroup identity in the face of a powerful and unsympathetic outgroup. On the other hand, the knowledge that other ingroup members are unable to identify the self may have consequences for (in particular) low identifiers to feel less committed to ingroup norms.

==Applications==

'''Spatial justice''' links together [[social justice]] and space, most notably in the works of geographers [[David Harvey]] and [[Edward W. Soja]]. The organization of space is a crucial dimension of human societies and reflects social facts and influences social relations ([[Henri Lefebvre]], 1968, 1972). Consequently, both [[justice]] and injustice become visible in space. Therefore, the analysis of the interactions between space and society is necessary to understand social injustices and to formulate territorial policies aiming at tackling them. It is at this junction that the concept of spatial justice has been developed.

== Social justice ==

According to this political theory, space being a fundamental dimension of human societies, [[social justice]] is embedded in it. So the understanding of interactions between space and societies is essential to the understanding of social injustices and to a reflection on planning policies that aims at reducing them. This reflection can be guided by the concept of spatial justice, which ties Social Justice with space.
Spatial justice is a crucial challenge because it is the ultimate goal of many planning policies. However, the diversity of definitions of "[[Justice]]" (and of the possible "[[social contract]]s" that legitimate them), is high and the political objectives of [[regional planning]] or [[urban planning]] can be quite different and even contradictory.

Therefore, it is important to analyze the concept of spatial justice, which is still rarely questioned (particularly since the work of Anglo-American [[critical geography|radical geographers]] in the 1970s–1980s&lt;ref&gt;See [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], ''Social Justice and the City'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;) to the extent that it has been taken for granted. These past few years, several events and publications have demonstrated the rising interest of human and social sciences for the concept of spatial justice.&lt;ref&gt;A conference investigating the concept of spatial justice was held in March 2008 at the University Paris-Ouest Nanterre, France. Moreover, ''justice spatiale - spatial justice'', a scientific Journal centered on Spatial Justice has been created in 2009: http://jssj.org/. A book focused on Spatial Justice has also been written by [[Edward W. Soja]] in 2010 : 
SOJA Edward W., 2010, ''Seeking Spatial Justice'', Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Between issues of redistribution and decision-making processes ==
The concept of spatial justice opens up several perspectives for social sciences. Building on the work of several famous Justice philosophers ([[John Rawls]], 1971; [[Iris Marion Young]], 1990, 2000), two contrasting approaches of justice have polarized the debate: one focuses on redistribution issues, the other concentrates on decision-making processes. 
A first set of approaches consists in asking questions about spatial or socio-spatial distributions and working to achieve an equal geographical distribution of society's wants and needs, such as [[Employment|job opportunities]], [[Health disparities|access to health care]], [[Air Quality Index|good air quality]], et cetera.  This is of particular concern in regions where the population has difficulty moving to a more spatially just location due to poverty, discrimination, or political restrictions (such as apartheid [[pass laws]]).  Even in free, developed nations, access to many places are limited.  Geographer [[Don Mitchell (geographer)|Don Mitchell]] points to the mass [[privatization]] of once-public land as a common example of spatial injustice. In this distributive justice perspective, the access to material and immaterial goods, or to social positions indicates whether the situation is fair or not. At the scale of urban space, questions of accessibility, walkability and transport equity can also be seen as matters of distribution of spatial resources.

Another way of tackling the concept of spatial justice is to focus on decision-making procedures: this approach also raises issues of representations of space, of territorial or other identities and of social practices. For instance, focusing on minorities allows to explore their spatial practices but also to investigate how these are experienced and managed by various agents: this may lead to reveal forms of [[oppression]] or [[discrimination]] that a universalist approach might disregard otherwise.
In sum, depending on the chosen approach, either questions are asked about spatial distributions because justice is evaluated from "results", or questions are asked about space representations, (spatial or not) identities and experiences because justice is defined as a process. Spatial justice stands as a unifying concept for the social sciences: its coherence stems from a reflection on the modalities of the political decision-making and on the policies implemented in order to improve spatial distributions.

== Environmental justice ==
The emergence of the concept of [[sustainable development]] has also fostered a debate on environmental equity. It questions our ontological relationship to the world, and the possibility of a fair policy addressing the needs of mankind, present and future, local and global, and of new forms of governance. The notion of "Environmental Justice" was created in the 1970s–1980s in North American cities to denounce the spatial overlapping between forms of [[racial discrimination]] and social-economic exclusion, industrial pollutions and vulnerability to natural hazards.

'''Tap water''' (''running water'', ''city water'', ''town water'', ''municipal water'', etc.) is [[water]] supplied to a [[tap (valve)]]. Its uses include drinking, washing, cooking, and the flushing of [[toilet]]s. Indoor tap water is distributed through "indoor [[plumbing]]", which has existed since antiquity but was available to very few people until the second half of the 19th century when it began to spread in popularity in what are now [[developed country|developed countries]]. Tap water became common in many regions during the 20th century, and is now lacking mainly among people in poverty, especially in [[developing country|developing countries]].

Tap water is often culturally assumed to be [[drinking water]], especially in developed countries. Usually it is potable, although [[water quality]] problems are not rare. Household [[water purification]] methods such as [[water filter]]s, [[boiling]], or [[distillation]] can be used when tap water's potability is doubted. The application of technologies (such as [[water treatment]] plants) involved in providing clean water to homes, businesses, and public buildings is a major subfield of [[sanitary engineering]]. Calling a water supply "tap water" distinguishes it from the other main types of fresh water which may be available; these include water from rainwater-collecting [[cistern]]s, water from [[village pump]]s or town pumps, water from [[Water well|well]]s, or water carried from streams, rivers, or lakes (whose potability may vary).

==Background==
Publicly available treated water has historically been associated with major increases in life expectancy and improved [[public health]].  [[Water-borne diseases]] are vastly reduced by proper sewage and fresh water availability. Providing tap water to large urban or suburban populations requires a complex and carefully designed system of collection, storage, [[water purification|treatment]] and distribution, and is commonly the responsibility of a government agency, often the same agency responsible for the removal and treatment of [[clean water]].

Specific [[compound (chemistry)|chemical compounds]] are often taken out of tap water during the treatment process to adjust the [[pH]] or remove contaminants, and [[chlorine]] may be added to kill [[biotoxin|biological toxins]]. Local geological conditions affecting [[groundwater]] are determining factors for the presence of various metal [[ion]]s, often rendering the water "[[soft water|soft]]" or "[[hard water|hard]]".

Tap water remains susceptible to biological or chemical contamination. In the event of contamination deemed dangerous to public health, government officials typically issue an advisory regarding water consumption. In the case of [[biological contamination]], residents are usually advised to boil their water before consumption or to use bottled water as an alternative. In the case of chemical contamination, residents may be advised to refrain from consuming tap water entirely until the matter is resolved.

In many areas a [[compound (chemistry)|compound]] of [[fluoride]] is added to tap water in an effort to improve [[dental health]] among the public. In some communities "[[Water fluoridation|fluoridation]]" remains a controversial issue. (See [[water fluoridation controversy]].)

==Potable water supply==
{{main|Potable water}}
This supply may come from several possible sources.
* [[Water purification|Municipal water supply]]
* [[Water well]]s
* Processed water from creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, rainwater, etc.

Domestic water systems have been evolving since people first located their homes near a running water supply, such as a stream or river.  The water flow also allowed sending waste water away from the residences.

Modern indoor plumbing delivers clean, safe, potable water to each service point in the distribution system.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  It is important that the clean water not be contaminated by the waste water (disposal) side of the process system.  Historically, this contamination of drinking water has been the largest killer of humans.&lt;ref&gt;''Plumbing: the Arteries of Civilization'', Modern Marvels video series, The History Channel, AAE-42223, A&amp;E Television, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Tap water can sometimes appear cloudy, often mistaken for mineral impurities in the water. It is usually caused by air bubbles coming out of solution due to change in temperature or pressure. Because cold water holds more air than warm water, small bubbles will appear in water. It has a high dissolved gas content that is heated or depressurized, which reduces how much dissolved gas the water can hold. The harmless cloudiness of the water disappears quickly as the gas is released from the water.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Water Resource Authority. http://www.mwra.com/04water/2004/whitewater.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hot water supply==
{{Main|Hot water system}}
Domestic hot water is provided by means of [[water heater]] appliances, or through [[district heating]].  The hot water from these units is then piped to the various fixtures and appliances that require hot water, such as lavatories, sinks, bathtubs, showers, washing machines, and dishwashers.

==Fixtures and appliances==
Everything in a building that uses water falls under one of two categories; fixture or appliance.  As the consumption points above perform their function, most produce waste/sewage components that will require removal by the waste/sewage side of the system.  The minimum is an air gap. See [[cross connection control &amp; backflow prevention]] for an overview of backflow prevention methods and devices currently in use, both through the use of mechanical and physical principles.

Fixtures are devices that use water without an additional source of power.

==Fittings and valves==
{{main|Piping and plumbing fittings}}
Potable water supply systems are composed of [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s, [[Piping and plumbing fittings|fittings]] and [[valve]]s.

==== Lead pipes ====
For many centuries, water pipes were made of lead, because of its ease of processing and durability. The use of lead pipes was a cause of health problems due to ignorance of the dangers of lead on the human body, which causes miscarriages and high death rates of newborns. Lead pipes, which were installed mostly in the late 1800s in the US, are still common today, much of which are located in the Northeast and the Midwest. Their impact is relatively small due to the fouling of pipes and stone cessation of the evolution of lead in the water; however, lead pipes are still detrimental. Most of the lead pipes that exist today are being removed and replaced with the more common material, copper or some type of plastic.

Remnants of pipes in some languages are the names of the experts involved in the execution, reparation, maintenance, and installation of water supply systems, which have been formed from the Latin word 'lead', English word 'plumber', French word, 'plombier'.

==Regulation and compliance==

===United States===
Before a water supply system is constructed or modified, the designer and contractor need to consult the local plumbing code and obtain a building permit prior to construction.&lt;ref&gt;''Uniform Plumbing Code'', IAPMO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Plumbing Code'', ICC&lt;/ref&gt; Even replacing an existing water heater may require a permit and inspection of the work. The US national standard for potable water piping guidelines is NSF/ANSI 61 certified materials. NSF/ANSI also sets standards for certifying polytanks, though the FDA approves the materials. National and local fire codes should be integrated in the design phase of the water system too to prevent "failure to comply with regulations" notices. Some areas of the [[United States]] require on-site water reserves of potable and fire water by law.

==Wastewater==
{{main|Sewage treatment}}
[[Wastewater]] from various appliances, fixtures, and taps is transferred to the waste and sewage removal system via the [[sewerage|sewage drain]] system to [[sewage treatment|treatment plants]].  This system consists of larger diameter piping, [[backflow preventer|water traps]], and [[Plumbing drainage venting|ventilation]] to prevent toxic gases from entering the living space.

==Water flow reduction==
{{main|Water conservation}}
Water flow through a tap can be reduced by inexpensive small plastic flow reducers.  These restrict flow between 15 and 50%, aiding [[water conservation]] and reducing the burden on both [[water supply]] and [[sewerage treatment|treatment]] facilities.

==Comparison to bottled water==
{{Globalize|section|date=April 2010}}
{{See also|Bottled water#Bottled water versus tap water}}
In modern [[Western society]], levels of contaminants found in tap water vary for every household and plumbing system but tend to be low. Two general conceptions with popular appeal are:
# That tap water is widely contaminated 
# That bottled water is assuredly pure
Both lack scientific support. In reality, both tap water and bottled water are usually safe, although in both cases exceptions can occur. The University of Cincinnati recently completed a Tap Water Quality Analysis, funded by PUR, for major US cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uc.edu/gissa/projects/drinkingwater/ "Tap Water Quality Analysis"]&lt;/ref&gt; Its findings show generally safe [[water quality]] in most regions. While most US cities have what is considered safe tap water, contaminants ranging from bacteria to heavy metals are present in some tap water, and occasionally serious violations of tap water standards have been well-publicized, such as the severe 1993 [[Cryptosporidium]] outbreak in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], which led to several deaths and around 400,000 illnesses (see: [[Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak]]). Regarding bottled water quality perceptions and reality, in 1999, the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) released controversial findings from a 4-year study on bottled water. The results of this study claimed that one-third of the waters tested contained levels of contamination—including synthetic organic chemicals, bacteria, and arsenic—in at least one sample that exceeded allowable limits under either state or bottled water industry standards or guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/nbw.asp|title=NRDC: Summary Findings of NRDC's 1999 Bottled Water Report|work=nrdc.org|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bottled water industry was quick to dispute the claim, saying bottled water is one of the most highly regulated food products under the FDA regulatory authority and that the FDA system worked extremely well when coupled with the International Bottled Water Association's Model Code and unannounced inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bottledwater.org/content/key-message-points|title=Key Message Points|work=bottledwater.org|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using tap water (whether straight from the tap or [[water filter|filtered]] first) is generally considered to be better for one's environmental impact than habitually drinking bottled water, because the bottling and distribution of bottled water consumes resources and produces emissions (electricity and oil to make the bottles, [[diesel fuel]] to truck the filled bottles through the supply chain, truck exhaust, powerplant emissions, bottle recycling, and so on). In comparison, the [[water treatment]] plant activities were going to happen anyway in either case, but the other costs and effects are avoided in the tap water case.

Many municipalities in the [[United States]] are making an effort to use tap water over bottled water on government properties and events. However, others voted the idea down, including voters in the state of Washington, who repealed a bottled water tax via citizen initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Washington's Gregoire plans 400 million more in budget cuts|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-12-16/washington-s-gregoire-plans-400-million-more-in-cuts.html|publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Workman, author of the book ''Heart of Dryness: How the Last Bushmen Can Help Us Endure the Coming Age of Permanent Drought'' and co-founder of SmartMarkets says that he doesn't believe that "tap water is bad and bottled water is good". Rather he cites differences in quality regulations and standards. "Bottled water is often tap water put through another filter and not held to the same quality regulations as public utility water is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = van der Leun| first = Justine| authorlink = | title = A Closer Look at New Research on Water Safety |  publisher = AOL Health | date = September 2009 | url = http://www.aolhealth.com/healthy-living/pollution-water-effects | accessdate = September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chlorine]] is a disinfectant which is added to tap water in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aCw-BPRYqqgC&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=Chlorine+disinfectant+which+is+added+to+tap+water+in+the+United+States&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8_7PRnebUAhVV2WMKHWAlAK0Q6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Chlorine%20disinfectant%20which%20is%20added%20to%20tap%20water%20in%20the%20United%20States&amp;f=false|title=Chlorine|last=Saucerman|first=Linda|date=September 2007|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=9781404219625}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chlorine can leave organic material like [[trihalomethanes]] and [[haloacetic acids]] in the water.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The level of chlorine found is small, 1L of chlorinated water gives 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg of chlorine, which has not been found to cause any health problems.&lt;ref name="Petraccia"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petraccia, L., Liberati, G., Masciullo S.G., Grassi, M. &amp; Fraioli, A. | title = Water, mineral waters and health | journal = Clinical Nutrition | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 377–385 | doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2005.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Teddy'''" is a short story by [[J. D. Salinger]], completed on November 22, 1952 and originally published in the January 31, 1953
issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]'', Salinger created an engaging child character, Teddy McArdle, to introduce to his readership some of the basic concepts of [[Zen]] enlightenment and [[Vedanta]] reincarnation – a task that Salinger recognized would require overcoming some 1950s American cultural chauvinism.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "In 1952, most Americans thought their way of life superior to that of Eastern cultures. Salinger was well aware of this chauvinism. It was clear to him that his reading audience was not going to accept the notions of mysticism or reincarnation easily."&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger wrote "Teddy" while he was arranging publication for a number of his [[Nine Stories (Salinger)|short stories]] and crafted the story to balance and contrast the collections' intended opening work "[[A Perfect Day for Bananafish]]".&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;

In Salinger's novella, "[[Seymour: An Introduction]]", a meditation written by a member of the fictional Glass family, [[Buddy Glass]] writes about his brother, [[Seymour Glass|Seymour]], where Buddy claims authorship to "Teddy" as well as other pieces in ''Nine Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;Wenke, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The story comprises several vignettes which take place aboard a luxury liner. The events occur roughly between 10:00 and 10:30 am on October 28, 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 235-236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Teddy is Theodore "Teddy" McArdle, a 10-year-old mystic-savant returning home to America with his entertainer-socialite parents and his younger sister. As part of their tour of [[Great Britain]], Teddy has been interviewed as an academic curiosity by professors of religious and philosophical studies - the "Leidekker examining group" - from various European universities in order to test his claims of advanced spiritual enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first scene opens in the McArdles' stateroom. Teddy is standing on his father’s expensive suitcase, peering out of the porthole. Mr. McArdle, apparently hung-over, is attempting to verbally assert control over his son; Mrs. McArdle indulges the boy as a provocative counterpoint to her husband’s bullying: neither adult has any real impact on the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 236: "His father, a bellicose actor and not in the best of moods, struggles to assert his authority over his child. Teddy’s mother lies under the covers in bed, taunting her husband and listlessly issuing commands to Teddy in an attempt to irritate his father."&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to his parents' outbursts impassively, he contemplates the nature of existence and physical permanence while observing fragments of orange peel that have been discarded overboard. The concepts that the preternatural child ponders are evidently derived from [[Zen]] and [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] religious philosophy, and suggest that Teddy possesses advanced enlightenment or God-consciousness. When Teddy conveys his spiritual insights to his father and mother, they interpret them merely as the products of his precociousness, eliciting annoyance or indifference from the adults.

Teddy is ordered to retrieve his six-year-old sister, Booper, who has absconded to the sport deck with her father’s expensive camera, which Teddy -  indifferent to its material value -  has bestowed upon her as a plaything. 
As he departs, Teddy delivers a short, cryptic caveat to his parents, informing them that they may never see him again outside the realm of memory.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Main Deck, Teddy has a brief encounter with one of the ship's female officers, Ensign Mathewson. Forthright and exacting,  the boy questions the officer and obtains information about a shipboard word game competition - and disabuses the bemused woman as to her misapprehensions regarding his advanced intellectual development.

Teddy proceeds to the Sport Deck and locates his little sister, Booper, at play with another young passenger. Booper is a domineering and hateful child, contrasting sharply with her older brother's equanimity. Teddy, with firmness, politely exhorts the girl to return with the camera to the cabin and report to their mother. Ignoring his sister’s verbal ripostes, he reminds her to meet him shortly for their swimming lesson at the swimming pool. She submits with bad grace as he departs.

The final scene takes place on the Sun Deck, where Teddy, reclining on one of his family's reserved deckchairs, reviews his recent diary entries. The document has been conscientiously edited and neatly written. It contains reminders to foster better relations with his father; commentary on a letter from a Professor of Literature; a list of vocabulary words to study and notes on his meditation schedule - all matters of self-improvement. While making his daily entry, he writes the following ''non sequitur'': “It will either happen today or February 14, 1958 when I am sixteen. It is ridiculous to mention it even.”

Teddy is interrupted by a passenger named Bob Nicholson, a graduate of an unnamed university, who teaches curriculum and instruction. Nicholson is on a first name basis with the Leidekker group and has listened to a taped interview with Teddy, in which he shows a lurid interest. He peppers Teddy with questions on the boy’s commitment to the precepts of Vedantic reincarnation; Teddy remains composed in the face of the young man’s veiled hostility, and provides him with a brief sketch of this discovery of God, his relationships with his parents and his views on Zen philosophy. The boy offers Nicholson an extended metaphor on the nature of logic that challenges the young man’s rational and orthodox commitment to material reality. Teddy, in explaining his position on death and reincarnation gives a hypothetical example describing a series of events at his upcoming swimming lesson in which a fatality occurs: his own.

Teddy disengages from the interview and hurries to his lesson. Nicholson pursues him through the levels of the ship's decks, and as he begins to descend the stairs to the swimming pool, he hears the scream of "a small, female child" emanating from the enclosed walls of the indoor pool. The story ends on this ambiguous note.

==Analysis==

===The porthole and the orange peel===

In the opening scene set in the Mr. and Mrs. McArdle's state room, Salinger presents two facets of Zen enlightenment: "God-consciousness", a profound awareness of "inner spirit", in contrast to material concerns, and secondly, "the notion of impermanence", based on "the Vedantic belief that separate existence is an illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy, perched on a piece of luggage, pokes his head through the open porthole, penetrating figuratively into a zone of enlightenment and sublimity; his body remains in the cabin, where his parents – “materialistic and self-centered” – engage in mildly abusive repartee, issuing petulant and ineffectual commands to their son, who endures them with tolerant detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Teddy’s astonishing self-possession is a product of his adherence to Vedantic “philosophy of non-attachment”, enabling him to distinguish between “the world of illusion” – the material world – and “the world of reality”, where “only unity of God is real.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238&lt;/ref&gt;

The boy focuses his attention on some discarded orange peel suspended momentarily on the ocean surface; as they sink out of sight, he engages in “[[Solipsism|solipsistic]] contemplation. Teddy conveys his revelation to his parents: “After I go out this door, I may only exist in the minds of all my acquaintances…I may be an orange peel.” His mother and father, victims of their spiritual “immaturity”, are incapable of grasping his warning that they may never see him again. Salinger issues this Vedantic premonition to the reader as a clue to Teddy’s fate.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237: “It foreshadows the story’s ending…”&lt;/ref&gt;

===Booper===

The same studied disengagement that characterizes Teddy’s relationship with his parents also informs the “amazing” toleration he exhibits toward his younger sister – a child that biographer Kenneth Slawenski describes as “a cruel little girl” and “perhaps the most vicious child ever discharged by Salinger’s imagination.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

When Booper announces that she “hates everybody in the ocean”, Salinger calls attention to the setting of his story: the sea, with its infinite horizons and indefinite boundaries where his characters drift – a seascape that reflects “the Zen and Vedantic concepts of existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teddy’s tolerance of his sister is due to his understanding that few reincarnations have contributed to the six-year old’s spiritual development.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 237-238: “[Teddy] recognizes that  she has only just begun her spiritual journey and has many reincarnations ahead of her.”&lt;/ref&gt; Booper’s misanthropic persona make plausible her role in the sinister and unsettling denouement at the swimming  pool.

===Bob Nicholson===

The final vignette occurs on the Sun Deck. Bob Nicholson, a teacher at Trinity College, Dublin, is acquainted with some members of the Leidekker group who examined Teddy; he engages the boy in an ''ad hoc'' interview.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238: “[Nicholson] imposes himself on Teddy and begins to pepper him with philosophical questions.”&lt;/ref&gt; This serves two purposes in Salinger’s story. First, he functions as a foil to Teddy,  posing logical questions challenging the tenets of Vendantic and Zen philosophy. Salinger uses this device to respond to hostile skeptics among his readers.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p.238: “Nicholson’s character serves two purposes. Salinger uses him as a sounding board against which Teddy can express Vedantic and Zen viewpoints that Nicholson reacts to skeptically.”&lt;/ref&gt; According to Slawenski, Nicholson “embodies the logic that poisons God-consciousness, and he represents the power of the intellect to blind individuals from spiritual truth.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson additionally functions as a witness to Teddy’s final discourse on the nature of existence and death, in which the boy formulates the circumstances that might lead to his reincarnation. In a lull in their exchange, Teddy becomes momentarily distracted by an inner voice or vision, and spontaneously recites to Nicholson two haiku by the 17th Century poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]]: “Nothing in the voice of the cicada intimates how soon it will die” and “Along this road goes no one, this autumn eve.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson, pursuing Teddy to the indoor swimming pool, hears, but does not see, the event that the boy prophesied, providing the reader with tantalizing evidence that leaves the boy's ultimate fate a mystery.

===The "swimming pool ending"===

The ending of Salinger’s “Teddy” has been described as “controversial” &lt;ref&gt;Alexander, 1999,  p. 169-172&lt;/ref&gt; and “the most widely criticized ending of any story that he ever wrote.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger thrice provides the  reader with intimations of Teddy’s demise: in statements to his parents, in his diary and to Nicholson. This has led readers to interpret the final passage as confirmation of the boy’s premonition  i.e. Booper shoves her older brother into the empty concrete pool and screams when she sees the deadly consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239: “Most readers have interpreted the closing lines of “Teddy” as indicating Teddy’s death at the hand of Booper. This conclusion is derived from Teddy’s own predictions rather than the text itself.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Slawenski reports two additional interpretations that might be derived from the final passage. One option is that Teddy “recognizing the threat his sister poses” evades her thrust and pushes her to her death, as act of premeditated murder.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; A third option is that both children plunge into the empty basin when Teddy carries Booper with him off the precipice – in order to advance her into her next reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 239-240&lt;/ref&gt; "None of these" says Slawenski, "is very satisfying."

Critics of the story may have targeted the ending for disapproval, rather than engage in a culturally biased critique of Salinger’s foray into Zen philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240: “[T]he story's critics – many of whom found fault with in its Eastern tenets – conveniently delivered the brunt of disapproval to the story's ambiguous ending, rather than condemn cultural philosophies they did not understand.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinger himself regarded the work as “exceptionally Haunting [sic]” and “memorable” yet “unpleasantly controversial” and “thoroughly unsuccessful.”&lt;ref&gt;Slawenski, 2010, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Final Circle of Paradise''''' ({{lang-ru|Хищные вещи века}}, literally ''Predatory Things of the Century'') is a [[science fiction]] novel by [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]] (also spelled Strugatski or Strugatskii) set in the first half of the 21st century.  It was first published in the [[USSR]] in 1965 and the first English edition, translated by Leonid Renen, was published by [[DAW books]] in 1976.  The literal English translation of the original Russian title is "Predatory Things of Our Times".

This novel is a sequel of sorts to an earlier Strugatsky novel ''[[Space Apprentice]]'' (1962).  At the end of ''Space Apprentice'', flight engineer Ivan Zhilin gives up space travel for Earth, where "the most important things are" to make the solar system a better place for the young people of the world.  ''The Final Circle of Paradise'' takes place a little less than ten years after ''Space Apprentice'', in a medium-sized seaside resort city somewhere in Europe.  In the intervening time, he has been working for the security service of the World Council, an international governing body similar to but far more powerful than the [[United Nations]].  A few years before, Zhilin fought as part of an international brigade to put down a [[Fascist]] uprising in the same city where this story is set, reminiscent of the Soviet experience during the Second World War.  This was supposedly one of the "final" wars before universal disarmament, where the last of the fascists were finally defeated.  Like other Strugatsky novels, the setting is an internationalized future of advanced technology and world peace.  There is no iron curtain, cold war, or arms race.  Most of the world is permanently at peace, with the rest on the verge of being forcibly demilitarized.

==Plot summary==
Ivan Zhilin, posing as a writer working on a novel, visits a seaside resort city to investigate a series of mysterious deaths.  Zhilin's role as an undercover agent becomes apparent to the reader only gradually and is not brought into the open until the final chapters of the novel.

While being given a tour of the city, a tourism official tells Zhilin that he will get no work done, as he will be distracted by the "twelve circles of paradise" found in the city.  These include the Fishers, which provide thrill seekers with situations of extreme and potentially fatal terror, the Shivers, which electronically induce pleasurable dreams to large crowds of people, and the Society of Patrons of Arts, who procure priceless works of art and ritualistically destroy them.  The culture of this city has become utterly decadent, the product of an age of universal affluence.  Zhilin refers to the present state of the world as "the age of the boob" where the highest priority is placed on orgiastic pleasure and staving off boredom, to the neglect of culture, education and scientific progress.  The authors express the [[Marxist]] perspective in the scene of an argument between Zhilin and a third-world revolutionary:
{{quote|The great revolutionaries would not have accepted your shibboleth: now you are free – enjoy yourselves.  They spoke otherwise: now you are free – work.  After all, they never fought for abundance for the belly, they were interested in abundance for the soul and the mind.|(p. 158)}}

The ultimate expression of the decadence of Earth culture is the mysterious "slug", which is apparently responsible for the deaths that Zhilin is investigating.   At first Zhilin believes it to be some sort of narcotic, distributed by gangsters with secret laboratories and trafficking networks.  Zhilin progressively finds clues that lead him to Peck Xenai, a his former classmate and the last surviving member of his international unit that fought the Fascists some years before.  Peck, however, is physically ravaged by alcoholism and the use of "slug" and does not even recognize Zhilin when he finds him.  Zhilin succeeds in getting a "slug" from Peck, in the form of a small silver electronic component.  What Zhilin finds when he plugs the "slug" into his radio receiver and lies in the bathtub causes him to rethink the entire situation.

"Slug" turns out to be a way of generating an artificial reality significantly more intense than normal reality, to the point where there is virtually no comparison between our reality and that of the "slug".  People become addicted to it and spend increasing amounts of time unconscious in their bathtubs until it kills them by nervous exhaustion or brain hemorrhages.  This is "the final circle of paradise". It also turns out that the "slug" is not the work of gangsters or a secret laboratory, but is a common electronic component being used in a novel way.  If "slug" were to become widely known, Zhilin concludes, nothing would stop it from being used by millions the world over.  Zhilin, himself struggling not to use it a second time, concludes that "slug" represents "the end of progress".  He foresees humanity as a whole entering this illusory reality, which will eventually destroy mankind.

At the end of ''Space Apprentice'', Zhilin began to devote his life to making the solar system a better place for young people struggling to find purpose in the world.  At the end of this story, he leaves his work with the World Council to fight "the last war – the most bloodless and most difficult for its soldiers" (p. 170) – that of making life worth living for the millions caught unprepared in an age of affluence, so that they will never need anything like "slug".  However, even as Zhilin is saying this, at the end of the novel it is left ambiguous whether he thinks he will be able to resist using the "slug" again.

== Predictions ==
Published in the middle of 1960s, the book predicted several phenomena, like

* [[Rave]]s
* Popularization of [[extreme sport]]s – fishers

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57146">This is a chronological index for the start year for motor vehicle brands (up to 1969). For manufacturers that went on to produce many models, it represents the start date of the whole brand; for the others, it usually represents the date of appearance of the main (perhaps only) model that was produced.

This also gives an idea of what motor vehicles were appearing on the streets in each country around each date (allowing, too, for imports from other countries). Moreover, by showing which models were contemporary, it gives a first indication of how individual designers were being influenced by each other, and a flavor of the entrepreneurial spirit and dynamics of the pioneering days of motor vehicle manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;David Burgess Wise (2000). ''The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Automobiles'', BookSales Inc, 560pp, {{ISBN|978-0-7858-1106-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beaulieu&gt;{{cite book |last=[[G.N. Georgano]] |first=N. |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile |year=2000 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |isbn=1-57958-293-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each year, and country of origin, the lists are structured according to the type of vehicle first introduced. These include the following types: steam, electric, [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric]], internal-combustion, [[touring car]], [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]], [[tonneau]], [[Phaeton body|phaeton]], [[cyclecar]], [[light car]], [[voiturette]], [[Runabout (car)|runabout]], [[high wheeler]], [[Buggy (automobile)|buggy]], [[Three-wheeler|tricar]], motor quadricycle, motor tricycle, motorcycle, coach, bus, fire-engine, truck, tractor, racing car, avant-train.

===1885===
Karl Benz's vehicle was the first true automobile, entirely designed as such, rather than simply being a motorized stage coach or horse carriage.

His wife and sons became the first true motorists, in 1889, when they took the car out for the specific task of paying a family visit.

===1896===
In the UK, the [[Locomotives on Highways Act 1896]] replaced the hugely restrictive [[Locomotive Act]]s of 1861, 1865 and 1878 (the so-called ''Red Flag acts'') thereby finally freeing up the automotive industry in the UK (and, incidentally, was also the origin of the celebrations of the first [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run]]). Knight had been convicted under the old act, the previous year, for not having a man precede his vehicle with a red flag, and Walter Arnold was the first person to be convicted, in January 1896, for exceeding the speed limit. Meanwhile, Serpollet was issued with what was effectively the first driving licence.

'''Tree box filters'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/epublic/live/ec701/build/ec701.pdf| "Stormwater Terminology" 2011. University of Nebraska Press Extension Curricular&lt;/ref&gt; are typically filtration systems installed under a street or sidewalk which have trees planted in them.  The systems collect [[stormwater]] runoff through methods such as permeable pavers or curb cuts.  The runoff is then filtered by soil, microbes and vegetation before either being utilized by the tree or discharged into a [[storm drain]] system.

==Benefits==

Tree box filters have the potential to improve the quality and health of street trees by providing larger areas for roots to stabilize the tree and more availability of water and nutrients. Additionally, the filters can delay the [[peak flow]] and improve the [[water quality]] of [[water]] entering a storm drain system. It is a practical management strategy for stormwater issues in urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geronimo|first=Franz Kevin F.|last2=Maniquiz-Redillas|first2=Marla C.|last3=Kim|first3=Lee-Hyung|date=2013-05-01|title=Treatment of parking lot runoff by a tree box filter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2013.781099|journal=Desalination and Water Treatment|volume=51|issue=19-21|pages=4044–4049|doi=10.1080/19443994.2013.781099|issn=1944-3994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6353">The '''Virtual Global University''' ('''VGU''') is a [[virtual university]] offering online [[distance education]] or [[virtual education]] on the [[Internet]].

==Organization==

The Virtual Global University (VGU) is a private organization founded in 2001 by 17 professors of [[Business Informatics]] from 14 different universities in [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. The VGU brings together the knowledge and experience of people from different universities in one [[virtual business|virtual organization]]. At the same time it is a real organization, according to German civil law under the name "VGU Private Virtual Global University GmbH".

Within the Virtual Global University, the School of Business Informatics (SBI) is the organizational unit that offers online courses and an online study program.

==Studies==

The focus of VGU's study offerings is [[information technology]] (IT) and [[management]]—or [[Business Informatics]] as it is called in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, B., J. Valacich, R. Watson, R. Zmud and et al., What Every Business Student Needs to Know About Information Systems, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, (9:30) December, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doukidis, G.: et al. (Ed.): Proceedings of the 3rd European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS '95). Athens 1995, pp.1295–1297&lt;/ref&gt; Students of [[Business Informatics]] (BI) are taught how to use IT effectively to develop business solutions for global challenges.

All courses offered by the VGU are based on the Internet as well as on commonly available information and communication technology and are given entirely, or are substantially supported, by means of electronic media. The MBI can be conducted either in English or in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Annette |last=Bauer |title=Neuer Wirtschaftsinformatik-Master für Berufstätige startet |url=http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news317473 |work=Abteilung Presse- und Öffentlichkeitsarbeit Europa-Universität Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder)|date=2009-05-28 |accessdate = 2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MBI program===

The VGU offers a master's program leading to the degree of an "International [[Master of Business Informatics]]" (MBI). The creation of the MBI was supported by the German "Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung" (federal ministry of education and research) within the program "New Media in Education". The program is accredited by government as well as by [[ACQUIN]]. The [[master's degree]] is awarded by the [[European University Viadrina]] (EUV) in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany in cooperation with the VGU. While the latter one provides expertise and teaching for the program, EUV is responsible for ensuring that the academic and educational standards of the program are maintained at an appropriate level.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medien-bildung.net&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certificate courses===

Independent certificate courses on a number of IT and [[management]] topics are offered in addition to the master program MBI.

'''Yale-NUS College''' is a [[liberal arts college]] in [[Singapore]]. Established in 2011 as a collaboration between [[Yale University]] and the [[National University of Singapore]], it is the first liberal arts college in Singapore and one of the few in Asia. Yale-NUS is the first institution outside [[New Haven, Connecticut]], that Yale University has developed in its 300-year history, making Yale the first American [[Ivy League]] school to establish a college bearing its name in Asia.

Yale-NUS is predominantly a four-year, fully residential undergraduate institution. The first class, the class of 2017, consisted of 157 students entering in 2013. Over several years, the college intends to increase its student body to 1,000 students and its teaching faculty to about 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS Faculty|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/faculty/|website=Yale-NUS College|publisher=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-over-190-students-to-the-class-of-2019/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students select their majors (currently there are 14&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/majors/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at the end of their second year, after going through two years of the Yale-NUS Common Curriculum, which is "built from scratch by the inaugural faculty, draws on the strengths of established liberal arts traditions, while introducing our students to the diverse intellectual traditions and cultures of Asia and the world". Students graduate with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours or a Bachelor of Science degree with Honours from Yale-NUS College, awarded by NUS.

The College's first graduating class (Class of 2017 – excluding those who are still completing their concurrent degree programmes, amongst others), comprises 119 students. 103 graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours and 16 with a Bachelor of Science with Honours. The top five majors of choice amongst the students were Arts and Humanities; Philosophy, Politics and Economics; Environmental Studies; Psychology; and Mathematical, Computational and Statistical Sciences. As of Sept. 29 2017, over 90% of the students had secured jobs or university places to pursue graduate studies. Students who received job offers are working in sectors such science &amp; research (12%), consulting (14%), as well as the public sector (17%). Others industries include education and engineering, finance, technology and start-ups, communications, and consumer and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hua|first1=Rachel|title=Yale-NUS Graduates Secure Job and Graduate School Opportunities|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/viii-10/news/yale-nus-graduates-secure-job-graduate-school-opportunities/|accessdate=14 November 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 60% of students at Yale-NUS are Singaporeans and 40% are international students. Yale-NUS College receives more than 8,000 applications annually and the admit rate is typically 3% to 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=Yale-NUS Welcomes Class of 2021, with 7% acceptance rate|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vii-1/news/yale-nus-welcomes-class-2021-acceptance-rate/|accessdate=14 November 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]], Yale-NUS is the only other college in Singapore to follow a holistic admissions process similar to that followed by Yale and other American universities. Like both Yale and NUS, Yale-NUS follows a [[need-blind]] admission policy and offers financial aid on a full-need basis. Yale-NUS also distributes scholarships to some admitted students based on academic merit.&lt;ref name="http://yale-nus.edu.sg"&gt;http://yale-nus.edu.sg&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Under the presidency of [[Rick Levin|Richard Levin]], Yale University began developing a "internationalization" strategy that included expanding financial resources for international students and study abroad programs, founding the [[Yale World Fellows]] and the [[Yale Center for the Study of Globalization|Center for the Study of Globalization]], and joining the [[International Alliance of Research Universities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/The%20Internationalization%20of%20Yale%20-%20The%20Emerging%20Framework%20.pdf |last1=Levin |first1=Richard C. |last2=Lorimer |first2=Linda K. |title=The Internationalization of Yale: 2005-2008 |date=December 2005 |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrators at Yale began considering international campus expansion in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Katz |first=Daniel |title=Levin Forges New Ties in Middle East |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/09/22/levin-forges-new-ties-in-middle-east/ |date=22 September 2006 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially approached the [[United Arab Emirates]] about establishing an arts institute on Abu Dhabi's [[Saadiyat Island]], developed in collaboration with the university's arts professional schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ouroussoff |first=Nicolai |title=A Vision in the Desert |date=1 February 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/01/arts/design/04ouro.html |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Day Lassila |first=Kathrin |title=Worldly Ambitions |date=May 2007 |magazine=Yale Alumni Magazine |url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2007_05/q_a.html |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyd |first=Rachel |title=Arts institute plans intensify |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=13 September 2007 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2007/09/13/arts-institute-plans-intensify/ |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Yale indicated that it was not willing to offer Yale degree programs at the proposed institute, the project was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Thomas |last2=Wessel |first2=Nora |title=Yale drops plans for Abu Dhabi |date=11 April 2008 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2008/04/11/yale-drops-plans-for-abu-dhabi/ |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewin |first=Tamar |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/12/education/12yale.html |title=Yale Moves Away From Plans for Link With Abu Dhabi |date=12 April 2008 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levin and National University of Singapore President [[Tan Chorh Chuan]] discussed the concept of a joint liberal arts college at the 2009 [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland,&lt;ref name="CHE2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-in-a-Name-For-Yale-in/131794/ |last=Fischer |first=Karin |title=What's in a Name?

Among the given reasons for the initiative were "develop[ing] a novel curriculum spanning Western and Asian cultures" and better preparing students for "an interconnected, interdependent global environment".&lt;ref name="YNCP"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Levin |first1=Rick |last2=Salovey |first2=Peter |title=Prospectus for a liberal arts college in Singapore |date=12 September 2010 |url=http://communications.yale.edu/sites/default/files/YNC-Prospectus-2010-09.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212093625/http://communications.yale.edu/sites/default/files/YNC-Prospectus-2010-09.pdf |archivedate=12 December 2013 |deadurl=unfit |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caplan-Bricker |first=Nora |title=Yale, Singapore plan new liberal arts college |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=13 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale-NUS College was officially launched in April 2011. In July 2012, the College held its ground-breaking ceremony;&lt;ref name="ao1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Edvantage/Story/A1Story20120706-357731.html |title=Yale-NUS College holds groundbreaking ceremony |publisher=News.asiaone.com |date=2012-07-06 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; it enrolled its first class of students in 2013.&lt;ref name="milestones"&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/milestones/|website=Yale–NUS College|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale-NUS inaugurated its campus on October 12, 2015.

In 2012, Yale-NUS published its policy on academic freedom and non-discrimination, which states that “the College upholds the principles of academic freedom and open inquiry, essential core values in higher education of the highest calibre. Faculty and students in the College will be free to conduct scholarship and research and publish the results, and to teach in the classroom and express themselves on campus, bearing in mind the need to act in accordance with accepted scholarly and professional standards and the regulations of the College.” The College is also “committed to basing judgments concerning the admission, education, and employment of individuals upon their qualifications and abilities.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/policies-and-procedures/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissions==
Yale-NUS has a no-loan policy and provides need-blind admission to local and international students. The admission timeline is similar to that of colleges and universities in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://admissions.yale-nus.edu.sg/afford/|title=Afford - Yale-NUS College|work=Yale-NUS College|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Yale-NUS hopes to grow its class size to 250 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-over-190-students-to-the-class-of-2019/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2016|7|reason=Hopes from 2013 should have changed by now.}} &lt;!--Neither point is fully correct at the present time.

The College employs a holistic approach in evaluating applicants: while academic achievement as reflected in examinations grades is a primary consideration, interviews, recommendations, essays and extracurricular accomplishments are also given significant weight in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College welcomes inaugural class exceeding 150 students|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-college-welcomes-inaugural-class-exceeding-150-students/|website=Yale-NUS College|publisher=Yale-NUS College|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its inaugural review, the common curriculum was reduced to 10 courses, with the removal of a science course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=Common Curriculum reduced to 10 courses, following first review - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-13/news/common-curriculum-reduced-to-10-courses-following-first-review/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yale-NUS common curriculum is a set of interconnected courses designed to provide all students with a shared, intensive exploration of themes and topics ranging across all the academic disciplines, from science to the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/singapores-first-liberal-arts-college-outlines-innovative-common-curriculum/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, titled "In Defense of a Liberal Education," Fareed Zakaria describes the Yale-NUS Curriculum Report as the 21st century version of the Yale Report of 1828, which set the agenda for the classical curriculum of the 19th century, and the Harvard Red Book of 1945, which set a similar agenda for the 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.libertyproject.com/freedom/why-american-colleges-need-global-common-curriculu/|title=Why American colleges need a global common curriculum in the 21st century|work=The Liberty Project|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majors===

Students choose their majors at the end of their second year. Currently, there are 14 major fields of study. 31% of the courses are part of the common curriculum, 34% are required by the major, and 35% are electives and prerequisites for the major.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/student-experience/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minors===

Students can declare their minors after the end of their second year. Currently there are 13 minor fields of study. The fields correspond to Yale-NUS's existing majors, with the exception of PPE and DDP Law. However, the college recently approved two new interdisciplinary minors: Global Antiquity and Chinese Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ong|first1=Justin|title=Global Antiquity and Chinese Studies Approved as Yale-NUS’s First Interdisciplinary Minors|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vi-8/news/global-antiquity-chinese-studies-approved-yale-nus-first-interdisciplinary-minor/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|issue=Volume VI Issue 8|publisher=The Octant|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 42% of the inaugural two batches have declared minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chappell|first1=David|title=42% of Yale-NUS Upperclass Students Declare Minor|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/news/yale-nus-students-declare-minor/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joint and associated programs==
Yale-NUS and Faculty of Law, NUS jointly offer a Double Degree program in Law and Liberal Arts for those seeking a broad liberal arts education in addition to their professional training in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/double-degree-with-law/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale-NUS offers three Concurrent Degree Programs:

·       Concurrent Degree Program with Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. A five-year program designed for students who want to pursue careers in an environmental field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/concurrent-degree-with-yfes/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·       Concurrent Degree Program with Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. A five-year program designed for students who want a broad liberal arts education followed by careers in the field of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/concurrent-degree-with-lkyspp/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·       Concurrent Degree Program with Yale School of Public Health. A five-year program designed for students who want a broad liberal arts education and a career in the field of public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/curriculum/concurrent-degree-with-yale-school-of-public-health/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale-NUS plans to introduce a fourth Concurrent Degree Programme with the NUS School of Computing, in 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ho|first1=Dion|title=Yale-NUS Concurrent Degree Programme with NUS School of Computing - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/issue/news/yale-nus-concurrent-degree-programme-nus-school-computing/|accessdate=26 October 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Students will receive special consideration to be admitted in the Silver Scholars Program of the Yale School of Management. The program provides the unique opportunity to enter the Yale MBA program immediately after undergraduate study to move more quickly toward career goals. Duke-NUS, Singapore's first US-style graduate-entry medical school, has also expressed interest in admitting Yale-NUS graduates for their  Doctor of Medicine (MD), PhD and MD/PhD degree programs.&lt;ref name="duke-nus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/index.php/learning/md-phd-md-phd-programs-at-duke-nus-graduate-medical-school.html |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601222220/http://yale-nus.edu.sg/index.php/learning/md-phd-md-phd-programs-at-duke-nus-graduate-medical-school.html |title=MD, PhD, MD/PhD Programs at Duke-NUS Medical School| archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiential learning ==
The Yale-NUS Centre for International and Professional Experience integrates traditionally separate and often silo-ed components of experience based learning (such as study abroad, summer sessions, internships, career services, leadership and service programming, research attachments) under one roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cipe.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=cipe.yale-nus.edu.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Week 7 program takes place in the seventh week of the first semester of the first year – a time when all freshers are enrolled in the same common curriculum courses. During Week 7, all first-year students participate in a faculty-generated initiative that brings student learning out into the world and connects to both faculty interests and themes of the common curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/world-insight-designing-experiential-learning-yale-nus-college|title=World insight: designing experiential learning at Yale-NUS College|date=2016-07-24|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Yale-NUS, a term-time study abroad experience is the norm. Some 75 to 80 per cent of students spend a semester elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/world-insight-building-study-abroad-programme-works|title=World insight: building a study abroad programme that works|date=2016-12-27|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2017-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus life==

===Residential colleges===
[[File:Yale-NUS 5.jpg|thumb|right|Yale-NUS College's central courtyard]]
Yale-NUS's student life is modelled on the [[residential colleges of Yale University|residential colleges of Yale]]. There are three residential colleges named Saga, Elm and Cendana, although there are plans to build a fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marie Lee|first1=Regina|title=Yale-NUS to Open a Fourth Residential College in Four Years - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-3/features/yale-nus-to-open-a-fourth-residential-college-in-four-years/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each has its own dining hall, courtyard, student suites, sky-gardens, faculty residences, study-spaces, intramural teams, and butteries, informal student-run eateries that are a Yale tradition. Students live in suites of six single rooms. These small-scale communities are arranged vertically in residential towers, which contain both student suites and faculty apartments. Floors are grouped into neighborhoods, each with its own skygarden, a landscaped outdoor space for high-rise buildings that was pioneered in Singapore.

The residential community includes a rector (equivalent to the position of a college master at Yale), a vice rector, faculty fellows, advisors, rector's aides, and distinguished visiting fellows. Students will expand their social and leadership skills while enjoying the support of "nested academic communities."

[[File:Yale-NUS 2.jpg|thumb|left|A courtyard at Yale-NUS]]

Kyle Farley, formerly Dean of Jonathan Edwards College at Yale, served as the first Dean of Students of the college. Brian McAdoo, a geologist and expert in environment studies, formerly of [[Vassar College]], served as the inaugural Rector and is currently rector of Elm college, while Eduardo Lage-Otero, formerly of Trinity College, was named inaugural Vice-Rector and later served as Vice-Rector of Saga College.

There is currently no Dean of Students.

As the first freshmen transitioned into the collegiate living experience, they were originally aided by Dean's Fellows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/21-july-2017-deans-fellows-guides-and-mentors-for-yale-nus-students/|title=Yale-NUS College|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a group of recent college graduates picked from various higher educational backgrounds, including Amherst, Carleton, Princeton, Reed, Mt. Holyoke, Yale, and NUS. As of 2017, the Dean's Fellow role has shifted, with residential functions now primarily being performed by upper-class students.

===Student organisations===

In 2017, Yale-NUS had 54 student organisations recognised by the Dean of Students Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://studentlife.yale-nus.edu.sg/student-activities/student-orgs-directory/|website=studentlife.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college has a number of student newspapers, magazines and journals. Publications include ''The Octant'', Yale-NUS's most established publication, ''The Mocktant'', its satirical counterpart, ''Tònes'', a multilingual magazine, and the Yale-NUS Society for Academic Research, which publishes academic journals. While not a recognised student organisation, ''The Fox and Hedgehog'', a current and global affairs review, was founded by Yale-NUS students.

==Campus==
[[Image:Yale-NUS 3.jpg|thumb|A view of the three residential colleges.]]
The Yale-NUS campus is adjacent to NUS University Town&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University Town|url=https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/University+Town/@1.3060434,103.7707735,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da1af575f7ff17:0x1056d4b4bd4641c8!8m2!3d1.306038!4d103.7729622?hl=en|website=Google Maps|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the College moved to this permanent campus in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/milestones/ |website=Yale–NUS College|accessdate=July 25, 2016 |title=Milestones}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a central campus green flanked by academic and administrative buildings. The campus was designed by architectural firms Pelli Clark Pelli and Forum Architects (a Singaporean architecture studio), who state that "its architectural style blends the collegiate traditions of Yale with the Southeast Asian cultures through its modernist style ornamented by metalwork patterns inspired by southeast Asian textiles." Unlike the neighbouring University Town, Yale-NUS's campus is built on a grid system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chia|first1=David|title=Detailing the Distinct Architecture of Yale-NUS - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-10/arts/detailing-the-distinct-architecture-of-yale-nus/|accessdate=7 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus was designed to achieve the highest rating under the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark, Singapore's benchmark for sustainable design. In addition to visible sustainable design strategies such as the biofiltration pond and the frequent use of natural ventilation, the campus integrates advanced building systems for energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/singapore/yale-nus-college|title=Yale-NUS College - Singapore Education Building - e-architect|date=9 February 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale-NUS's campus was awarded the Green Mark Platinum Award from the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/yale-nus-wins-bca-green-mark-platinum-award/|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the International Architecture Award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isabel Ee|first1=Clare|title=Yale-NUS College|url=https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/26-july-2016-yale-nus-college-receives-prestigious-international-architecture-award-2016/|website=www.yale-nus.edu.sg|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alumni==

Upon graduation, Yale-NUS alumni will be receive alumni membership of National University of Singapore and will be international affiliates in the Association of Yale Alumni (AYA), although not membership to the Yale Club of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xie|first1=Yihao|title=Yale-NUS Alumni to be International Affiliates in the Association of Yale Alumni - The Octant|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/iv-9/news/breaking-yale-nus-alumni-to-be-international-affiliates-in-the-association-of-yale-alumni/|accessdate=8 May 2017|work=The Octant|publisher=The Octant|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale-NUS has its own Alumni Affairs Council and is working to establish a Yale-NUS Club of Singapore.

Since graduating its first class in June 2017, Yale-NUS alumni have won several post-graduate awards, including its first Rhodes Scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/yale-nus-graduate-awarded-prestigious-rhodes-scholarship|title=Yale-NUS graduate awarded prestigious Rhodes Scholarship|last=|first=|date=|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Schwarzman Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.schwarzmanscholars.org/scholar/mollie-saltskog/|title=Schwarzman Scholars Class of 2018 Profiles|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also achieved an employment rate of 93.3%, with a median monthly salary of SGD3,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/ix-6/uncategorized/graduation-statistics-first-cohort-yale-nus-graduates/|title=Graduation statistics from the first cohort of Yale-NUS graduates|last=Ho|first=Dion|date=15 March 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Mascot ==
Yale-NUS launched the College Mascot in 2017. The Yale-NUS College Mascot - 'Halcyon' -  emerged as a representation of the blue-eared kingfisher species found in rarity in Singapore. The orange-and-blue mascot, colours of Yale-NUS, found ready acceptance as it also encapsulates the core identity of a young academic institution in quick and confident ascension, ready to take on the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.campaignbriefasia.com/2017/03/yale-nus-and-hakuhodo-singapor.html|title=Yale-NUS and Hakuhodo Singapore team up to create the college kingfisher mascot|work=Campaign Brief Asia|access-date=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mascot was ratified by the student body on April 7, 2016 after three rounds of voting. Since ratification, the Yale-NUS Student Government held focus group discussions to gather feedback on the mascot design and name. The name Halcyon emerged from one of these student focus group discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theoctant.org/edition/vi-2/news/yale-nus-unveils-official-college-mascot/|title=Yale-NUS Unveils Official College Mascot|date=2017-02-02|work=The Octant|access-date=2017-07-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Observers in the [[New York Times]] and the [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] see Yale's move as part of a larger movement of the globalization of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/nyregion/14yale.html | work=The New York Times | first=Lisa W. | last=Foderaro | title=Yale Plans to Create a College in Singapore | date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fischer |first=Karin |url=http://chronicle.com/article/YaleNational-U-of/132563/ |title=Yale and National U. of Singapore Hammer Out New College's Curriculum |newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=25 June 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale faced criticism for its involvement in Singapore because of the government's restrictions on freedom of assembly and ban on homosexual activity.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Karin |last=Fischer |title=With Opening Near, Yale Defends Singapore Venture |newspaper=The New York Times |date=27 August 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/world/asia/27iht-educlede27.html|quote="...few have provoked the heated criticism that Yale has regarding its decision to be involved in a country where not only is freedom of assembly and association restricted, but homosexual activity is banned."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fareed Zakaria]], a CNN host and fellow of the [[Yale Corporation]] at the time, supported the venture, saying that "Singapore has a great deal to learn from America, and NUS has a great deal to learn from Yale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/03/zakaria-a-global-education-for-a-global-age/ |last=Zakaria |first=Fareed |title=A global education for a global age |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommy Koh]], former Singaporean Ambassador to the [[United Nations]], called it a "timely and visionary initiative" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spp.nus.edu.sg/ips/docs/pub/pa_tk_ST_Yale-NUS%20a%20timely%20visionary%20initiative_150412.pdf |title=Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy |publisher=Spp.nus.edu.sg |date=15 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faculty expressed themselves in the pages of [[Yale Daily News]]. [[Seyla Benhabib]], a [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] at Yale, calling it a "naïve missionary sentiment," asked, "Do we need to go to Singapore to advance interdisciplinarity and a revival of the liberal arts?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/04/benhabib-whats-stake-yale-nus/ |last=Benhabib |first=Seyla |title=What's at stake at Yale-NUS |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817103617/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/04/benhabib-whats-stake-yale-nus/ |archivedate=17 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairs of the faculty search committee responded, "the new college will require faculty to rethink their pedagogical assumptions and to consider such innovations as integrated and interactive approaches to science; writing across the curriculum; computation, computer simulations and interpretation of large data sets; and the honing of quantitative, communication and other skills."&lt;ref name="bdl"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/feb/29/bailyn-davis-and-lewis-rethinking-liberal-arts/?print |last1=Bailyn |first1=Charles |last2=Davis |first2=Deborah |last3=Lewis |first3=Pericles |title=Rethinking liberal arts education |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Bloch]], a [[Sterling Professor|Sterling Professor of French]], said that "As a nexus between India, China and the West, Singapore’s location favors an important conceptual realignment of the humanities that will be a long time coming to the home campus in New Haven — that is, a synthesis of the ways that ideas and creative works of East and West intersect historically as well as conceptually with each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/19/bloch-why-i-yale-nus/ |last=Bloch |first=Howard |title=Why I like Yale-NUS |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=19 March 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of professors critical of the project characterize the endeavor of "globalizing" a "specious one," saying that the graduates "will have to be conformist, dissent-averse managers and executives who serve the global profit motive."&lt;ref name="bmyjr"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/21/letters-32112/ |last1=Miller |first1=Christopher |last2=Bers |first2=Victor |last3=Campbell |first3=Jill |last4=Rogers |first4=John |last5=Yiengpruksawan |first5=Mimi |title=LETTERS: 3.21.12 |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=6 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210072143/http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/21/letters-32112/ |archivedate=10 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvin Chun, the master of [[Berkeley College (Yale University)|Berkeley College]] and educated in South Korea, disagreed, asking "Will Yale-NUS be denied to numerous students around the world like me who lack the hyper-talent or mega-resources needed to study abroad at a place like Yale?"&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/05/chun-globalizing-the-academic-1-percent/ |last=Chun |first=Marvin |title= Globalizing the academic 1 percent |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are concerned that Yale-NUS would dilute the Yale name. For [[Michael J. Fischer|Michael Fischer]], professor of computer science, since Yale-NUS will not grant Yale degrees, the value of a Yale degree becomes diminished, and that the joint governing board does not "make Yale-NUS a part of Yale any more than does Levin's service on the board of directors for American Express make American Express a part of Yale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/mar/23/fischer-yale-nus-is-not-yale/ |last=Fischer |first=Michael |title=Yale-NUS is not Yale |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haun Saussy]] stated says that "It’s in the spirit of the motto "Lux et veritas" — my light is not diminished when my neighbor lights his candle at mine, and a truth becomes more powerful, not less, when it is shared." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/sep/14/saussy-when-elihu-meets-confucius/ |last=Saussy |first=Haun |title=When Elihu meets Confucius |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=14 September 2010 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spring 2012, the Yale College faculty passed a resolution stating, "We urge Yale-NUS to respect, protect and further principles of non-discrimination for all, including sexual minorities and migrant workers; and to uphold civil liberty and political freedom on campus and in the broader society".&lt;ref name="YDN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2012/apr/06/faculty-approve-yale-nus-resolution |last1=Gideon |first1=Gavan |last2=Woodford |first2=Antonia |title=Faculty approve Yale-NUS resolution |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer, prompted by a ''Wall Street Journal'' report that students would not be allowed to stage protests or form political parties, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that it disapproved such restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303933704577530524046581142 |last=Mahtani |first=Shibani |title=Yale-Singapore Venture to Forbid Political Protest - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=16 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/19/singapore-yale-curtail-rights-new-campus |title=Singapore: Yale to Curtail Rights on New Campus &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=19 July 2012 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Riady]], an Associate Professor of Law at the Pelita Harapan University in Indonesia, defended the venture, stating that "Singapore and Asia are in the middle of great transitions, and Yale has an opportunity to shape that process and put its stamp on a rising continent.

Barron's Magazine's article “Yale goes to Asia” highlighted how education experts such as Ben Nelson, CEO of the Minerva Project, particularly likes Yale-NUS’ emphasis on seminars and its requirement that all students in their first two years take pretty much the same core curriculum, including philosophy and political thought, literature and humanities, and modern social thought. In an article for The Atlantic, Michael Roth, President of Wesleyan University and author of ''Beyond the University: Why Liberal Education Matters'' write about how he was impressed by Yale-NUS’ decision to decline to institutionalize faculty within departments representing the academic disciplines. This has led to a re-conceptualization of majors as complements to a core curriculum, and, in turn, to the welcoming of faculty with diverse skill sets over those tethered to divisive academic specializations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/10/american-liberal-education-happens-better-in-singapore/410869/?single_page=true&amp;print|title=The Ironic Birth of Liberal-Arts Education in Asia|last=Roth|first=Michael|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5084">The '''Yamartino method''' is an algorithm for calculating an approximation of [[wind direction]] during a single pass through the incoming data.&lt;ref&gt;

==Background==
The standard deviation of wind direction is a measure of lateral [[turbulence]] and is used in a method for estimating the [[Air pollution dispersion terminology#The Pasquill atmospheric stability classes|Pasquill stability category]] in air pollution dispersion.

The simple method for calculating standard deviation requires two passes through the list of values. The first pass determines the average of those values; the second pass determines the sum of the squares of the differences between the values and the average. This double-pass method requires access to all values. A [[Standard deviation#Rapid calculation methods|single-pass method]] can be used for normal data but is unsuitable for [[Polar coordinate system|angular]] data such as wind direction where the 0°/360° (or ±180°) discontinuity forces special consideration. For example, the directions 1°, 0°, and 359° (or −1°) should not average to the direction 180°.

The Yamartino method, introduced by Robert J. Yamartino in 1984, solves both problems. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has chosen it as the preferred way to compute the standard deviation of wind direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/guidance/met/mmgrma.pdf Meteorological Monitoring Guidance for Regulatory Modeling Applications (section 6.2.1)]&lt;/ref&gt;
A further discussion of the Yamartino method, along with other methods of estimating the standard deviation of wind direction can be found in Farrugia &amp; Micallef.

It is possible to calculate the exact standard deviation in one pass. However, that method needs slightly more calculation effort.

==Algorithm==
Over the time interval to be averaged across, ''n'' measurements of wind direction (''θ'') will be made and two totals are accumulated without storage of the ''n'' individual values. At the end of the interval the calculations are as follows: with the average values of sin&amp;nbsp;''θ'' and cos&amp;nbsp;''θ'' defined as

:&lt;math&gt;s_a = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n \sin \theta_i,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_a = \frac 1 n \sum_{i=1}^n \cos \theta_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the average wind direction is given via the four-quadrant arctan(x,y) function as

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_a=\arctan(c_a,s_a).&lt;/math&gt;

From twenty different functions for ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; using variables obtained in a single-pass of the wind direction data, Yamartino found the best function to be

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_\theta = \arcsin (\varepsilon) \left[1+\left(\tfrac 2 {\sqrt 3} -1\right) \varepsilon^3\right], &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\sqrt{1-(s^2_a+c^2_a)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The key here is to remember that sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''θ'' + cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''θ'' = 1 so that for example, with a constant wind direction at any value of ''θ'', the value of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; will be zero, leading to a zero value for the standard deviation.
 
The use of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; alone produces a result close to that produced with a double-pass when the dispersion of angles is small (not crossing the discontinuity), but by construction it is always between 0 and 1.  Taking the [[arcsine]] then produces the double-pass answer when there are just two equally common angles: in the extreme case of an oscillating wind blowing backwards and forwards, it produces a result of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians, i.e. a [[right angle]].  The final factor adjusts this figure upwards so that it produces the double-pass result of &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt; radians for an almost uniform distribution of angles across all directions, while making minimal change to results for small dispersions.

The theoretical maximum error against the correct double-pass ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore about 15% with an oscillating wind. Comparisons against Monte Carlo generated cases indicate that Yamartino's algorithm is within 2% for more realistic distributions.

A variant might be to weight each wind direction observation by the wind speed at that time.

He is the Gershom Scholem Professor Emeritus of Kabbalah at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He is considered a leading scholar of [[Kabbalah]]; his other research interests include Jewish [[myth]], [[Sabbateans|Sabbateanism]], and the links between [[Judaism]] and [[ancient Greek religion]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. Author of many books and articles, his work is often cited by other scholars. He is the recipient of the 1997 [[Bialik Prize]], the 1999 Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research, the 2006 [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture| EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]], and the 2017 [[Israel Prize]].

==Early life and education==
Yehuda Liebes was born in [[Jerusalem]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; His father, [[:he:יוסף גרהרד ליבס|Joseph Gerhard Liebes]] (1910–1988), a noted Hebrew translator of classic literature, left his native Germany at the age of 18 to study at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He returned to his homeland to continue his education, but was expelled from his university due to the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. He then undertook agricultural training in [[Latvia]] with a Zionist movement. There he married his first wife, with whom he settled in [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Pardes Hanna]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] and had two daughters before they divorced. In 1941 Liebes married his second wife, Mira, a native of [[Riga]] who had grown up in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1250272|title=דמותו של פרופ' יהודה ליבס: חוקר קבלה שנוי במחלוקת ודתי ציוני|language=Hebrew|trans-title=Professor Yehuda Liebes: A Controversial Kabbalah Scholar and Religious Zionist|first=Dalia|last=Karpal|date=13 March 2009|accessdate=5 January 2017|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, a daughter (Tamar, today head of the Department of Communications at Hebrew University) and a son (Yehuda).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; On his mother's side, Yehuda was a cousin of Israeli intellectual [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; 

Liebes was acquainted with [[Gershom Scholem]], the father of modern Kabbalah scholarship, from an early age, as his parents were friends of Scholem. Scholem attended Yehuda's [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] and gave him as a gift [[:he:ישעיה תשבי|Yeshayahu Tishby]]'s book ''Mishnat HaZohar'' ("The Wisdom of the [[Zohar]]").&lt;ref name=musaf/&gt;
 
[[File:Scholem card catalog.jpg|125px|left|thumb|[[Gershom Scholem]]'s card catalog]]
Liebes graduated from the [[Hebrew University Secondary School]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; In 1965, he enlisted in the [[Paratroopers Brigade]] for his [[Conscription in Israel|compulsory army service]], and in 1967, served in the [[Six-Day War]] as a non-commissioned officer.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; During [[Reserve duty (Israel)|reserve duty]] in 1969, he was injured during a Palestinian attack on his post in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], lost several teeth, and was hospitalized for several months.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

In 1967, Liebes began his studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; After earning undergraduate and graduate degrees, he pursued his doctoral research under Scholem.&lt;ref name=alan/&gt;&lt;ref name=card&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/collections/jewish-collection/scholem/scholem-card-catalog/Pages/Scholem-Prologue.aspx|title= Gershom Scholem's Milon HaZohar Card Index|first=Yehuda|last=Liebes|publisher=[[National Library of Israel]]|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholem gave Liebes access to handwritten note cards he had prepared for a lexicon of [[Zohar]] terminology that he never wrote,&lt;ref name=card/&gt; and Liebes submitted his dissertation on ''Peraḳim be-milon sefer ha-Zohar'' (Chapters in the Dictionary of the Book of the Zohar) (1976).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Teaching career==
Liebes began lecturing in the Hebrew University's Department of Jewish Thought in 1971.

 |quote=I do not really like the term 'Jewish mysticism'. The order of the words is not correct. You have to say 'mystical Judaism', because Kabbalah is first and foremost an interpretation of an aspect of the Jewish religion. … The inclusion of all mystical phenomena under the heading 'mysticism' is a mistake, because it causes people to think everything is the same—Christian mysticism, Jewish mysticism, Muslim mysticism. The Kabbalah is an interpretation of the Jewish religion, of [[Torah]] and [[Mitzva|mitzvot]], of the people and the land of Israel".

Liebes has also translated Greek, Latin, and Arabic religious poetry into Hebrew.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Controversial views==
Challenging the traditional ascription of the Zohar to the 2nd-century disciples of [[Shimon bar Yochai]] in [[Israel]], Liebes asserts that a group of 13th-century Spanish Kabbalists, which included [[Moses de León]], composed the work, each reflecting his own approach to Kabbalah.&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; Liebes claims that the ''Ketem Paz'' on the Zohar and the Kabbalistic hymn ''[[Bar Yochai (song)|Bar Yochai]]'' were written by two different authors with similar names, not the one [[Shimon Lavi]] who is traditionally credited with authoring both works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/nlis/he/Song/pages/Articles/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8_%D7%A8'_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90.aspx |title= ר' שמעון לביא |language=Hebrew|trans-title=Rabbi Shimon Lavi|publisher=[[National Library of Israel]]|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebes also finds Christian and Sabbatean inspiration in the ideas of Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]]&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; and, at the same time, Sabbatean influences on the disciples of the Vilna Gaon [[Misnagdim|who opposed Hasidism]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Liebes angered [[Religious Zionism|National Religious]] Jews in Israel when he claimed to find a Christian allusion in the [[Amidah]], the central prayer of the [[Jewish prayer|Jewish liturgy]]. Liebes asserted that the conclusion of the 14th blessing, "''keren yeshua''" ("horn of salvation") refers not to [[David]], but to [[Jesus]] (''Yeshua'' in Hebrew).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Liebes publishes in Hebrew and has expressed opposition to the study of Jewish thought in English. He has allowed only a few of his works to be translated into English, in conjunction with his academic degree and tenure.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Liebes received the 1997 [[Bialik Prize]] for his book ''The Secret of the Sabbatean Faith'' (1995).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; In 1999 he received the Peace Prize for the study of Kabbalah&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; and the Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academy.ac.il/RichText/GeneralPage.aspx?nodeId=1079|title=Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research|publisher=[[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 2006 [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture| EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]], in the category of Humanities, for his work on Sabbateanism.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.emetprize.org/laureates/humanities/jewish-philosophy/prof-yehuda-liebes/|title=Emet Prize Laureates|publisher=Emet Prize for Science, Art and Culture|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he received the [[Israel Prize]] for his work on Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/380233|title=Israel Prize for Kaballah to Professor Yehuda Liebes|date=5 February 2017|accessdate=21 January 2018|work=[[Arutz Sheva|Israel National News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Liebes and his wife Esther have three children. In 1977, after he completed his doctorate, they joined the nucleus of the new community of [[Shilo, Mateh Binyamin|Shilo]], living in a caravan near [[Ofra]], but left after nine months.&lt;ref name=musaf/&gt; The couple resides in the [[Kiryat Moshe]] neighborhood of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; Esther formerly worked as librarian of the Gershom G. Scholem Collection at the Hebrew University Library.&lt;ref name=musaf/&gt;

Liebes identifies politically with the [[Right-wing politics|extreme right]] and religiously with [[Religious Zionism]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;
