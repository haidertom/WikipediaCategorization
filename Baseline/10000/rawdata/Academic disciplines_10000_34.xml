== Content ==
The title offers a multimedia exploration of private collections of [[postimpressionist]] [[painting]]s. It depicts the story of Dr. Barnes and his collection through virtual galleries, timelines, and documents.&lt;ref&gt;http://besser.tsoa.nyu.edu/impact/w95/RN/mar3news/Merc-news-drbarnes&lt;/ref&gt; The title includes three guided tours through the content, based on different themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2rK8GDDQbTYC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=%22A+Passion+for+Art:+Renoir,+Cezanne,+Matisse,+and+Dr.+Barnes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YCIKSVayY4&amp;sig=Wm_Q0xAs_-FkpJtpk74SnIRZ0IM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOyODZrMnaAhVBlJQKHX_tBi04ChDoAQhSMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Passion%20for%20Art:%20Renoir,%20Cezanne,%20Matisse,%20and%20Dr.%20Barnes%22&amp;f=false|title=PC Mag|last=Inc|first=Ziff Davis|date=1996-09-24|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aerenchyma''' is a spongy tissue that forms spaces or air channels in the leaves, stems and roots of some plants, which allows exchange of gases between the shoot and the root.&lt;ref&gt;Sculthorpe, C. D. 1967. The Biology of Aquatic Vascular Plants. Reprinted 1985 Edward Arnold, by London.&lt;/ref&gt; The channels of air-filled cavities (see image to right) provide a low-resistance internal pathway for the exchange of gases such as oxygen and ethylene between the plant above the water and the submerged tissues. Aerenchyma is also widespread in aquatic and wetland plants which must grow in hypoxic soils.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kozlowski, T. T. (ed.) 1984. Flooding and Plant Growth. Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aerenchyma formation and hypoxia ==

When soil is flooded, [[Hypoxia_(environmental)|hypoxia]] develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of [[wetlands]]. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes.&lt;ref&gt;Dacey, J. W. H. 1980. Internal winds in water lilies: an adaptation for life in anaerobic sediments. Science 210: 1017–19.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia.  For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, W. H., Jr. and Reddy, C. N. 1978. Chemical changes in rice soils. In Soils and Rice, pp. 361–79. Los Ban˜ os, Philippines: International Rice Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the [[Parenchyma#In plants|parenchyma]].

In general, low oxygen stimulates trees and plants to produce [[ethylene]].&lt;ref&gt;Kozlowski, T. T. (ed.) 1984. Flooding and Plant Growth. Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethylene slows down primary and adventitious root elongation and formation.

== Advantages of aerenchyma ==

The large air-filled cavities provide a low-resistance internal pathway for the exchange of gases between the plant organs above the water and the submerged tissues. This allows plants to grow without incurring the metabolic costs of anaerobic respiration.&lt;ref&gt;Laing, H. E. 1940. Respiration of the rhizomes of Nuphar advenum and other water plants. American Journal of Botany 27: 574–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the oxygen transported through the aerenchyma leaks through root pores into the surrounding soil. The resulting small [[rhizosphere]] of oxygenated soil around individual roots support microorganisms that prevent the influx of potentially toxic soil components such as [[sulfide]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]].

==Role in Gravity Sensing==
[[File:Plastids types en.svg|thumb|A diagram showing the different types of plastids]]
Amyloplasts are thought to play a vital role in [[gravitropism]]. Statoliths, a specialized starch-accumulating amyloplast, are denser than [[cytoplasm]], and are able to settle to the bottom of the gravity-sensing cell, called a [[statocyte]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morita|first=Miyo Terao|date=2010-06-02|title=Directional Gravity Sensing in Gravitropism|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092042|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=705–720|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092042|issn=1543-5008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This settling is a vital mechanism in the plant's perception of gravity, triggering the asymmetrical distribution of [[auxin]] that causes the curvature in roots and stems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tasaka|first=M.|last2=Kato|first2=T.|last3=Fukaki|first3=H.|date=1999-03-01|title=The endodermis and shoot gravitropism|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10322541|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=4|issue=3|pages=103–107|issn=1360-1385|pmid=10322541}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morita|first=Miyo Terao|last2=Tasaka|first2=Masao|date=2004-12|title=Gravity sensing and signaling|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15491921|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|volume=7|issue=6|pages=712–718|doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2004.09.001|issn=1369-5266|pmid=15491921}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plant lacking in [[phosphoglucomutase]] (pgm), for example, is a starchless mutant plant, thus preventing the settling of the statoliths.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiss|first=John Z.|last2=Wright|first2=Jonathan B.|last3=Caspar|first3=Timothy|date=1996-06|title=Gravitropism in roots of intermediate-starch mutants of Arabidopsis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1399-3054.1996.970205.x|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|language=en|volume=97|issue=2|pages=237–244|doi=10.1034/j.1399-3054.1996.970205.x|issn=0031-9317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mutant shows a significantly weaker gravitropic response as compared to a non-mutant plant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toyota|first=Masatsugu|last2=Ikeda|first2=Norifumi|last3=Sawai-Toyota|first3=Satoe|last4=Kato|first4=Takehide|last5=Gilroy|first5=Simon|last6=Tasaka|first6=Masao|last7=Morita|first7=Miyo Terao|date=2013-11|title=Amyloplast displacement is necessary for gravisensing in Arabidopsis shoots as revealed by a centrifuge microscope|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24004104|journal=The Plant Journal: For Cell and Molecular Biology|volume=76|issue=4|pages=648–660|doi=10.1111/tpj.12324|issn=1365-313X|pmid=24004104}}&lt;/ref&gt; A normal gravitropic response can be rescued with hypergravity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In roots, gravity is sensed in the [[root cap]], a section of tissue at the very tip of the root. Upon removal of the root cap, the root looses its ability to sense gravity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, if the root cap is regrown, the root's gravitropic response will recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=Henry|last2=Wain|first2=R.

Seedlings to White Light and to Gravity|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23371730|journal=Planta|volume=123|issue=3|pages=217–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In roots, the asymmetrical distribution of auxin causes the root to grow along the gravity vector.

In stems, gravity is sensed in the [[Endodermis|endodermal cells]] of the shoots.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Unlike roots, the differential distribution of [[auxin]] causes stems to grow against the gravity vector.

The '''Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory''' ('''AOML'''), a federal research laboratory, is part of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR), located in Miami, Florida. AOML's research spans [[tropical cyclone]] and hurricanes, [[coastal ecosystem]]s, oceans and human health, [[Climatology|climate studies]], global carbon systems, and ocean observations. It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NOAA Research Laboratories |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/NOAAResearchLaboratories.aspx |accessdate = 2014-04-26 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AOML’s organizational structure consists of an Office of the Director and three scientific research divisions. The Office of the Director oversees the Laboratory’s scientific programs, as well as its financial, administrative, computer, outreach/education, and facility management services. Research programs are augmented by the [[Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies]] (CIMAS), a joint enterprise with the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. CIMAS enables AOML and university scientists to collaborate on research areas of mutual interest and facilitates the participation of students and visiting scientists. 

The Laboratory is a member of a unique community of marine research and educational institutions located on [[Virginia Key]] in Miami, Florida. Approximately $150M per year is invested in marine science and education among the University of Miami's [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]], NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Science Center, the [[Miami Seaquarium]], the [[Maritime and Science Technology Academy]] (MAST Academy).

==History==
The deeper roots of AOML can be traced to the oceanographic investigations of the U.S. Coast Survey beginning in the mid-19th century under the direction of Professor [[Alexander Dallas Bache]], great grandson of Benjamin Franklin and a preeminent U.S. science figure of the age. In subsequent decades, the urgency of charting coastal waters in support of growing commerce, a task increased by the acquisition of Alaska, Hawaii, and other island territories, came to require all the resources of the Coast Survey.
 
The modern era can be considered to have begun during the 1960s. In early 1966, an Institute for Oceanography was created, primarily from research groups of the then [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA, forerunner of NOAA). The following year the Institute was relocated to Miami for a variety of reasons, including the presence already in Miami of meteorological research groups of ESSA dedicated to hurricane research, and air-sea interaction was a hot topic of the time in weather research.
 
All of these groups were reorganized as the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratories (AOML) and by 1973 took occupancy in the new laboratory constructed on Virginia Key.
 
Emphasis at AOML continues to be on making and interpreting observations of the ocean and atmosphere from ships, buoys, and research aircraft. The motivation and objectives of our research is continually evolving, however. In the beginning, study of the geology, geophysics, and sedimentation of the sea floor was the largest activity of the Laboratory, but it has diminished to a smaller part of ecosystem research. Research in response to concerns for marine environmental quality and large-scale physics and chemistry of the oceans related to climate variation and global change have supplemented the original themes. Research into the nature and mechanisms of hurricanes has been and is also expected to continue as a major theme in view of the importance of this natural hazard to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States.
 
New projects include expansion of the use of satellite and locally operated remote sensing techniques to enhance the coverage and detail of observations. Outreach via electronic communication is enabling AOML to  serve a larger constituency with access to oceanographic and meteorological observations.

==Research==
AOML conducts mission oriented scientific research that seeks to understand the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and processes of the ocean and atmosphere, both separately and as a coupled system. The Laboratory’s research themes (oceans and climate, coastal ecosystems, and hurricanes and [[tropical meteorology]]) employ a cross-disciplinary approach, conducted through collaborative interactions with national and international research and environmental forecasting institutions. More information about AOML's research can be found at [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/research/ http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/research].

===Oceans and its link to extreme weather and climate===
AOML carries out interdisciplinary scientific investigations of the physics of ocean currents and water properties, and on the role of the ocean in climate, extreme weather events, and ecosystems. The tools used to carry out these studies range from sensors on deep ocean moorings to satellite-based instruments to measurements made on research and commercial shipping vessels and autonomous vehicles, and include data analysis and numerical modeling as well as theoretical approaches  (http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod).
 
AOML manages, leads, or participate in the design, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of several key components of the global ocean observing system and, with these and other data, conducts research in several areas including:
* [[Meridional Overturning Circulation]]
* Tropical Atlantic variability
* Oceans and extreme weather (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, etc.)
* [[Physical oceanography]]
* Oceans and ecosystems
* Global carbon cycle
* Research to Applications and Operations
* Development of oceanographic instrumentation

===Coastal ecosystems===
Coastal and regional ecosystem research has been a focus of AOML activities for more than two decades. Current interdisciplinary field efforts include physical, biological, and chemical studies supporting the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (SFER) effort and the underlying health of this ecosystem to the regional Intra-Americas Sea program, as well as the status and health of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.

Coastal Ecosystem related research projects:
* Global carbon cycle
* [[Climate change]]
* Coastal pollution
* Fishing effects
* Physical oceanography of [[coral reef]]s
* Coral health and monitoring program
* Petroleum and oil spill research
* Marine and Estuarine Goal Setting for South Florida (MARES) Project

===Hurricanes and tropical meteorology===
Tropical meteorology research at AOML is focused on advancing the understanding and prediction of hurricanes and other tropical weather. Scientists conduct their research utilizing a combination of models, theories, and observations, with particular emphasis on data obtained with research aircraft in the inner core of tropical cyclones and their surrounding environment.

Hurricanes and tropical meteorology related research projects:
* [[Tropical cyclone track forecasting|Track forecasting]]
* Hurricane intensity change
* [[Climate variation]]
* Hurricane impacts
* Administrative projects

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5970">{{distinguish|Backward chaining (applied behavior analysis)|Back-chaining}}
'''Backward chaining''' (or '''backward reasoning''') is an [[inference]] method described colloquially as working backward from the goal. It is used in [[automated theorem prover]]s, [[inference engine]]s, [[proof assistant]]s, and other [[artificial intelligence]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feigenbaum|first=Edward|title=The Rise of the Expert Company|year=1988|publisher=Times Books|isbn=0-8129-1731-6|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[game theory]], researchers apply it to (simpler) [[subgame]]s to find a solution to the game, in a process called ''[[backward induction]]''. In chess, it is called [[retrograde analysis]], and it is used to generate table bases for [[chess endgame]]s for [[computer chess]].

Backward chaining is implemented in [[logic programming]] by [[SLD resolution]]. Both rules are based on the [[modus ponens]] inference rule. It is one of the two most commonly used methods of [[reasoning]] with [[inference rule]]s and [[Logical consequence|logical implications]] – the other is [[forward chaining]]. Backward chaining systems usually employ a [[depth-first search]] strategy, e.g. [[Prolog]].&lt;ref name="CheinMugnier2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michel Chein|author2=Marie-Laure Mugnier|title=Graph-based knowledge representation: computational foundations of conceptual graphs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iz3y6WK2EMEC&amp;pg=PA297|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-84800-285-2|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==

Backward chaining starts with a list of [[goal]]s (or a [[hypothesis]]) and works backwards from the [[consequent]] to the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] to see if any [[data]] supports any of these consequents.&lt;ref name="Norwig Definition"/&gt; An [[inference engine]] using backward chaining would search the [[inference]] rules until it finds one with a consequent ('''Then''' clause) that matches a desired goal. If the antecedent ('''If''' clause) of that rule is known to be true, then it is added to the list of goals (for one's goal to be confirmed one must also provide data that confirms this new rule).

For example, suppose a new pet, Fritz, is delivered in an opaque box along with two facts about Fritz:
* Fritz croaks
* Fritz eats flies
The goal is to decide whether Fritz is green, based on a [[rule base]] containing the following four rules:

[[File:Backward Chaining Frog Color Example.png|upright=0.56|thumb|alt=An Example of Backward Chaining.|An Example of Backward Chaining.]]

# '''If''' X croaks and X eats flies – '''Then''' X is a frog
# '''If''' X chirps and X sings – '''Then''' X is a canary
# '''If''' X is a frog – '''Then''' X is green
# '''If''' X is a canary – '''Then''' X is yellow

With backward reasoning, an inference engine can determine whether Fritz is green in four steps.  To start, the query is phrased as a goal assertion that is to be proved: "Fritz is green".

1. Fritz is substituted for X in rule #3 to see if its consequent matches the goal, so rule #3 becomes:
  '''If''' Fritz is a frog – '''Then''' Fritz is green
Since the consequent matches the goal ("Fritz is green"), the rules engine now needs to see if the antecedent ("If Fritz is a frog") can be proved.  The antecedent therefore becomes the new goal:
  Fritz is a frog

2. Again substituting Fritz for X, rule #1 becomes:
  '''If''' Fritz croaks and Fritz eats flies – '''Then''' Fritz is a frog
Since the consequent matches the current goal ("Fritz is a frog"), the inference engine now needs to see if the antecedent ("If Fritz croaks and eats flies") can be proved.  The antecedent therefore becomes the new goal:
  Fritz croaks and Fritz eats flies

3. Since this goal is a conjunction of two statements, the inference engine breaks it into two sub-goals, both of which must be proved:
  Fritz croaks
  Fritz eats flies

4. To prove both of these sub-goals, the inference engine sees that both of these sub-goals were given as initial facts.  Therefore, the conjunction is true:
  Fritz croaks and Fritz eats flies
therefore the antecedent of rule #1 is true and the consequent must be true:
  Fritz is a frog
therefore the antecedent of rule #3 is true and the consequent must be true:
  Fritz is green

This derivation therefore allows the inference engine to prove that Fritz is green.  Rules #2 and #4 were not used.

Note that the goals always match the affirmed versions of the consequents of implications (and not the negated versions as in [[modus tollens]]) and even then, their antecedents are then considered as the new goals (and not the conclusions as in [[affirming the consequent]]), which ultimately must match known facts (usually defined as consequents whose antecedents are always true); thus, the inference rule used is [[modus ponens]].

Because the list of goals determines which rules are selected and used, this method is called [[goal-oriented|goal-driven]], in contrast to [[Data science|data-driven]] [[forward chaining|forward-chaining]] inference. The backward chaining approach is often employed by [[expert systems]].

Programming languages such as [[Prolog]], [[Knowledge Machine]] and [[ECLiPSe]] support backward chaining within their inference engines.&lt;ref name="Programming Languages"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7888">The '''Bem Sex-Role Inventory''' ('''BSRI''')&lt;!--Keep capitalized words capitalized--&gt; is a measure of [[gender expression]] and [[gender role]]s, put in terms of [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]]. It assesses how people identify themselves [[Psychology|psychologically]]. [[Sandra Bem]]'s goal of the BSRI was to examine psychological [[androgyny]] and provide [[empirical]] evidence to show the advantage of a shared masculine and feminine [[personality]] versus a sex-typed categorization.&lt;ref name="American Psychologist"&gt;American Psychologist (1977) "Sandra Lipsitz Bem: Early Career Award." ''American Psychologist'' (32)88-89&lt;/ref&gt; The test is formatted with 60 different [[Trait theory|personality traits]] which participants rate themselves based on a 7-point [[Likert scale]]. Traits are evenly dispersed, 20 masculine, 20 feminine, and 20 filler traits thought to be gender neutral.&lt;ref name="Bem"&gt;Bem &amp; Sandra Lipsitz (1981) "Bem Sex-Role Inventory" ''Mental Measurements Yearbook with Tests in Print'', (9)&lt;/ref&gt; All traits in the BSRI are positively valued personality aspects.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, Aldora (1982) "Psychological Androgyny and Social Desirability" ''Journal of Personality Assessment'', (46)147&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous past studies have found that gender categorizations are [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with many stereotypical gendered behaviors.&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

==History==
"In the field of psychology, much research is conducted involving individuals' perceptions of gender roles, and behavioral as well as attitudinal correlates.  Gender roles may be defined as "expectations about what is appropriate behavior for each sex".  One can also add to this definition the expectations which are held about appropriate personality characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cheryl L. Holt|author2=Jon. B. Ellis |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1018836923919#page-2 |title=Assessing the Current Validity of the Bem Sex-Role Inventory  |date=1998-12-01 |accessdate=2013-11-01 |doi=10.1023/A:1018836923919 |volume=39 |journal=Sex Roles |pages=929–941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bem Sex-Role Inventory was created by [[Sandra Bem]] in an effort to measure androgyny. It was published in 1974. Stereotypical masculine and feminine traits were found by surveying 100 Stanford undergraduate students on which traits they found to be socially desirable for each sex.&lt;ref name="Bem" /&gt; The original list of 200 traits was narrowed down to the 40 masculine and feminine traits that appear on the present test.&lt;ref name="Gaa"&gt;Gaa, John P. &amp; Liberman, Dov. (1980) "Response Tendency on the Bem Sex-Role Inventory." ''The Journal of Psychology''. (2)259&lt;/ref&gt; Normative data was found from a 1973 sample for 444 males and 279 females and a 1978 sample of 340 females and 476 males all also from [[Stanford University]] undergraduates.&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

==Scoring and interpretation==
Participants are asked to rate themselves on each trait using a Likert scale. One indicates never or almost never true, while a seven would indicate always or almost always true.&lt;ref name="Gaa"/&gt; Originally androgyny was calculated by finding the [[T-statistic|t-ratio]] difference between masculine and feminine scores; however, in 1981 Bem advises users to utilize a split [[median]] technique for more accurate scoring.&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

The Bem Sex-Role Inventory offers four different possible resulting categorizations: masculine, feminine, androgynous and undifferentiated. Previously, an androgynous score was thought to be the result of equal masculine and feminine traits, while a sex-typed masculine or feminine score is the result of more traits belonging in one or the other category.The fourth type of score, undifferentiated, was seen as the result of extremely low masculine and feminine traits.

However, after the change in scoring technique, androgynous is the result of scoring above the median in both masculine and feminine categories. Sex-typed scores, masculine and feminine, are the result of scoring above the median in one gender and below the median in the other. An undifferentiated score is now a result of scoring below the median in both masculine and feminine categories. In other words, since scores are based on normative data, an androgynous classification occurs when a subject scores above 50% of the comparison group in both masculine and feminine categories, while a sex-typed classification is the result of scoring above half the comparison group in only one gender category.&lt;ref name="Sedney"&gt;Sedney, Mars Anne (1981) "Comments on Median Split Procedures for Scoring Androgyny Measures." ''Sex Roles'' (7)217&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability and validity==
The BSRI is very empirically sound. Bem reports [[Cronbach's alpha|coefficient alphas]] of .78 for femininity scales and .87 for the masculinity scale. BSRI, also has demonstrated high [[Repeatability|test-retest reliability]].&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

However, since this is a [[self-report inventory]], how reliable the assessment is depends on how accurately participants rate themselves. An androgynous score is the result of extremely masculine and feminine scores and an undifferentiated score is the result of extremely low masculine and feminine scores. It has been theorized that perhaps tendencies to rate oneself extremely low and extremely high on traits can affect a subjects' resulting gender placement.&lt;ref name="Gaa"/&gt;

The degree of [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] of each scoring technique is up for debate. When comparing the old t ratio scoring to the newly endorsed median split technique, 42.3% of participants had a different resulting categorization. Since the median split method bases scores more heavily on the normative data of that population, a participant can be categorized differently based on the population of subjects they take the test with. For example, results may differ if the test was administered to a group of marines versus students at a private girls highschool. This challenges the test's between sample reliability.&lt;ref name="Sedney"/&gt; As stated by Elazae Pedhazur in a clip from his critique, "Bem concludes her discussion by stating, 'Finally, we urge investigators to further analyze their data without categorizing individual subjects in any way, i.e., through the use of multiple regression technique.' While endorsing what appears to be a suggestion to conduct studies within the framework of trait-treatment interactions, one cannot help wondering: Where has androgyny gone?"&lt;ref&gt;Pedhazur, Elazae. "Bem Sex Role Inventory: A Theoretical and Methodological Critique." Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (1979): 996-1016. EBSCOhost. Web. 13 Oct. 2013. &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=ca8d7727-86ea-47e2-a191-8f083f23dcd3%40sessionmgr111&amp;hid=103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=1980-29271-001&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bem Sex-Role Inventory (short form)==
The short form of the BSRI consists of 30 items. It has a strong .90 correlation with the original BSRI. This short form of the test allows for increased [[internal consistency]]. Bem reports similar masculinity coefficient alphas and higher femininity coefficient alphas with this form. The short form discards the traits "feminine", "masculine", and "athletic" from the self-report scales. Specifically, the short form removed some feminine traits that could be seen as less socially desirable such as "gullible" and "childlike". Masculine categories depict "assertive-dominance" and "instrumentality", while feminine categories depict "nurtureness-interpersonal warmth" and "expressiveness".&lt;ref name="Bem"/&gt;

A '''bioregion''' is an [[ecology|ecologically]] and geographically defined area that is smaller than an [[ecozone]], but larger than an [[ecoregion]] or an [[ecosystem]], in the [[World Wildlife Fund]] classification scheme. There is also an attempt to use the term in a rank-less generalist sense, similar to the terms "biogeographic area" or "biogeographic unit".&lt;ref&gt;Vilhena, D., Antonelli, A. (2015). A network approach for identifying and delimiting biogeographical regions. ''Nature Communications'' 6, 6848, [http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7848].&lt;/ref&gt;

It may be conceptually similar to an [[ecoprovince]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecozones.ca/english/levels.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also differently used in the [[environmentalist]] context, being coined by Berg and Dasmann (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Berg, P. and Dasmann, R. (1977). Reinhabiting California. ''The Ecologist'' 7 (10): 399-401.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, K. 1999. What is bioregional planning?. In: R. Crofts, E. Maltby, R. Smith and L. Maclean (eds).

==WWF bioregions==
{{Main|Global 200}}
The WWF scheme further subdivides the ecozones into bioregions, defined as "geographic clusters of [[ecoregions]] that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)." The WWF bioregions are as follows:{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

'''Braille music''' is a [[Braille code]] that allows music to be notated using [[Braille]] cells so music can be read by visually impaired musicians.  The Braille music system was originally developed by [[Louis Braille]].

[[File:Braille cell.svg|thumb|Braille cell, 2 dots wide by 3 dots high]]Braille music uses the same six-position [[Braille cell]] as literary braille.  However braille music assigns a separate meaning to each braille symbol or group of symbols different from literary braille and has its own syntax and abbreviations.

Almost anything that can be written in print music notation can be written in braille music notation.  However, braille music notation is an independent and well-developed system with its own conventions.

The world's largest collection of braille music is located at the National Library for the Blind in Stockport, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nlb-online.org/mod.php?mod%3Duserpage%26menu%3D130002%26page_id%3D50 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313234416/http://www.nlb-online.org/mod.php?mod=userpage&amp;menu=130002&amp;page_id=50 |archivedate=2005-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning Braille music ==
Braille music is in general neither easier nor more difficult to learn than print music. Visually impaired musicians gain the same benefits upon learning to read braille music as sighted musicians who learn to read print music. Visually impaired musicians can begin learning braille music about the time they have reasonable competence reading literary Braille.

== Teaching Braille music ==
Braille music for beginners, like print music for beginners, is quite simple.  Music teachers with no previous knowledge of braille music can easily learn the rudiments of braille music notation and keep a step or two ahead of the student who is learning braille music.  Some common print method books are available in braille so a sighted teacher can use a print version and the visually impaired student braille version or the other way around.

== Transcribing music into Braille ==
Much commonly used music has been transcribed into braille.  In the U.S. this is available from the National Library Service (NLS) of the Library of Congress (free for qualified individuals) and through other sources.  Most countries have a national library similar to the NLS.

However, many visually impaired musicians require a good deal of music that has never before been transcribed.  In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and many other countries, there is a network of braille music transcribers who can transcribe such music.

Another option is to use a computer-music system.  Such systems typically allow a user to enter music into a computerized music notation program.  The software then automatically converts the print notation into braille. One such software program is called Goodfeel. The visually impaired individual can enter music notation within the Lime program, which has been scripted so the process of music entry is accessible. Then this file can be imported into Goodfeel which converts the music into a Braille file that can be exported to a Braille embosser or read on a portable Braille display.

== Introduction to Braille music symbols and syntax ==
Some of the most common braille music symbols and combinations are summarized in the chart below:

[[File:braillemusicsummary.gif|Braille Music Summary Graphic]]

=== Pitch and rhythm ===
As the "Notes" section of the music braille chart above indicates, a single symbol shows both the pitch and rhythmic length of a note.  For instance, dots 1,4,5 indicate an eighth note (or 128th note) C. Every rhythm symbol in braille music does double duty—8th notes and 128th notes use the same symbols, as do quarter notes and 64th notes, half notes and 32nd notes, and whole notes and 16th notes.  Beginners first learn the most common rhythmic value (8th, quarter, half, and whole notes).  For advanced users there is never rhythmic ambiguity because the context, including time signature and bar lines, makes the intended rhythmic value clear.  For instance, in a measure of 4/4 time that includes only the symbol with dots 1,3,4 (whole or 16th rest), context says the symbol must indicate a whole rest.

=== Octave marks ===
An octave mark is included before a note symbol to specify the octave of the note.  For instance, the 4th Octave is the octave starting with middle C and going up to the B above middle C. Octaves are only specified when needed.  For instance, a melody proceeding upward from the first octave can, if moving by step, proceed to the second, third, and fourth octaves without requiring additional octave signs. The rule is that, in the absence of an octave mark specifying otherwise, notes move by a unison, 2nd, or 3rd rather than a 6th, 7th, or octave.  For instance, the following moves upward continuously, ending in octave 5:

:Octave 2 C C D E F G A B C D E F G A B C D E F G A B B C C

The rule for 4ths and 5ths is different, however: in the absence of an octave sign specifying otherwise, a melodic leap of a 4th or 5th will stay within the same octave as the previous note.  For instance, the following always stays within Octave 2:

:Octave 2 C G D A E B F C G D A E

Because of the use of octave marks, clef symbols are not required in braille music.  On occasion, clef symbols (bass clef, treble clef, or other) will be indicated so the visually impaired musician will be aware of every detail of the print score.

=== Musical markings ===
Musical indications like "dim", "cresc", or "rit" are inserted inline with the note and rhythm notation and, to differentiate them from note, octave, and other musical signs, always preceded by the "word sign" (dots 3,4,5).

Slurs may be indicated by a slur sign between two notes or bracket slur surrounding a group of notes to be slurred.

Musical signs such as staccato or tenuto are generally placed before the note or chord they affect.  The musical signs shown on the chart are shown modifying a quarter note C (dots 1,4,5,6).

"Music hyphen" is used to indicate that a measure will be continued on the following line (this happens somewhat more often in braille music than in print music).

A "word apostrophe" indicates that the word will be continued on the following line.

=== Repetition symbols ===
Braille music tends to be rather bulky.  Because of this, a system of repetition symbols—much more extensive than that in print music—is employed to reduce page turns, size of scores, and expense of printing.

The repetition symbol (dots 2,3,5,6) is used similarly to the musical repetition symbol [[File:Repetition symbol.jpg]] to indicate that a beat, half measure, or full measure is to be repeated.

In addition, braille music often includes instructions such as "repeat measure 2 here" or "repeat measures 5-7 here".  Such indications are in addition to the commonly used repeat marks and first and second endings.

=== Contrapuntal lines and chords within a staff ===
Unlike print music notation, braille music is a linear format.  Therefore, certain conventions must be used to indicate [[contrapuntal]] lines and chords, situations where more than one note is played simultaneously within a staff.

==== In-accords ====
Independent contrapuntal lines within a staff are indicated via whole- or part-measure in-accords.  The first of the contrapuntal lines is given, then the second, enclosed by the in-accord symbols.  The in-accord symbols indicate that the two lines are to be played simultaneously.

==== Interval notation ====
Homophonic chordal sections are written using interval notation.  For instance, the notation "quarter-note-C, 3rd, 5th" would indicate playing a C along with the notes a 3rd and 5th higher than C, making a chord C-E-G a quarter note in length. Reading the interval notation is somewhat complicated by the fact that some staves use bottom-up notation (the bottom note of each chord is specified and intervals are read upwards from the given note) and some use top-down notation (the top note of each chord is specified and intervals are read downwards from the given note). The modern convention is to specify the main note (either the bass line or melody line) and let the intervals go up or down from there as appropriate.  For instance, in most piano music the left hand specifies the bottom note and intervals go bottom-up while the right hand specifies the top note and intervals go top-down. Many older scores have all staves reading bottom-up or all reading top-down. Most scores have a note indicating the direction of the interval notation.  However, in some older scores the direction must be established from the context. By convention, in-accords are given in the same direction as the interval notation. Thus, examining the in-accords is one way to establish whether the interval notation on a particular staff is bottom-up or top-down.

=== Dealing with different staves ===
Printed music is often written on several different staves.  For instance, piano music is typically written on two different staves combined into the [[grand staff]]: one for treble clef and one for bass clef, while choral music often has four different staves (one each for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass).  The notes in different staves that play simultaneously are aligned vertically. Because of the linear nature of braille music and the fact that the blind musician can typically read only one staff at a time, multiple staves are handled in several ways depending on the complexity of the music and other considerations. ''Bar over bar format'' is most similar to print music.  Simple piano music in bar over bar format is quite similar to print music, with right-hand notation on the top line and left-hand notation on the bottom line.  Some degree of vertical alignment between the right and left hands is maintained. Other ways of dealing with multiple-staff music are ''line over line format'', [http://www.brl.org/music/code/bmb/chap29/index.html ''section by section format''], ''paragraph style'', and ''bar by bar format''.  As a rule these formats take up less space on the page but require more of the musician in working out how to fit the staves together. For instance, in a piano score notated in section by section format, the right-hand part may be written out for the first 8 measures, followed by the left-hand part.  No attempt is made to align the parts. The same procedure is followed for measures 9-16, and so on, section by section, throughout the score. The blind musician learns and memorizes one section right hand alone, then left hand alone, then works out the hands together by memory and referencing various spots in the braille score to work out how the sections fit together. A note from the transcriber often clarifies the format used.  However, with many older and more complex scores the format must be determined by examination of the music and context.

== Variations in Braille music ==
Over the years and in the many different countries, a variety of minor differences in braille music practice have arisen.  Some countries have preferred a different standard for interval or staff notation or used different codes for various less common musical notations. An international effort to standardize the braille music code culminated in the updates summarized in [http://www.brl.org/music/index.html Braille Music Code 1997] and detailed in the [http://www.opustec.com/products/newintl/newbrl.html New International Manual of Braille Music Notation (1997)].  However, users should be aware that they will continue to encounter divergences when ordering scores from printing houses and libraries because these are often older and come from various countries.

'''Business process automation (BPA)''', also known as '''business automation''' or '''digital transformation''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/06/29/mapping-out-business-process-automation-how-bpm-functions-like-a-gps/#3d91f3a33feb Mapping Out Business Process Automation: How BPM Functions Like A GPS] Published by Forbes, June 29, 2017, retrieved August 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; is the technology-enabled [[automation]] of complex&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bpa-business-process-automation https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bpa-business-process-automation] Published by Gartner&lt;/ref&gt; [[business process]]es. It can streamline a business for simplicity, achieve [[digital transformation]], increase [[service quality]], improve service delivery or contain costs. It consists of integrating applications, restructuring labor resources and using [[application software|software applications]] throughout the organization. [[Robotic process automation]] is an emerging field within BPA and uses [[artificial intelligence]].

==Deployment of a BPA==
BPAs can be implemented in a number of business areas including [[marketing]], [[sales]] and [[workflow]]. Toolsets vary in sophistication, but there is an increasing trend towards the use of [[artificial intelligence]] technologies that can understand natural language and unstructured [[data set]]s, interact with human beings, and adapt to new types of problems without human-guided training. BPA providers tend to focus on different industry sectors but their underlying approach tends to be similar in that they will attempt to provide the shortest route to automation by exploiting the [[user interface]] layer rather than going deeply into the application code or databases sitting behind them. They also simplify their own interface to the extent that these tools can be used directly by non-technically qualified staff. The main advantage of these toolsets is therefore their speed of deployment, the drawback is that it brings yet another IT supplier to the organization.

The market is, however, evolving in this area.  In order to automate these processes, connectors are needed to fit these systems/solutions together with a data exchange layer to transfer the information. A [[process driven messaging service]] is an option for optimizing your data exchange layer. By mapping your end-to-end process workflow, you can build an integration between individual platforms using a process driven messaging platform. Process driven messaging service gives you the logic to build your process by using triggers, jobs and workflows. Some companies uses an API where you build workflow/s and then connect various systems or mobile devices. You build the process, creating workflows in the API where the workflow in the API acts as a data exchange layer.

==A business process management implementation==
A [[business process management]] system is quite different from BPA. However, it is possible to build automation on the back of a BPM implementation. The actual tools to achieve this vary, from writing custom application code to using specialist BPA tools. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are inextricably linked – the BPM implementation provides an architecture for all processes in the business to be mapped, but this in itself delays the automation of individual processes and so benefits may be lost in the meantime.

==Deployment of robotic process automation==
The practice of performing [[robotic process automation]] results in the deployment of attended or unattended software agents to an organization's environment. These software agents, or robots, are deployed to perform pre-defined structured and repetitive sets of business tasks or processes. Artificial intelligence software robots are deployed to handle unstructured data sets and are deployed after performing and deploying robotic process automation. Robotic process automation is the leading gateway for the adoption of artificial intelligence in business environments.

When the triskelia interact they form a [[polyhedron|polyhedral]] lattice that surrounds the vesicle. This is how clathrin gets its name, from the [[Latin]] ''clathratus'' meaning like a lattice. Coat-proteins, like clathrin, are used to build small vesicles in order to transport molecules within cells. The [[endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]] of vesicles allows cells to communicate, to transfer nutrients, to import signaling receptors, to mediate an immune response after sampling the extracellular world, and to clean up the cell debris left by tissue inflammation. The endocytic pathway can be hijacked by viruses and other pathogens in order to gain entry to the cell during infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2007_4/Page1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116085409/http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/potm/2007_4/Page1.htm |archivedate=2016-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clathrin triskelion is composed of three clathrin heavy chains interacting at their [[C-terminus |C-termini]], each ~190 kDa heavy chain has a ~25 kDa light chain tightly bound to it. The three heavy chains provide the structural backbone of the clathrin lattice, and the three light chains are thought to regulate the formation and disassembly of a clathrin lattice. There are two forms of clathrin light chains, designated a and b. The main clathrin heavy chain, located on [[Chromosome 17 (human) |chromosome 17]] in humans, is found in all cells. A second clathrin heavy chain gene, on [[chromosome 22 (human) |chromosome 22]], is expressed in muscle.

Clathrin heavy chain is often described as a leg, with subdomains, representing the foot (the [[N-terminal]] domain), followed by the ankle, distal leg, knee, proximal leg, and trimerization domains. The N-terminal domain consists of a seven-bladed β-propeller structure. The other domains form a super-helix of short alpha helices. This was originally determined from the structure of the proximal leg domain that identified and is composed of a smaller structural module referred to as clathrin heavy chain repeat motifs. The light chains bind primarily to the proximal leg portion of the heavy chain with some interaction near the trimerization domain. The β-propeller at the 'foot' of clathrin contains multiple binding sites for interaction with other proteins.

When triskelia assemble together in solution, they can interact with enough flexibility to form 6-sided rings ([[hexagons]]) that yield a flat lattice, or 5-sided rings ([[pentagons]]) that are necessary for curved lattice formation. When many triskelions connect, they can form a basket-like structure. The structure shown, is built of 36 triskelia, one of which is shown in blue. Another common assembly is a [[truncated icosahedron]]. To enclose a vesicle, exactly 12 pentagons must be present in the lattice.

In a cell, clathrin triskelion in the cytoplasm binds to an adaptor protein that has bound membrane, linking one of its three feet to the membrane at a time. Clathrin cannot bind to membrane or cargo directly and instead uses adaptor proteins to do this. This triskelion will bind to other membrane-attached triskelia to form a rounded lattice of hexagons and pentagons, reminiscent of the panels on a soccer ball, that pulls the membrane into a bud. By constructing different combinations of 5-sided and 6-sided rings, vesicles of different sizes may assemble. The smallest clathrin cage commonly imaged, called a mini-coat, has 12 pentagons and only two hexagons. Even smaller cages with zero hexagons probably do not form from the native protein, because the feet of the triskelia are too bulky.

== Function ==

Clathrin performs critical roles in shaping rounded vesicles in the [[cytoplasm]] for intracellular trafficking. Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV) selectively sort cargo at the [[cell membrane]], trans-[[golgi apparatus|Golgi network]], and [[endosome|endosomal]] compartments for multiple membrane traffic pathways. After a vesicle buds into the cytoplasm, the coat rapidly disassembles, allowing the clathrin to recycle while the vesicle gets transported to a variety of locations.

Adaptor molecules are responsible for self-assembly and recruitment. Two examples of [[Adaptor proteins, vesicular transport|adaptor protein]]s are [[AP180]]&lt;ref name="urlClathrin and its interactions with AP180"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.endocytosis.org/AP180/Clathrin.html| title =Clathrin and its interactions with AP180.| author =McMahon HT| date =| work =| publisher =MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology| pages =| language =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090501052207/http://endocytosis.org/AP180/Clathrin.html| archivedate =2009-05-01| quote =micrographs of clathrin assembly| accessdate =2009-04-17| deadurl =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[epsin]].&lt;ref name="urlEpsin 1 EM gallery"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/MonolayerEMs.html| title =Epsin 1 EM gallery| author =McMahon HT| date =| work =| publisher =MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology,| pages =| language =| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090102032308/http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/MonolayerEMs.html| archivedate =2009-01-02| quote =micrographs of vesicle budding| accessdate =2009-04-17| deadurl =no| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11161218"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford MG, Pearse BM, Higgins MK, Vallis Y, Owen DJ, Gibson A, Hopkins CR, Evans PR, McMahon HT | authorlink2 = Barbara Pearse | title = Simultaneous binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and clathrin by AP180 in the nucleation of clathrin lattices on membranes | journal = Science | volume = 291 | issue = 5506 | pages = 1051–5 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11161218 | doi = 10.1126/science.291.5506.1051 | url = http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/ford.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081121191304/http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/ford.pdf | archivedate = 2008-11-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12076538"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Higgins MK, McMahon HT | title = Snap-shots of clathrin-mediated endocytosis | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–63 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12076538 | doi = 10.1016/S0968-0004(02)02089-3 | url = http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/mcmahon.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081121220307/http://www.endocytosis.org/epsin/EM/mcmahon.pdf | archivedate = 2008-11-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; AP180 is used in synaptic vesicle formation. It recruits clathrin to membranes and also promotes its [[polymerization]]. Epsin also recruits clathrin to membranes and promotes its polymerization, and can help deform the membrane, and thus clathrin-coated vesicles can bud. In a cell, a triskelion floating in the cytoplasm binds to an adaptor protein, linking one of its feet to the membrane at a time. The skelion will bind to other ones attached to the membrane to form a polyhedral lattice, skelion, which pulls the membrane into a bud. The skelion does not bind directly to the membrane, but binds to the adaptor proteins that recognize the molecules on the membrane surface.

Clathrin has another function aside from the coating of [[organelle]]s. In non-dividing cells, the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles occurs continuously. Formation of clathrin-coated vesicles is shut down in cells undergoing [[mitosis]]. During mitosis, clathrin binds to the [[spindle apparatus]], in complex with two other proteins: [[TACC3]] and ch-TOG/[[CKAP5]]. Clathrin aids in the congression of chromosomes by stabilizing [[kinetochore]] fibers of the [[mitotic spindle]]. The amino-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain and the TACC domain of TACC3 make the microtubule binding surface for TACC3/ch-TOG/clathrin to bind to the [[mitotic spindle]]. The stabilization of [[kinetochore]] fibers requires the trimeric structure of clathrin in order to crosslink microtubules.&lt;ref name="Clathrin is required for the function of the mitotic spindle"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Royle SJ, Bright NA, Lagnado L | title = Clathrin is required for the function of the mitotic spindle | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | pages = 1152–1157 | year = 2005 | doi = 10.1038/nature03502 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7037/full/nature03502.html | pmid = 15858577 | issue = 7037 | pmc = 3492753 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712175953/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7037/full/nature03502.html | archivedate = 2007-07-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coordination of adjacent domains mediates TACC3-ch-TOG-clathrin assembly and mitotic spindle binding"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hood FE, Williams SJ, Burgess SG, Richards MW, Roth D, Straube A, Pfuhl M, Bayliss R, Royle SJ | title = Coordination of adjacent domains mediates TACC3-ch-TOG-clathrin assembly and mitotic spindle binding | journal = [[Journal of Cell Biology]] | volume = 202 | issue = 3 | pages = 463–78 |year=2013 | pmid = 23918938 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.201211127 | url = | pmc=3734082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Receptor-mediated endocytosis |Clathrin-mediated endocytosis]] (CME) regulates many cellular physiological processes such as the internalization of growth factors and receptors, entry of pathogens, and synaptic transmission. It is believed that cellular invaders use the nutrient pathway to gain access to a cell's replicating mechanisms. Certain signalling molecules open the nutrients pathway. Two chemical compounds called Pitstop 1 and Pitstop 2, selective clathrin inhibitors, can interfere with the pathogenic activity, and thus protect the cells against invasion. These two compounds selectively block the endocytic ligand association with the clathrin terminal domain in vitro.&lt;ref&gt;Role of the Clathrin Terminal Domain in Regulating Coated Pit Dynamics Revealed by Small Molecule Inhibition|Cell, Volume 146, Issue 3, 471-484, 5 August 2011 [http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2811%2900667-2 Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119233601/http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(11)00667-2 |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the specificity of these compounds to block clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been questioned.&lt;ref name="Pitstop 2 is a potent inhibitor of clathrin-independent endocytosis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dutta D, Williamson CD, Cole NB, Donaldson JG | title = Pitstop 2 is a potent inhibitor of clathrin-independent endocytosis | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | pages = e45799 | date = Sep 2012 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0045799 | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045799 | pmid = 23029248 | issue = 9 | pmc = 3448704 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811163931/http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0045799 | archivedate = 2014-08-11 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed in August, 1996, for the purpose developing and standardizing the use and implementation of SPICE models and the model interfaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10319">In [[computer science]], the '''complexity function''' of a string, a finite or infinite sequence of letters from some alphabet, is the function that counts the number of distinct factors (substrings of consecutive symbols) from that string.  More generally, the complexity function of a language, a set of finite words over an alphabet, counts the number of distinct words of given length.

==Complexity function of a word==
Let ''u'' be a (possibly infinite) sequence of symbols from an alphabet.  Define the function
''p''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') of a positive integer ''n'' to be the number of different factors (consecutive substrings) of length ''n'' from the string&amp;nbsp;''u''.&lt;ref name=L7&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=L46/&gt;&lt;ref name=PF3&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLRS82&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS298&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.298&lt;/ref&gt;

For a string ''u'' of length at least ''n'' over an alphabet of size ''k'' we clearly have 
:&lt;math&gt; 1 \le p_u(n) \le k^n \ , &lt;/math&gt;
the bounds being achieved by the constant word and a [[disjunctive word]],&lt;ref name=Bug91&gt;Bugeaud (2012) p.91&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the [[Champernowne word]] respectively.&lt;ref name=CN165&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.165&lt;/ref&gt;  For infinite words ''u'', we have ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') bounded if ''u'' is ultimately periodic (a finite, possibly empty, sequence followed by a finite cycle).  Conversely, if ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') ≤ ''n'' for some ''n'', then ''u'' is ultimately periodic.&lt;ref name=PF3/&gt;&lt;ref name=AS302&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.302&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aperiodic sequence''' is one which is not ultimately periodic.  An aperiodic sequence has strictly increasing complexity function (this is the '''Morse–Hedlund theorem'''),&lt;ref name=BR166/&gt;&lt;ref name=CN166&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.166&lt;/ref&gt; so ''p''(''n'') is at least ''n''+1.&lt;ref name=L22&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A set ''S'' of finite binary words is ''balanced'' if for each ''n'' the subset ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of words of length ''n'' has the property that the [[Hamming weight]] of the words in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; takes at most two distinct values.  A '''balanced sequence''' is one for which the set of factors is balanced.&lt;ref name=AS313&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.313&lt;/ref&gt;  A balanced sequence has complexity function at most ''n''+1.&lt;ref name=L48&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sturmian word]] over a binary alphabet is one with complexity function ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=PF6&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.6&lt;/ref&gt;  A sequence is Sturmian if and only if it is balanced and aperiodic.&lt;ref name=L46&gt;Lothaire (2011) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS318&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.318&lt;/ref&gt;  An example is the [[Fibonacci word]].&lt;ref name=PF6/&gt;&lt;ref name=deluca1995&gt;{{cite journal |  journal=Information Processing Letters | year=1995 | pages=307–312 | doi=10.1016/0020-0190(95)00067-M | title=A division property of the Fibonacci word | first=Aldo | last=de Luca |  volume=54 |  issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, a Sturmian word over an alphabet of size ''k'' is one with complexity ''n''+''k''−1.  An Arnoux-Rauzy word over a ternary alphabet has complexity 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1:&lt;ref name=PF6/&gt; an example is the [[Tribonacci word]].&lt;ref name=PF368&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.368&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[recurrent word]]s, those in which each factor appears infinitely often, the complexity function almost characterises the set of factors: if ''s'' is a recurrent word with the same complexity function as ''t'' are then ''s'' has the same set of factors as ''t'' or δ''t'' where δ denotes the letter doubling morphism ''a'' → ''aa''.&lt;ref name=BLRS84&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''L'' be a language over an alphabet and define the function ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') of a positive integer ''n'' to be the number of different words of length ''n'' in ''L''&lt;ref name=BR166&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.166&lt;/ref&gt;  The complexity function of a word is thus the complexity function of the language consisting of the factors of that word.

The complexity function of a language is less constrained than that of a word.  For example, it may be bounded but not eventually constant: the complexity function of the [[regular language]] &lt;math&gt;a(bb)^*a&lt;/math&gt; takes values 3 and 4 on odd and even ''n''≥2 respectively.  There is an analogue of the Morse–Hedlund theorem: if the complexity of ''L'' satisfies ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')  ≤ ''n'' for some ''n'', then ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; is bounded and there is a finite language ''F'' such that&lt;ref name=BR166/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L \subseteq \{ x y^k z : x,y,z \in F,\ k \in \mathbb{N} \} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

A '''polynomial''' or '''[[sparse language]]''' is one for which the complexity function ''p''(''n'') is bounded by a fixed power of ''n''.  A [[regular language]] which is not polynomial is ''exponential'': there are infinitely many ''n'' for which ''p''(''n'') is greater than ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some fixed ''k'' &gt; 1.&lt;ref name=BR136&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
The ''[[topological entropy]]'' of an infinite sequence ''u'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\mathrm{top}}(u) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log p_u(n)}{n \log k} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The limit exists as the logarithm of the complexity function is [[Subadditivity|subadditive]].&lt;ref name=PF4&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS303&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.303&lt;/ref&gt;  Every real number between 0 and 1 occurs as the topological entropy of some sequence is applicable,&lt;ref name=CN169&gt;Cassaigne &amp; Nicolas (2010) p.169&lt;/ref&gt; which may be taken to be [[Uniformly recurrent word|uniformly recurrent]]&lt;ref name=BR391&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.391&lt;/ref&gt; or even uniquely ergodic.&lt;ref name=BR169&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.169&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''x'' a real number and ''b'' an integer ≥ 2 then the complexity function of ''x'' in base ''b'' is the complexity function ''p''(''x'',''b'',''n'') of the sequence of digits of ''x'' written in base ''b''.
If ''x'' is an [[irrational number]] then ''p''(''x'',''b'',''n'') ≥ ''n''+1; if ''x'' is [[rational number|rational]] then ''p''(''x'',''b'',''n'') ≤ ''C'' for some constant ''C'' depending on ''x'' and ''b''.&lt;ref name=Bug91&gt;Bugeaud (2012) p.91&lt;/ref&gt;  It is conjectured that for algebraic irrational ''x'' the complexity is ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (which would follow if all such numbers were [[Normal number|normal]]) but all that is known in this case is that ''p'' grows faster than any linear function of ''n''.&lt;ref name=BR414&gt;Berthé &amp; Rigo (2010) p.414&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''abelian complexity function''' ''p''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') similarly counts the number of occurrences of distinct factors of given length ''n'', where now we identify factors that differ only by a permutation of the positions.  Clearly ''p''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') ≤ ''p''(''n'').  The abelian complexity of a Sturmian sequence satisfies ''p''&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;(''n'') = 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=On the Asymptotic Abelian Complexity of Morphic Words | title=Developments in Language Theory.

In [[graphic design]] and [[advertising]], a '''comprehensive layout''' or '''comprehensive,''' usually shortened to '''comp''', is the [[page layout]] of a proposed design as initially presented by the designer to a client, showing the relative positions of [[typography|text]] and [[illustration]]s before the final content of those elements has been decided upon. The comp thus serves as a draft of the final layout, and (if approved) is used as guide for further design changes and, ultimately, production.

Traditionally, the four stages of an illustration or other commercial art creation (e.g., advertisement) are:
* Sketch&amp;nbsp;— the initial idea roughly "sketched out" in order to quickly transfer the idea on to a physical substrate
* Layout&amp;nbsp;— the idea laid out in relative position for further development
* Comp&amp;nbsp;— the idea created in such a way as to closely mimic the final creation, usually as a step toward approval by decision-makers
* Finish&amp;nbsp;— the idea rendered in the appropriate medium for sale, display, or reproduction

For traditional media (such as paint), the division between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for [[computer-generated art]]. For traditional media, the distinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and presentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because of this (e.g., tracing paper for a layout vs. calendered bond paper or illustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on tracing paper could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) to see how it would eventually appear after finish render, and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.

With computer-generated art, the distinction between layout and comp has become blurred. Since computer-generated art can evolve as one file over time, finely segmented milestones in the development process have less meaning. With computer-generated art, even the sketch stage is often skipped. This has led to a two-stage process; comp and finish. The definitions of each milestone are roughly the same as with traditional media.  Even in the age of rapid desktop publishing software, comps may be developed using hand-rendering techniques and materials to avoid investing too much time on the computer before client approval of the idea, depending on the complexity of the production task. If there is any three-dimensionality to the design (for example, the design is of a box or of a two sided piece) a "physical comp" is preferred to a computerized sketch because fundamental physical relationships (for example, position and show-through of die-cuts, or inadvertently designing Möbius strips) can be missed in a two-dimensional sketch. A hand-rendered comp may be useful in helping the client refrain from "[[Nitpicking (pastime)|nitpicking]]" the production quality and focus on the design idea.

In the overall creation process there is also a distinction between finish render and final render. Finish rendering refers to the process, and final rendering refers to the schedule. The first finish rendering may not be the final rendering; the first finish rendering could be the first of many renderings, with each subsequent finish rendering needing refinement before the final version is created.

The illustration element may incorporate [[stock photography]], [[clip art]], or other found material that gives an idea of what should be visually communicated, before entering any negotiations concerning the rights to use a specific image for the purpose. Picture agencies may encourage such use free of charge, in the hope that the comp image (sometimes referred to as a "positional" image) will end up being used in the final product. For this reason, it is sometimes mistakenly believed that "comp" is short for "complimentary," as it is in some other promotional contexts.

The word "comp" can also be used as a verb. For example, an artist may "comp something up"; that is, they will create a comp.  "Comp" may also stand for "composition" or "composite layout".

'''Critical Path Institute''' (C-Path) is an independent, non-profit organization committed to transformational improvement of the [[drug development]] process. C-Path has established first-of-its-kind, global [[consortia]] that currently include over 1,000 scientists from [[Regulatory agency|government regulatory]] and research agencies, [[academia]], [[Patient advocacy|patient advocacy organizations]], and forty one major [[Pharmaceutical industry|biopharmaceutical companies]].&lt;ref&gt;Woosley, R.

==Background==
New drug development can cost nearly $1 billion and take, on average, 15 years to get from laboratory testing to regulatory approval;&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dimasi |first1=JA |last2=Feldman |first2=L |last3=Seckler |first3=A |last4=Wilson |first4=A |title=Trends in risks associated with new drug development: success rates for investigational drugs |journal=Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=272–7 |year=2010 |pmid=20130567 |doi=10.1038/clpt.2009.295}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pkdcure.org/Research/DrugDevelopmentTimeline.aspx "Drug Development Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722003533/http://www.pkdcure.org/Research/DrugDevelopmentTimeline.aspx |date=2011-07-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; only five- to 15-percent of new medicines that enter human testing reach the market.&lt;ref name="Pmid" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coons, S. J. [http://www.clinicaltherapeutics.com/article/S0149-2918%2809%2900435-4/pdf "The FDA's Critical Path Initiative: a Brief Introduction."] ''Clinical Therapeutics'' 31.11(2009): 2572-2573&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, only 21 new drugs were approved for marketing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/documents/image/ucm243824.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the declining productivity of the pharmaceutical industry, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) launched the [[Food and Drug Administration#Critical Path Initiative|Critical Path Initiative]] (CPI) in 2004, its national strategy for forming collaborations to transform the way FDA-regulated medical products are developed, evaluated, and manufactured.&lt;ref name="Pmid_b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romero |first1=K |last2=De Mars |first2=M |last3=Frank |first3=D |last4=Anthony |first4=M |last5=Neville |first5=J |last6=Kirby |first6=L |last7=Smith |first7=K |last8=Woosley |first8=RL |title=The Coalition Against Major Diseases: developing tools for an integrated drug development process for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases |journal=Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=365–7 |year=2009 |pmid=19763117 |doi=10.1038/clpt.2009.165}}&lt;/ref&gt; C-Path was created with support and funding from the FDA, [http://www.sfaz.org/ Science Foundation Arizona], and the Tucson community. C-Path's creation was designed to fill an essential role as a neutral third party that enables scientists from the regulated industry and international regulatory agencies to work together to establish a faster, safer, and more efficient path through the drug development process.&lt;ref name="Pmid_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coons |first1=Stephen Joel |title=The FDA's critical path initiative: A brief introduction |journal=Clinical Therapeutics |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=2572–3 |year=2009 |pmid=20110002 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.11.035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its launch in 2005, six C-Path consortia—made up of participants from industry, academia, regulatory agencies, and patient advocacy groups—have focused on identifying the best methods for testing [[drug safety]] and efficacy, and have shared their data and knowledge about major diseases ([[clinical trial]] data, quantitative [[disease]] progression models, and [[biomarker]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C-Path |url=http://www.c-path.org/ |title=The Critical Path Institute. |publisher=C-path.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
C-Path works with over 1,000 scientists from 41 major biopharmaceutical companies around the world under a common legal agreement; this agreement allows the sharing of data to generate new scientific knowledge and tools that will enable the design of more efficient clinical trials leading to rapid approval of therapies. They also work with scientists from academia, the [[Nih|National Institutes of Health]], the [[Center for Disease Control|Centers for Disease Control]], the [[World health organization|World Health Organization]], the [[Gates foundation|Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], and others. C-Path focuses on work that has been identified as high priority by the FDA and is in the interest of national and global [[public health]].&lt;ref name="Pmid_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woosley | first1 = R.

==Qualification process==
C-Path and FDA scientists have worked together to identify the guiding principles for how biomarkers can be scientifically reviewed in order to bring greater efficiency to the drug development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattes |first1=WB |last2=Walker |first2=EG |title=Translational Toxicology and the Work of the Predictive Safety Testing Consortium |journal=Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics |volume=85 |pages=327–30 |year=2009 |doi=10.1038/clpt.2008.270 |issue=3 |pmid=19158666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of describing biomarkers with general terms such as “validated” or “surrogate endpoints” as is generally done, C-Path prefers the designation ''qualified'' for a specific use or ''fit for use''. By specifying the intended “use,” much greater clarity is provided on the context and intent for using a biomarker. Once a [[scientific consensus]] on how a biomarker can be used to support specific decisions to be made by the industry and/or the FDA, it can be designated as ''qualified'' for that use. Based on the work with C-Path consortia, the FDA recently released a [http://google2.fda.gov/search?q=cache:KF4qLlUrklIJ:www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM230597.pdf+UCM230597&amp;client=FDAgov&amp;site=FDAgov&amp;lr=&amp;proxystylesheet=FDAgov&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;access=p&amp;oe=UTF-8 Draft Guidance for Qualification of Drug Development Tools.] This is the process being used by C-Path consortia and others to obtain regulatory decisions on the acceptability of new testing methods in drug development.

* The Predictive Safety Testing Consortium (PSTC) was the first of C-Path’s consortia, and brings together pharmaceutical companies to share and qualify one another's safety testing methods. The process included advisors from the FDA and its European counterpart, the [[European Medicines Agency|European Medicines Agency (EMA)]]. The industry members of the consortium share experience with pre-clinical and clinical safety biomarkers in six workgroups: [[carcinogenicity]], [[kidney]], [[liver]], [[muscle]], [[vascular]] injury, and [[cardiac]] [[hypertrophy]]. All biomarker research programs have a strong clinical and [[Translational medicine|translational]] focus to select new safety tools that are applicable across the drug development spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Goodsaid, F. M., F. W. Frueh, and W. B. Mattes.

* The Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium was formed by C-Path in cooperation with the FDA and the medical products industry. Its purpose is to develop, evaluate, and qualify PRO instruments (e.g., questionnaires) for use in clinical trials designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of medical products. PRO instruments offer a means for capturing how a patient feels or functions with respect to her/his health or condition. Instruments are currently being developed to support label claims for efficacy in [[asthma]], [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[diabetes]], mild [[cognitive impairment]], and [[cancer]] ([[Breast cancer|breast]] and [[Lung cancer|lung]]).&lt;ref name="Departmentof" /&gt;
* The Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD) includes [[patient advocacy]] groups, [[biopharmaceutical]] companies, foundations, and advisors from the FDA, EMA, the [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] (NINDS), and the [[National Institute on Aging]] (NIA). Members share pre-competitive data and knowledge that will more efficiently and safely speed development of treatments and preventions for [[Alzheimer's]], [[Parkinson's]], [[Huntington's]], and other debilitating [[Degenerative disease|neuro-degenerative diseases]]. CAMD’s overall objective is to help scientists identify clinical and laboratory characteristics (biomarkers) of patients destined to develop Alzheimer's but before they are symptomatic and therefore more likely to benefit from new therapies. CAMD gathers and submits the evidence for the FDA and EMA to officially designate such tools as ''qualified for use'' in drug development.&lt;ref name="Pmid_b" /&gt;

:: CAMD developed and launched the largest standardized [[database]] of combined [[clinical trial]]s to be openly shared by pharmaceutical companies and made available to qualified researchers around the world. This database—involving anonymous data from approximately 4,000 Alzheimer's patients—provides a platform from which to design more efficient clinical trials to test new treatments. This will allow the industry to more rapidly identify potential therapies that prevent the disease or halt its progression.&lt;ref name="Pmid_b"/&gt;
* The Critical Path to TB Drug Regimens (CPTR) is a collaboration of pharmaceutical companies, government, regulatory, and multilateral agencies, donors, academia, advocates, and NGOs that aims to accelerate the development of new, safe, and highly effective [[tuberculosis treatment]] regimens with shortened durations of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tballiance.org/cptr/ |title=The Critical Path to TB Regimens Initiative. |publisher=Tballiance.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427133236/http://www.tballiance.org/cptr/ |archivedate=2011-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Joining the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the [[Global Alliance for TB Drug Development]] (TB Alliance) as CPTR founding organizations, C-Path provides overall program management for this initiative and leads one component, the CPTR Regulatory Science Consortium.
* The [[Polycystic kidney disease|Polycystic Kidney Disease]] (PKD) Consortium was created and is managed by C-Path with funding from the PKD Foundation, and includes three academic medical centers (University of Colorado, Emory University, and [http://www.mayoclinic.com/ Mayo Clinic]). Its mission is to evaluate the evidence supporting [[Renal function|total kidney volume]] (TKV) as a biomarker for assessing the progression of autosomal dominant PKD. If the data support the conclusion that TKV is an early and reliable predictor of subsequent renal failure, C-path will submit a request to the FDA that TKV be qualified as a measure of disease progression that can be used in drug development to test the efficacy of new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/polycystic-kidney-disease-center/index.cfm "Mayo Clinic Translational Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) Center;"] [http://www.pkdcure.org/Research/VirtualDrugDevelopmentMachine.aspx "Building a Drug Development Machine."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116052642/http://www.pkdcure.org/Research/VirtualDrugDevelopmentMachine.aspx |date=2011-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cygnus X-3''' is a [[high-mass X-ray binary]] (HMXB), one of the stronger [[X-ray binary|binary X-ray sources]] in the sky. It is often considered to be a [[Microquasar#Microquasar|microquasar]], and it is believed to be a [[compact object]] in a [[binary system]] which is pulling in a stream of gas from an ordinary [[star]] companion. It is the only known HMXB containing a [[Wolf-Rayet star]].  It is invisible visually, but can be observed at [[radio frequency|radio]], [[infrared]], [[X-ray]], and [[gamma-ray]] wavelengths.

==Observations==
[[File:Cygnus X3.jpg|thumb|left|Cygnus X3 and its X-ray halo]]
Cygnus X-3 is a prominent [[X ray]] source, with soft and hard x-rays both varying in intensity.  Periods where the hard x-rays are at minimum intensity are known as soft states.  It is less than half a degree from a [[gamma-ray]] pulsar, but is itself a weak gamma-ray source. It also shows periodic gamma-ray flares, apparently all occurring during the soft state.&lt;ref name=becklin/&gt;&lt;ref name=tavani/&gt;

It is undetectable at visual wavelengths due to extreme [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] in the [[galactic plane]].  However, there is an [[infrared]] point source at its position.&lt;ref name=koljonen/&gt;  Cygnus X-3 is also notable as one of the very few confirmed sources of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s, with energies in the 100–1000 [[Electronvolt|TeV]] range.&lt;ref name=zanin/&gt;

Because of the variations in emission at various wavelengths, Cygnus X-3 has been given the [[variable star designation]] V1521 Cygnus.&lt;ref name=gcvs/&gt;

==Flares==
Cygnus X-3 is notable for its intense X-ray emission and ultra-high energy cosmic rays, but it is also remarkable for its gamma-ray and radio flares during which it becomes the brightest radio source in the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=koljonen2018/&gt;  The gamma-ray flares apparently occur in the quiet radio period before a major radio flare.&lt;ref name=becklin/&gt;&lt;ref name=tavani/&gt;

During the giant radio flares, a [[relativistic jet]] has been resolved within about {{val|14|ul=°}} of being aimed directly towards us.&lt;ref name=koljonen2018/&gt;

==Binary system==
Cygnus X-3 shows consistent variations across all wavelengths with a {{val|4.8|ul=hour}} period.  The nature of the infrared spectrum and the x-ray emission is interpreted as a [[binary system]] containing a [[Wolf-Rayet star|Wolf-Rayet]] (WR) star and a compact object.  The {{val|4.8|u=hour}} variations have been interpreted as eclipses,&lt;ref name=becklin/&gt; but this is thought to be unlikely because there are not well-defined periodic dips in the brightness.&lt;ref name=koljonen/&gt;

The orbit of the binary system is not known accurately, other than the period.  Therefore the masses of the components are not known accurately.  Orbital analysis suggested that the mass of the compact object is less than {{solar mass|5|link=yes}}, probably around {{solar mass|2}}.  It could possibly be a [[neutron star]] but is more likely to be a [[black hole]].&lt;ref name=koljonen/&gt;  The combination of a WR star and a black hole would be the only known example.&lt;ref name=lutovinov/&gt;

While the combination of WR star and compact object would be unique, the WR component will itself almost certainly become a black hole very quickly by astronomical timescales.  The expect [[supernova]] or possible direct collapse to a black hole is expected within a million years or so.  However, modelling of the Cygnus X-3 system suggests it is most likely that the binary will be disrupted by any supernova event.&lt;ref name=belczynski/&gt;

The [[cosmic ray]] events from Cygnus X-3 had previously led to exotic proposals such as a star made of [[quark]]s,&lt;ref name=quark/&gt; but are now explained as being produced in the relativistic jet.  The explanation for the unusual relationship between the x-rays and the gamma-ray and radio flares is that the compact objects produces jets along its axis of rotation, within the dense wind from the WR star.  These jets evacuate a cocoon within the wind when entering the hard state, and are then quenched by the wind when entering the soft state.  Flares are produced during the transition to the hard state as the jets are interacting with the dense wind.&lt;ref name=koljonen2018/&gt;

==Distance==
Cygnus X-3 lies in the direction of the [[Cygnus OB2]] association in the [[Cygnus X (star complex)|Cygnus X]] complex, although it is much further away&lt;ref name=mccollough/&gt;  Its distance can be estimated relative to Cygnus OB2 by studying the X-ray halo produced by dust between us and Cygnus X-3.  The distance to Cygnus OB2 is not known precisely, but this method gives possible distances to Cygnus X-3 of {{val|3.4|u=kpc}} or {{val|9.3|u=kpc}}.&lt;ref name=ling/&gt;

There is a small X-ray source {{val|16|ul="}} from Cygnus X-3 that varies with the same period by a phase lag of about {{val|2.7|u=h}}.  This is thought to be a [[Bok globule]] at approximately the same distance as Cygnus X-2.  Using molecular line emission from this object, two possible distances are found to be {{val|6.1|0.6|u=kpc}} and {{val|7.8|0.6|u=kpc}}.  A statistical mean is {{val|7.4|1.1|u=kpc}}.&lt;ref name=mccollough/&gt;

'''H.M. Dobrov Center for Scientific and Technological Potential and Science History Studies''' ({{lang-uk|Інститут досліджень науково-технічного потенціалу та історії науки імені Г. М. Доброва}}) is a research institute of the National Academy of Sciences of [[Ukraine]].

==History==

The Center's history dates from 1965, with the Department of Machine Methods for Processing of Science History Information at the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR.

In subsequent years, the team of researchers supervised by H.M. Dobrov was doing research in the Institute of Mathematics, Institute of Cybernetics and the Council of Productive Forces of Ukraine of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR.

In 1986-1991 the center was a functionally independent structural entity in the Institute for Superhard Materials.

In 1989 the Center was named after its founder — [[H.M. Dobrov]], professor, and correspondent-member of the NAS of Ukraine.

In 1991 the center received the status of a research institute.

Since 1991 the center has been an scientific research institution within the Informatics Division of the NAS of Ukraine.

Copulatory vocalizations usually occur during [[sexual intercourse]] and are hence related to [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornhill|first1=R.|last2=Gangestad|first2=S. W.|title=The Evolutionary Biology of Human Female Sexuality|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIE8DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=vocalizations%20OR%20%22copulation%20calls%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalizations that occur before intercourse, for the purpose of attracting mates, are known as [[mating call]]s.

In [[primate]]s, copulation calling is typically observed at the end of [[mating]]&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pradhan|first1=Gauri|last2=Engelhardt|first2=Antje|last3=van Schaik|first3=Carel|last4=Maestripieri|first4=Dario|title=The evolution of female copulation calls in primates: a review and a new model|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=January 2006|volume=59|issue=3|pages=333–343|doi=10.1007/s00265-005-0075-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are vast variations between species regarding its occurrence, frequency and form. It is agreed that coital vocalizations fulfill an [[evolution]]ary purpose&lt;ref name="Dixson 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixson|first1=A.|title=Primate Sexuality: Comparative Studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Humans|date=2013|publisher=Oxford: UOP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they serve as adaptive solutions to problems that the females face, such as [[infanticide]], as well as [[sperm competition|obtaining high quality sperm]].&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt;

In non-primates, copulatory calling predominantly occurs before copulation in order to attract mates ([[mating call]]). Calls vary in [[frequency]] (14&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to 70,000&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) and function. One of the main purposes of females vocalizing is the induction of [[mate guarding]] behavior in males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Conversely, calls may also be used in order to attract high ranking mates who can prevent intercourse with the initial partner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is done to incite [[sexual selection|male mate competition]].

In humans, coital vocalizations are linked to [[orgasm]],&lt;ref name="Sex at Dawn"&gt;Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha, ‘’[[Sex at Dawn|Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What It Means for Modern Relationships]]’’ (Harper Perennial, 2011), pp. 255-57.&lt;/ref&gt; hence occurring during [[sexual intercourse|copulation]] and serving as an expression of sexual pleasure. Vocalizations can be used intentionally by women in order to boost the self-esteem of their partner and to cause quicker [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = Gayle | last2 = Hendrie | first2 = Colin A. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence to Suggest that Copulatory Vocalizations in Women Are Not a Reflexive Consequence of Orgasm | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 559–64 | pmid = 20480220 | doi=10.1007/s10508-010-9632-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In non-human primates==

===Occurrence, frequency and form===

[[File:Vocalization sonograms.jpg|thumb|Sonograms of female copulatory vocalizations of a human female (top), female baboon (middle), and female gibbon (bottom),&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = J. | last2 = Arrowood | first2 = P. C. | year = 1978 | title = Copulatory Vocalizations of Chacma Baboons (Papio Ursinus), gibbons (Hylobates Hoolock) and Humans | url = | journal = Science | volume = 200 | issue = 1405| pages = 1406–07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with time being plotted on the x-axis and the [[Audio frequency|pitch]] being represented on the y-axis.]]In non-human primates, copulatory vocalizations begin towards the end of the copulatory act or even after copulation.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; The percentage of vocalizations after copulation varies dependent on the non-human primate species studied. In long-tail macaques, for instance, 80% of copulations are followed by [[Sexual intercourse|copulation]] calls. In contrast, the percentage for [[chimpanzee]]s and [[Tonkean macaque]]s has been found to be 78.8% and 6%, respectively.&lt;ref name="Maestripieri 106–113"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Primate copulation calls and postcopulatory female choice|url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/1/106|journal = Behavioral Ecology|date = 2005-01-01|issn = 1045-2249|pages = 106–113|volume = 16|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/beheco/arh120|language = en|first = Dario|last = Maestripieri|first2 = James R.|last2 = Roney}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little consensus on what causes these inter-specific differences, given the lack of consistent findings within the literature.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; The typical quantity of specimen that are tested in [[experiment|experimental settings]] is often too low in order to allow any [[inference|general conclusions]] about the species as a whole.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt;
Another aspect of [[Sexual intercourse|coital]] vocalization that varies according to species is the form of the call: in [[macaque]]s and [[baboon]]s they manifest themselves as [[Guttural|grunts]], whereas other species such as [[talapoin]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s typically emit [[screaming]] sounds.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; The quality and structure of copulatory calls are analyzed by comparing their respective [[spectrogram]]s in terms of their frequency. Accordingly, some species produce calls that are structurally more complex than that of others. This is linked to the amount of [[Animal sexual behavior#Promiscuity|promiscuity]] exhibited, in a way that more promiscuous species emit more faceted calls in order to convey more information about themselves and hence render [[Signalling theory|self-advertisement]] more efficient.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"/&gt;

===Adaptive function===

[[File:World 06 temp-1416046030-546725ce-620x348.jpg|thumb|A male Chacma baboon shows aggression towards a female and her offspring.]]Copulatory calls in primates serve an [[Adaptation|adaptive function]] and are [[sexual selection|sexually selected]].&lt;ref name="Dixson 2013"/&gt; Calling signals sexual receptivity of the female and therefore affects [[mate choice]]. There are many different hypotheses as to the exact adaptive function of female copulatory calls in primates and research on the subject is still in its early stages.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt;

There is general agreement that copulatory calls are the adaptive solution to problems with [[reproductive success]]. In other words, copulatory vocalizations address issues that stand in the way of successfully producing [[offspring]] and guaranteeing its survival, such as the occurrence of infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maestripieri|first1=Dario|title=Post-Copulatory Sexual Selection and Female Mating Vocalizations in Primates|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhVRetJZrkM|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the killing of their offspring, female baboons employ copulatory calls in order to attract other males, allowing multiple mating acts and creating parental confusion among the males involved. The resulting uncertainty of who the father is hence reduces the occurrence of attacks, given the newly incited risk of potentially harming their own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infanticide avoidance, sperm competition and mate choice: the function of copulation calls in female baboons|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347284712887|journal = Animal Behaviour|date = 1994-09-01|pages = 687–694|volume = 48|issue = 3|doi = 10.1006/anbe.1994.1288|first = Sanjida M.|last = O'Connell|first2 = Guy|last2 = Cowlishaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, mating in rapid successions also entails sperm competition, and therefore fulfills the additional function of obtaining high quality sperm.&lt;ref name="stockley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Stockley |first1= P|year= 1997|title= Sexual conflict resulting from adaptations to sperm competition |volume= 12|pages= 154–159|journal= Trends Ecol. Evol.|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01000-8 |issue= 4 |pmid= 21238013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important in species that do not openly advertise good genes via [[honest signal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maestripieri|first1=Dario|last2=Roney|first2=James|title=Primate copulation calls and post-copulatory female choice|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2005|volume=16|pages=106–113|doi=10.1093/beheco/arh120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By attracting other males through post-copulatory calls, the female might provoke mate guarding behavior in their initial mate. This 'parental concentration',&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; has two outcomes. Firstly, the male might be of high [[Fitness (biology)|quality]], allowing him to fend off those that were attracted by the call. In that case the female has not only gained someone who can protect her and who prevents infanticide through other males, but this also means that she was [[insemination|inseminated]] by a specimen with potentially good genes. Secondly, if the male fails to successfully guard her, she will mate with the newly arrived males, hence inciting sperm competition and paternity confusion (again preventing [[infanticide|attacks on her offspring]], as well as increasing her likelihood of obtaining high quality sperm). The calls produced by the female also carries information about the [[Dominance hierarchy|status]] of the male with whom she was copulating, thus allowing her to influence the likelihood of other males approaching.&lt;ref name="Sex at Dawn"/&gt;

Accordingly, copulatory calls serve more than a single adaptive function. There is no [[mutual exclusivity]] when it comes to addressing the two problems described, namely that of infanticide and receiving high quality sperm. However, by taking the female's [[menstrual cycle|cycle stage]] into account, sperm competition can be ruled out as the primary underlying cause of copulatory calling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Townsend|first1=Simon|last2=Deschner|first2=T|last3=Zuberbühler|first3=K|title=Female chimpanzees use copulation calls flexibly to prevent social competition|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2008|volume=3 | issue = 6 |page=e2431|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002431|pmid=22423311|pmc=3278306}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, females produce coital vocalizations also when they mate during non-fertile periods, which is therefore primarily aimed at attracting as many males as possible and to create parental confusion rather than obtaining high quality sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Dieter|last2=Huchard|first2=Elise|title=The evolution of infanticide by males in mammalian societies|journal=Science|date=2014|volume=346|issue=6211|pages=841–843|doi=10.1126/science.1257226|pmid=25395534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females have no interest in advertising their periods of [[fertility]], given that males would pick up on these patterns, reducing paternal confusion and causing an increase in [[infanticide|aggressive behavior towards her offspring]] from other males.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; Such hidden fertility has been coined [[concealed ovulation]], and is part of [[extended female sexuality]].

=== Alternative benefits ===

In addition to the incitement of parental confusion in order to avoid infanticide, female primates that exhibit [[promiscuity|promiscuous behavior]] also reap non-genetic material benefits. A female that uses vocalizations after copulating with her mate attracts other males, with whom she is also likely to engage in multiple acts of mating.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"/&gt; As a consequence male mates provide non-genetic benefits, such as food, to the female they mated with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodrı́guez-Gironés|first1=M. A.|last2=Enquist|first2=M.|title=The evolution of female sexuality|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2001|volume=61|issue=4|pages=695–704|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such vocalization-facilitated promiscuity heightens the female's [[reproductive success]]. The strategy to mate with multiple partners in order to obtain material benefits can equally be observed in non-primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=P. B.|title=Female promiscuity and male reproductive success in social birds and mammals.|journal=American Naturalist|date=1982|pages=51–64|doi=10.1086/283969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In non-primates ==

=== Occurrence ===

In addition to emitting copulatory vocalizations during and after copulation (as it is mostly seen in primates), non-primate species also vocalize before engaging in mating. Vocalizations that are made prior to copulation are named [[mating call]]s. They serve as a means to advertise sexual receptivity and are predominantly used by males to attract female mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fedorka|first1=K.|last2=Mousseau|first2=T.|title=Material and genetic benefits of female multiple mating and polyandry|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2001|volume=64|issue=3|pages=361–367|doi=10.1006/anbe.2002.3052}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, non-primates emit more calls before copulating, as exemplified by the [[frog#call|croak]]s of male frogs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilczynski | first1 = W. | last2 = McClelland | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Rand | first3 = A.

=== Properties ===
[[File:Elephant Berlin Zoo having Sex cropped.JPG|thumb|Elephant copulation.]]
In regard to the calling properties, frequency analysis is typically used in research to look at the complexity of the vocalization and to distinguish between calls, which is important in determining their function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerhardt|first1=C.|title=Mating call recognition in the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea): importance of two frequency bands as a function of sound pressure level.|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|date=1981|volume=144 | issue = 1 |pages=9–16|doi=10.1007/bf00612792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large frequency variations have been noted between species, ranging from 14&amp;nbsp;Hz to 70,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. [[Mice]], for instance, use 70,000&amp;nbsp;Hz calls continuously prior to copulation. They then lower the frequency down to 40,000&amp;nbsp;Hz during the copulatory act, therefore two qualitatively different calls are used for attracting mates as compared to the actual act of mating.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = N. R. | last2 = Prasad | first2 = M. | last3 = Barfield | first3 = R. J. | last4 = Nyby | first4 = J. G. | year = 1998 | title = 40-and 70-kHz vocalizations of mice (Mus musculus) during copulation | url = | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 63 | issue = 4| pages = 467–473 | doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(97)00484-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the calling in mice is done by males. They use these [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] calls (&gt; 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz and hence not discernible by the human ear) to attract females, with the quantity of calls being related to the male's mating success, making these vocalizations a [[sexual selection|sexually selected]] trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pomerantz | first1 = S. M. | last2 = Nunez | first2 = A. A. | last3 = Bean | first3 = N.

On the other end of the spectrum, female [[African elephant]]s use very low frequency calls of 14–35&amp;nbsp;Hz prior to, as well as during, copulation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poole | first1 = J. H. | last2 = Payne | first2 = K. | last3 = Langbauer Jr | first3 = W. R. | last4 = Moss | first4 = C.

The vocalizations of female elephants are also used in order to incite [[mate guarding]] behavior in the male,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=J.|title=Mate guarding, reproductive success and female choice in African elephants|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1989|volume=37|pages=842–849|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(89)90068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which manifests itself in the form of fighting off any newly arriving mates. Not only females make use of this, as male [[Columbian ground squirrel]]s have been observed to use copulatory vocalizations in order to announce their post-copulatory mate guarding to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manno | first1 = T. G. | last2 = Nesterova | first2 = A. P. | last3 = Debarbieri | first3 = L. M. | last4 = Kennedy | first4 = S. E. | last5 = Wright | first5 = K. S. | last6 = Dobson | first6 = F.

[[Red junglefowl]]s, for instance, utilize calls in order to prevent or end unwanted copulations by attracting another high-ranking male fowl.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Løvlie | first1 = H. | last2 = Zidar | first2 = J. | last3 = Berneheim | first3 = C. | year = 2014 | title = A cry for help: Female distress calling during copulation is context dependent | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 151–157 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further effects of female calling on male's behavior are illustrated by [[spider]]s that have been shown to [[Stridulation|stridulate]] before copulation to inform males of sexual receptivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutto | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Calbacho-Rosa | first2 = L. | last3 = Peretti | first3 = A. V. | year = 2011 | title = Signalling and sexual conflict: Female spiders use stridulation to inform males of sexual receptivity | url = | journal = Ethology | volume = 117 | issue = 11| pages = 1040–1049 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2011.01957.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as  during intercourse in order to influence male genitalic movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peretti | first1 = A. | last2 = Eberhard | first2 = W.

Moreover, attracting new mates by calling out during copulation can entail many benefits for the female. Female [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s which mate with multiple partners receive a greater number of [[nuptial gift]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tregenza|first1=T.|last2=Wedell|first2=N.|title=Benefits of Multiple Mates in the Cricket Gryllus bimaculatus|journal=Evolution|date=1998|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1726–1730|doi=10.2307/2411345|jstor=2411345}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing them to lay a larger quantity of eggs, hence increasing their [[reproductive success]].

==In humans==

Theories are more diverse in regard to women’s sexual vocalizing. On the one hand, researchers have noted some apparently communicative patterns in women’s copulatory vocalizations that suggest some parallels with those of other primates (including an invitation to sperm competition, given that female sexual vocalizations, like those of other primates, serve as "copulation calls" noticeable to other men and exciting to them if overheard&lt;ref name="Sex at Dawn"/&gt;). One study, for instance, has noted that female sexual vocalizations tend to become more intense as she approaches orgasm; at orgasm her vocalization tends to become very rapid, with a regular rhythm that includes equal note lengths and intervals between notes, which male vocalization typically lacks.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07" /&gt; This is especially frequent when her orgasm occurs during penile-vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer" /&gt; By exciting her partner with her vocalizations and bringing about his orgasm at that point, she helps ensure that the [[semen|seminal pool]] is available for her [[cervix]] to dip into as her [[vagina]] relaxes after her orgasm.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"/&gt; Copulatory vocalizations may also be a type of mate retention behaviour. One study found that women who perceived a high risk of [[infidelity]] in their relationship were more likely to utilize copulatory vocalizations in order to [[Fake orgasm|fake an orgasm]], along with other mate retention behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaighobadi|first=Farnaz|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|last3=Weekes-Shackelford|first3=Viviana A.|date=2011-11-17|title=Do Women Pretend Orgasm to Retain a Mate?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-011-9874-6|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1121–1125|doi=10.1007/s10508-011-9874-6|issn=0004-0002|pmc=3563256|pmid=22089325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, recent studies have indicated that most copulatory vocalizations in women do not accompany their own orgasm, but rather their partner’s ejaculation. The study showed that the man typically finds the woman’s vocalization arousing and highly exciting, and that the woman herself is aware of this. Most women in the study, furthermore, indicated that they vocalized during intercourse to make their man ejaculate more quickly, or to boost his enjoyment or [[self-esteem]], or both.&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer"/&gt; A correlation has been found between the frequency of vocalizations and sexual satisfaction for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Babin | first1 = E. A. | year = 2013 | title = An examination of predictors of nonverbal and verbal communication of pleasure during sex and sexual satisfaction | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 270–292 | doi=10.1177/0265407512454523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons that women gave for wanting to force a quick ejaculation include the alleviation of the female's pain, fatigue, or even boredom, or simply to stay within some imposed time restriction for sexual activity. Reasons for wanting to boost the male self-esteem included reinforcing the [[pair bond]] that intercourse helps to strengthen, and thus reducing emotional and sexual infidelity and abandonment.&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer" /&gt; The researchers note that all of these goals are apparently congruent with female copulatory vocalizations in non-human primates.

It is also possible that some vocalizations are due to [[hyperventilation]]. Both men and women can experience hyperventilation during sexual arousal,&lt;ref&gt;Masters W. H., Johnson V. E. Human Sexual Response. Boston: Little Brown and Co, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; which can involve involuntary vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Passie | first1 = T. | last2 = Hartman | first2 = U. | last3 = Schneider | first3 = U. | last4 = Emrich | first4 = H.M. | year = 2003 | title = On the function of groaning and hyperventilation during sexual intercourse: Intensification of sexual experience by altering brain metabolism through hypercapnia | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 60 | issue = 5| pages = 660–663 | doi=10.1016/s0306-9877(03)00010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genetic engineering''', also called '''genetic modification''' or '''genetic manipulation''', is the direct manipulation of an organism's [[gene]]s using [[biotechnology]]. It is a set of [[Genetic engineering techniques|technologies]] used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel [[organisms]]. New [[DNA]] is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using [[recombinant DNA]] methods or by [[Artificial gene synthesis|artificially synthesising]] the DNA. A [[Vector (molecular biology)|construct]] is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. The first recombinant DNA molecule was made by [[Paul Berg]] in 1972 by combining DNA from the monkey virus [[SV40]] with the [[Lambda phage|lambda virus]]. As well as inserting [[gene]]s, the process can be used to remove, or "[[Gene knockout|knock out]]", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or [[Gene targeting|targeted]] to a specific part of the [[genome]].

An organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO). The first GMO was a [[Genetically modified bacterium|bacterium]] generated by [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] in 1973. [[Rudolf Jaenisch]] created the first GM animal when he inserted foreign DNA into a [[Genetically modified mouse|mouse]] in 1974. The first company to focus on genetic engineering, Genentech, was founded in 1976 and started the production of human proteins. Genetically engineered human [[insulin]] was produced in 1978 and insulin-producing bacteria were commercialised in 1982. [[Genetically modified food]] has been sold since 1994, with the release of the [[Flavr Savr]] tomato. The Flavr Savr was engineered to have a longer shelf life, but most current GM crops are modified to increase resistance to insects and herbicides. [[GloFish]], the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003. In 2016 [[AquAdvantage salmon|salmon]] modified with a growth hormone were sold.

Genetic engineering has been applied in numerous fields including research, medicine, industrial biotechnology and agriculture. In research GMOs are used to study gene function and expression through loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression experiments. By knocking out genes responsible for certain conditions it is possible to create [[Model organism|animal model organisms]] of human diseases. As well as producing hormones, vaccines and other drugs genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases through [[gene therapy]]. The same techniques that are used to produce drugs can also have industrial applications such as producing enzymes for laundry detergent, cheeses and other products.

The rise of commercialised [[genetically modified crops]] has provided economic benefit to farmers in many different countries, but has also been the source of most of the [[Genetically modified food controversies|controversy]] surrounding the technology. This has been present since its early use, the first field trials were destroyed by anti-GM activists. Although there is a [[scientific consensus]] that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, GM food safety is a leading concern with critics. [[Gene flow]], impact on non-target organisms, control of the food supply and [[intellectual property]] rights have also been raised as potential issues. These concerns have led to the development of a regulatory framework, which started in 1975. It has led to an international treaty, the [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], that was adopted in 2000. Individual countries have developed their own regulatory systems regarding GMOs, with the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe.

Genetic engineering is a process that alters the genetic structure of an organism by either removing or introducing [[DNA]]. Unlike traditional [[animal husbandry|animal]] and [[plant breeding]], which involves doing multiple crosses and then selecting for the organism with the desired [[phenotype]], genetic engineering takes the [[gene]] directly from one organism and inserts it in the other. This is much faster, can be used to insert any genes from any organism (even ones from different [[Domain (biology)|domains]]) and prevents other undesirable genes from also being added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/how-does-gm-differ-from-conventional-plant-breeding/|title=How does GM differ from conventional plant breeding?|website=royalsociety.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of genetic engineering}}

Humans have altered the genomes of species for thousands of years through [[selective breeding]], or artificial selection&lt;ref name=Root&gt;{{cite book|title=Domestication|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WGDYHvOHwmwC}}|first=Clive |last=Root|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Groups}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name=Zohary&gt;{{cite book |title=Domestication of Plants in the Old World: The origin and spread of plants in the old world|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=tc6vr0qzk_4C}}|first1=Daniel |last1=Zohary |first2=Maria |last2=Hopf |first3=Ehud |last3=Weiss|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} as contrasted with [[natural selection]], and more recently through [[mutagenesis]]. Genetic engineering as the direct manipulation of DNA by humans outside breeding and mutations has only existed since the 1970s.

{{main|Genetic engineering techniques}}
[[File:Master Mix with Primers form PCR.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Polymerase chain reaction]] is a powerful tool used in [[molecular cloning]]]]
Creating a GMO is a multi-step process. Genetic engineers must first choose what gene they wish to insert into the organism. This is driven by what the aim is for the resultant organism and is built on earlier research. [[Genetic screen]]s can be carried out to determine potential genes and further tests then used to identify the best candidates. The development of [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[transcriptomics]] and [[Whole genome sequencing|genome sequencing]] has made it much easier to find suitable genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWJ1CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=genetic+engineering+screen+to+find+target+genes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ExTec5lWP4&amp;sig=9jiW3UGkfeN82RHwW5H5weFHwF4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqkfmup8nTAhXKmpQKHVWMAiQQ6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=genetic%20engineering%20screen%20to%20find%20target%20genes&amp;f=false|title=Current Technologies in Plant Molecular Breeding: A Guide Book of Plant Molecular Breeding for Researchers|last=Koh|first=Hee-Jong|last2=Kwon|first2=Suk-Yoon|last3=Thomson|first3=Michael|date=2015-08-26|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9789401799966|location=|pages=242|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luck also plays its part; the round-up ready gene was discovered after scientists noticed a bacterium thriving in the presence of the herbicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/how-to-make-a-gmo/|title=How to Make a GMO - Science in the News|date=2015-08-09|work=Science in the News|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene isolation and cloning ===
{{Main|Molecular cloning}}
The next step is to isolate the candidate gene.

Before the gene is inserted into the target organism it must be combined with other genetic elements. These include a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]] region, which initiate and end [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. A [[selectable marker]] gene is added, which in most cases confers [[antibiotic resistance]], so researchers can easily determine which cells have been successfully transformed. The gene can also be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. These manipulations are carried out using [[recombinant DNA]] techniques, such as [[restriction digest]]s, ligations and molecular cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1534/genetics.109.112144 |title=Personal Reflections on the Origins and Emergence of Recombinant DNA Technology |year=2010 |last1=Berg |first1=P. |last2=Mertz |first2=J.

===Inserting DNA into the host genome===
{{Main|Gene delivery}}
[[File:Genegun.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A gene gun uses [[biolistics]] to insert DNA into plant tissue]]
There are a number of techniques available for inserting the gene into the host genome. Some bacteria can naturally [[Competence (biology)|take up foreign DNA]]. This ability can be induced in other bacteria via stress (e.g. [[heat shock|thermal]] or electric shock), which increases the cell membrane's permeability to DNA; up-taken DNA can either integrate with the genome or exist as [[extrachromosomal DNA]]. DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using [[microinjection]], where it can be injected through the cell's [[nuclear envelope]] directly into the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], or through the use of [[viral vectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chen |first=I |last2=Dubnau |first2=D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat.

The new genetic material can be inserted randomly within the host genome or targeted to a specific location. The technique of [[gene targeting]] uses [[homologous recombination]] to make desired changes to a specific [[endogenous]] gene.  This tends to occur at a relatively low frequency in plants and animals and generally requires the use of [[selectable markers]]. The frequency of gene targeting can be greatly enhanced through [[genome editing]]. Genome editing uses artificially engineered [[nuclease]]s that create specific [[double-strand breaks|double-stranded breaks]]  at desired locations in the genome, and use the cell’s endogenous mechanisms to repair the induced break by the natural processes of [[homologous recombination]] and [[Nonhomologous end joining|nonhomologous end-joining]].

== Applications ==

Genetic engineering has applications in medicine, research, industry and agriculture and can be used on a wide range of plants, animals and micro organisms. [[Bacteria]], the first organisms to be genetically modified, can have plasmid DNA inserted containing new genes that code for medicines or enzymes that process food and other [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/gmo/gmo_2.html|title=Genetic Modification of Bacteria|publisher=[[Annenberg Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panesar, Pamit et al (2010) "Enzymes in Food Processing: Fundamentals and Potential Applications", Chapter 10, I K International Publishing House, {{ISBN|978-9380026336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants have been modified for insect protection, herbicide resistance, virus resistance, enhanced nutrition, tolerance to environmental pressures and the production of edible vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtraitslist/default.asp|title=GM traits list|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commercialised GMOs are insect resistant or herbicide tolerant crop plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/43/executivesummary/default.asp|title=ISAAA Brief 43-2011: Executive Summary|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetically modified animals have been used for research, model animals and the production of agricultural or pharmaceutical products.

Genetic engineering is an important tool for [[natural scientists]]. Genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms can be inserted into bacteria for storage and modification, creating [[genetically modified bacteria]] in the process. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]], multiply quickly, relatively easy to transform and can be stored at -80&amp;nbsp;°C almost indefinitely. Once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria providing an unlimited supply for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/gmo/gmo_2.html|title=Rediscovering Biology - Online Textbook: Unit 13 Genetically Modified Organisms|website=www.learner.org|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms are genetically engineered to discover the functions of certain genes. This could be the effect on the phenotype of the organism, where the gene is expressed or what other genes it interacts with. These experiments generally involve loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression.

* '''Loss of function experiments''', such as in a [[gene knockout]] experiment, in which an organism is engineered to lack the activity of one or more genes. In a simple knockout a copy of the desired gene has been altered to make it non-functional. [[Embryonic stem cells]] incorporate the altered gene, which replaces the already present functional copy. These stem cells are injected into [[blastocyst]]s, which are implanted into surrogate mothers. This allows the experimenter to analyse the defects caused by this [[mutation]] and thereby determine the role of particular genes. It is used especially frequently in [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Walter|first6=Peter|date=2002|title=Studying Gene Expression and Function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26818/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this is done by creating a library of genes with point mutations at every position in the area of interest, or even every position in the whole gene, this is called "scanning mutagenesis". The simplest method, and the first to be used, is "alanine scanning", where every position in turn is mutated to the unreactive amino acid [[alanine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ycVoWFqDTmAC&amp;pg=PA94|title=Protein Engineering and Design|last=Park|first=Sheldon J.|last2=Cochran|first2=Jennifer R.|date=2009-09-25|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420076592|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gain of function experiments''', the logical counterpart of knockouts. These are sometimes performed in conjunction with knockout experiments to more finely establish the function of the desired gene. The process is much the same as that in knockout engineering, except that the construct is designed to increase the function of the gene, usually by providing extra copies of the gene or inducing synthesis of the protein more frequently. Gain of function is used to tell whether or not a protein is sufficient for a function, but does not always mean it's required, especially when dealing with genetic or functional redundancy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* '''Tracking experiments''', which seek to gain information about the localisation and interaction of the desired protein. One way to do this is to replace the wild-type gene with a 'fusion' gene, which is a juxtaposition of the wild-type gene with a reporting element such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) that will allow easy visualisation of the products of the genetic modification. While this is a useful technique, the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene, creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment. More sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function, such as the addition of small sequences that will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* '''Expression studies''' aim to discover where and when specific proteins are produced. In these experiments, the DNA sequence before the DNA that codes for a protein, known as a gene's [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], is reintroduced into an organism with the protein coding region replaced by a reporter gene such as GFP or an enzyme that catalyses the production of a dye. Thus the time and place where a particular protein is produced can be observed. Expression studies can be taken a step further by altering the promoter to find which pieces are crucial for the proper expression of the gene and are actually bound by transcription factor proteins; this process is known as [[promoter bashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ed4_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=genetically+engineering+%22promoter+bashing%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lBHJ-WRplM&amp;sig=9_Ai3toQAWmYrZGin9_bw3_0_QQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5qIeMueDVAhUDU7wKHcdJBhIQ6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=genetically%20engineering%20%22promoter%20bashing%22&amp;f=false|title=Techniques in Genetic Engineering|last=Kurnaz|first=Isil Aksan|date=2015-05-08|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781482260908|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms can have their cells transformed with a gene coding for a useful protein, such as an enzyme, so that they will [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|overexpress]] the desired protein.

One of the best-known and [[Genetically modified food controversies|controversial]] applications of genetic engineering is the creation and use of [[genetically modified crops]] or [[genetically modified livestock]] to produce [[genetically modified food]].

==Controversy==

{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies|}}

Critics have objected to the use of genetic engineering on several grounds, that include ethical, ecological and economic concerns. Many of these concerns involve GM crops and whether food produced from them is safe and what impact growing them will have on the environment. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=Ian M.|date=2002-03-01|title=Regulation of biotechnology: will we ever ‘freely’ trade GMOs?|url=https://academic.oup.com/erae/article-abstract/29/1/155/558037/Regulation-of-biotechnology-will-we-ever-freely|journal=European Review of Agricultural Economics|volume=29|issue=1|pages=155–176|doi=10.1093/erae/29.1.155|issn=0165-1587|citeseerx=10.1.1.596.7670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''glacier''' ({{IPAc-en|US|pron|ˈ|ɡ|l|eɪ|ʃ|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɡ|l|æ|s|i|ər}}) is a persistent body of dense [[ice]] that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of [[snow]] exceeds its [[ablation]] (melting and [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]) over many years, often [[Century|centuries]]. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating [[crevasse]]s, [[serac]]s, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as [[cirque]]s and [[moraine]]s. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner [[sea ice]] and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.

On [[Earth]], 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast [[ice sheet]]s (also known as "continental glaciers") in the [[polar region]]s, but glaciers may be found in [[mountain range]]s on every [[continent]] including Oceania's high-latitude [[oceanic island]] countries such as New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. Between 35°N and 35°S, glaciers occur only in the [[Himalayas]], [[Andes]], [[Rocky Mountains]], a few high mountains in [[East Africa]], [[Mexico]], [[New Guinea]] and on [[Zard Kuh]] in Iran.&lt;ref name="Post 2000"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Post | first1 = Austin | last2 = LaChapelle | first2 = Edward R | title = Glacier ice | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 2000 | location = Seattle, Washington | isbn = 0-295-97910-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth's land surface. Continental glaciers cover nearly {{convert|5|e6sqmi|e6km2|order=flip|abbr=unit}} or about 98 percent of Antarctica's {{convert|5.1|e6sqmi|e6km2|order=flip|abbr=unit|sigfig=3}}, with an average thickness of {{convert|7,000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}. [[Greenland]] and [[Patagonia]] also have huge expanses of continental glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Almanac of Geography, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7922-3877-X}}, page 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of [[fresh water]] on Earth.&lt;ref name=IMS&gt;{{cite web|author1=Brown, Molly Elizabeth |author2=Ouyang, Hua |author3=Habib, Shahid |author4=Shrestha, Basanta |author5=Shrestha, Mandira |author6=Panday, Prajjwal |author7=Tzortziou, Maria |author8=Policelli, Frederick |author9=Artan, Guleid |author10=Giriraj, Amarnath |author11=Bajracharya, Sagar R. |author12=Racoviteanu, Adina |title=HIMALA: Climate Impacts on Glaciers, Snow, and Hydrology in the Himalayan Region|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/20110015312|work=Mountain Research and Development|publisher=International Mountain Society|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many glaciers from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of [[meltwater]] as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a [[Water resources|water source]] that is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may be scant. Within high-altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater.

Since glacial mass is affected by long-term [[climate|climatic]] changes, e.g., [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[temperature|mean temperature]], and [[cloud cover]], [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacial mass change]]s are considered among the most sensitive indicators of [[climate change]] and are a major source of variations in [[Current sea level rise|sea level]].

A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, [[Blue ice (glacial)|appears blue]], as large quantities of [[Color of water|water appear blue]]. This is because water molecules absorb other colors more efficiently than blue. The other reason for the blue color of glaciers is the lack of air bubbles. Air bubbles, which give a white color to ice, are squeezed out by pressure increasing the density of the created ice.

==Etymology and related terms==
The word ''glacier'' is a [[loanword]] from [[French language|French]] and goes back, via [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], to the [[Vulgar Latin]] ''{{lang|la|glaciārium}}'', derived from the [[Late Latin]] ''{{lang|la|glacia}}'', and ultimately [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|glaciēs}}'', meaning "ice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=D.P. |title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary |publisher=Cassell Ltd. |year=1979 |edition=5 |location=London |page=883 |isbn=0-304-52257-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes and features caused by or related to glaciers are referred to as glacial. The process of glacier establishment, growth and flow is called [[glacial period|glaciation]]. The corresponding area of study is called [[glaciology]]. Glaciers are important components of the global [[cryosphere]].

Glaciers are categorized  by their morphology, thermal characteristics, and behavior. ''[[Cirque]] glaciers'' form on the crests and slopes of [[mountain]]s. A glacier that fills a valley is called a ''valley glacier'', or alternatively an ''alpine glacier'' or ''mountain glacier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1216/text.html |title=Glossary of Glacier Terminology |publisher=USGS |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large body of glacial ice astride a mountain, [[mountain range]], or [[volcano]] is termed an ''[[ice cap]]'' or ''[[ice field]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/juneau%20icefield.htm |title=Retreat of Alaskan glacier Juneau icefield |publisher=Nichols.edu |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice caps have an area less than {{convert|50,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} by definition.

''[[Tidewater glacier cycle|Tidewater glaciers]]'' are glaciers that terminate in the sea, including most glaciers flowing from [[Greenland]], [[Antarctica]], [[Baffin Island|Baffin]] and [[Ellesmere Island]]s in Canada, [[Southeast Alaska]], and the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s. As the ice reaches the sea, pieces break off, or calve, forming [[iceberg]]s. Most tidewater glaciers calve above sea level, which often results in a tremendous impact as the iceberg strikes the water. Tidewater glaciers undergo centuries-long [[tidewater glacier cycle|cycles of advance and retreat]] that are much less affected by the climate change than those of other glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/questions/types.html|title=What types of glaciers are there? {{!}} National Snow and Ice Data Center|website=nsidc.org|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification by thermal state ===
Thermally, a ''temperate glacier'' is at melting point throughout the year, from its surface to its base. The ice of a ''polar glacier'' is always below the freezing point from the surface to its base, although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting. A ''sub-polar glacier'' includes both temperate and polar ice, depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier. In a similar way, the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by its basal temperature. A ''cold-based glacier'' is below freezing at the ice-ground interface, and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate. A ''warm-based glacier'' is above or at freezing at the interface, and is able to slide at this contact.&lt;ref name="ColdBased"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-90-481-2642-2_72|title=Encyclopedia of Snow, Ice and Glaciers|first1=Reginald D.|last1=Lorrain|first2=Sean J.|last2=Fitzsimons|editor-first1=Vijay P.|editor-last1=Singh|editor-first2=Pratap|editor-last2=Singh|editor-first3=Umesh K.|editor-last3=Haritashya|date=18 October 2017|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=157–161|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2642-2_72/fulltext.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively [[Glacial erosion|erode its bed]], as sliding ice promotes [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]] at rock from the surface below.&lt;ref&gt;Boulton, G.S. [1974] "Processes and patterns of glacial erosion", (In Coates, D.R. ed., ''Glacial Geomorphology''.

(Publications in Geomorphology))&lt;/ref&gt; Glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as ''polythermal''.&lt;ref name="ColdBased" /&gt;

==Formation==
[[File:GornerGlacier 002.jpg|thumb|[[Gorner Glacier]] in Switzerland]]

Glaciers form where the [[Glacier ice accumulation|accumulation]] of snow and ice exceeds [[ablation]]. A glacier usually originates from a landform called '[[cirque]]' (or corrie or cwm) – a typically armchair-shaped geological feature (such as a depression between mountains enclosed by arêtes) – which collects and compresses through gravity the snow that falls into it. This snow collects and is compacted by the weight of the snow falling above it, forming [[névé]]. Further crushing of the individual snowflakes and squeezing the air from the snow turns it into "glacial ice". This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it "overflows" through a geological weakness or vacancy, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure.  On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as 15&amp;nbsp;m (50&amp;nbsp;ft) of snow-ice.

[[File:Packrafting at Spencer Glacier. Chugach National Forest, Alaska.jpg|thumb|left|A [[packraft]]er passes a wall of freshly exposed blue ice on Spencer Glacier, in Alaska. Glacial ice acts like a filter on light, and the more time light can spend traveling through ice, the bluer it becomes.]]
In temperate glaciers, snow repeatedly freezes and thaws, changing into granular ice called [[firn]]. Under the pressure of the layers of ice and snow above it, this granular ice fuses into denser and denser [[firn]]. Over a period of years, layers of firn undergo further compaction and become glacial ice. Glacier ice is slightly less dense than ice formed from frozen water because it contains tiny trapped air bubbles.

Glacial ice has a distinctive [[blue]] tint because it absorbs some red light due to an [[overtone]] of the infrared [[Infrared spectroscopy|OH stretching]] mode of the water molecule. Liquid [[water]] is blue for the same reason. The blue of glacier ice is sometimes misattributed to [[Rayleigh scattering]] due to bubbles in the ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/5C.html |title=What causes the blue color that sometimes appears in snow and ice? |publisher=Webexhibits.org |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
A glacier originates at a location called its glacier head and terminates at its glacier foot, snout, or [[Glacier terminus|terminus]].

Glaciers are broken into zones based on surface snowpack and melt conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, C.S., 1961, "Stratigraphic studies in the snow and firn of the Greenland Ice Sheet", ''Res. Rep. 70'', U.S. Army Snow, Ice and Permafrost Res Establ., Corps of Eng., 120 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ablation zone is the region where there is a net loss in glacier mass. The equilibrium line separates the ablation zone and the [[accumulation zone]]; it is the altitude where the amount of new snow gained by accumulation is equal to the amount of ice lost through ablation.  The upper part of a glacier, where accumulation exceeds ablation, is called the [[accumulation zone]]. In general, the accumulation zone accounts for 60–70% of the glacier's surface area, more if the glacier calves icebergs. Ice in the accumulation zone is deep enough to exert a downward force that erodes underlying rock.  After a glacier melts, it often leaves behind a bowl- or amphitheater-shaped depression that ranges in size from large basins like the Great Lakes to smaller mountain depressions known as [[cirque]]s.

The accumulation zone can be subdivided based on its melt conditions.
# The dry snow zone is a region where no melt occurs, even in the summer, and the snowpack remains dry.
# The percolation zone is an area with some surface melt, causing [[meltwater]] to percolate into the [[snow#Snowpack|snowpack]].  This zone is often marked by refrozen [[Ice segregation|ice lens]]es, glands, and layers.  The snowpack also never reaches melting point.
# Near the equilibrium line on some glaciers, a superimposed ice zone develops.  This zone is where meltwater refreezes as a cold layer in the glacier, forming a continuous mass of ice.
# The wet snow zone is the region where all of the snow deposited since the end of the previous summer has been raised to 0&amp;nbsp;°C.

The health of a glacier is usually assessed by determining the [[glacier mass balance]] or observing terminus behavior. Healthy glaciers have large accumulation zones, more than 60% of their area snowcovered at the end of the melt season, and a terminus with vigorous flow.

Following the [[Little Ice Age]]'s end around 1850, [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glaciers around the Earth have retreated substantially]]. A slight cooling led to the advance of many alpine glaciers between 1950 and 1985, but since 1985 glacier retreat and mass loss has become larger and increasingly ubiquitous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grid.unep.ch/activities/global_change/switzerland.php |title=Glacier change and related hazards in Switzerland |publisher=UNEP |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://folk.uio.no/kaeaeb/publications/grl04_paul.pdf |format=PDF| title= Rapid disintegration of Alpine glaciers observed with satellite data|doi=10.1029/2004GL020816 |year= 2004 |bibcode=2004GeoRL..3121402P |volume=31 |journal=Geophysical Research Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/Glacier/glacier_retreat.htm |title=Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motion==
[[File:Chevron Crevasses 00.JPG|thumb|Shear or herring-bone crevasses on [[Emmons Glacier]] ([[Mount Rainier]]); such crevasses often form near the edge of a glacier where interactions with underlying or marginal rock impede flow. In this case, the impediment appears to be some distance from the near margin of the glacier.]]
{{Main article|Ice-sheet dynamics}}
Glaciers move, or flow, downhill due to [[gravity]] and the internal deformation of ice.&lt;ref name="GreveBlatter2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Greve, R. |author2=Blatter, H. |year=2009|title=Dynamics of Ice Sheets and Glaciers|publisher=Springer|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-03415-2|isbn=978-3-642-03414-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ice behaves like a brittle solid until its thickness exceeds about 50&amp;nbsp;m (160&amp;nbsp;ft). The pressure on ice deeper than 50&amp;nbsp;m causes [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic flow]]. At the molecular level, ice consists of stacked layers of molecules with relatively weak bonds between layers. When the stress on the layer above exceeds the inter-layer binding strength, it moves faster than the layer below.&lt;ref&gt;W.S.B. Paterson, Physics of ice&lt;/ref&gt;

Glaciers also move through [[basal sliding]]. In this process, a glacier slides over the terrain on which it sits, [[lubrication|lubricated]] by the presence of liquid water.  The water is created from ice that melts under high pressure from frictional heating.  Basal sliding is dominant in temperate, or warm-based glaciers.

Although evidence in favour of glacial flow was known by the early 19th century, other theories of glacial motion were advanced, such as the idea that melt water, refreezing inside glaciers, caused the glacier to dilate and extend its length. As it became clear that glaciers behaved to some degree as if the ice were a viscous fluid, it was argued that "regelation", or the melting and refreezing of ice at a temperature lowered by the pressure on the ice inside the glacier, was what allowed the ice to deform and flow.  [[James David Forbes|James Forbes]] came up with the essentially correct explanation in the 1840s, although it was several decades before it was fully accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= A short history of scientific investigations on glaciers|year= 1987 |volume=Special issue |journal=Journal of Glaciology|pages= 4–5|author=Clarke, Garry K.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pexels-photo-25416.jpg|thumb|Perito Moreno glacier]]

===Fracture zone and cracks===
[[File:TitlisIceCracks.jpg|thumb|Ice cracks in the [[Titlis]] Glacier]]
The top {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure. This upper section is known as the ''fracture zone'' and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called [[crevasse]]s develop in the fracture zone.  Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity.  If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, [[Shear (geology)|shear]] forces cause them to break apart, opening  a crevasse.  Crevasses are seldom more than {{convert|150|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} deep but in some cases can be {{convert|1000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.  Intersecting crevasses can create isolated peaks in the ice, called [[serac]]s.

Crevasses can form in several different ways.  Transverse crevasses are transverse to flow and form where steeper slopes cause a glacier to accelerate.  Longitudinal crevasses form semi-parallel to flow where a glacier expands laterally.  Marginal crevasses form from the edge of the glacier, due to the reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls.  Marginal crevasses are usually largely transverse to flow.  Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above, forming a [[bergschrund]].  Bergschrunds resemble crevasses but are singular features at a glacier's margins.

Crevasses make travel over glaciers hazardous, especially when they are hidden by fragile [[snow bridge]]s.

[[File:Glaciereaston.jpg|thumb|upright|Crossing a crevasse on the [[Easton Glacier]], [[Mount Baker]], in the [[North Cascades]], United States]]

Below the equilibrium line, glacial meltwater is concentrated in stream channels.  Meltwater can pool in proglacial lakes on top of a glacier or descend into the depths of a glacier via [[Moulin (geomorphology)|moulins]]. Streams within or beneath a glacier flow in englacial or sub-glacial tunnels.  These tunnels sometimes reemerge at the glacier's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/moulin-20061211.html |title=Moulin 'Blanc': NASA Expedition Probes Deep Within a Greenland Glacier |publisher=NASA |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed===
The speed of glacial displacement is partly determined by [[friction]]. Friction makes the ice at the bottom of the glacier move more slowly than ice at the top. In alpine glaciers, friction is also generated at the valley's side walls, which slows the edges relative to the center.

Mean speeds vary greatly, but is typically around {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/ncc/Notes/chap3.landforms/erosion.deposition/glaciers.htm|title=Glaciers|website=www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu|access-date=2014-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222172708/http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/ncc/Notes/chap3.landforms/erosion.deposition/glaciers.htm|archive-date=2014-02-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be no motion in stagnant areas; for example, in parts of [[Alaska]], trees can establish themselves on surface sediment deposits. In other cases, glaciers can move as fast as {{convert|20|–|30|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} per day, such as in Greenland's [[Jakobshavn Isbræ]] ({{lang-kl|Sermeq Kujalleq}}).  Velocity increases with increasing slope, increasing thickness, increasing snowfall, increasing longitudinal confinement, increasing basal temperature, increasing meltwater production and reduced bed hardness.

A few glaciers have periods of very rapid advancement called [[Surge (glacier)|surges]]. These glaciers exhibit normal movement until suddenly they accelerate, then return to their previous state. During these surges, the glacier may reach velocities far greater than normal speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth.esa.int/pub/ESA_DOC/gothenburg/154stroz.pdf T.

In glaciated areas where the glacier moves faster than one km per year, [[glacial earthquake]]s occur.  These are large scale [[earthquake]]s that have seismic magnitudes as high as 6.1.&lt;ref name="people.deas.harvard.edu"&gt;[http://people.deas.harvard.edu/~vtsai/files/EkstromNettlesTsai_Science2006.pdf "Seasonality and Increasing Frequency of Greenland Glacial Earthquakes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007062935/http://people.deas.harvard.edu/~vtsai/files/EkstromNettlesTsai_Science2006.pdf |date=2008-10-07 }}, Ekström, G., M.

''Ogives'' (or ''Forbes bands'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Summerfield|first = Michael A.|title = Global Geomorphology| year = 1991| p = 269}}&lt;/ref&gt; are alternating wave crests and valleys that appear as dark and light bands of ice on glacier surfaces.  They are linked to seasonal motion of glaciers; the width of one dark and one light band generally equals the annual movement of the glacier.  Ogives are formed when ice from an icefall is severely broken up, increasing ablation surface area during summer.  This creates a [[swale (landform)|swale]] and space for snow accumulation in the winter, which in turn creates a ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Easterbrook  | first = D.J.  | title = Surface Processes and Landforms  | publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc.  | year = 1999   | edition = 2 | location = New Jersey  | page = 546  | isbn = 0-13-860958-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes ogives consist only of undulations or color bands and are described as wave ogives or band ogives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1216/no/no.html |title=Glossary of Glacier Terminology |publisher=Pubs.usgs.gov |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountain glaciers are widespread, especially in the [[Andes]], the [[Himalayas]], the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Scandinavian mountains]] and the [[Alps]].

The permanent snow cover necessary for glacier formation is affected by factors such as the degree of [[slope]] on the land, amount of snowfall and the [[wind]]s. Glaciers can be found in all [[latitude]]s except from 20° to 27° north and south of the equator where the presence of the descending limb of the [[Hadley circulation]] lowers precipitation so much that with high [[insolation]] [[snow line]]s reach above {{convert|6500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Between 19˚N and 19˚S, however, precipitation is higher and the mountains above {{convert|5000|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} usually have permanent snow.

Even at high latitudes, glacier formation is not inevitable.  Areas of the [[Arctic]], such as [[Banks Island]], and the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] in Antarctica are considered [[polar desert]]s where glaciers cannot form because they receive little snowfall despite the bitter cold.  Cold air, unlike warm air, is unable to transport much water vapor.

In addition to the dry, unglaciated polar regions, some mountains and volcanoes in Bolivia, Chile and Argentina are high ({{convert|4500|to|6900|m|ft|-2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and cold, but the relative lack of precipitation prevents snow from accumulating into glaciers. This is because these peaks are located near or in the [[hyperarid]] [[Atacama Desert]].

== Glacial geology ==
[[File:Arranque glaciar-en.svg|thumb|Diagram of glacial plucking and abrasion]]
[[File:PluckedGraniteAlandIslands.JPG|thumb|right|Glacially plucked granitic bedrock near Mariehamn, [[Åland Islands]]]]
Glaciers erode terrain through two principal processes: '''[[abrasion (geology)|abrasion]]''' and '''[[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]].

As glaciers flow over bedrock, they soften and lift blocks of rock into the ice. This process, called plucking, is caused by subglacial water that penetrates fractures in the bedrock and subsequently freezes and expands. This expansion causes the ice to act as a lever that loosens the rock by lifting it. Thus, sediments of all sizes become part of the glacier's load. If a retreating glacier gains enough debris, it may become a [[rock glacier]], like the [[Timpanogos Glacier]] in Utah.

Abrasion occurs when the ice and its load of rock fragments slide over bedrock and function as sandpaper, smoothing and polishing the bedrock below.  The pulverized rock this process produces is called [[rock flour]] and is made up of rock grains  between 0.002 and 0.00625&amp;nbsp;mm in size.  Abrasion leads to steeper valley walls and mountain slopes in alpine settings, which can cause avalanches and rock slides, which add even more material to the glacier.

Glacial abrasion is commonly characterized by [[glacial striation]]s.  Glaciers produce these when they contain large boulders that carve long scratches in the bedrock.  By [[cartography|mapping]] the direction of the striations, researchers can determine the direction of the glacier's movement.  Similar to striations are [[chatter mark]]s, lines of crescent-shape depressions in the rock underlying a glacier.  They are formed by abrasion when boulders in the glacier are repeatedly caught and released as they are dragged along the bedrock.

The rate of glacier erosion varies. Six factors control erosion rate:
* Velocity of glacial movement
* Thickness of the ice
* Shape, abundance and hardness of rock fragments contained in the ice at the bottom of the glacier
* Relative ease of erosion of the surface under the glacier
* Thermal conditions at the glacier base
* Permeability and water pressure at the glacier base
When the bedrock has frequent fractures on the surface, glacial erosion rates tend to increase as plucking is the main erosive force on the surface; when the bedrock has wide gaps between sporadic fractures, however, abrasion tends to be the dominant erosive form and glacial erosion rates become slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dühnforth|first=Miriam|last2=Anderson|first2=Robert S.|last3=Ward|first3=Dylan|last4=Stock|first4=Greg M.|date=2010-05-01|title=Bedrock fracture control of glacial erosion processes and rates|url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/38/5/423|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=38|issue=5|pages=423–426|doi=10.1130/G30576.1|issn=0091-7613|bibcode=2010Geo....38..423D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glaciers in lower latitudes tend to be much more erosive than glaciers in higher latitudes, because they have more meltwater reaching the glacial base and facilitate sediment production and transport under the same moving speed and amount of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koppes|first=Michéle|last2=Hallet|first2=Bernard|last3=Rignot|first3=Eric|last4=Mouginot|first4=Jérémie|last5=Wellner|first5=Julia Smith|last6=Boldt|first6=Katherine|title=Observed latitudinal variations in erosion as a function of glacier dynamics|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature15385|journal=Nature|volume=526|issue=7571|pages=100–103|doi=10.1038/nature15385|bibcode=2015Natur.526..100K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Material that becomes incorporated in a glacier is typically carried as far as the [[zone of ablation]] before being deposited. Glacial deposits are of two distinct types:
* ''Glacial till'': material directly deposited from glacial ice. Till includes a mixture of undifferentiated material ranging from clay size to boulders, the usual composition of a moraine.
* ''Fluvial and outwash sediments'': sediments deposited by water. These deposits are stratified by size.

Larger pieces of rock that are encrusted in till or deposited on the surface are called "[[glacial erratic]]s".  They range in size from pebbles to boulders, but as they are often moved great distances, they may be drastically different from the material upon which they are found.  Patterns of glacial erratics hint at past glacial motions.

===Moraines===
[[File:MorainesLakeLouise.JPG|thumb|Glacial moraines above [[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]], [[Alberta]], Canada]]
Glacial [[moraine]]s are formed by the deposition of material from a glacier and are exposed after the glacier has retreated.  They usually appear as linear mounds of [[till]], a non-sorted mixture of rock, gravel and boulders within a matrix of a fine powdery material. Terminal or end moraines are formed at the foot or terminal end of a glacier. Lateral moraines are formed on the sides of the glacier. Medial moraines are formed when two different glaciers merge and the lateral moraines of each coalesce to form a moraine in the middle of the combined glacier. Less apparent are [[ground moraine]]s, also called ''glacial drift'', which often blankets the surface underneath the glacier downslope from the equilibrium line.

The term ''moraine'' is of French origin.  It was coined by peasants to describe alluvial embankments and rims found near the margins of glaciers in the French [[Alps]]. In modern geology, the term is used more broadly, and is applied to a series of formations, all of which are composed of till. Moraines can also create moraine dammed lakes.

=== Drumlins ===
[[File:Drumlins LMB.svg|frame|right|A drumlin field forms after a glacier has modified the landscape. The teardrop-shaped formations denote the direction of the ice flow.]]
[[Drumlin]]s are asymmetrical, canoe shaped hills made mainly of till. Their heights vary from 15 to 50&amp;nbsp;meters and they can reach a kilometer in length. The steepest side of the hill faces the direction from which the ice advanced (''stoss''), while a longer slope is left in the ice's direction of movement (''lee'').

Drumlins are found in groups called ''[[drumlin field]]s'' or ''drumlin camps''. One of these fields is found east of [[Rochester, New York]]; it is estimated to contain about 10,000 drumlins.

Although the process that forms drumlins is not fully understood, their shape implies that they are products of the plastic deformation zone of ancient glaciers. It is believed that many drumlins were formed when glaciers advanced over and altered the deposits of earlier glaciers.

==={{anchor|Glacial valleys}}Glacial valleys, cirques, arêtes, and pyramidal peaks===
[[File:Glacial landscape.svg|right|thumb|Features of a glacial landscape]]

Before glaciation, mountain valleys have a characteristic [[V-shaped valley|"V" shape]], produced by eroding water. During glaciation, these valleys are often widened, deepened and smoothed to form a [[U-shaped valley|"U"-shaped]] glacial valley or glacial trough, as it is sometimes called.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/gallery/troughs.html] Glacial Landforms: Trough&lt;/ref&gt;  The erosion that creates glacial valleys truncates any spurs of rock or earth that may have earlier extended across the valley, creating broadly triangular-shaped cliffs called [[truncated spurs]].  Within glacial valleys, depressions created by plucking and abrasion can be filled by lakes, called [[paternoster lake]]s.  If a glacial valley runs into a large body of water, it forms a [[fjord]].

Typically glaciers deepen their valleys more than their smaller [[tributary|tributaries]]. Therefore, when glaciers recede, the valleys of the tributary glaciers remain above the main glacier's depression and are called [[hanging valley]]s.

At the start of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped [[cirque]], which has escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the valley. Cirques are where ice begins to accumulate in a glacier.  Two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge, called an [[arête]] is left. This structure may result in a [[mountain pass]].  If multiple cirques encircle a single mountain, they create pointed [[pyramidal peak]]s; particularly steep examples are called [[Glacial horn|horn]]s.

===Roches moutonnées===
Passage of glacial ice over an area of bedrock may cause the rock to be sculpted into a knoll called a ''[[roche moutonnée]],'' or "sheepback" rock. Roches moutonnées may be elongated, rounded and asymmetrical in shape. They range in length from less than a meter to several hundred meters long.&lt;ref&gt;'Glaciers &amp; Glaciation' (Arnold, London 1998) Douglas Benn and David Evans, pp324-326&lt;/ref&gt;  Roches moutonnées have a gentle slope on their up-glacier sides and a steep to vertical face on their down-glacier sides. The glacier abrades the smooth slope on the upstream side as it flows along, but tears rock fragments loose and carries them away from the downstream side via [[plucking (glaciation)|plucking]].

===Alluvial stratification===
As the water that rises from the [[ablation zone]] moves away from the glacier, it carries fine eroded sediments with it.  As the speed of the water decreases, so does its capacity to carry objects in suspension. The water thus gradually deposits the sediment as it runs, creating an [[alluvial plain]]. When this phenomenon occurs in a valley, it is called a ''valley train''. When the deposition is in an [[estuary]], the sediments are known as [[bay mud]].

Outwash plains and valley trains are usually accompanied by basins known as "[[Kettle (landform)|kettles]]". These are small lakes formed when large ice blocks that are trapped in alluvium melt and produce water-filled depressions. Kettle diameters range from 5&amp;nbsp;m to 13&amp;nbsp;km, with depths of up to 45&amp;nbsp;meters.  Most are circular in shape because the blocks of ice that formed them were rounded as they melted.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web | title =Kettle geology |publisher=Britannica Online | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/315739/kettle | accessdate = 2009-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glacial deposits===
[[File:Receding glacier-en.svg|thumb|Landscape produced by a receding glacier]]
When a glacier's size shrinks below a critical point, its flow stops and it becomes stationary. Meanwhile, meltwater within and beneath the ice leaves [[Stratigraphy|stratified]] alluvial deposits. These deposits, in the forms of columns, [[Terrace (geology)|terraces]] and clusters, remain after the glacier melts and are known as "glacial deposits".

Glacial deposits that take the shape of hills or mounds are called ''[[kame]]s''. Some kames form when meltwater deposits sediments through openings in the interior of the ice. Others are produced by fans or [[river delta|deltas]] created by meltwater.  When the glacial ice occupies a valley, it can form terraces or kames along the sides of the valley.

Long, sinuous glacial deposits are called ''[[eskers]]''.  Eskers are composed of sand and gravel that was deposited by meltwater streams that flowed through ice tunnels within or beneath a glacier. They remain after the ice melts, with heights exceeding 100&amp;nbsp;meters and lengths of as long as 100&amp;nbsp;km.

===Loess deposits===
Very fine glacial sediments or [[rock flour]] is often picked up by wind blowing over the bare surface and may be deposited great distances from the original fluvial deposition site. These [[Eolian processes|eolian]] [[loess]] deposits may be very deep, even hundreds of meters, as in areas of China and the Midwestern United States of America. [[Katabatic wind]]s can be important in this process.

==Isostatic rebound==
{{Main article|Post-glacial rebound}}
[[File:Glacier weight effects LMB.png|right|frame|Isostatic pressure by a glacier on the Earth's crust]]
Large masses, such as ice sheets or glaciers, can depress the crust of the Earth into the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UYrRG2ocHoC&amp;pg=PT95&amp;dq=Large+masses,+such+as+ice+sheets+and+glaciers,+can+depress+the+crust+of+the+Earth+into+the+mantle.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9uPj-_bvUAhUR2mMKHaWYAQ4Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Large%20masses,%20such%20as%20ice%20sheets%20and%20glaciers,%20can%20depress%20the%20crust%20of%20the%20Earth%20into%20the%20mantle.&amp;f=false|title=Global Warming Cycles: Ice Ages and Glacial Retreat|last=Casper|first=Julie Kerr|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816072620|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The depression usually totals a third of the ice sheet or glacier's thickness.   After the ice sheet or glacier melts, the mantle begins to flow back to its original position, pushing the crust back up. This [[post-glacial rebound]], which proceeds very slowly after the melting of the ice sheet or glacier, is currently occurring in measurable amounts in [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Great Lakes]] region of North America.

A geomorphological feature created by the same process on a smaller scale is known as ''dilation-faulting''. It occurs where previously compressed rock is allowed to return to its original shape more rapidly than can be maintained without faulting.  This leads to an effect similar to what would be seen if the rock were hit by a large hammer. Dilation faulting can be observed in recently de-glaciated parts of Iceland and Cumbria.

==On Mars==
[[File:Mars north pole.jpg|thumb|left|Northern [[polar ice cap]] on [[Mars]]]]
{{main article|Glaciers on Mars}}
The polar [[ice cap]]s of [[Mars]] show geologic evidence of glacial deposits. The south polar cap is especially comparable to glaciers on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/polar2003/pdf/8112.pdf |title=Kargel, J.S. et al.:'&amp;#39;Martian Polar Ice Sheets and Mid-Latitude Debris-Rich Glaciers, and Terrestrial Analogs'&amp;#39;, Third International Conference on Mars Polar Science and Exploration, Alberta, Canada, October 13–17, 2003 (pdf 970 Kb) |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topographical features and computer models indicate the existence of more glaciers in Mars' past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMS3PMZCIE_0.html |title=Martian glaciers: did they originate from the atmosphere?

At mid-latitudes, between 35° and 65° north or south, Martian glaciers are affected by the thin Martian atmosphere. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, ablation near the surface is solely due to [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], not [[melting]]. As on Earth, many glaciers are covered with a layer of rocks which insulates the ice. A radar instrument on board the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] found ice under a thin layer of rocks in formations called [[lobate debris apron]]s (LDAs).&lt;ref&gt;Head, J. et al.  2005.

*[[Anjan Chakravartty]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/scientific-realism "Scientific realism"], §4 "Antirealism: Foils for scientific realism: §4.1: "Empiricism", in [[Edward N. Zalta]], ed, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', Summer 2013 edn: "Traditionally, instrumentalists maintain that terms for unobservables, by themselves, have no meaning; construed literally, statements involving them are not even candidates for truth or falsity.  The most influential advocates of instrumentalism were the [[logical empiricist]]s (or logical positivists), including [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] and [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]], famously associated with the [[Vienna Circle]] group of philosophers and scientists as well as important contributors elsewhere.  In order to rationalize the ubiquitous use of terms which might otherwise be taken to refer to unobservables in scientific discourse, they adopted a non-literal [[semantics]] according to which these terms acquire meaning by being associated with terms for observables (for example, '[[electron]]' might mean 'white streak in a [[cloud chamber]]'), or with demonstrable laboratory procedures (a view called '[[operationalism]]').  Insuperable difficulties with this semantics led ultimately (in large measure) to the demise of [[logical empiricism]] and the growth of [[scientific realism|realism]].  The contrast here is not merely in [[semantics]] and [[epistemology]]: a number of logical empiricists also held the [[neo-Kantian]] view that [[ontological]] questions 'external' to the frameworks for knowledge represented by theories are also meaningless (the choice of a framework is made solely on [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] grounds), thereby rejecting the [[metaphysical]] dimension of [[scientific realism|realism]] (as in Carnap 1950)".

*Samir Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), [http://books.google.com/books?id=W2jCrzKYqxMC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]: "Strictly we should distinguish two sorts of anti-realism.  According to the first sort, talk of unobservable entities is not to be understood literally at all.  So when a scientist pus forward a theory about electrons, for example, we should not take him to be asserting the existence of entities called 'electrons'.  Rather, his talk of electrons is metaphorical.  This form of anti-realism was popular in the first half of the 20th century, but few people advocate it today.  It was motivated largely by a doctrine in the philosophy of language, according to which it is not possible to make meaningful assertions about things that cannot in principle be observed, a doctrine that few contemporary philosophers accept.  The second sort of anti-realism accepts that talk of unobservable entities should be taken at face value: if a theory says that electrons are negatively charged, it is true if electrons do exist and are negatively charged, but false otherwise.  But we will never know which, says the anti-realist.  So the correct attitude towards the claims that scientists make about unobservable reality is one of total agnosticism.  They are either true or false, but we are incapable of finding out which.  Most modern anti-realism is of this second sort".&lt;/ref&gt;  According to instrumentalists scientific theory is merely a tool whereby humans ''predict'' observations in a particular domain of nature by formulating laws, which state or summarize regularities, while theories themselves do not reveal supposedly hidden aspects of nature that somehow ''explain'' these laws.&lt;ref name=Torretti-Duhem/&gt;  Initially a novel perspective introduced by [[Pierre Duhem]] in 1906, instrumentalism is largely the prevailing theory that underpins the practice of physicists today.&lt;ref name=Torretti-Duhem&gt;Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [http://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA242&amp;dq=Duhem#v=twopage pp. 242–43]: "Like [[William Whewell|Whewell]] and [[Ernst Mach|Mach]], Duhem was a practicing scientist who devoted an important part of his adult life to the history and philosophy of physics.  ...  His philosophy is contained in ''La théorie physique: son objet, sa structure'' [''The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory''] (1906), which may well be, to this day, the best overall book on the subject.  Its main theses, although quite novel when first put forward, have in the meantime become commonplace, so I shall review them summarily without detailed argument, just to associate them with his name.  But first I ought to say that neither in the first nor in the second (1914) edition of his book did Duhem take into account—or even so much as mention—the deep changes that were then taking place in physics.  Still, the subsequent success and current entrenchment of Duhem's ideas are due above all to their remarkable agreement with—and the light they throw on—the practice of mathematical physics in the twentieth century.  In the first part of ''La théorie physique'', Duhem contrasts two opinions concerning the aim of physical theory.  For some authors, it ought to furnish 'the ''explanation'' of a set of experimentally established laws', while for others it is 'an abstract system whose aim is to ''summarize'' and ''logically classify'' a set of experimental laws, without pretending to explain these laws' (Duhem 1914, p. 3).  Duhem resolutely sides with the latter.  His rejection of the former rests on his understanding of 'explanation' ('explication' in French), which he expresses as follows: 'To explain, ''explicare'', is to divest ''reality'' from the ''appearances'' which enfold it like veils, in order to see the reality face to face' (pp 3–4).  Authors in the first group expect from physics the true vision of [[ding-an-sich|things-in-themselves]] that religious myth and philosophical speculation have hitherto been unable to supply.  Their explanation makes no sense unless (i) there is, 'beneath the sense appearances revealed to us by our perceptions, [...] a reality different from these appearances' and (ii) we know 'the nature of the elements which constitute' that reality (p 7).  Thus, physical theory cannot explain—in the stated sense—the laws established by experiment unless it depends on metaphysics and thus remains subject to the interminable disputes of metaphysicians.  Worse still, the teachings of no metaphysical school are sufficiently detailed and precise to account for all of the elements of physical theory (p 18).  Duhem instead assigns to physical theories a more modest but autonomous and readily attainable aim: 'A physical theory is not an explanation.  It is a system of mathematical propositions, derived from a small number of principles, whose purpose is to represent a set of experimental laws as simply, as completely, and as exactly as possible (Duhem 1914, p. 24)".&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejecting [[scientific realism]]'s ambitions to uncover metaphysical truth about nature,&lt;ref name=Torretti-Duhem/&gt; instrumentalism is usually categorized as an ''antirealism'', although its mere lack of commitment to scientific theory's realism can be termed ''nonrealism''.  Instrumentalism merely bypasses debate concerning whether, for example, a ''particle'' spoken about in [[particle physics]] is a discrete entity enjoying individual existence, or is an ''excitation mode'' of a region of a field, or is something else altogether.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;P Kyle Stanford, ''Exceeding Our Grasp: Science, History, and the Problem of Unconceived Alternatives'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), [http://books.google.com/books?id=_JIxeQ_sfzwC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=instrumentalism+particle+physics p. 198].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Torretti-pp396-97&gt;Roberto Torretti, ''The Philosophy of Physics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), [http://books.google.com/books?id=vg_wxiLRvvYC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=#v=twopage pp. 396–97], including quote: "First, quantum field theories have been the working theories at the frontline of physics for over 30 years.  Second, these theories appear to do away with the familiar conception of physical systems as aggregates of substantive individual particles.  This conception was already undermined by [[Bose–Einstein statistics|Bose–Einstein]] and [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] (§6.1.4), according to which the so-called particles cannot be assigned a definite trajectory in ordinary space.  But quantum field theories go a long step further and—or so it would seem—conceive 'particles' as excitation modes of the field.  This, I presume, motivated Howard Stein's saying that 'the quantum theory of fields is the contemporary locus of metaphysical research' (1970, p. 285).  Finally, the very fact that physicists conspicuously and fruitfully resort to unperspicacious theories can teach us something about the aim and reach of science.  Here is how physicists work, dirty-handed, in their everyday practice, a far cry from what is taught at the Sunday school of the 'scientific worldview' ".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann&gt;Meinard Kuhlmann, [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/physicists-debate-whether-world-made-of-particles-fields-or-something-else "Physicists debate whether the world is made of particles or fields—or something else entirely], ''Scientific American'', 2013 Aug;'''309'''(2).&lt;/ref&gt;  Instrumentalism holds that theoretical terms need only be useful to predict the phenomena, the observed outcomes.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

Instrumentalism is a variety of [[scientific anti-realism]].

==History==
===British empiricism===
{{main|British empiricism}}
Newton's theory of motion, whereby any object instantly interacts with all other objects across the universe, motivated the founder of [[British empiricism]], [[John Locke]], to speculate that matter is capable of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;  The next leading British empiricist, [[George Berkeley]], argued that an object's putative primary qualities as recognized by scientists, such as shape, extension, and impenetrability, are inconceivable without the putative secondary qualities of color, hardness, warmth, and so on. He also posed the question how or why an object could be properly conceived to exist independently of any perception of it.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt;  Berkeley did not object to everyday talk about the reality of objects, but instead took issue with philosophers' talk, who spoke as if they knew something beyond sensory impressions that ordinary folk did not.&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Berkeley, a scientific theory does not state causes or explanations, but simply identifies perceived types of objects and traces their typical regularities.&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"/&gt;  Berkeley thus anticipated the basis of what [[Auguste Comte]] in the 1830s called ''positivism'',&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"/&gt; although Comtean positivism added other principles concerning the scope, method, and uses of science that Berkeley would have disavowed.  Berkeley also noted the usefulness of a scientific theory having terms that merely serve to aid calculations without their having to refer to anything in particular, so long as they proved useful in practice.&lt;ref name="Torretti 1999 p. 102"/&gt;  Berkeley thus predated the insight that Logical Positivists-who originated in the late 1920s, but who, by the 1950s, had softened into Logical Empiricists-would be compelled to accept: theoretical terms in science do not always translate into observational terms.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last great British empiricist, [[David Hume]], posed a number of challenges to Bacon's inductivism, which had been the prevailing, or at least the professed view concerning the attainment of scientific knowledge.  Regarding himself as having placed his own [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] on par with Newton's theory of motion, Hume supposed that he had championed inductivism over scientific realism.  Upon reading Hume's work, Immanuel Kant was "awakened from dogmatic slumber", and thus sought to neutralise any threat to science posed by Humean empiricism.  Kant would develop the first stark philosophy of physics.&lt;ref&gt;Torretti 1999 p. 98: "I shall dwell at some length on Kant's conception of the sources and scope of Newton's conceptual frame, for it was the first full-blown philosophy of physics and remains to this day the most significant".&lt;/ref&gt;

===German idealism===
{{main|German idealism}}
To save Newton's law of universal gravitation, [[Immanuel Kant]] reasoned that the mind is the precondition of experience and so, as the bridge from the [[noumena]], which are how the world's [[ding-an-sich|things exist in themselves]], to the [[phenomena]], which are humans' recognized experiences.  And so mind itself contains the structure that determines ''space'', ''time'', and ''substance'', how mind's own categorization of noumena renders space Euclidean, time constant, and objects' motions exhibiting the very determinism predicted by Newtonian.  Kant apparently presumed that the human mind, rather than a phenomenon itself that had evolved, had been predetermined and set forth upon the creation of humankind.  In any event, the mind also was the veil of appearance that scientific methods could never lift.  And yet the mind could ponder itself and discover such truths.  Kant's metaphysics, then, [[transcendental idealism]], secured science from doubt, and yet discarded hope of scientific realism.  Meanwhile, it was a watershed for idealist metaphysics, and launched [[German idealism]], most influentially [[Hegel]]'s [[absolute idealism]] or objective idealism, or at least interpretations, often misinterpretations, and political misuses, of it.

===Logical empiricism===
{{main|Logical empiricism}}
According the mind virtually no power to know anything beyond direct sensory experience, [[Ernst Mach]]'s early version of [[logical positivism]] ([[empirio-criticism]]) verged on idealism.  It was alleged to even be a surreptitious [[solipsism]], whereby all that exists is one's own mind.  Mach's positivism also strongly asserted the ultimate [[unity of science|unity of the empirical science]]s.  Mach's positivism asserted [[phenomenalism]] as to new basis of scientific theory, all scientific terms to refer to either actual or potential sensations, thus eliminating hypotheses while permitting such seemingly disparate scientific theories as physical and psychological to share terms and forms.  Phenomenalism was insuperably difficult to implement, yet heavily influenced a new generation of philosophers of science, who emerged in the 1920s while terming themselves ''logical positivists'' while pursuing a program termed ''[[verificationism]]''.  Logical positivists aimed not to instruct or restrict scientists, but to enlighten and structure philosophical discourse to render ''scientific philosophy'' that would verify philosophical statements as well as scientific theories, and align all human knowledge into a ''scientific worldview'', freeing humankind from so many of its problems due to confused or unclear language.

The verificationists expected a strict gap between ''theory'' versus ''observation'', mirrored by a theory's ''[[theoretical term]]s'' versus ''[[observable term]]s''.  Believing a theory's posited unobservables to always correspond to observations, the verificationists viewed a scientific theory's theoretical terms, such as ''electron'', as metaphorical or elliptical at observations, such as ''white streak in [[cloud chamber]]''.  They believed that scientific terms lacked meanings unto themselves, but acquired meanings from the logical structure that was the entire theory that in turn matched ''patterns of experience''.  So by translating theoretical terms into observational terms and then decoding the theory's mathematical/logical structure, one could check whether the statement indeed matched patterns of experience, and thereby verify the scientific theory false or true.  Such verification would be possible, as never before in science, since translation of theoretical terms into observational terms would make the scientific theory purely empirical, none metaphysical.  Yet the logical positivists ran into insuperable difficulties.  [[Moritz Schlick]] debated with [[Otto Neurath]] over [[foundationalism]]—the traditional view traced to Descartes as founder of modern Western philosophy—whereupon only nonfoundationalism was found tenable.  Science, then, could not find a secure foundation of indubitable truth.

And since science aims to reveal not private but public truths, verificationists switched from phenomenalism to [[physicalism]], whereby scientific theory refers to objects observable in space and at least in principle already recognizable by physicists.  Finding strict empiricism untenable, verificationism underwent "liberalization of empiricism".  [[Rudolf Carnap]] even suggested that empiricism's basis was pragmatic.  Recognizing that verification—proving a theory false or true—was unattainable, they discarded that demand and focused on ''confirmation theory''.  Carnap sought simply to quantify a universal law's ''degree of confirmation''—its probable truth—but, despite his great mathematical and logical skill, discovered equations never operable to yield over ''zero'' degree of confirmation. [[Carl Hempel]] found the [[Raven paradox|paradox of confirmation]].  By the 1950s, the verificationists had established philosophy of science as subdiscipline within academia's philosophy departments.  By 1962, verificationists had asked and endeavored to answer seemingly all the great questions about scientific theory.  Their discoveries showed that the idealized ''scientific worldview'' was naively mistaken.  By then the leader of the legendary venture, Hempel raised the white flag that signaled verificationism's demise.  Suddenly striking Western society, then, was Kuhn's landmark thesis, introduced by none other than Carnap, verificationism's greatest firebrand.  Instrumentalism exhibited by ''scientists'' often does not even discern unobservable from observable entities.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

===Historical turn===
{{main|Historical turn}}
From the 1930s until [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', there were roughly two prevailing views about the nature of science.  The popular view was [[scientific realism]], which usually involved a belief that science was progressively unveiling a truer view, and building a better understanding, of nature.  The professional approach was [[logical empiricism]], wherein a scientific theory was held to be a logical structure whose terms all ultimately refer to some form of observation, while an objective process neutrally arbiters theory choice, compelling scientists to decide which scientific theory was superior.  Physicists knew better, but, busy developing the [[Standard Model]], were so steeped in developing [[quantum field theory]], that their talk, largely metaphorical, perhaps even metaphysical, was unintelligible to the public, while the steep mathematics warded off philosophers of physics.&lt;ref name=Torretti-pp396-97/&gt;  By the 1980s, physicists regarded not ''particles'', but ''fields'' as the more fundamental, and no longer even hoped to discover what entities and processes might be truly fundamental to nature, perhaps not even the field.&lt;ref name=Torretti-pp396-97/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhlmann/&gt;  Kuhn had not claimed to have developed a novel thesis, but instead hoped to synthesize more usefully recent developments in the philosophy of science.

In 1906, Duhem had introduced the problem of the [[underdetermination|underdetermination of theory by data]], since any dataset could be consistent with several different explanations, how the success of any prediction does not, by [[affirming the consequent]], a [[deductive fallacy]], logically confirm the truth of the theory in question.  In the 1930s, [[Ludwik Fleck]] had explained the role of [[perspectivism]] ([[logology]]) in science whereby scientists are trained in ''thought collectives'' to adopt particular ''thought styles'' setting expectations for a proper scientific question, scientific experiment, and scientific data.  Scientists manipulate experimental conditions to obtain results that cohere with their own expectations—what the scientists presuppose is realistic—and as a result might be tempted to invoke the [[experimenter's regress]] in order to reject unexpected results. They would then redo these experiments under what were supposedly better and more conducive conditions.  By the 1960s, physicists recognized two, differing roles of physical theory, ''formalism'' and ''interpretation''. Formalism involved mathematical equations and axioms that, upon input of physical data, yielded certain predictions.  Interpretation sought to explain ''why'' they succeeded. 

Widely read, Kuhn's 1962 thesis seemed to shatter logical empiricism, whose paradigmatic science was physics and which championed instrumentalism.  Yet scientific realists, who were far more tenacious, responded by attacking Kuhn's thesis, perennially depicted thereafter as either illuminated or infamous.  Kuhn later indicated that his thesis had been so widely misunderstood that he himself was not a ''Kuhnian''.  With logical empiricism's demise, [[Karl Popper]]'s falsificationism was in the ascendancy, and Popper was knighted in 1965. Yet in 1961, the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] had made its first major empirical breakthrough in cracking the ''genetic code''. By the 1970s, [[molecular genetics]]' research tools could also be used for [[genetic engineering]].  In 1975, philosopher of science Hilary Putnam famously resurrected scientific realism with his ''no miracles'' argument, whereby the best scientific theories' predictive successes would appear miraculous if those theories were not at least ''approximately'' true about reality as it exists in and of itself beyond human perception.  Antirealist arguments were formulated in response.

===Revival of realism===
{{main|Scientific realism}}
By rejecting all variants of positivism via its focus on sensations rather than realism, [[Karl Popper]] asserted his commitment to scientific realism, merely via the necessary uncertainty of his own [[falsificationism]].   Popper alleged that instrumentalism reduces basic science to what is merely applied science.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (London: Routledge, 2003 [1963]), {{ISBN|0-415-28594-1}}, quote: "Instrumentalism can be formulated as the thesis that scientific theories—the theories of the so-called 'pure' sciences—are nothing but computational rules (or inference rules); of the same character, fundamentally, as the computation rules of the so-called 'applied' sciences. (One might even formulate it as the thesis that "pure" science is a misnomer, and that all science is 'applied'.)  Now my reply to instrumentalism consists in showing that there are profound differences between "pure" theories and technological computation rules, and that instrumentalism can give a perfect description of these rules but is quite unable to account for the difference between them and the theories".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival of empiricism===
{{main|Constructive empiricism}}
[[Bas van Fraassen]]'s (1980)&lt;ref&gt;van Fraassen, Bas C., 1980, ''The Scientific Image'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; project of [[constructive empiricism]] focuses on belief in the domain of the observable, so for this reason it is described as a form of instrumentalism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-realism/ Scientific Realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21287">'''Interindividual differences in perception''' describes the effect that differences in brain structure or factors such as culture, upbringing and environment have on the [[perception]] of humans.
Interindividual (differing from person to person) variability is usually regarded as a source of noise for research. However, in recent years, it has become an interesting source to study sensory mechanisms and understand [[human behavior]]. With the help of modern [[neuroimaging]] methods such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], individual differences in perception could be related to the underlying brain mechanisms. This has helped to explain differences in  behavior and [[cognition]] across the population. Common methods include studying the perception of [[illusion]]s, as they can effectively demonstrate how different aspects such as [[culture]], [[Human genetics|genetics]] and the [[Human ecology|environment]] can influence human behavior.

A motion quartet is a [[Bistability|bistable]] stimulus - it consists of two dots that change their position from frame to frame. This position change can either be interpreted as horizontal or vertical movement by viewers, and this experience can switch during viewing between interpretations. Depending on the [[aspect ratio]] of the two dots' positions, one or the other state is perceived longer or more often. At an aspect ratio of one, the illusion is biased towards the vertical perception. The reason for this might be the way the human brain processes the signals from both eyes in the [[visual system]]. The right half of an eye's field of view is processed by the left hemisphere, and the left half by the right hemisphere. A stimulus moving vertically only involves one field of view and so one hemisphere, while a stimulus moving vertically from one field of view to the other involves both hemispheres, and requires communication between them. The delay caused by this additional signalling might be the cause for the bias.&lt;ref name="metastable anisotropy"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Metastable motion anisotropy. | author=Chaudhuri, Avi | journal=Visual Neuroscience | year=1991 | volume=7 | issue=5 | pages=397–407 | pmid=1764411 | doi=10.1017/s0952523800009706}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also individual differences in the way the motion quartet is perceived: Some people require a different aspect ratio to perceive both axes of movement than others.
A study using diffusion tensor imaging further showed differences in the structure of the corpus callosum, the primary connection between the two hemispheres, might be the origin of these differences.&lt;ref name="Genç bistable"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211008773 | title=Interhemispheric Connections Shape Subjective Experience of Bistable Motion | author= Genç, Erhan | journal=Current Biology | year=2011 |  volume=21 | issue=17 | pages=1494–1499 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.003| pmid=21885284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Object size estimation===
There exist a variety of illusions that make objects appear bigger or smaller compared to their real size. Two such illusions are the [[Ebbinghaus illusion|Ebbinghaus]] and the [[Ponzo illusion|Ponzo]] illusions. The Ebbinghaus illusion makes a dot seem bigger because it is surrounded by smaller dots, while the Ponzo illusion exploits human [[Perspective (visual)#Linear perspective|perspective]] processing by making a dot appear bigger because it seems farther away. Schwarzkopf et al.&lt;ref name="surface_V1" /&gt; found that the size of the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex .28V1.29|primary visual cortex (V1)]] has an effect on the magnitude of these illusions. The larger the subject's V1 surface area was, the less the subjects fell for the illusion. This is hypothesized to be due to the fact that a larger V1 dedicated to the same portion of the visual field means a lesser effect of later, fixed-size visual areas (which are the ones that are responsible for the illusion effect).&lt;ref name="surface_V1"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n1/full/nn.2706.html | title=The surface area of human V1 predicts the subjective experience of object size | author=Schwarzkopf, D Samuel | journal=Nature Neuroscience | volume=14 | year=2011 | issue=1 | pages=28–30 | doi=10.1038/nn.2706 | pmid=21131954 | pmc=3012031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditory Illusions==

===McGurk Effect===
The [[McGurk effect]] is an auditory illusion in which people perceive a different syllable when incongruent audiovisual speech is presented: an auditory syllable "ba" is presented while the mouth movement is "ga". As a result, the listener perceives the syllable "da". However, according to Gentilucci and Cattaneo (2005), not everyone perceives this illusion; only about 26% to 98% of the population are susceptible to this illusion.&lt;ref name="McGurk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gentilucci | first1 = M. | last2 = Cattaneo | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Automatic audiovisual integration in speech perception" ''Experimental Brain Research'' 167(1), 66-75. McGurk, H., &amp; MacDonald, J. (1976). Hearing lips and seeing voices | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 264 | issue = | pages = 746–748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the psychological models that explains the interindividual differences in speech perception is the [[fuzzy logic]] model of speech perception&lt;ref name="fuzzy speech"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oden | first1 = G. C. | last2 = Massaro | first2 = D. W. | year = 1978 | title = Integration of featural information in speech perception | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 85 | issue = 3| pages = 172–191 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.85.3.172 | pmid=663005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this model, a categorization process is carried out when processing speech sounds. When listening to a stimulus, the features of the acoustic signal are analyzed. Subsequently, this signal is compared with the features that are stored in the memory; finally the sound is classified into the category that best fits. However, this classification may have a blurred boundary respectively to the category which the sound belongs to. As a result, the final decision may depend on integration of multiple sources of information. When the McGurk effect is presented the auditory and visual components of the speech are separately evaluated before being integrated. In those who perceive the McGurk effect, the visual information has a higher influence on the perception of the ambiguous audiovisual information and thus the sound is classified as "da".

Many studies have concluded that the area responsible for the perception of this phenomenon is the left [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulcus(STS)]].&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nath | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Beauchamp | first2 = M. S. | year = 2012 | title = A neural basis for interindividual differences in the McGurk effect, a multisensory speech illusion | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 781–787 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.07.024 | pmid=21787869 | pmc=3196040}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is critical for the [[multisensory integration]] of visual and auditory information during speech perception. Moreover,  there is a correlation between the activation of the STS and the perception of the McGurk effect. In that sense, if the left STS  correctly integrates the mismatched audiovisual information, a McGurk effect is perceived; if the left STS is not active, the visual and auditory information are not integrated and thus a McGurk effect is not perceived.

In one study&lt;ref name="McGurk_Nath" /&gt; [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (BOLD fMRI) was used to measure the brain activity in perceivers and non-perceivers of the McGurk effect while presented with congruent audiovisual syllables, McGurk audiovisual syllables (auditory "ba" + visual "ga" producing perception of "da"),  and non-McGurk incongruent syllables( auditory "ga" + visual "ba" producing auditory perception of "ga"). The researchers found that there was a positive correlation between the amplitude of response in the left STS and the probability of perceiving the McGurk effect. In other words, the subject with the weakest STS activation to incongruent speech had the smallest probability of experiencing a McGurk percept; whereas the subject with the strongest STS response had the highest probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK3T7LWIkP8|title=McGurk effect: Auditory "ba" + Visual "ga"|first=|last=anathfMRI|date=18 February 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beauchamp et al. (2010) highlight the critical role of the left STS in audiovisual integration.&lt;ref name="TMS"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = M. S. | last2 = Nath | first2 = A.

The perception of the McGurk effect decreased from 94% to 43% and the subjects reported perceiving only the auditory syllable. Following from that, Beauchamp et al. conclude that the left STS is crucial for the audiovisual integration and thus for the perception of the McGurk effect.

Moreover, another study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurler | first1 = D. | last2 = Doyle | first2 = N. | last3 = Walker | first3 = E. | last4 = Magnotti | first4 = J. | last5 = Beauchamp | first5 = M. | year = 2015 | title = A link between individual differences in multisensory speech perception and eye movements | url = | journal = Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 77 | issue = 4| pages = 1333–1341 | doi=10.3758/s13414-014-0821-1| pmc = 4437244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the basis of the interindividual differences in the perception of McGurk effect lies in the eye movements of the subject when viewing the talker’s face. The experimenters carried out an [[eye tracking]] study and measured the eye movements of the participants while viewing audiovisual speech. They found that people who spent more time fixating the mouth of the talker were the more likely to perceive the McGurk effect than those who rarely fixated on the mouth of the speaker.

===Other auditory illusions===
[[File:Pitch class space.svg|thumb|right|Representation of the [[pitch class]] circle with respect to tone height]]
Interindividual differences have also been researched for the '''[[Tritone paradox]] illusion'''. In this illusion, the subject successively listens to two tones, which are separated by a half [[octave]]. Each tone is made of a set of [[harmonics]] which have an octave relation. The listener has to decide if the two tones have a descending or ascending relation. According to [[Diana Deutsch]],&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"&gt;Deutsch, D. (1991). The tritone paradox: An influence of language on music perception. Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 8(4), 335-347.&lt;/ref&gt; the perception of the tones is influenced by the language spoken by the listener. The listener has a circular representation of the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of sounds that are common in their culture and based on that develops a pitch range of their speaking voice, which determines the orientation of the [[pitch class]] with respect to the height; when a given tone is in this range, it is taken as the highest position along the circle and depending on the second tone, the person perceives the pattern as ascending or descending. Deutsch&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1"/&gt; found that for people from [[California]], the tone in the highest position of the pitch-class circle is around C# and D whereas for people from southern [[England]] it is around G. According to those results, Deutsch hypothesized that the orientation of the pitch-class circle with respect to the height is similar for individuals from the same linguistic group and varies for individuals from different linguistic groups.

Other illusions found by Deutsch whose interpretation depends on interindividual differences is the '''phantom words illusion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=211|title=Diana Deutsch - Phantom Words|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illusion consists of the continuous presentation of two meaningless syllables. In order to experience the illusion, it is necessary that the listener sits between two loudspeakers, one to the left and the other to the right. The syllables are presented offset in time, in such a way that while one syllable is coming from the left, the other syllable is coming from the right loudspeaker. It was shown that after a period of time, people start hearing words. According to Deutsch, the perceived words depend on the language spoken by the listener, their knowledge and their expectations. According to Shinn-Cunningham (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shinn-Cunningham | first1 = B.G. | year = 2008 | title = Object-based auditory and visual attention | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 182–186 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.02.003| pmc = 2699558}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the information is incomplete or contradictory, the perceptual system often fills this gaps with plausible interpretations and in that way allows new information to be efficiently processed.

==Effect of Culture on Perception==
[[File:Frame_and_Line_Test.svg|thumb|height=width|right|The framed line test]]
Several studies have shown that differences between individuals play a significant role in determining how a stimulus is perceived. These differences among people, in turn, are greatly influenced by one's own socio-cultural contexts. The research indicates that cultural factors influence the process of perception not just on lower-level (such as [[Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition|object perception]] and [[attention]] deployment), but also on the higher-order functions (such as [[theory of mind]] and [[emotion recognition]]).&lt;ref name= "Culture_and_self"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markus|first1=Hazel R.|last2=Kitayama|first2=Shinobu|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation.|journal=Psychological Review|date=1991|volume=98|issue=2|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "holistic vs nalytical"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masuda|first1=Takahiko|last2=Nisbett|first2=Richard E|title=Attending holistically versus analytically: Comparing the context sensitivity of Japanese and Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=Nov 2001|volume= 81|issue=5|pages=922–934|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.5.922|pmid=11708567}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name= "New Look"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kitayama|first1=S.|last2=Duffy|first2=S.|last3=Kawamura|first3=T.|last4=Larsen|first4=J.

The two major cultures analyzed in these studies were mostly [[Western World|Western]] and [[East Asia]]n cultures because of the considerable differences in the social structure and practices. Western culture was referred to as an ''analytical'' culture whereas Eastern culture was referred more as a ''holistic'' culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=JB|last2=Rule|first2=NO|last3=Ambady|first3=N|title=The cultural neuroscience of person perception|journal=Progress in Brain Research|date=2009|volume=178|pages=191–201|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17813-5|pmid=19874970|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444533616}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[individualism]] and [[freedom]] are the predominant values in Western societies, which in turn demand interpretation of an object in its absolute terms independent of its context. In contrast, Eastern culture is known for its emphasis on [[collectivism]] and [[interdependence]] on each other, where interpretation of an object is often in relation with its context&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbett|first1=RE|last2=Peng|first2=K|last3=Choi|first3=I|last4=Norenzayan|first4=A|title=Culture and systems of thought: holistic versus analytic cognition.|journal=Psychological Review|date=April 2001|volume=108|issue=2|pages=291–310|pmid=11381831|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.108.2.291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pioneer study examining these cultural differences in visual perception was conducted by Kitmaya et al. (2003).&lt;ref name="New Look"/&gt; The findings of that study provide behavioural evidence on how cultural factors affect visual perception and attention deployment. For the study, [[United States|Americans]] and [[Japan]]ese were taken as subjects. The visual stimulus shown to the subjects consisted of a square figure with a line hanging from the centre (the framed line test). First was the absolute condition, where the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in its absolute length, to a new square box independent of its size. Second was the relative condition, in which the task was to redraw the line on the centre of the square in proportionally similar to context of the new square box. The results show that Americans perform better in the absolute task which requires analytical processing of stimulus independent of it context, whereas the Japanese performed better at the relative task which demands the holistic processing of the stimulus in relation to its context.

In line with these findings, Hedden and colleagues (2009)&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedden|first1=T.|last2=Mormino|first2=E. C.|last3=Amariglio|first3=R. E.|last4=Younger|first4=A. P.|last5=Schultz|first5=A. P.|last6=Becker|first6=J. A.|last7=Buckner|first7=R. L.|last8=Johnson|first8=K. A.|last9=Sperling|first9=R. A.|last10=Rentz|first10=D.

Participants of the study were asked to judge the length of a vertical line, either including the contextual information or ignoring it. The results revealed that separate brain regions were employed while performing  the task, either incorporating the contextual information or avoiding it, based on one's own culture. The areas associated with [[attentional control]] in the [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[Parietal lobe|parietal]] region of the brain were highly activated when the subjects performed the task which was incongruent to their cultural pattern. That is, the activity in the fronto-parietal region enhanced when East Asians had to ignore the contextual information, while similar enhancement happened for Americans when they had to incorporate the contextual information. These findings illustrate that the function of the neural mechanisms are also modulated to some extent by one's own culture.&lt;ref name="Hedden 2009"/&gt;

A follow-up fMRI study by Gutchess, Welsh, Boduroglu, and Park (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gutchess|first1=AH|last2=Welsh|first2=RC|last3=Boduroglu|first3=A|last4=Park|first4=DC|title=Cultural differences in neural function associated with object processing.|journal=Cognitive, affective &amp; behavioral neuroscience|date=June 2006|volume=6|issue=2|pages=102–9|pmid=17007231|doi=10.3758/cabn.6.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed the previous findings by using a rather complex stimulus, which consists of ''only the object'' pictures, ''object with background'' pictures and ''only the background'' pictures without the object. This particular study was done on East-Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans. Though the performance of both subject groups was equally good, the activity of the involved brain areas was significantly different. Non-Asian Americans had a higher activation in the object processing areas in the ventral visual cortex during the object recognition task whereas the East-Asian Americans exhibited higher activity in the left [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] and [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] areas which are associated with perceptual analysis.

comprising the [[European Pulsar Timing Array]] (EPTA), the [[North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves]] (NANOGrav), and the [[Parkes Pulsar Timing Array]] (PPTA). The goal of the IPTA is to detect [[gravitational waves]] using an array of approximately 30 pulsars. This goal is shared by each of the participating institutions, but they have all recognized that their goal will be achieved more quickly in collaboration, and by combining their respective resources.

==Overview==
The basic experiment exploits the predictability of the times of arrival (TOAs) of pulses from [[millisecond pulsar]]s (MSPs) and uses them as a system of Galactic clocks. Disturbances in the clocks will be measurable at Earth. A disturbance from a passing gravitational wave will have a particular signature across the ensemble of pulsars, and will be thus detected.

The experiment is analogous to ground-based interferometric detectors such as [[LIGO]] and [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], where the time-of-flight of a laser beam is measured along a particular path and compared to the time-of-flight along an orthogonally oriented path. Instead of the time-of-flight of a laser beam the IPTA is measuring the time-of-flight of an electromagnetic pulse from the pulsar. Instead of 4&amp;nbsp;km arms (as in the case of LIGO) the 'arms' of the IPTA are thousands of light-years (the distance between the pulsars and the earth.) Each of the PTAs times approximately 20 MSPs each month. With significant overlap between the collaborations the total number of MSPs timed by the IPTA (and thus the number of 'arms' in the detector) is approximately 30.

These differences between the IPTA and the ground-based interferometers allow them to probe a completely different range in gravitational-wave frequency and thus a different category of sources. Whereas ground-based detectors are sensitive to between tens and thousands of Hz, the IPTA is sensitive to between tens and hundreds of microHertz. Their primary source of gravitational waves is supermassive black-hole binaries (billions of solar masses), presumed to exist in plenty in the universe at the centers of galaxies, resulting from previous mergers of those galaxies.

The resources of the IPTA are substantial. The EPTA uses large quantities of time on Europe’s five 100-meter class telescopes: the [[Lovell Telescope]] at Jodrell Bank, England, the [[Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope]] in Germany, the [[Sardinia Radio Telescope]] in Italy, the [[Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Nancay Radio Telescope]] in France. Together these 5 telescopes make up the Large European Array for Pulsars (LEAP) in which they operate together as a single 300-meter class telescope. NANOGrav uses about 1-day per month of time at the Green Bank 100-m telescope, and 0.5 days per month at the 300-m [[Arecibo Observatory]] in Puerto Rico. The PPTA uses several days per month at the 64-meter [[Parkes Radio Telescope]].

Pulsar timing was tied for top ranking in the "medium size" category for priorities from the Particle Astrophysics and Gravitational Panel of the Astro2010 [[decadal survey|Decadal Review]] sponsored by the National Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Academies|first1=Science Frontiers Panels, Program Prioritization Panels, Committee for a Decadal Survey of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Board on Physics and Astronomy, Space Studies Board, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, National Research Council of the National|title=Panel reports--new worlds, new horizons in astronomy and astrophysics|date=2011|publisher=[[National Academies Press]]|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-15962-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPTA is coordinated and advised by the IPTA Steering Committee, a seven-member committee with two representatives from each of the three PTA consortia plus the immediate past Chair. Currently on the committee are [[Dick Manchester]] (Chair, CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science), Willem van Straten (Swinburne University), Scott Ransom ([[NRAO]]), Ingrid Stairs (UBC), [[Ben Stappers]] (Jodrell Bank Center for Astrophysics), Gilles Theureau (Nancay Telescope), and Andrea Lommen (past Chair, Franklin &amp; Marshall College). Each of the three consortia are also members of the Gravitational Wave International Committee, an advisory council consisting of the leaders of gravitational wave experiments worldwide.

The first IPTA data release was on the 12 February 2016, which provided a 2 sigma limit on the amplitude of the [[Gravitational Wave Background]].&lt;ref name="arXiv:1602.03640" /&gt;

'''Irregular warfare''' is defined in [[United States]] joint doctrine as “A violent struggle among state and non-state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations.”&lt;ref&gt;The Irregular Warrior, 4 October 2015 [http://irregularwarrior.com/2015/10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irregular warfare favors indirect and asymmetric warfare approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities, in order to erode the adversary’s power, influence, and will. It is inherently a protracted struggle that will test the resolve of a [[State (polity)|state]] and its strategic partners.&lt;ref&gt;"Irregular Warfare (IW) Joint Operating Concept (JOC)", Version 1.0, [[United States Department of Defense]], 27 February 2009 [http://morsnet.pbwiki.com/f/MORS+IW+Mini-Symposium+TOR-final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"US Irregular Warfare (IW) Analysis Workshop", [[Military Operations Research Society]] (MORS), 11 September 2007 [http://www.dtic.mil/futurejointwarfare/concepts/iw_joc1_0.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dodd300007"&gt;"Irregular Warfare (IW)", DoD Directive 3000.07, [[United States Department of Defense]], 1 December 2008 [http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/300007p.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Quadrennial Roles &amp; Missions (QRM) Review Report", [[United States Department of Defense]], January 2009 [http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2009/QRMFinalReport_v26Jan.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Irregular Warfare", Doctrine Document 2-3, [[United States Air Force]], 1 August 2007 [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA471742]&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts associated with irregular warfare are older than the term itself.&lt;ref name="gates"&gt;Gates, John M., "The U.S. Army and Irregular Warfare", The College of Wooster {{cite web |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-contents.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623141322/http://www.wooster.edu/History/jgates/book-contents.html |archivedate=2009-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origination of the term ===
The distinction between regular and irregular forces is unrelated to the term "irregular warfare." The term, irregular warfare, was settled upon in distinction from "traditional warfare" and "unconventional warfare", and to differentiate it as such.

=== Early use ===
One of the earliest known uses of the term ''irregular warfare'' is in the 1986 English edition of "Modern Irregular Warfare in Defense Policy and as a Military Phenomenon" by [[Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte]].  The original 1972 German edition of the book is titled "Der Moderne Kleinkrieg als Wehrpolitisches und Militarisches Phänomen".  The German word "Kleinkrieg" is literally translated as "Small War".&lt;ref&gt;Moses, A. Dirk, "German intellectuals and the Nazi past," {{ISBN|978-0-521-86495-4}}, 2007 [https://books.google.com/books?id=P1KoR4vF3ysC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206&amp;dq=Kleinkrieg+%22Small+War%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K4n_4koqOr&amp;sig=edxYQjmQRaz1H3Z73IPzXkre_Ls&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fEOYSjOpsfEGvf2BxgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Kleinkrieg%20%22Small%20War%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "Irregular", used in the title of the English translation of the book, seems to be a reference non "regular armed forces" as per the aforementioned [[Third Geneva Convention]].

=== US DoD use ===
One of the earliest known uses of the term IW is in a 1996 [[Central Intelligence Agency]] document by [[Jeffrey B. White]].&lt;ref name="white"&gt;White, Jeffrey B., "A Different Kind of Threat, Some Thoughts on Irregular Warfare", CIA, 1996 [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/96unclass/iregular.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Major [[military doctrine]] developments related to IW were done between 2004 and 2007&lt;ref&gt;"The National Military Strategy of the United States of America", [[United States Department of Defense]], 2004 [http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil429.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, LTC Frank A., "Irregular Warfare – Perhaps Not So "Irregular"", U.S. Army War College, 15 March 2006 [http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/ksil429.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The National Security Strategy of the United States of America", National Security Council, 2002 [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/national/nss-020920.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A key proponent of IW within US DoD is [[Michael G.

==Other definitions==
* IW is a form of warfare that has as its objective the credibility and/or legitimacy of the relevant political authority with the goal of undermining or supporting that authority. IW favors indirect approaches, though it may employ the full range of military and other capabilities to seek asymmetric approaches, in order to erode an adversary’s power, influence, and will.&lt;ref&gt;"Irregular Warfare Special Study", [[United States Joint Forces Command]] Joint Warfighting Center, 4 August 2006 [http://merln.ndu.edu/archive/digitalcollections/irregwarfarespecialstudy.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IW is defined as a violent struggle among [[State (polity)|state]] and non-state actors for [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and influence over the relevant [[population]](s)
* IW involves conflicts in which enemy combatants are not regular military forces of nation-states.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Quadrennial Defense Review]] Report", [[United States Department of Defense]], 6 February 2006 [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/dod/qdr-2006-report.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* IW is "war among the people" as opposed to "industrial war" (i.e. regular war).&lt;ref&gt;[http://rdsc.md.government.bg/BG/Activities/Publication/MilitaryLead/3-4-Benest.pdf Benest, David, "British Leaders and Irregular Warfare," 29 August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Activities and types of conflict included in IW are:
* [[Colonial war]]
* [[Asymmetric warfare]]
* [[Insurgency]]/[[Counter-insurgency]] (COIN)
* [[Terrorism]]/[[Counter-terrorism]]
* [[Stabilization, Security, Transition, and Reconstruction Operations]] (SSTRO)
* [[Unconventional warfare]] (UW)
* [[Guerrilla warfare]] (GW)
* [[Foreign internal defense]] (FID)
* [[Civil-military operations]] (CMO)
* [[Military Intelligence]] and [[counter-intelligence]] activities
* [[Transnational crime|Transnational]] [[criminal activities]] that support or sustain IW:
** [[narco-trafficking]]
** [[Illicit arms trafficking]]
** illegal [[financial transactions]]
* [[Outline of law enforcement|Law enforcement]] activities focused on countering irregular adversaries

According to the DoD, there are five core activities of IW:&lt;ref&gt;The Core Activities of Irregular Warfare, The Irregular Warrior, [http://irregularwarrior.com/the-core-activities-of-irregular-warfare]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Counter-insurgency]] (COIN)
* [[Counter-terrorism]] (CT)
* [[Unconventional warfare]] (UW)
* [[Foreign internal defense]] (FID)
* [[Stability Operations]] (SO)

==Examples==
Nearly all modern wars include at least some element of irregular warfare. Since the time of Napoleon, approximately 80% of conflict has been irregular in nature.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Imperitive: Irregular Warfare and the Future of Security, The Irregular Warrior, [http://irregularwarrior.com/the-imperitive-irregular-warfare-and-the-future-of-security]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the following conflicts may be considered to have exemplified by irregular warfare:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;

* [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghan Civil War]]
* [[Algerian War]]
* [[American Indian Wars]]
* [[American Revolutionary War]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to the definition of "regular forces", which came much after the [[American Revolutionary War]] ([[American Revolutionary War|ARW]]), the American forces did not meet the following criteria at all times during the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]]:
* having a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance
* carrying arms openly
* conducting operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war
&lt;br&gt;
Notwithstanding, in terms of modern international humanitarian law which was also developed much later than the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]], the American forces formed part of the armed forces of a party to an armed conflict but not belonging to that party's regular forces (since the [[United States of America]] did not exist and hence could not have had regular forces; the American forces were an insurgency at least until 1776) and operating in or outside of their own territory even if the territory is under occupation.

American forces did become regular forces but cannot be considered regular forces during the entire period of the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]]. For example, the American flag got established (1777) 2 years after the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] started (1775). Also, there were great disparities between the American and British forces.  It was not until France started to assist American forces (1778) that the disparity started to be narrowed.  Conflict during the disparity surely counts as [[Asymmetric warfare]]. Also, the [[Boston Tea Party]] (1773) can be viewed as [[guerrilla]] tactics.  At the very least, a good portion of the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] should be counted as IW although the entire [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] being counted as IW is controversial.  However, since more than 1/2 of the [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] was fought as [[American Revolutionary War|ARW]] then it is thought that it is safe to classify it as IW even though that the American forces acted in all respects as regular forces towards the end of the conflict.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Revolution 1774-1783|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mQCRNfiB1-EC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=american+revolution+irregular+warfare#v=onepage&amp;q=american%20revolution%20irregular%20warfare&amp;f=false | first=Daniel | last=Marston | isbn=978-1-84176-343-9 | year=2002 | publisher=Osprey Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wargames and exercises==
There have been several military [[Military simulation|wargames]] and [[military exercises]] associated with IW, including:
* Unified Action &lt;ref&gt;http://www.citmo.net/library/Military%20Support%20to%20Unified%20Action%20-%20ROL%20Focus%20for%20Policing%20WS.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unified Quest &lt;ref&gt;https://unifiedquest.army.mil/&lt;/ref&gt;

* Joint Irregular Warrior Series war games,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Expeditionary Warrior war game series,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and 
* a December 2011 Naval War College Maritime Stability Operations Game focused specifically on stability operations in the maritime domain conducted by the Naval Service.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Modeling and simulation ==

The '''Fire Mummies''' of the [[Philippines]], also known as the''' [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]] Mummies''', [[Benguet]] Mummies, or [[Ibaloi]] Mummies, are a group of [[mummies]] found along the mountain slopes of  [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], a town in the northern part of the Philippines. They were made from as early as 2000 BC until the 16th century, when [[Spain]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonized the Philippines]]. Today, they remain in natural [[caves]] and a museum in [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]].

== Description ==

[[Scientists]] believe that the Fire Mummies were created by the [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] between 1200 and 1500 [[AD]] in five towns in [[Benguet]] and buried in [[caves]]. Others believe that the process of [[mummification]] began at 2000 [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="made"/&gt; What makes the Fire Mummies unique is their process of [[mummification]]. That mummification began shortly before a person [[death|died]], where he would [[digestion|digest]] a very salty drink. After his death, his [[corpse]] was washed and set over a [[fire]] in a seated position, thus drying the fluids. [[Smoke]] from [[tobacco]] was blown into the [[mouth]] to dry the body's inside and [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]]. Eventually, herbs were rubbed into the body.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fire-mummies-of-the-philippines |title=Fire Mummies of the Philippines |author=Dylan |author2=Treeswithknees |author3=Nicholas Jackson |website=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mummified bodies are then placed in a coffin made of pinewood and laid to rest in rock shelters, natural caves or man made burial niches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2070/|title = Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves|date = |accessdate = September 13, 2014|website = |publisher = UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of that mummification ended, since [[Spaniards]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonized the Philippines]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="made"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/kabayan.htm |title=Kabayan Mummies |at=When were they made |website=Mummy Tombs |accessdate=21 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001028161032/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/kabayan.htm |archivedate=28 October 2000 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery ===

When the Fire Mummies were 'discovered' in the early 20th century by Westerners (the mummies have been known to local communities for hundreds of years), many of them were [[Grave robbery|stolen]], because the [[caves]] were mostly unprotected. Because of this, Monument Watch, a [[nonprofit organization]], declared the site as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paperdue.com/essay/Fire-Mummies-of-the-6468 |title=Fire Mummies of the Philippines |author=Paperdue |date=November 2010 |website=PaperDue.com |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==

After [[logging]] operations intensified in the area, the location of many [[caves]] became known. Unfortunately this has led to [[looting]], as unconscientious visitors have been eager to leave their mark, including [[graffiti]], on the Kabayan mummies. The Kabayan Mummies were listed in the [[1998 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. Funding through [[American Express]] was used for emergency conservation and the creation of a comprehensive management plan. Additionally, local authorities from surrounding municipalities collaborated in cultural awareness campaign to introduce the Mummies to [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]. [[tourism|Tourist]] facilities were also constructed in order to control visitation and prevent harmful intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmf.org/project/kabayan-mummy-caves |website=World Monuments Fund |title=Kabayan Mummy Caves |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fire Mummies remain in natural [[caves]] with relatively small security and have been designated as one of the 100 world's most endangered heritage sites. Officials know 50-80 other mummies, but they will not give their locations because of their fear of [[vandalism]]. A small museum in [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], [[Benguet]] also displays a few mummies.&lt;ref name="making"/&gt;

== Declarations ==
The Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves are listed as National Cultural Treasures by the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 374. It is also under consideration as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Scholars are also pushing for the inclusion of the mummy burial caves in neighboring [[Buguias, Benguet|Buguias]] town in the ''Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves'' nomination of the Philippines in the UNESCO Tentative List. The caves in Buguias is home to one of Benguet's folk hero, Apo Anno. The burial caves in Kabayan and Buguias will collectively be called as the Benguet Mummy Burial Caves or Mummy Burial Caves in Kabayan and Buguias.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Kondura''' or '''Condura''' ({{lang-el|Condoira}}{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}) was a type of ship used on the eastern shores of the Adriatic. It is first mentioned and described in the 10th century as part of the medieval [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Croatia]]n navy. It is also mentioned in the 14th century as a type of ship used by the [[Republic of Ragusa]].&lt;ref name="KahaneKahane1979"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henry Romanos Kahane|author2=Renée Kahane|title=Graeca Et Romanica Scripta Selecta: Romance and Mediterranean lexicology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miskAAAAMAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Hakkert}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condura was {{convert|7|to|8|m|ft}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw4rAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Academia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condura croatica==
In 1966, remains of two ships were accidentally found by the port of [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]], which, in 1974, were taken out and transferred to [[Zadar]] to restore and conserve the remains. Through [[radiocarbon dating]], it was established that these ships sailed from the end of 11th century to the start of 12th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5063">'''Les Automatistes''' were a group of [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]] artistic dissidents from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The movement was founded in the early 1940s by painter [[Paul-Émile Borduas]]. Les Automatistes were so called because they were influenced by [[Surrealism]] and its theory of [[surrealist automatism|automatism]]. Members included [[Marcel Barbeau]], [[Roger Fauteux]], [[Claude Gauvreau]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], [[Pierre Gauvreau]], [[Fernand Leduc]], [[Jean-Paul Mousseau]], and [[Marcelle Ferron]] and [[Françoise Sullivan]]. 

The movement may have begun with an exhibition Borduas gave in Montreal in 1942. However, les Automatistes were soon being exhibited in [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]] also. Though it began as a visual arts group, it also spread to other forms of expression, such as drama, poetry and dance. The title les Automatistes came from journalist [[Tancrède Marcil]] Jr., in a review of their second exhibit in Montreal (February 15 to March 1, 1947), which appeared in ''Le Quartier Latin'' (the [[Université de Montréal]]'s student journal).

In 1948 [[Paul-Émile Borduas|Borduas]] published a collective [[manifesto]] called the [[Refus global]], an important document in the cultural history of Quebec and a declaration of artistic independence and the need for expressive freedoms. Its denunciation of the Catholic Church's authority was particularly scandalous and resulted in the group's public humiliation. This ultimately lead to a kind of martyrdom but was initially devastating. Although the group dispersed soon after the manifesto was published, the movement continues to have influence, and may be considered a forerunner of the [[Quiet Revolution]]. 

Alongside [[Lyrical abstraction|Lyrical Abstract]] painters in France, the Automatistes favoured a fluid, painterly technique over the comparatively reserved, hard-edge abstraction so popular in the U.S. and Eastern Europe at the time. Much like a nonfigurative [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], they were looking to create a distinctively Canadian artistic identity. Heavily influenced by Surrealist manifestos and poetry, their work was largely stream-of-consciousness inspired, believing this to be a truer means of communicating subconscious emotions and sensory experiences; they wanted to be liberated from intention, reason, and any kind of structure, in order to communicate a universal human experience without bias. This resulted in increasingly crude or intuitive methods such as applying paint with palette knives and fingers and painting blindfolded, their efforts contradicting their claims of working without intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Automatiste Revolution|last = Nasgaard|first = Roald|publisher = D&amp;M Publishers Inc.|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Vancouver, BC|pages = |first2 = Ray|last2 = Ellenwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
In 1954, the Automatistes were the subject of the NFB/CBC documentary series ''[[On the Spot (Canadian TV series)|On the Spot]]'' in an episode entitled ''Artist in Montreal.''&lt;ref name="Ohayon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2010/04/14/on-the-spot-the-nfb-in-the-early-days-of-television/|title=On the Spot: The NFB in the early days of television|last=Ohayon|first=Albert|date=April 14, 2010|work=NFB.ca|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical education''' is education related to the practice of being a medical practitioner; either the initial training to become a [[physician]] (i.e., [[medical school]] and [[internship (medical)|internship]]), or additional training thereafter (e.g., [[Residency (medicine)|residency]], [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] and continuing medical education).

Medical education and training varies considerably across the world. Various teaching methodologies have been utilised in medical education, which is an active area of educational research.&lt;ref name="pmid17655743"&gt;

==Entry-level education==
{{main|Medical school}}

Entry-level medical education programs are tertiary-level courses undertaken at a [[medical school]]. Depending on jurisdiction and university, these may be either undergraduate-entry (most of Europe, Asia, South America and Oceania), or [[Graduate Entry Program|graduate-entry programs]] (mainly Australia, North America). Some jurisdictions and universities provide both undergraduate entry programs and graduate entry programs (Australia, South Korea).

In general, initial training is taken at [[medical school]]. Traditionally initial medical education is divided between ''preclinical'' and ''clinical'' studies. The former consists of the basic sciences such as [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[pathology]]. The latter consists of teaching in the various areas of clinical medicine such as [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[psychiatry]], [[general practice]] and [[surgery]]. However, medical programs are using systems-based curricula in which learning is integrated, and several institutions do this.  In the United States, until quite recently,{{when|date=November 2015}} the requirements for the M.D. degree did not include even one course in human nutrition.  Today, this omission has been rectified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dang|first1=Timothy M.|last2=Maggio|first2=Lauren A.|title=Supporting the Call to Action|journal=Academic Medicine|date=March 2017|volume=92|issue=3|pages=403–416|doi=10.1097/ACM.0000000000001532|pmid=28225733}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least to the extent that one such course is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hark|first1=Lisa A.|last2=Deen|first2=Darwin D.|last3=Morrison|first3=Gail|title=Learner-Directed Nutrition Content for Medical Schools to Meet LCME Standards|journal=Journal of Biomedical Education|date=2015|volume=2015|pages=1–12|doi=10.1155/2015/469351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a proliferation of programmes that combine medical training with research (M.D./Ph.D.) or management programmes (M.D./ MBA), although this has been criticised because extended interruption to clinical study has been shown to have a detrimental effect on ultimate clinical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dyrbye LN|author2=Thomas MR|author3=Natt N|author4=Rohren CH|title=Prolonged Delays for Research Training in Medical School are Associated with Poorer Subsequent Clinical Knowledge|journal=J Gen Intern Med|date=2007|pmid=17492473|doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0200-x|volume=22|pages=1101–6|issue=8|pmc=2305740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postgraduate education==

Following completion of entry-level training, newly graduated doctors are often required to undertake a period of supervised practice before full registration is granted; this is most often of one-year duration and may be referred to as an "internship" or "provisional registration" or "[[Residency (medicine)|residency]]".

[[Image:Děkanát 1.LF UK.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Dean's office at the [[First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague|First Faculty of Medicine]], [[Charles University]], [[Prague]]]]

Further training in a particular field of medicine may be undertaken. In the U.S., further specialized training, completed after residency is referred to as "fellowship".  In some jurisdictions, this is commenced immediately following completion of entry-level training, while other jurisdictions require junior doctors to undertake generalist (unstreamed) training for a number of years before commencing specialisation.

Education theory itself is becoming an integral part of postgraduate medical training. Formal qualifications in education are also becoming the norm for medical educators, such that there has been a rapid increase in the number of available graduate programs in medical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page: master's degree in health professions education programs.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=September 2013|volume=88|issue=9|pages=1399|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e31829decf6|pmid=23982511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page.

==Continuing medical education==
In most countries, [[continuing medical education]] (CME) courses are required for continued licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=4|author=Ahmed K|author2=Ashrafian H|author3=Hanna GB|author4=Darzi A|author5=Athanasiou T. |date=Oct 2009 |title=Assessment of specialists in cardiovascular practice |journal=Nature Reviews Cardiology  |url=http://www.nature.com/nrcardio/journal/v6/n10/pdf/nrcardio.2009.155.pdf |volume=6 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; CME requirements vary by state and by country. In the USA, accreditation is overseen by the [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education]] (ACCME).  Physicians often attend dedicated lectures, [[grand rounds]], conferences, and performance improvement activities in order to fulfill their requirements. Additionally, physicians are increasingly opting to pursue further graduate-level training in the formal study of medical education as a pathway for continuing professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cervero|first1=RM|last2=Artino|first2=AR|last3=Daley|first3=BJ|last4=Durning|first4=SJ|title=Health Professions Education Graduate Programs Are a Pathway to Strengthening Continuing Professional Development.|journal=The Journal of continuing education in the health professions|date=2017|volume=37|issue=2|pages=147–151|doi=10.1097/CEH.0000000000000155|pmid=28562504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Artino|first1=Anthony R.|last2=Cervero|first2=Ronald M.|last3=DeZee|first3=Kent J.|last4=Holmboe|first4=Eric|last5=Durning|first5=Steven J.|title=Graduate Programs in Health Professions Education: Preparing Academic Leaders for Future Challenges|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|date=April 2018|volume=10|issue=2|pages=119–122|doi=10.4300/JGME-D-18-00082.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online learning==

Medical education is increasingly utilizing online teaching, usually within [[learning management system]]s (LMSs) or [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs).&lt;ref name="pmid18576185"&gt;

However, the use of evidence-based multimedia design principles in the development of online lectures was seldom reported, despite their known effectiveness in medical student contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Brandon|last2=Coret|first2=Alon|last3=Qureshi|first3=Aatif|last4=Barron|first4=Henry|last5=Ayala|first5=Ana Patricia|last6=Law|first6=Marcus|date=2018|title=Online Lectures in Undergraduate Medical Education: Scoping Review|url=https://mededu.jmir.org/2018/1/e11/|journal=JMIR Medical Education|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|doi=10.2196/mededu.9091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research areas into online medical education include practical applications, including simulated patients and virtual medical records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Favreau|first=Annie|title=Minnesota Virtual Clinic Medical Education Software|url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Minnesota-Virtual-Clinic-Medical-Education-Software__Z05174.aspx|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota|accessdate=2011-09-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152337/http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Minnesota-Virtual-Clinic-Medical-Education-Software__Z05174.aspx|archivedate=2012-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When compared to no intervention, simulation in medical education
training is associated with positive effects on knowledge, skills, and behaviors and moderate effects for patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=DA|last2=Hatala|first2=R|last3=Brydges|first3=R|last4=Zendejas|first4=B|last5=Szostek|first5=JH|last6=Wang|first6=AT|last7=Erwin|first7=PJ|last8=Hamstra|first8=SJ|title=Technology-enhanced simulation for health professions education: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA|date=7 September 2011|volume=306|issue=9|pages=978–88|doi=10.1001/jama.2011.1234|pmid=21900138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example of medical education systems==

At present, in the United Kingdom, a typical medicine course at university is 5 years or 4 years if the student already holds a degree. Among some institutions and for some students, it may be 6 years (including the selection of an intercalated BSc—taking one year—at some point after the pre-clinical studies).  All programs culminate in the [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] degree (abbreviated MBChB, MBBS, MBBCh, BM, etc.). This is followed by 2 clinical foundation years afterward, namely F1 and F2, similar to internship training. Students register with the UK [[General Medical Council]] at the end of F1. At the end of F2, they may pursue further years of study. The system in Australia is very similar, with registration by the Australian Medical Council (AMC).

In the US and Canada, a potential medical student must first complete an undergraduate degree in any subject before applying to a graduate medical school to pursue an ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) program.  U.S. medical schools are almost all four-year programs.  Some students opt for the research-focused M.D./Ph.D. dual degree program, which is usually completed in 7–10 years. There are certain courses that are pre-requisite for being accepted to medical school, such as general [[chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]], [[English language|English]], labwork, etc. The specific requirements vary by school.

In Australia, there are two pathways to a medical degree. Students can choose to take a five- or six-year undergraduate medical degree [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS or BMed) as a first tertiary degree directly after secondary school graduation, or first complete a bachelor's degree (in general three years, usually in the medical sciences) and then apply for a four-year [[Graduate Medical Program|graduate entry]] [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/pathways/medicine/#registration|title=Medicine - Find My Pathway|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.surgeons.org/becoming-a-surgeon/surgery-as-a-career/pathways-through-specialty-medical-training/|title=Pathways through specialty medical training|last=(RACS)|first=Royal Australasian College of Surgeons|website=www.surgeons.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration with [[health policy]] ==
As medical professional stakeholders in the field of health care (i.e. entities integrally involved in the health care system and affected by reform), the practice of medicine (i.e. diagnosing, treating, and monitoring disease) is directly affected by the ongoing changes in both national and local health policy and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Michael L.|title=Introduction: Health Policy and Health Care Economics Observed|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053429608000131|journal=Seminars in Radiation Oncology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=149–151|doi=10.1016/j.semradonc.2008.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One 2010 survey of U.S. medical school deans of education regarding health policy education initiatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mou|first=David|last2=Sarma|first2=Aartik|last3=Sethi|first3=Roshan|last4=Merryman|first4=Reid|date=2011-03-10|title=The State of Health Policy Education in U.S. Medical Schools|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp1101603|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=364|issue=10|pages=e19|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1101603|issn=0028-4793|pmid=21345091}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that of the 160 accredited M.D. and D.O schools surveyed, 58% responded to report that while 94% of them had "some form" of policy education, 74% required that education and only 24% had courses directly on the topic of health policy. 58% reported room for improvement, while 52% were currently in the processing of adapting their policy curriculums. Still, the average amount of time spent with health policy instruction was only 14 hours (SD 12 hours) over the four years of medical school training.

In order to truly integrate health policy matters into physician and medical education, training should begin as early as possible – ideally during medical school or premedical coursework – to build “foundational knowledge and analytical skills” continued during residency and reinforced throughout clinical practice, like any other core skill or competency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This source further recommends adopting a national standardized core health policy curriculum for medical schools and residencies in order to introduce a core foundation in this much needed area, focusing on four main domains of health care: (1) ''systems and principles'' (e.g. financing; payment; models of management; information technology; physician workforce), (2) ''quality and safety'' (e.g. quality improvement indicators, measures, and outcomes; patient safety), (3) ''value and equity'' (e.g. medical economics, medical decision making, comparative effectiveness, health disparities), and (4) ''politics and law'' (e.g. history and consequences of major legislations; adverse events, medical errors, and malpractice).

However limitations to implementing these health policy courses mainly include perceived time constraints from scheduling conflicts, the need for an interdisciplinary faculty team, and lack of research / funding to determine what curriculum design may best suit the program goals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Resistance in one pilot program was seen from program directors who did not see the relevance of the elective course and who were bounded by program training requirements limited by scheduling conflicts and inadequate time for non-clinical activities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greysen|first=S.

Additionally, recruiting and retaining a diverse set of multidisciplinary instructors and policy or economic experts with sufficient knowledge and training may be limited at community-based programs or schools without health policy or public health departments or graduate programs. Remedies may include having online courses, off-site trips to the capitol or health foundations, or dedicated externships, but these have interactive, cost, and time constraints as well. Despite these limitations, several programs in both medical school and residency training have been pioneered.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalanotti|first=Jillian|last2=Popiel|first2=David|last3=Johansson|first3=Patrik|last4=Talib|first4=Zohray|date=2014-01-07|title=A Pilot Curriculum to Integrate Community Health Into Internal Medicine Residency Training|url=http://www.jgme.org/doi/abs/10.4300/JGME-D-12-00354.1|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|language=EN|volume=5|issue=4|pages=674–677|doi=10.4300/jgme-d-12-00354.1|pmc=3886472}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/09/481206602/this-med-school-teaches-health-policy-along-with-the-pills|title=This Med School Teaches Health Policy Along With The Pills.|last=Rovner|first=Julie|date=June 9, 2016|work=|access-date=December 13, 2016|via=NPR and Kaiser Health News (KHN)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shah SH, Clark MD, Hu K, Shoener JA, Fogel J, Kling WC, Ronayne J  [https://mededu.jmir.org/2017/2/e18/ Systems-Based Training in Graduate Medical Education for Service Learning in the State Legislature in the United States: Pilot Study]  JMIR Med Educ 2017;3(2):e18  DOI: 10.2196/mededu.7730  {{PMID|29042343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, more national support and research will be needed to not only establish these programs, but to evaluate how to both standardize and innovate the curriculum in a way that is flexible with the changing health care and policy landscape. In the United States, this will involve coordination with the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]] (Accrediting Council for Graduate Medical Education), a private NPO that sets educational and training standards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/echo/acgme-core-competencies.html.|title=ACGME Core Competencies.|last=The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)|first=|date=July 5, 2012|website=http://www.ecfmg.org/|publisher=The Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates.|access-date=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for U.S. residencies and fellowships that determines funding and ability to operate.

'''Naval architecture''', or '''naval engineering''', along with [[automotive engineering]] and [[aerospace engineering]], is an [[engineering]] discipline branch of [[vehicle engineering]], incorporating elements of mechanical, electrical, electronic, software and safety engineering as applied to the [[engineering design process]], [[shipbuilding]], maintenance, and operation of [[watercraft|marine vessels]] and structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rina.org.uk/careers_in_naval_architecture.html RINA – Careers in Naval Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biran, Adrian; (2003). Ship hydrostatics and stability (1st Ed.) – [[Butterworth-Heinemann]]. {{ISBN|0-7506-4988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, [[Shipbuilding|construction]], [[Sea trial|trials]], operation and maintenance, launching and [[dry-docking]] are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being [[Ship#Repair and conversion|modified]] (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or [[ship repair|repair]]). Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage-control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet [[statutory]] and non-statutory requirements.

==Main subjects==
The word "vessel" includes every description of [[watercraft]], including non-displacement craft, [[Ground effect vehicle|WIG craft]] and [[seaplane]]s, used or capable of being used as a means of [[Water transport|transportation on water]].&lt;ref&gt;Convention On The [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], 1972,As Amended; [[International Maritime Organization]]; {{ISBN|92-801-4167-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal elements of naval architecture are:&lt;ref&gt;Lewis V, Edward (Ed.); (June 1989). Principles of Naval Architecture (2nd Rev.) Vol. 1 – [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers]]. {{ISBN|0-939773-00-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrostatics===
[[Image:Lines plan en.svg|thumb|right|200px|Body plan of a ship showing the hull form]]
[[Hydrostatics]] concerns the conditions to which the vessel is subjected while at rest in water and to its ability to remain afloat. This involves computing [[buoyancy]], [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]], and other hydrostatic properties such as [[Sailing ballast|trim]] (the measure of the longitudinal inclination of the vessel) and [[Ship stability|stability]] (the ability of a vessel to restore itself to an upright position after being inclined by wind, sea, or loading conditions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usna.edu/NAOE/academics/en342.php www.usna.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrodynamics===
[[Hydrodynamics]] concerns the flow of water around the ship's [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], [[Bow (ship)|bow]], and [[stern]], and over bodies such as [[Boat Propeller|propeller]] blades or [[rudder]], or through thruster tunnels. 
[[Ship resistance and propulsion|Resistance]] – resistance towards motion in water primarily caused due to flow of water around the hull. Powering calculation is done based on this.
[[Marine propulsion|Propulsion]] – to move the vessel through water using [[propellers]], thrusters, [[Pump-jet|water jets]], [[sail]]s etc. Engine types are mainly [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]]. Some vessels are electrically powered using [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear]] or [[solar energy]].
[[Ship motions]] – involves motions of the vessel in seaway and its responses in waves and wind.
Controllability (maneuvering) – involves controlling and maintaining position and direction of the vessel.

=== Flotation and stability ===
While atop a liquid surface a floating body has 6 degrees of freedom in its movements, these are categorized in either rotation or translation.
* Fore and aft translation is termed surge.
* Transverse translation is termed sway.
* Vertical translation is termed heave.
* Rotation about a transverse axis is termed trim or pitch.
* Rotation about a fore and aft axis is termed heel or roll.
* Rotation about a vertical axis is termed yaw.

Longitudinal stability for longitudinal inclinations, the stability depends upon the distance between the center of gravity and the longitudinal meta-center. In other words, the basis in which the ship maintains its center of gravity is its distance set equally apart from both the aft and forward section of the ship.

While a body floats on a liquid surface it still encounters the force of gravity pushing down on it. In order to stay afloat and avoid sinking there is an opposed force acting against the body known as the hydrostatic pressures. The forces acting on the body must be of the same magnitude and same line of motion in order to maintain the body at equilibrium. This description of equilibrium is only present when a freely floating body is in still water, when other conditions are present the magnitude of which these forces shifts drastically creating the swaying motion of the body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Naval Architecture|last=Tupper|first=Eric|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=1996|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the body, in other words, the mass of the body is equal to the mass of the water displaced by the body. This adds an upward force to the body by the amount of surface area times the area displaced in order to create an equilibrium between the surface of the body and the surface of the water.

The stability of a ship under most conditions is able to overcome any form or restriction or resistance encountered in rough seas; however, ships have undesirable roll characteristics when the balance of oscillations in roll is two times that of oscillations in heave, thus causing the ship to capsize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neves|first=M. A. S.|date=2016|title=Dynamic stability of ships in regular and irregular seas - An Overview|url=|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=120|pages=362–370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Oil tanker deck.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Deck of an oil tanker, looking aft]]

===Structures===
[[Structural engineering|Structures]] involves selection of material of construction, [[structural analysis]] of global and local strength of the vessel, vibration of the structural components and structural responses of the vessel during [[Seakeeping|motions in seaway]]. Depending on the type of ship, the structure and design will vary in what material to use as well as how much of it. Some ships are made from glass reinforced plastics but the vast majority are steel with possibly some aluminium in the superstructure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The complete structure of the ship is designed with panels shaped in a rectangular form consisting of steel plating supported on four edges. Combined in a large surface area the Grillages create the hull of the ship''',''' deck, and bulkheads while still providing mutual support of the frames. Though the structure of the ship is sturdy enough to hold itself together the main force it has to overcome is longitudinal bending creating a strain against its hull, its structure must be designed so that the material is disposed as much forward and aft as possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The principal longitudinal elements are the deck, shell plating, inner bottom all of which are in the form of grillages, and additional longitudinal stretching to these. The dimensions of the ship are in order to create enough spacing between the stiffeners in prevention of buckling. Warships have used a longitudinal system of stiffening that many modern commercial vessels have adopted. This system was widely used in early merchant ships such as the [[SS Great Eastern]], but later shifted to transversely framed structure another concept in ship hull design that proved more practical. This system was later implemented on modern vessels such as tankers because of its popularity and was then named the Isherwood system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The arrangement of the Isherwood system consists of stiffening decks both side and bottom by longitudinal members, they are separated enough so they have the same distance between them as the frames and beams. This system works by spacing out the transverse members that support the longitudinal by about 3 or 4 meters, with the wide spacing this causes the traverse strength needed by displacing the amount of force the bulkheads provide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Arrangements===
Arrangements involves [[concept design]], layout and access, [[fire protection]], allocation of spaces, [[ergonomics]] and [[Tonnage|capacity]].

===Construction===
[[Shipbuilding|Construction]] depends on the material used. When steel or aluminium is used this involves welding of the plates and profiles after [[Rolling (metalworking)|rolling]], marking, [[Machining|cutting]] and [[Bending (metalworking)|bending]] as per the [[structural design]] drawings or models, followed by erection and [[Ship launching|launching]]. [[Adhesive bonding|Other joining techniques]] are used for other materials like [[fibre reinforced plastic]] and [[glass-reinforced plastic]].The process of construction is thought-out cautiously while considering all factors like safety, strength of structure, hydrodynamics, and ship arrangement. Each factor considered presents a new option for materials to consider as well as ship orientation. When the strength of the structure is considered the acts of ship collision are considered in the way that the ships structure is altered. Therefore, the properties of materials are considered carefully as applied material on the struck ship has elastic properties, the energy absorbed by the ship being struck is then deflected in the opposite direction, so both ships go through the process of rebounding to prevent further damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prabowo|first=A. R.|date=2017|title=Effects of the rebounding of a striking ship on structural crashworthiness during ship-ship collision|url=|journal=Thin-Walled Structures|volume=115|pages=225–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and craft==
Traditionally, naval architecture has been more craft than science.  The suitability of a vessel's shape was judged by looking at a half-model of a vessel or a prototype.  Ungainly shapes or abrupt transitions were frowned on as being flawed.  This included rigging, deck arrangements, and even fixtures.  Subjective descriptors such as ungainly, full, and fine were used as a substitute for the [[Hull (watercraft)|more precise terms]] used today.  A vessel was, and still is described as having a ‘fair’ shape.  The term ‘fair’ is meant to denote not only a smooth transition from fore to aft but also a shape that was ‘right.’  Determining what is ‘right’ in a particular situation in the absence of definitive supporting analysis encompasses the art of naval architecture to this day.

Modern low-cost digital [[computers]] and dedicated [[software]], combined with extensive research to correlate full-scale, [[towing tank]] and computational data, have enabled naval architects to more accurately predict the performance of a marine vehicle. These tools are used for [[Stability conditions (watercraft)|static stability]] (intact and damaged), dynamic stability, resistance, powering, hull development, [[structural analysis]], green water modelling, and slamming analysis. Data are regularly shared in international conferences sponsored by [[Royal Institution of Naval Architects|RINA]], [[Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers|Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME)]] and others. [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] is being applied to predict the response of a floating body in a random sea.

==The naval architect==
[[File:Naval Architect at Work.JPG|thumb|Naval architect at work]]
Due to the complexity associated with operating in a marine environment, naval architecture is a co-operative effort between groups of technically skilled individuals who are specialists in particular fields, often coordinated by a lead naval architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalengineers.org/About/Brochure/naval_engineering.html American Society of Naval Engineers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226035256/http://www.navalengineers.org/About/Brochure/naval_engineering.html |date=December 26, 2008 }}. Naval engineering brochure.&lt;/ref&gt; This inherent complexity also means that the analytical tools available are much less evolved than those for designing aircraft, cars and even spacecraft.  This is due primarily to the paucity of data on the environment the marine vehicle is required to work in and the complexity of the interaction of waves and wind on a marine structure.

A naval architect is an [[engineer]] who is responsible for the design, construction, and/or repair of ships, boats, other marine vessels, and offshore structures, both commercial and military, including:

:* [[Merchant ship]]s – [[oil tanker]]s, [[LNG carrier|gas tankers]], [[cargo ship]]s, [[bulk carrier]]s, [[container ships]]
:* [[Ferry|Passenger/vehicle ferries]], [[cruise ship]]s
:* [[Warship]]s – [[frigate]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[aircraft carrier]]s, amphibious ships
:* [[Submarine]]s and underwater vehicles
:* [[Icebreaker]]s
:* [[High speed craft]] – [[hovercraft]], [[catamaran|multi-hull ships]], [[hydrofoil]] craft
:* Workboats – [[barge]]s, [[fishing boat]]s, [[anchor handling tug supply vessel]]s, [[platform supply vessel]]s, [[tug boat]]s, pilot vessels, rescue craft
:* [[Yacht]]s, power boats, and other recreational watercraft
:* [[Offshore platform]]s and [[Subsea#Oil and gas|subsea]] developments
[[File:Model of Veteran Class MT46 Tanker, Florida .jpg|thumb|1/100 scale model of Veteran Class MT46 Tanker. Florida]]
Some of these vessels are amongst the largest (such as [[supertankers]]), most complex (such as [[Aircraft carriers]]), and highly valued movable structures produced by mankind. They are typically the most efficient method of transporting the world's raw materials and products. Modern engineering on this scale is essentially a team activity conducted by specialists in their respective fields and disciplines. 
Naval architects integrate these activities. This demanding leadership role requires managerial qualities and the ability to bring together the often-conflicting demands of the various design constraints to produce a product which is fit for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Family Standard for Professional Work in the Engineering and Architecture Group, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, pp. 43–45 |url=http://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512122916/https://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this leadership role, a naval architect also has a specialist function in ensuring that a safe, economic, environmentally sound and [[seaworthy]] design is produced. To undertake all these tasks, a naval architect must have an understanding of many branches of engineering and must be in the forefront of high technology areas. He or she must be able to effectively utilize the services provided by scientists, lawyers, accountants, and business people of many kinds.

Naval architects typically work for [[shipyard]]s, ship owners, design firms and consultancies, equipment manufacturers, [[Classification society|Classification societies]], regulatory bodies ([[Admiralty law]]), [[Navy|navies]], and governments.

The '''Office of Technology Assessment''' ('''OTA''') was an office of the [[United States Congress]] from 1972 to 1995. OTA's purpose was to provide Congressional members and committees with objective and authoritative analysis of the complex scientific and technical issues of the late 20th century, i.e. [[technology assessment]]. It was a leader in practicing and encouraging delivery of public services in innovative and inexpensive ways, including early involvement in the distribution of government documents through [[electronic publishing]]. Its model was widely copied around the world.

[[Princeton University]] hosts The OTA Legacy site, which holds "the complete collection of OTA publications along with additional materials that illuminate the history and impact of the agency". On July 23, 2008 the [[Federation of American Scientists]] launched a similar archive that includes interviews and additional documents about OTA.

==History==
Congress established the Office of Technology Assessment with the Technology Assessment Act of 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-86/pdf/STATUTE-86-Pg797.pdf |title=Technology Assessment Act of 1972 ~ Public Law 92-484 |date=October 13, 1972 |series=86 Stat. 797 ~ House Bill 10243 |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office}} ([http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/ns20/act_f.html HTML version])&lt;/ref&gt; It was governed by a twelve-member board, comprising six members of Congress from each party — half from the Senate and half from the House of Representatives.  During its twenty-four-year life it produced about 750 studies on a wide range of topics, including [[acid rain]], [[health care]], global [[climate change]], and [[polygraphs]].

===Closure===
{{Multiple image|direction=horizontal |align=right|image1=OTAShirt-Front.png|image2=OTAShirt-Back.png|footer=The front and back of a tee shirt created and worn by some staff of the OTA to express their sentiments about the intent of the 104th Congress to terminate their service while simultaneously increasing the Library of Congress' budget by an amount equal to nearly twice that of OTA's. Compare to the official seal above, and note the arm of Congress strangling the symbolic U.S.A. in the satirical version.}}

Criticism of the agency was fueled by ''Fat City'', a 1980 book by [[Donald Lambro]] that was regarded favorably by the Reagan administration; it called OTA an "unnecessary agency" that duplicated government work done elsewhere.  OTA was abolished (technically "de-funded") in the "[[Contract with America]]" period of [[Newt Gingrich]]'s Republican ascendancy in Congress.

When the [[104th Congress]] withdrew funding for OTA, it had a full-time staff of 143 people and an annual budget of $21.9 million.  The Office of Technology Assessment closed on September 29, 1995. The move was criticized at the time, including by Republican representative [[Amo Houghton]], who commented at the time of OTA’s defunding that "we are cutting off one of the most important arms of Congress when we cut off unbiased knowledge about science and technology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2010/06/nader-proposes-reviving-congressional-office-of-technology-assessment/ Nader proposes reviving Congressional Office of Technology Assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the closure saw it as an example of politics overriding science, and a variety of scientists have called for the agency's reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/09/14/bring-back-the-ota/ |title=Bring back the OTA |accessdate=2013-03-12 |author=PZ Myers |date=September 14, 2007|publisher=[[Scienceblogs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
While the OTA was closed down, the idea of [[technology assessment]] survived, in particular in Europe. The [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network coordinates members of [[technology assessment]] units working for various European governments. The US [[Government Accountability Office]] has meanwhile established a TA unit, taking on former duties of the OTA.

While campaigning in the [[2008 US presidential election]], [[Hillary Clinton]] pledged to work to restore the OTA if elected [[United States President|President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Healy |author2=Cornelia Dean |title=Clinton Says She Would Shield Science From Politics |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/05/us/politics/05clinton.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page= |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/speech/view/?id=3570 |title=Scientific Integrity and Innovation: Remarks at the Carnegie Institution for Science |accessdate=2007-10-05 |date=October 4, 2007}} Text of Clinton's speech to the [[Carnegie Institution]].&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 29, 2009, House of Representatives member [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.|Rush Holt]] of New Jersey wrote an op-ed piece articulating the argument for restoring the OTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/04/fromthefields-holt/ |first=Rush |last=Holt |authorlink=Rush D. Holt, Jr. |title=Lobotomy |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=2009-04-29 |date=April 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 The [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] released a report entitled "Reinventing Technology Assessment" that emphasized citizen engagement and called for performing the functions of the OTA by creating a nationwide network of non-partisan policy research organizations, universities, and science museums: the Expert &amp; Citizen Assessment of Science &amp; Technology (ECAST) network. ECAST would conduct both expert and participatory technology assessments for Congress and other clients.  The author of the report was Dr. Richard Sclove of the Loka Institute.  The report states that the drive to modernize OTA was initiated by [[Darlene Cavalier]], a popular citizen science advocate and author of the Science Cheerleader blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wilsoncenter.org/topics/docs/ReinventingTechnologyAssessment1.pdf |title= Reinventing Technology Assessment: A 21st Century Model |accessdate=2010-05-05 | author=Richard Sclove |date=April 2010 |publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavalier outlined the idea of the citizen network in a guest blog post for [[Discover Magazine]]'s The Intersection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/2010/04/29/a-little-respect-involving-citizens-in-technology-assessment/ |title=A Little Respect: Involving Citizens in Technology Assessment |accessdate=2010-05-05 |author=[[Darlene Cavalier]] |date=April 29, 2010|publisher=Discover}}&lt;/ref&gt; She introduced the concept in an article in Science Progress in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceprogress.org/2008/07/harnessing-citizen-scientists/ |title=Harnessing Citizen Scientists |accessdate=2010-05-05 |author=[[Darlene Cavalier]] |date=July 7, 2008|publisher=Science Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They may be contrasted with [[copiotrophs]], which prefer nutritionally rich environments. Oligotrophs are characterized by slow growth, low rates of metabolism, and generally low population density.

The adjective ''oligotrophic'' may be used to refer to environments that offer little to sustain life, organisms that survive in such environments, or the adaptations that support survival. [[etymology|Etymologically]], the word "oligotroph" is a combination of the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] adjective ''oligos'' (ὀλίγος)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|o)li/gos|ὀλίγος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "few" and the adjective ''trophikos'' (τροφικός)&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|trofiko/s|τροφικός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;) meaning "feeding".

Oligotrophic environments include deep oceanic sediments, caves, glacial and polar ice, deep subsurface soil, aquifers, ocean waters, and leached soils.

Examples of oligotrophic organisms are the cave-dwelling [[olm]]; the bacterium, ''[[Pelagibacter ubique]]'', which is the most abundant organism in the oceans with an estimated 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; individuals in total; and the [[lichen]]s with their extremely low [[metabolic rate]].

==Plant adaptations==
Plant adaptations to oligotrophic soils provide for greater and more efficient nutrient uptake, reduced nutrient consumption, and efficient nutrient storage. Improvements in nutrient uptake are facilitated by root adaptations such as [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[root nodule]]s, [[mycorrhiza]]e and [[cluster roots]]. Consumption is reduced by very slow growth rates, and by efficient use of low-availability nutrients; for example, the use of highly available ions to maintain [[turgor pressure]], with low-availability nutrients reserved for the building of tissues. Despite these adaptations, nutrient requirement typically exceed uptake during the growing season, so many oligotrophic plants have the ability to store nutrients, for example, in trunk tissues, when demand is low, and remobilise them when demand increases.

== Oligotrophic environments ==
'''Oligotrophs''' occupy environments where the available nutrients offer little to sustain life. The term “'''oligotrophic'''” is commonly used to describe terrestrial and aquatic environments with very low concentrations of nitrates, iron, phosphates, and carbon sources.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koch|first1=Arthur L.|title=Oligotrophs versus copiotrophs|journal=BioEssays|date=July 2001|volume=23|issue=7|page=657-661|doi=10.1002/bies.1091}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extremophiles Where it all Began|last1=Horikoshi|first1=Koki|date=2016|publisher=Springer Japan|year=|isbn=978-4-431-55407-3|location=Tokyo, Japan|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-4-431-55408-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oligotrophs have acquired survival mechanisms that involve the expression of genes during periods of low nutrient conditions, which has allowed them to find success in various environments. Despite the capability to live in low nutrient concentrations, oligotrophs may find difficulty surviving in nutrient-rich environments.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Antarctica ===
Antarctic life offers very little to sustain life as most organisms are not well adapted to live under nutrient-limiting conditions and cold temperatures (lower than 5 °C). As such, these environments display a large abundance of [[Psychrophile|psychrophiles]] that are well adapted to living in an Antarctic biome. Most oligotrophs live in lakes where water helps support biochemical processes for growth and survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anesio|first1=Alexandre M.|last2=Laybourn-Parry|first2=Johanna|title=Glaciers and ice sheets as a biome|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=April 2012|volume=27|issue=4|pages=219–225|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2011.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some documented examples of oligotrophic environments in Antarctica:

'''[[Lake Vostok]]''', a freshwater lake which has been isolated from the world beneath 4 km (2.5 mi) of Antarctic ice is frequently held to be a primary example of an oligotrophic environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Race against time for raiders of the lost lake |date=2011 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=469 |issue= 7330|pages=275 |doi=10.1038/469275a |pmid=21248808|bibcode=2011Natur.469..275S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of ice samples showed ecologically separated microenvironments.

It is proposed that low competitive selection against ''Daphniopsis studeri'' has allowed the species to survive long enough to reproduce in nutrient limiting environments.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Australia===
The sandplains and [[laterite|lateritic soils]] of southern [[Western Australia]], where an extremely thick [[craton]] has precluded any geological activity since the [[Cambrian]] and there has been no [[glaciation]] to renew soils since the [[Carboniferous]]. Thus, soils are extremely nutrient-poor and most vegetation must use strategies such as [[cluster root]]s to gain even the smallest quantities of such nutrients as [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]].

The vegetation in these regions, however, is remarkable for its [[biodiversity]], which in places is as great as that of a [[tropical rainforest]] and produces some of the most spectacular wildflowers in the world. It is however, severely threatened by [[climate change in Australia|climate change]] which has moved the winter rain belt south, and also by clearing for [[agriculture]] and through use of [[fertilizer]]s, which is primarily driven by low land costs which make farming economic even with yields a fraction of those in Europe or North America.

===South America===
An example of oligotrophic soils are those on white-sands, with [[soil pH]] lower than 5.0, on the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] basin on northern [[Amazon Basin|Amazonia]] that house very low-diversity, extremely fragile forests and savannahs drained by [[blackwater river]]s; dark water colour due to high concentration of [[tannin]]s, [[humic acid]]s and other organic compounds derived from the very slow decomposition of plant matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janzen |first=D.

===Ocean===
In the [[ocean]], the [[Oceanic gyre|subtropical gyres]] north and south of the [[equator]] are regions in which the [[nutrient]]s required for [[phytoplankton]] growth (for instance, [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[silicic acid]]) are strongly depleted all year round.  These areas are described as oligotrophic and exhibit low surface [[chlorophyll]].  They are occasionally described as "ocean deserts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2008/20080305_oceandesert.html | date=2008-03-05| accessdate=2009-07-17 | publisher=[[NOAA]] | title=Study Shows Ocean "Deserts" are Expanding }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oligotrophic soil environments ===
The oligotrophic soil environments include agricultural soil, frozen soil etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Various factors, such as [[decomposition]], soil structure, [[Fertilizer|fertilization]] and [[temperature]], can affect the nutrient-availability in the soil environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Generally, the nutrient becomes less available along the depth of the soil environment, because on the surface, the organic compounds decomposed from the plant and animal [[debris]] are consumed quickly by other microbes, resulting in the lack of nutrient in the deeper level of soil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the metabolic waste produced by the microorganisms on the surface also causes the accumulation of toxic chemicals in the deeper area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, oxygen and water are important for some metabolic pathways, but it is difficult for water and oxygen to diffuse as the depth increases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bacteria in oligotrophic environments: Starvation-survival life style|last=Morita|first=Richard Yukio|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|year=1997|isbn=9780412106613|location=New York|pages=50 - 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some factors, such as soil aggregates, pores and extracellular enzymes, may help water, oxygen and other nutrients diffuse into the soil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, the presence of mineral under the soil provides the alternative sources for the species living in the oligotrophic soil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In terms of the agricultural lands, the application of fertilizer has a complicated impact on the source of carbon, either increasing or decreasing the organic carbon in the soil.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finn|first=Damien|last2=Kopittke|first2=Peter M.|last3=Dennis|first3=Paul G.|last4=Dalal|first4=Ram C.|title=Microbial energy and matter transformation in agricultural soils|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0038071716304771|journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry|volume=111|pages=176–192|doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.04.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Collimonas]]'' is one of the species that are capable of living in the oligotrophic soil.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; One common feature of the environments where ''[[Collimonas]]'' lives is the presence of fungi, because ''[[Collimonas]]'' have the ability of not only hydrolyzing the [[chitin]] produced by fungi for nutrients, but also producing materials (e.g., ''P. fluorescens'' 2-79) to protect themselves from fungal infection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The mutual relationship is common in the oligotrophic environments. Additionally, ''[[Collimonas]]'' can also obtain electron sources from rocks and minerals by [[weathering]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leveau|first=Johan H. J.|last2=Uroz|first2=Stéphane|last3=De Boer|first3=Wietse|date=2010-02-01|title=The bacterial genus Collimonas: mycophagy, weathering and other adaptive solutions to life in oligotrophic soil environments|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02010.x/abstract|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=281–292|doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02010.x|issn=1462-2920}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In terms of polar areas, such as Antarctic and Arctic region, the soil environment is considered as oligotrophic because the soil is frozen with low biological activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most abundant species in the frozen soil are [[Actinobacteria]], [[Proteobacteria]], [[Acidobacteria]] and [[Cyanobacteria]], together with a small amount of archaea and fungi.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Actinobacteria]] can maintain the activity of their metabolic enzymes and continue their biochemical reactions under a wide range of low temperature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, the DNA repairing machinery in [[Actinobacteria]] protects them from lethal DNA mutation at low temperature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makhalanyane|first=Thulani Peter|last2=Goethem|first2=Marc Warwick Van|last3=Cowan|first3=Don Arthur|title=Microbial diversity and functional capacity in polar soils|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0958166916300179|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=38|pages=159–166|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2016.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Human sexuality]]''' is the capacity to have [[erotic]] experiences and responses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.definition-of.com/human%20sexuality&lt;/ref&gt; Human sexuality can also refer to the way one person is sexually attracted to another person of the opposite sex ([[heterosexuality]]), the same sex ([[homosexuality]]), or having both tendencies ([[bisexuality]]). The lack of sexual attraction is referred to as [[asexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;University of California, Santa Barbara's SexInfo&lt;/ref&gt; Human sexuality impacts cultural, political, legal and philosophical aspects of life, as well as being widely connected to issues of [[morality]], [[ethics]], [[theology]], [[spirituality]], or [[religion]]. It is not, however, directly tied to [[gender]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''[[Humanities]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] that study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[Critical theory|critical]], or [[speculative philosophy|speculative]], as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[Science|natural sciences]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What types of thing are the humanities? ==

The humanities can be described as all of the following:
* a branch of [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is a field of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* study of the [[human condition]] &amp;ndash; unique and inescapable features of being human in a social, cultural, and personal context. The study of the humanities (history, philosophy, literature, the arts, etc.) all help understand the nature of the human condition and the broader cultural and social arrangements that make up human lives.

== The various humanities ==

* [[Classics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of classical studies|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the languages, literature, philosophy, history, art, archaeology and all other cultural elements of the ancient Mediterranean world (Bronze Age ca. BC 3000 to Late Antiquity ca. AD 300–600); especially Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.
** [[Digital classics]] &amp;ndash; application of the tools of digital humanities to the field of classics, or more broadly to the study of the ancient world.
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
** [[Digital history]] &amp;ndash;  use of digital media and tools for historical practice, presentation, analysis, and research. It is a branch of the Digital Humanities and an outgrowth of Quantitative history, Cliometrics, and History and Computing.
* [[Language]]s &amp;ndash; study of individual languages ([[Italian language]], [[Japanese language]]) or groups of related languages ([[Romance languages]], [[Slavic languages]]). Not to be confused with [[Linguistics]], the study of the structure and function of language.
* [[Literature]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of literature|outline]]) &amp;ndash; the art of written work, and is not confined to published sources (although, under some circumstances, unpublished sources can also be exempt).
** [[Comparative literature]] &amp;nbsp; comparative research into literature from more than one language, working with the original languages in which the texts were written
* [[Philosophy]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of philosophy|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with [[Ontology|existence]], [[Epistemology|knowledge]], [[Axiology|values]], reason, [[Philosophy of mind|mind]], and language.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: "Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: "The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value."&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason|rational argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: "Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Religion]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of religion|outline]]) &amp;ndash; a religion is a collection of [[cultural systems]], [[belief systems]], and [[worldviews]] that establishes symbols that relate humanity to [[spirituality]] and, sometimes,&lt;!--not all religions concern themselves with morality--&gt; to moral values.&lt;ref&gt;While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system" (Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973). A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category." (Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and sacred histories that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the [[universe]]. They tend to derive [[Moral code|morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]].
* [[Visual arts]] ([[Outline of the visual arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art forms that create works which are primarily visual in nature. Examples of visual arts include:
** [[Architecture]] ([[Outline of architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; The art and science of designing and erecting buildings and other physical structures.
*** [[Classical architecture]] ([[Outline of classical architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; architecture of classical antiquity and later architectural styles influenced by it.
** [[Handicraft|Arts and crafts]] ([[Outline of crafts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; recreational activities and hobbies that involve making things with one's hands and skill.
** [[Drawing]] ([[Outline of drawing and drawings|outline]]) &amp;ndash; visual art that makes use of any number of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium.
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures.
** [[Painting]] ([[Outline of painting|outline]]) &amp;ndash; practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a surface with a brush or other object.
** [[Art history]]
** [[Photography]] ([[Outline of photography|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art, science, and practice of creating pictures by recording radiation on a radiation-sensitive medium, such as a photographic film, or electronic image sensors.
** [[Sculpture]] ([[Outline of sculpture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard materials - typically stone such as marble - or metal, glass, or wood.
* [[Performing arts]] ([[Outline of performing arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; those forms of art that use the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium.  Examples of performing arts include:
** [[Dance]] ([[Outline of dance|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form of movement of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of expression, social interaction, or presented in a spiritual or performance setting.
** [[Drama]] &amp;nbsp; study of regional, global, or historical theatre, as well as techniques for acting, directing and choreographing plays
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures, the art form that records performances visually.
** [[Installation art]] &amp;ndash; the merging of multiple genres into a coherent three-dimensional, multi-sensory work.
** [[Theatre]] ([[Outline of theatre|outline]]) &amp;ndash; collaborative form of fine art that uses live performers to present the experience of a real or imagined event before a live audience in a specific place.
** [[Music]] ([[Outline of music|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form the medium of which is sound and silence.
** [[Opera]] ([[List of opera topics|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (called a libretto) and musical score.&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions of opera: "dramatic performance or composition of which music is an essential part, branch of art concerned with this" (''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]''); "any dramatic work that can be sung (or at times declaimed or spoken) in a place for performance, set to original music for singers (usually in costume) and instrumentalists" (Amanda Holden, ''Viking Opera Guide''); "musical work for the stage with singing characters, originated in early years of 17th century" (''[[Pears Cyclopaedia]]'', 1983 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Stagecraft]] ([[Outline of stagecraft|outline]]) &amp;ndash; technical aspects of theatrical, film, and video production. It includes, but is not limited to, constructing and rigging scenery, hanging and focusing of lighting, design and procurement of costumes, makeup, procurement of props, stage management, and recording and mixing of sound.

=== Humanities that are also social sciences ===
* [[Anthropology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of anthropology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of how humans developed biologically and culturally.
* [[Archaeology]] &amp;nbsp; research into human history by locating and studying artifacts, structural remains, and other surviving evidence
* [[Area studies]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular geographical, national/federal, or cultural regions. The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the social sciences and the humanities. Typical area studies programs involve history, political science, sociology, cultural studies, languages, geography, literature, and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include diaspora and emigration from the area studied.
* [[Communication studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of communication|outline]]) &amp;ndash; deals with processes of human communication, commonly defined as the sharing of symbols to create meaning. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts.
* [[Cultural studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of culture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary academic field grounded in [[critical theory]] and [[literary criticism]] that attempts to understand the political dynamics of contemporary culture, as well as its historical foundations, conflicts, and defining traits. Researchers concentrate on how a particular [[medium (communication)|medium]] or [[message]] relates to [[ideology]], [[social class]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[gender]] rather than investigating a particular culture or area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;In a loosely related but separate usage, the phrase '''cultural studies''' sometimes serves as a rough [[synonym]] for '''[[area studies]]''', as a general term referring to the academic study of particular cultures in departments and programs such as [[Islamic studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African American studies]], ''et al.''. However, strictly speaking, cultural studies programs  are not concerned with specific areas of the world so much as specific cultural practices.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
* [[Law]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of law|outline]]) &amp;ndash; set of rules and principles by which a society is governed. (For branches, see ''Law'' under ''Society'' below).

* [[Technology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of technology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures.

A military '''outpost''' is detachment of troops stationed at a distance from the main [[Armed forces|force]] or [[Formation (military)|formation]], usually at a station in a remote or sparsely populated location, positioned to stand guard against unauthorized intrusions and surprise attacks; and the station occupied by such troops, usually a small military base or settlement in an outlying frontier, limit, political boundary or in another country. Outposts can also be called '''miniature military bases''' based on size and number of troops it houses. &lt;ref name="Dictionary meaning: Outpost"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/outpost Dictionary meaning: Outpost]; TheFreeDictionary; An online Dictionary and Thesaurus&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent military use ==
Military outposts, more recently referred to as combat outposts (COPs), served as a cornerstone of counterinsurgency doctrine in Iraq and Afghanistan.  These permanent or semi-permanent structures, often located in or near populated areas, enabled military forces to secure key lines of communication or infrastructure, secure and co-opt the populace, assist the government in restoring essential services, and force insurgents to operate elsewhere. &lt;ref&gt;Seidel, S. B. (2010). ''Planning Combat Outposts to Maximize Population Security''. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a538711.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Combat Outposts were almost unanimously described in positive terms by defense analysts and military officers as a means through which to carry out its counterinsurgency efforts. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/journal/docs-temp/138-hsia.pdf|title=A Quick Review of Combat Outposts (COPs)|last=Hsia|first=Timothy|date=2008|website=Small Wars Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, the principle means that a component of a system should behave in a way that most users will expect it to behave; the behavior should not astonish or surprise users.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Formulation==
A [[textbook]] formulation is: "People are part of the system. The design should match the user's experience, expectations, and [[mental model]]s."&lt;ref name="SaltzerKaashoek2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saltzer|first1=J. H.|last2=Kaashoek|first2=Frans|authorlink2 =  Frans Kaashoek | title=Principles of computer system design: an introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-NOcVMGWSUC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2009|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-12-374957-4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of "least surprising" behavior can depend on the expected [[audience]] (for example, [[end user]]s, [[programmer]]s, or [[System Administrators Day|system administrators]]).&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt;

In more practical terms, the principle aims to leverage the pre-existing knowledge of users to minimize the [[learning curve]], for instance by designing interfaces that borrow heavily from "functionally similar or analogous programs with which your users are likely to be familiar".&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt; User expectations in this respect may be closely related to a particular [[computing platform]] or [[tradition]]. For example, [[Unix]] command line programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to [[Switch (command line)|switches]],&lt;ref name="Raymond2004" /&gt; and [[GUI widget|widget]]s of [[Microsoft Windows]] programs are expected to follow certain conventions with respect to [[keyboard shortcut]]s.&lt;ref name="Petroutsos2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petroutsos|first=Evangelos|title=Mastering Microsoft Visual Basic 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7LZTSVKZDoC&amp;pg=PA133|year=2010|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-53287-4|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more abstract settings like an [[Application programming interface|API]], the expectation that [[Function (computer science)|function]] or method names intuitively match their behavior is another example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176622 |chapter=How to design a good API and why it matters |last=Bloch|first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Bloch |publisher=Association for Computing Machinery |year=2006 |pages=506–7  |doi=10.1145/1176617.1176622 |isbn=1-59593-491-X  |title=Proceeding OOPSLA '06 Companion to the 21st ACM SIGPLAN symposium on Object-oriented programming systems, languages, and applications }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice also involves the application of sensible [[default (computer science)|default]]s.&lt;ref name="rexx" /&gt;

When two elements of an interface conflict, or are ambiguous, the behavior should be that which will least surprise the [[User (computing)|user]]; in particular a [[programmer]] should try to think of the behavior that will least surprise someone who uses the program, rather than that behavior that is natural from knowing the inner workings of the program.&lt;ref name="rexx"&gt;{{cite journal

|quote=Could there be a high astonishment factor associated with the new feature?

==Examples==
A web site could declare an [[Form (HTML)|input]] that should autofocus when the page is loaded,&lt;ref name="Forms in HTML"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Forms_in_HTML#The_autofocus_attribute | title=Forms in HTML | publisher=Mozilla | work=Mozilla Developers Network | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a search field (e.g., [[Google.com]]), or the ''username'' field of a [[login]] [[Form (HTML)|form]].  Sites offering [[keyboard shortcut]]s often allow pressing {{Key press|?}} to see the available shortcuts.  Examples include [[Gmail]]&lt;ref name="Gmail Keyboard Shortcuts"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594 | title=Keyboard shortcuts for Gmail | author=Vivian | publisher=Google | date=2013-06-21 | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jira (software)|Jira]].&lt;ref name="Jira Using Keyboard Shortcuts"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Keyboard+Shortcuts#UsingKeyboardShortcuts-AccessingtheKeyboardShortcutsDialogBox | title=Using Keyboard Shortcuts | publisher=Atlassian | accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{keypress|F1}} [[Function key]] in [[Windows operating system]]s is almost always for opening a help program associated with an application, and similarly for some of the Linux [[desktop environment]]s.  The corresponding key combination in [[Mac OS X]] is {{keypress|Command|Shift|/}}. Users expect a help screen or similar help services [[Context menu|popup]] when they press this key. Software binding this key to some other feature is likely to cause astonishment if no help appears. [[Malware|Malicious programs]] are known to exploit users' familiarity with regular shortcut keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9164038/Microsoft_Don_t_press_F1_key_in_Windows_XP |title=Microsoft: Don't press F1 key in Windows XP |newspaper=Computerworld |first=G. |last=Keizer |date=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In programming, a good example of this principle is the common &lt;code&gt;ParseInteger(string, radix)&lt;/code&gt; function which exists in most languages and is used to convert a [[String (computer science)|string]] to an integer value. The [[radix]] is usually an optional argument and assumed to be 10 (representing [[Decimal|base 10]]). Other bases are usually supported (like [[Binary number|binary]] or [[octal]]) but only when specified explicitly; when the radix argument is not specified, base 10 is assumed. Notably JavaScript did not originally adopt this behavior, which resulted in developer confusion and software bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5600366/why-does-the-radix-for-javascripts-parseint-default-to-8 |title=Why does the radix for JavaScript's parseInt default to 8? |date=8 April 2011 |work=Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychology sidebar}}
'''Psychometrics''' is a field of study concerned with the theory and technique of [[psychological]] [[measurement]]. As defined by the [[National Council on Measurement in Education]] (NCME), psychometrics refers to psychological measurement. Generally, it refers to the field in psychology and education that is devoted to testing, measurement, assessment, and related activities.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorP {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorP |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is concerned with the objective [[measurement]] of skills and knowledge, abilities, attitudes, [[Trait theory|personality traits]], and [[educational measurement|educational achievement]]. Some psychometric researchers focus on the construction and validation of assessment instruments such as [[questionnaire]]s, [[test (student assessment)|tests]], raters' judgments, and [[personality tests]]. Others focus on research relating to measurement theory (e.g., [[item response theory]]; [[intraclass correlation]]).

Practitioners are described as psychometricians. Psychometricians usually possess a specific qualification, and most are [[psychologists]] with advanced graduate training. In addition to traditional academic institutions, many psychometricians work for the government or in [[human resources]] departments. Others specialize as [[learning and development]] professionals.

== Historical foundation ==

Psychological testing has come from two streams of thought: the first, from [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Sir Francis Galton|Galton]], and [[James McKeen Cattell|Cattell]] on the measurement of individual differences, and the second, from [[J.E. Herbart|Herbart]], [[E.H. Weber|Weber]], [[Gustav Fechner|Fechner]], and [[Wundt]] and their psychophysical measurements of a similar construct. The second set of individuals and their research is what has led to the development of [[experimental psychology]], and standardized testing.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, R.M. 2010"&gt;Kaplan, R.M., &amp; Saccuzzo, D.P. (2010). ''Psychological Testing: Principles, Applications, and Issues.'' (8th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victorian stream ===

Charles Darwin was the inspiration behind Sir Francis Galton who led to the creation of psychometrics. In 1859, Darwin published his book "[[The Origin of Species]]", which pertained to individual differences in animals. This book discussed how individual members in a [[species]] differ and how they possess characteristics that are more adaptive and successful or less adaptive and less successful. Those who are adaptive and successful are the ones that survive and give way to the next generation, who would be just as or more adaptive and successful. This idea, studied previously in animals, led to Galton's interest and study of human beings and how they differ one from another, and more importantly, how to measure those differences.

Galton wrote a book entitled "Hereditary Genius" about different characteristics that people possess and how those characteristics make them more "fit" than others. Today these differences, such as sensory and motor functioning (reaction time, visual acuity, and physical strength) are important domains of scientific psychology. Much of the early theoretical and applied work in psychometrics was undertaken in an attempt to measure [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]. Galton, often referred to as "the father of psychometrics," devised and included mental tests among his [[anthropometric]] measures. James McKeen Cattell, who is considered a pioneer of psychometrics went on to extend Galton's work. Cattell also coined the term ''mental test'', and is responsible for the research and knowledge which ultimately led to the development of modern tests. (Kaplan &amp; Saccuzzo, 2010)

=== German stream ===

The origin of psychometrics also has connections to the related field of [[psychophysics]]. Around the same time that Darwin, Galton, and Cattell were making their discoveries, Herbart was also interested in "unlocking the mysteries of human consciousness" through the scientific method. (Kaplan &amp; Saccuzzo, 2010) Herbart was responsible for creating mathematical models of the mind, which were influential in educational practices in years to come.

E.H. Weber built upon Herbart's work and tried to prove the existence of a psychological threshold, saying that a minimum stimulus was necessary to activate a sensory system. After Weber, G.T. Fechner expanded upon the knowledge he gleaned from Herbart and Weber, to devise the law that the strength of a sensation grows as the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. A follower of Weber and Fechner, Wilhelm Wundt is credited with founding the science of psychology. It is Wundt's influence that paved the way for others to develop psychological testing.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, R.M. 2010" /&gt;

=== 20th century ===
The psychometrician [[L. L. Thurstone]], founder and first president of the Psychometric Society in 1936, developed and applied a theoretical approach to measurement referred to as the [[law of comparative judgment]], an approach that has close connections to the psychophysical theory of [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] and [[Gustav Fechner]]. In addition, Spearman and Thurstone both made important contributions to the theory and application of [[factor analysis]], a statistical method developed and used extensively in psychometrics.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} In the late 1950s, [[Leopold Szondi]] made an historical and epistemological assessment of the impact of statistical thinking onto psychology during previous few decades: "in the last decades, the specifically psychological thinking has been almost completely suppressed and removed, and replaced by a statistical thinking. Precisely here we see the cancer of testology and testomania of today."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] (1960) ''Das zweite Buch: Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik''. Huber, Bern und Stuttgart, 2nd edition. Ch.27, From the Spanish translation, B)II ''Las condiciones estadisticas'', p.396. Quotation: {{quotation|el pensamiento psicologico especifico, en las ultima decadas, fue suprimido y eliminado casi totalmente, siendo sustituido por un pensamiento estadistico. Precisamente aqui vemos el cáncer de la testología y testomania de hoy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, psychometric theory has been applied in the measurement of [[wikt:personality|personality]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[belief]]s, and [[academic achievement]].  Measurement of these unobservable phenomena is difficult, and much of the research and accumulated science in this discipline has been developed in an attempt to properly define and quantify such phenomena.  Critics, including practitioners in the [[physical sciences]] and [[Activism|social activists]], have argued that such definition and quantification is impossibly difficult, and that such measurements are often misused, such as with psychometric personality tests used in employment procedures:

: "For example, an employer wanting someone for a role requiring consistent attention to repetitive detail will probably not want to give that job to someone who is very creative and gets bored easily."&lt;ref&gt;Psychometric Assessments. ''[http://www.services.unimelb.edu.au/careers/student/interviews/test.html Psychometric Assessments .]'' University of Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures who made significant contributions to psychometrics include [[Karl Pearson]], [[Henry F. Kaiser]], [[Carl Brigham]], [[L. L. Thurstone]], [[Anne Anastasi]], [[Georg Rasch]], [[Eugene Galanter]], [[Johnson O'Connor]], [[Frederic M. Lord]], [[Ledyard R Tucker]], [[Arthur Jensen]], and [[David Andrich]].

== Definition of measurement in the social sciences ==
The definition of measurement in the social sciences has a long history.  A currently widespread definition, proposed by [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] (1946), is that measurement is "the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to some rule."  This definition was introduced in the paper in which Stevens proposed four [[levels of measurement]].  Although widely adopted, this definition differs in important respects from the more classical definition of measurement adopted in the physical sciences, namely that scientific measurement entails "the estimation or discovery of the ratio of some magnitude of a quantitative attribute to a unit of the same attribute" (p.&amp;nbsp;358)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michell|first1=Joel|title=Quantitative science and the definition of measurement in psychology|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=August 1997|volume=88|issue=3|pages=355–383|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1997.tb02641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Stevens's definition of measurement was put forward in response to the British Ferguson Committee, whose chair, A. Ferguson, was a physicist.  The committee was appointed in 1932 by the British Association for the Advancement of Science to investigate the possibility of quantitatively estimating sensory events.  Although its chair and other members were physicists, the committee also included several psychologists.  The committee's report highlighted the importance of the definition of measurement.  While Stevens's response was to propose a new definition, which has had considerable influence in the field, this was by no means the only response to the report.  Another, notably different, response was to accept the classical definition, as reflected in the following statement:

:Measurement in psychology and physics are in no sense different.  Physicists can measure when they can find the operations by which they may meet the necessary criteria; psychologists have but to do the same.  They need not worry about the mysterious differences between the meaning of measurement in the two sciences. (Reese, 1943, p. 49)

These divergent responses are reflected in alternative approaches to measurement.  For example, methods based on [[covariance matrix|covariance matrices]] are typically employed on the premise that numbers, such as raw scores derived from assessments, are measurements.  Such approaches implicitly entail Stevens's definition of measurement, which requires only that numbers are ''assigned'' according to some rule.  The main research task, then, is generally considered to be the discovery of associations between scores, and of factors posited to underlie such associations.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

On the other hand, when measurement models such as the [[Rasch model]] are employed, numbers are not assigned based on a rule.  Instead, in keeping with Reese's statement above, specific criteria for measurement are stated, and the goal is to construct procedures or operations that provide data that meet the relevant criteria. Measurements are estimated based on the models, and tests are conducted to ascertain whether the relevant criteria have been met.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Instruments and procedures ==
The first{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}psychometric instruments were designed to measure the concept of [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://examenpsicometrico.com/los-diferentes-tipos-de-tests-psicometricos/|title=Los diferentes tipos de tests psicometricos - examen psicometrico|website=examenpsicometrico.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One historical approach involved the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]], developed originally by the French psychologist [[Alfred Binet]].  Intelligence tests are useful tools for various purposes.  An alternative conception of intelligence is that cognitive capacities within individuals are a manifestation of a general component, or [[general intelligence factor]], as well as cognitive capacity specific to a given domain.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Psychometrics is applied widely{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in educational assessment to measure abilities in domains such as [[literacy|reading, writing]], and [[mathematics]].  The main approaches in applying tests in these domains have been [[classical test theory]] and the more recent [[Item Response Theory]] and [[Rasch model|Rasch]] measurement models.  These latter approaches permit joint scaling of persons and assessment items, which provides a basis for mapping of developmental continua by allowing descriptions of the skills displayed at various points along a continuum.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Another major focus in psychometrics has been on [[personality test]]ing.  There have been a range of theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and measuring personality.  Some of the better known instruments include the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]], the [[Big five personality traits|Five-Factor Model]] (or "Big 5") and tools such as [[Personality and Preference Inventory]] and the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]].  Attitudes have also been studied extensively using psychometric approaches.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  A common method in the measurement of attitudes is the use of the [[Likert scale]].  An alternative method involves the application of unfolding measurement models, the most general being the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (Andrich &amp; Luo, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Andrich, D. &amp; Luo, G. (1993). A hyperbolic cosine latent trait model for unfolding dichotomous single-stimulus responses. Applied Psychological Measurement, 17, 253-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches ==
Psychometricians have developed a number of different measurement theories.  These include [[classical test theory]] (CTT) and [[item response theory]] (IRT).&lt;ref&gt;Embretson, S.E., &amp; Reise, S.P. (2000). ''Item Response Theory for Psychologists''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hambleton, R.K., &amp; Swaminathan, H. (1985). ''Item Response Theory: Principles and Applications.'' Boston: Kluwer-Nijhoff.&lt;/ref&gt;  An approach which seems mathematically to be similar to IRT but also quite distinctive, in terms of its origins and features, is represented by the [[Rasch model]] for measurement.  The development of the Rasch model, and the broader class of models to which it belongs, was explicitly founded on requirements of measurement in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Rasch, G. (1960/1980). ''Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests''. Copenhagen, Danish Institute for Educational Research, expanded edition (1980) with foreword and afterword by B.D. Wright. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychometricians have also developed methods for working with large matrices of correlations and covariances. Techniques in this general tradition include: [[factor analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, B.R. (2004). ''Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis: Understanding Concepts and Applications.'' American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; a method of determining the underlying dimensions of data; [[multidimensional scaling]],&lt;ref&gt;Davison, M.L. (1992). ''Multidimensional Scaling.'' Krieger.&lt;/ref&gt; a method for finding a simple representation for data with a large number of latent dimensions; and [[data clustering]], an approach to finding objects that are like each other. All these multivariate descriptive methods try to distill large amounts of data into simpler structures. More recently, [[structural equation modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, D. (2008). ''Structural Equation Modeling: Foundations and Extensions'', 2nd ed. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] represent more sophisticated approaches to working with large [[Covariance matrix|covariance matrices]]. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they are adequate fits.

One of the main deficiencies in various factor analyses is a lack of consensus in cutting points for determining the number of latent factors. A usual procedure is to stop factoring when [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] drop below one because the original sphere shrinks. The lack of the cutting points concerns other multivariate methods, also.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Key concepts ===
Key concepts in classical test theory are [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] and [[Test validity|validity]]. A reliable measure is one that measures a construct consistently across time, individuals, and situations. A valid measure is one that measures what it is intended to measure. Reliability is necessary, but not sufficient, for validity.

Both reliability and validity can be assessed statistically. Consistency over repeated measures of the same test can be assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient, and is often called ''test-retest reliability.''&lt;ref name="gifted.uconn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/Siegle/research/Instrument+Reliability+and+Validity/Reliability.htm|title=Home - Educational Research Basics by Del Siegle|website=www.gifted.uconn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly,  the equivalence of different versions of the same measure can be indexed by a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation]], and is called ''equivalent forms reliability'' or a similar term.&lt;ref name="gifted.uconn" /&gt;

Internal consistency, which addresses the homogeneity of a single test form, may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test, which is termed ''split-half reliability''; the value of this [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient]] for two half-tests is adjusted with the [[Spearman–Brown prediction formula]] to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests.&lt;ref name="gifted.uconn" /&gt;  Perhaps the most commonly used index of reliability is [[Cronbach's α]], which is equivalent to the [[mean]] of all possible split-half coefficients.  Other approaches include the [[intra-class correlation]], which is the ratio of variance of measurements of a given target to the variance of all targets.

There are a number of different forms of validity. Criterion-related validity can be assessed by correlating a measure with a criterion measure theoretically expected to be related. When the criterion measure is collected at the same time as the measure being validated the goal is to establish ''[[concurrent validity]]''; when the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish ''[[predictive validity]]''. A measure has ''[[construct validity]]'' if it is related to measures of other constructs as required by theory. ''[[Content validity]]'' is a demonstration that the items of a test do an adequate job of covering the domain being measured. In a personnel selection example, test content is based on a defined statement or set of statements of knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristics obtained from a ''[[job analysis]]''.

[[Item response theory]] models the relationship between [[latent trait]]s and responses to test items. Among other advantages, IRT provides a basis for obtaining an estimate of the location of a test-taker on a given latent trait as well as the standard error of measurement of that location. For example, a university student's knowledge of history can be deduced from his or her score on a university test and then be compared reliably with a high school student's knowledge deduced from a less difficult test. Scores derived by classical test theory do not have this characteristic, and assessment of actual ability (rather than ability relative to other test-takers) must be assessed by comparing scores to those of a "norm group" randomly selected from the population. In fact, all measures derived from classical test theory are dependent on the sample tested, while, in principle, those derived from item response theory are not.

Many psychometricians are also concerned with finding and eliminating test [[bias]] from their psychological tests. Test bias is a form of systematic (i.e., non-random) error which leads to examinees from one demographic group having an unwarranted advantage over examinees from another demographic group.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Yoon|first2=Myeongsun|last3=Price|first3=Chris J.|title=Exploring the various interpretations of "test bias"|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=20|pages=570–582|doi=10.1037/a0036503|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/a0036503|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to leading experts, test bias may cause differences in average scores across demographic groups, but differences in group scores are not sufficient evidence that test bias is actually present because the test could be measuring real differences among groups.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, C. R. (2000). Why is psychometric research on bias in mental testing so often ignored? ''Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 6'', 144-150. doi:10.1037/1076-8971.6.1.144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"/&gt; Psychometricians use sophisticated scientific methods to search for test bias and eliminate it. Research shows that it is usually impossible for people reading a test item to accurately determine whether it is biased or not.&lt;ref&gt;Reschly, D. J. (1980) Psychological evidence in the ''Larry P.'' opinion: A case of right problem-wrong solution? ''School Psychology Review, 9'', 123-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards of quality ==
The considerations of [[validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] typically are viewed as essential elements for determining the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of any test.  However, professional and practitioner associations frequently have placed these concerns within broader contexts when developing [[Standards organization|standards]] and making overall judgments about the quality of any test as a whole within a given context. A consideration of concern in many applied research settings is whether or not the metric of a given psychological inventory is meaningful or arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychology.tamu.edu/Faculty/blanton/bj.2006.arbitrary.pdf Blanton, H., &amp; Jaccard, J. (2006). Arbitrary metrics in psychology.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510182915/http://psychology.tamu.edu/Faculty/blanton/bj.2006.arbitrary.pdf |date=2006-05-10 }} ''American Psychologist, 61''(1), 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Testing standards ===
In 2014, the American Educational Research Association (AERA), American Psychological Association (APA), and National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) published a revision of the ''[[Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/science/standards.html#overview|title=The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing|website=http://www.apa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes standards for test development, evaluation, and use.  The ''Standards'' cover essential topics in testing including validity, reliability/errors of measurement, and fairness in testing.  The book also establishes standards related to testing operations including test design and development, scores, scales, norms, score linking, cut scores, test administration, scoring, reporting, score interpretation, test documentation, and rights and responsibilities of test takers and test users.  Finally, the ''Standards'' cover topics related to testing applications, including [[Psychological testing|psychological testing and assessment]], workplace testing and [[Professional certification|credentialing]], [[Test (student assessment)|educational testing and assessment]], and testing in [[program evaluation]] and public policy.

=== Evaluation standards ===
In the field of [[evaluation]], and in particular [[educational evaluation]], the [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044732/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/ |date=2009-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has published three sets of standards for evaluations. ''The Personnel Evaluation Standards''&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1988). ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PERSTNDS-SUM.htm The Personnel Evaluation Standards: How to Assess Systems for Evaluating Educators.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051212001638/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PERSTNDS-SUM.htm |date=2005-12-12 }}'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1988, ''The Program Evaluation Standards'' (2nd edition)&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (1994). ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PGMSTNDS-SUM.htm The Program Evaluation Standards, 2nd Edition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222025348/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/PGMSTNDS-SUM.htm |date=2006-02-22 }}'' Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1994, and ''The Student Evaluation Standards''&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation. (2003).  ''[http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/briefing/ses/ The Student Evaluation Standards: How to Improve Evaluations of Students.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524144621/http://www.wmich.edu/evalctr/jc/briefing/ses/ |date=2006-05-24 }}'' Newbury Park, CA: Corwin Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2003.

Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2395969/Author_guidelines_for_reporting_scale_development_and_validation_results_in_the_Journal_of_the_Society_for_Social_Work_and_Research |title=Author guidelines for reporting scale development and validation results in the Journal of the Society for Social Work and Research]|author=E. Cabrera-Nguyen|work=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate.  In these sets of standards, validity and reliability considerations are covered under the accuracy topic.  For example, the student accuracy standards help ensure that student evaluations will provide sound, accurate, and credible information about student learning and performance.

== Non-human: animals and machines ==

Psychometrics addresses ''human'' abilities, attitudes, traits and educational evolution. Notably, the study of behavior, mental processes and abilities of non-human ''animals'' is usually addressed by [[comparative psychology]], or with a continuum between non-human animals and the rest of animals by [[evolutionary psychology]]. Nonetheless there are some advocators for a more gradual transition between the approach taken for humans and the approach taken for (non-human) animals.&lt;ref name="Humphreys"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Humphreys, L.G.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evaluation of abilities, traits and learning evolution of ''machines'' has been mostly unrelated to the case of humans and non-human animals, with specific approaches in the area of [[artificial intelligence]]. A more integrated approach, under the name of universal psychometrics, has also been proposed.&lt;ref name="upsycho"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=J. Hernández-Orallo |author2=D.L. Dowe |author3=M.V.

In return, microbes attach to the plant root where it improves the roots access to nutrients and its resistance to environmental stress and pathogens.

==Function==

===Types of Symbioses===
Root associated microbes include [[Fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]], and [[archaea]] living within or on the surface of roots, as well as in the [[rhizosphere]]. [[Symbiosis|Symbionts]] associated with plant roots subsist off of [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] products (carbon rich molecules) from the plant host and can exist anywhere on the [[Symbiosis|mutualist/parasite]] continuum.

Root symbionts may improve their host's access to [[Plant nutrition#Functions of nutrients|nutrients]],&lt;ref name="vdH"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Heijden MG, Bardgett RD, van Straalen NM |title=The unseen majority: soil microbes as drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=296–310 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18047587 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2007.01139.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marschner |first1=Petra |last2=Crowley |first2=David |last3=Rengel |first3=Zed |year=2011 |title=Rhizosphere interactions between microorganisms and plants govern iron and phosphorus acquisition along the root axis – model and research methods |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=883–94 |doi=10.1016/j.soilbio.2011.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Laura E. |last1=Green |first2=Andrea |last2=Porras-Alfaro |first3=Robert L. |last3=Sinsabaugh |date=September 2008 |title=Translocation of Nitrogen and Carbon Integrates Biotic Crust and Grass Production in Desert Grassland |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=1076–85 |jstor=20143553 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01388.x|bibcode=2009JEcol..98...74B }}&lt;/ref&gt; produce [[Plant hormone|plant-growth regulators]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lugtenberg B, Kamilova F |title=Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=63 |issue= |pages=541–56 |year=2009 |pmid=19575558 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.62.081307.162918}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve [[Abiotic stress|environmental stress]] tolerance of their host,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Latch |first1=Garrick C.M. |year=1993 |title=Physiological interactions of endophytic fungi and their hosts.

Symbionts may be biotrophic (subsisting off of living tissue) or necrotrophic (subsisting off of dead tissue).

===Mutualist-Parasite Continuum===
While some microbes may be purely [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]]ic or [[Parasite|parasitic]], many may behave one way or the other depending on the host species with which it is associated, environmental conditions, and host health.&lt;ref name="Kogel"/&gt; A host’s immune response controls symbiont infection and growth rates.&lt;ref name="Kogel"/&gt; If a host’s immune response is not able to control a particular microbial species, or if host immunity is compromised, the microbe-plant relationship will likely reside somewhere nearer the parasitic side of the mutualist-parasite continuum. Similarly, high nutrients can push some microbes into parasitic behavior, encouraging unchecked growth at a time when symbionts are no longer needed to aid with nutrient acquisition.&lt;ref name="Kogel"/&gt;

==Composition==
Roots are colonized by [[Fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Because they are [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]], fungi can extend [[hypha]]e from nutrient exchange organs within host cells into the surrounding rhizosphere and bulk soil. Fungi that extend beyond the root surface and engage in nutrient-carbon exchange with the plant host are commonly considered to be [[Mycorrhizal fungi|mycorrhizal]], but external hyphae can also include other [[Endophyte|endophytic]] fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi can extend a great distance into bulk soil,&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; thereby increasing the root system’s reach and surface area, enabling mycorrhizal fungi to acquire a large percentage of its host plant’s nutrients. In some ecosystems, up to 80% of plant nitrogen and 90% of plant phosphorus is acquired by mycorrhizal fungi.&lt;ref name="vdH"/&gt; In return, plants may allocate ~20-40% of their carbon to mycorrhizae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Sally E. |last1=Smith |first2=David J. |last2=Read |title=Mycorrhizal Symbiosis |edition=2nd |location=New York, NY |publisher=Academic Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-08-053719-1}}{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mycorrhizae===
{{main|Mycorrhiza}}
Mycorrhizae include a broad variety of root-fungi interactions characterized by mode of colonization. Essentially all plants form mycorrhizal associations, and there is evidence that some mycorrhizae transport carbon and other nutrients not just from soil to plant, but also between different plants in a landscape.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The main groups include [[ectomycorrhiza]]e, [[arbuscular mycorhiza]]e, [[ericoid mycorrhiza]]e, [[orchid mycorrhiza]]e, and [[monotropoid mycorrhizae]]. Monotropoid mycorrhizae are associated with plants in the [[monotropaceae]], which lack [[chlorophyll]]. Many [[Orchidaceae|Orchids]] are also achlorophyllous for at least part of their life cycle. Thus these mycorrhizal-plant relationships are unique because the fungus provides the host with carbon as well as other nutrients, often by parasitizing other plants.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Achlorophyllous plants forming these types of mycorrhizal associations are called [[Myco-heterotrophy|mycoheterotrophs]].

===Endophytes===
{{main|Endophyte}}
Endophytes are bacteria or fungi that live within plant tissue. They may colonize inter-cellular spaces, the root cells themselves, or both. [[Rhizobia]] and [[dark septate endophytes]] (which produce [[melanin]], an [[antioxidant]] that may provide resilience against a variety of environmental stresses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ari |last1=Jumpponen |first2=James M. |last2=Trappe |date=October 1998 |title=Dark Septate Endophytes: A Review of Facultative Biotrophic Root-Colonizing Fungi |journal=New Phytologist |volume=140 |issue=2 |pages=295–310 |jstor=2588371 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00265.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are famous examples.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Archaea===
{{main|Archaea}}
Archaea are traditionally thought of as [[Extremophile|microbes belonging to extreme environments]]. Though they are found in plant roots, little is known about their effect on plant health or their role in the root microbiome.&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt;

==Assembly Mechanisms==
There is an ongoing debate regarding what mechanisms are responsible for assembling individual microbes into [[Community (ecology)|communities]]. There are two primary competing hypotheses. One is that "everything is everywhere, but the environment selects," meaning [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors pose the only constraints, through [[natural selection]], to which microbes colonize what [[Ecology#Physical environments|environments]]. This is called the [[Niche (ecology)|niche]] hypothesis, and its counterpart is the hypothesis that neutral processes, such as distance and geographic barriers to [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]], control microbial community assembly when [[Taxon|taxa]] are equally [[Biological fitness|fit]] within an environment. In this hypothesis, differences between individual taxa in modes and reach of dispersal explain the differences in microbial communities of different environments.&lt;ref name="Nemergut"/&gt; Most likely, both natural selection and neutral processes affect microbial community assembly, though certain microbial taxa may be more restricted by one process or the other depending on their physiological restrictions and mode of dispersion.&lt;ref name="Nemergut"/&gt;

Microbial dispersal mechanisms include wind, water, and hitchhiking on more mobile macrobes. Microbial dispersion is difficult to study, and little is known about its effect on microbial community assembly relative to the effect of abiotic and biotic assembly mechanisms,&lt;ref name="Nemergut"/&gt; particularly in roots. For this reason only assembly mechanisms that fit within the niche hypothesis are discussed below.

The taxa within root microbial communities seem to be drawn from the surrounding soil, though the relative abundance of various taxa may differ greatly from those found in bulk soil due to unique [[Niche (ecology)|niches]] in the root and rhizosphere.&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt;

===Biotic Assembly Mechanisms===
Different parts of the root are associated with different microbial communities. For example, fine roots, root tips, and the main root are all associated with different communities,&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchner"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marschner |first1=P |last2=Yang |first2=C.-H |last3=Lieberei |first3=R |last4=Crowley |first4=D.E |year=2001 |title=Soil and plant specific effects on bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=1437–45 |doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(01)00052-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rhizosphere, root surface, and root tissue are all associated with different communities,&lt;ref name ="Gottel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nguyen"/&gt; likely due to the unique chemistry and nutrient status of each of these regions. Additionally different plant species, and even different cultivars, harbor different microbial communities,&lt;ref name="Dean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchner"/&gt; probably due to host specific immune responses&lt;ref name="Kogel"/&gt; and differences in carbon root exudates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broeckling CD, Broz AK, Bergelson J, Manter DK, Vivanco JM |title=Root exudates regulate soil fungal community composition and diversity |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=738–44 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18083870 |pmc=2227741 |doi=10.1128/AEM.02188-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Host age affects root microbial community composition, likely for similar reasons as host identity.&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt; The identity of neighboring vegetation has also been shown to impact a host plant's root microbial community composition.&lt;ref name="Dean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bogar LM, Kennedy PG |title=New wrinkles in an old paradigm: neighborhood effects can modify the structure and specificity of Alnus-associated ectomycorrhizal fungal communities |journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=767–77 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23078526 |doi=10.1111/1574-6941.12032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meinhardt KA, Gehring CA |title=Disrupting mycorrhizal mutualisms: a potential mechanism by which exotic tamarisk outcompetes native cottonwoods |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=532–49 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22611852 |doi=10.1890/11-1247.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abiotic Assembly Mechanisms===
Abiotic mechanisms also affect root microbial community assembly&lt;ref name="Dean"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hardoim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tedersoo"/&gt; because individual taxa have different optima along various [[environmental gradient]]s, such as nutrient concentrations, pH, moisture, temperature, etc. In addition to chemical and climatic factors, soil structure and disturbance impact root biotic assembly.&lt;ref name="Buee"/&gt;

===Succession===
The root microbiome is dynamic, fluid within the constraints imposed by the biotic and abiotic environment. As in [[Macroecology|macroecological]] systems, the historical trajectory of the microbiotic community may partially determine the present and future community. Due to antagonistic and mutualistic interactions between microbial taxa, the taxa colonizing a root at any given moment could be expected to influence which new taxa are acquired, and therefor how the community responds to changes in the host or environment.&lt;ref name="Nemergut"/&gt;  While the effect of initial community on microbial [[Ecological succession|succession]] has been studied in various environmental samples, [[human microbiome]], and laboratory settings, it has yet to be studied in roots.

Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.

In social simulation, computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as [[complex system|complex non-linear systems]], which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models. [[Robert Axelrod]] regards social simulation as a third way of doing science, differing from both the deductive and inductive approach; generating data that can be analysed inductively, but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world. Thus, simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating it—constructing artificial societies. These ambitious aims have encountered [[#Criticisms|several criticisms]].

The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by three regional associations, [[European Social Simulation Association|ESSA]] for Europe, North America (reorganizing under the new CSSS name), and PAAA [https://archive.is/20130413115754/http://www.paaa.econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ Pacific Asia].

==History and development==

The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Self-replicating machine|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself. The device [[von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then improved by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up&amp;mdash;creating the first of devices later termed [[cellular automata]].

Another improvement was brought by mathematician, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike the von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

The birth of the agent-based model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as the [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] developed the first large scale agent model, the [[Sugarscape]], to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, transmission of disease, and even culture.

[[Kathleen M. Carley]] published "Computational Organizational Science and Organizational Engineering" defining the movement of simulation into
organizations, established a journal for social simulation applied to organizations and complex socio-technical systems: [[Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory]], and was the founding president of the North American Association of Computational Social and Organizational Systems that morphed into the current CSSSA.

[[Nigel Gilbert]] published with [[Klaus G. Troitzsch]] the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the Social Scientist (1999) and established its most relevant journal: the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]].

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]] (see {{Harv|Sun|2006}})

==Types of simulation and modeling==
Social simulation can refer to a general class of strategies for understanding social dynamics using computers to simulate social systems. Social simulation allows for a more systematic way of viewing the possibilities of outcomes.

There are four major types of social simulation: 
#System level simulation.
#System level modeling.
#Agent-based simulation.
#Agent-based modeling.

A social simulation may fall within the rubric of [[computational sociology]] which is a recently developed branch of [[sociology]] that uses [[computation]] to analyze social phenomena. The basic premise of computational sociology is to take advantage of [[computer simulation]]s {{Harv|Polhill|Edmonds|2007}} in the construction of social theories. It involves the understanding of [[social agent]]s, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate.  Although the subject matter and methodologies in [[social science]] differ from those in [[natural science]] or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social [[simulation]] originated from fields such as [[physics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

===System level simulation===
System Level Simulation (SLS) is the oldest level of social simulation. System level simulation looks at the situation as a whole. This theoretical outlook on social situations uses a wide range of information to determine what should happen to society and its members if certain variables are present. Therefore, with specific variables presented, society and its members should have a certain response to the new situation. Navigating through this theoretical simulation will allow researchers to develop educated ideas of what will happen under some specific variables.

For example, if [[NASA]] were to conduct a system level simulation it would benefit the organization by providing a cost effective research method to navigate through the simulation. This allows the researcher to steer through the virtual possibilities of the given simulation and develop [[safety]] procedures, and to produce proven facts about how a certain situation will play out. {{Harv|National Research|2006}}

===System level modeling===

System level modeling (SLM) aims to specifically predict (unlike system level simulation's generalization in prediction) and convey any number of actions, behaviors, or other theoretical possibilities of nearly any person, object, construct et cetera within a system using a large set of mathematical equations and computer programming in the form of models.

A model is a representation of a specific thing ranging from objects and people to structures and products created through mathematical equations and are designed, using computers, in such a way that they are able to stand-in as the aforementioned things in a study. Models can be either simplistic or complex, depending on the need for either; however, models are intended to be simpler than what they are representing while remaining realistically similar in order to be used accurately. They are built using a collection of data that is translated into computing languages that allow them to represent the system in question. These models, much like simulations, are used to help us better understand specific roles and actions of different things so as to predict behavior and the like.

===Agent-based simulation===

[[Agent-based social simulation]] (ABSS) consists of modeling different societies after artificial agents, (varying on scale) and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents.  From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of non-artificial agents and simulations.  Three main fields in ABSS are agent-based computing, social science, and computer simulation.

Agent-based computing is the design of the model and agents, while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes.  The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model.  It is where the social phenomena is developed and theorized. The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agent-based simulation of social phenomena.  With ABSS we can explore different outcomes for phenomena where we might not be able to view the outcome in real life.  It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena.

===Agent-based modeling===

[[Agent-based modeling]] (ABM) is a system in which a collection of agents independently interact on networks. Each individual agent is responsible for different behaviors that result in collective behaviors. These behaviors as a whole help to define the workings of the network. ABM focuses on human social interactions and how people work together and communicate with one another without having one, single "group mind". This essentially means that it tends to focus on the consequences of interactions between people (the agents) in a population. Researchers are better able to understand this type of modeling by modeling these dynamics on a smaller, more localized level. Essentially, ABM helps to better understand interactions between people (agents) who, in turn, influence one another (in response to these influences). Simple individual rules or actions can result in coherent [[group behavior]]. Changes in these individual acts can affect the collective group in any given population.

Agent-based modeling is an experimental tool for theoretical research. It enables one to deal with more complex individual behaviors, such as adaptation. Overall, through this type of modeling, the creator, or researcher, aims to model behavior of agents and the communication between them in order to better understand how these individual interactions impact an entire population. In essence, ABM is a way of modeling and understanding different global patterns.

==Current research==

There are several current research projects that relate directly to modeling and agent-based simulation the following are listed below with a brief overview.

*"Generative e-Social Science for Socio-Spatial Simulation" or (GENESIS) is a research node of the UK National Centre for e-Social Science funded by the UK research council [http://www.esrc.ac.uk ESRC]. For further details please see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20091209031009/http://www.genesis.ucl.ac.uk/ GENESIS Web Page] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091114023426/http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/genesisblog/ Blog].
*"National e-Infrastructure for Social Simulation" or (NeISS) is a UK-based project funded by [http://www.jisc.ac.uk JISC]. For further details please see: [http://www.neiss.org.uk The NeISS Web Pages].
*"Network Models Governance and R&amp;D collaboration networks" or (N.E.M.O) is a research centre whose main focus is to identify ways to create and to assess desirable network structures for typical functions; (e.g. knowledge, creation, transfer, and distribution.) This research will ultimately aid [[policy-makers]] at all political levels in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of network-based policy instruments at promoting the knowledge economy in Europe.
*"Agent-based Simulations of Market and Consumer Behavior" is another research group that is funded by the Unilever Corporate Research. The current research that is being conducted is investigating the usefulness of agent-based simulations for modeling [[consumer behavior]] and to show the potential value and insights it can add to long-established marketing methods.
*"New and Emergent World Models Through Individual, Evolutionary and Social Learning" or (New Ties) is a three-year project that will ultimately create a virtual society developed by agent-based simulation. The project will develop a simulated society capable of exploring the environment and developing its own image of this environment and the society through interaction. The goal of the research project is for the simulated society to exhibit [[individual learning]], [[evolutionary learning]] and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]].
*Bruch and Mare's project on neighborhood [[Residential segregation|segregation]]: The purpose of the study is to figure out the reasoning for neighborhood segregation based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and to figure out the [[tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] or when people become uncomfortable with the integration levels into their neighborhood, and decide to flee from the neighborhood. They set up a model using flash cards, and put the agent's house in the middle and put houses of different races surrounding the agent's house. They asked people how comfortable they would feel with different situations; if they were okay with one situation, they asked another until the neighborhood was fully integrated. Bruch and Mare's results showed that the tipping point was at 50%. When a neighborhood became 50% minority and 50% white, people of both races began to become uncomfortable and [[white flight]] began to rise. The use of agent-based modeling showed how useful it can be in the world of sociology, people did not have to answer why they would become uncomfortable, just which situation they were uncomfortable with.
*The MAELIA Program (Multi-Agent Emergent Norms Assessment) is a project dealing with the relationships between the users and managers of a natural resource, in that case water, and the related norms and laws that are to be built within them (conventions) or are imposed to them by other actors (institutions). The purpose of the project is to build a generic multiscale platform which is planned to deal with [[water conflict]]-related issues.
*The [http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/mosi/ Mosi-Agil project] is a four-year program funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program MOSI-AGIL-CM (grant S2013/ICE-3019, co-funded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER). It aims at creating a body of knowledge and practical tools which are necessary to handle more effectively the behavior of occupants of large facilities. Therefore, the project studies the development of ambient intelligence and intelligent environments supported by the use of Agent-Based Social Simulation.

Agent-based modeling is most useful in providing a bridge between micro and macro levels, which is a large part of what sociology studies. Agent-based models are most appropriate for studying processes that lack central coordination, including the emergence of institutions that, once established, impose order from the top down. The models focus on how simple and predictable local interactions generate familiar but highly detailed global patterns, such as emergence of [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[participation (decision making)|participation]] of collective action. Michael W. Macy and Robert Willer researched a recent survey of applications and found that there were two main problems with agent-based modeling the [[self-organization]] of social structure and the [[emergence]] of [[social order]] {{Harv|Macy|Willer|2002}}. Below is a brief description of each problem Macy and Willer believe there to be;
#"''Emergent structure''. In these models, agents change location or behavior in response to [[social influences]] or selection pressures. Agents may start out undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to avoid becoming different or isolated (or in some cases, overcrowded). Rather than producing homogeneity, however, these conformist decisions aggregate to produce global patterns of cultural differentiation, stratification, and homophilic clustering in local networks. Other studies reverse the process, starting with a heterogeneous population and ending in convergence: the coordination, diffusion, and sudden collapse of norms, conventions, innovations, and technological standards."
#"''Emergent social order''. These studies show how [[egotism|egoistic]] adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either altruism or global (top down) imposition of control. A key finding across numerous studies is that the viability of trust, cooperation, and collective action depends decisively on the embeddedness of interaction."

These examples simply show the complexity of our environment and that agent-based models are designed to explore the minimal conditions, the simplest set of assumptions about human behavior, required for a given social phenomenon to emerge at a higher level of organization.

==Criticisms==
Since its creation, computerized social simulation has been the target of some criticism in regard to its practicality and accuracy. Social simulation's simplification of the complex to form models from which we can better understand the latter is sometimes seen as a draw back, as using fairly simple models to simulate real life with computers is not always the best way to predict behavior.

Most of the criticism seems to be aimed at agent-based models and simulation and how they work:

#Simulations, being man-made from mathematical interfaces, predict [[human behavior]] in a far too simple manner in regard to the complexities of humanity and our actions.
#Simulations cannot enlighten researchers as to how people interact or behave in ways not programmed into their models. For this reason, the scope of simulations are limited in that the researchers must already know what they are going to find (to a degree, for they cannot find anything they themselves did not place in the model) at least vaguely, possibly skewing the results.
#Due to the complexities of what is being measured, simulations must be analyzed in unbiased ways; however, with the model running on a pre-made set of instructions coded into it by a modeler, biases exist almost universally.
#It is highly difficult and often impractical to attempt to link the findings from the abstract world the simulation creates and our complex society and all of its variation.

Researchers working in social simulation might respond that the competing theories from the [[social sciences]] are far simpler than those achieved through simulation and therefore suffer the aforementioned drawbacks much more strongly.  Theories in some social science tend to be linear models that are not dynamic, and are generally inferred from small laboratory [[experiment]]s (laboratory tests are most common in psychology but rare in sociology, political science, economics and geography). The behavior of populations of agents under these models is rarely tested or verified against empirical observation.

[[File:SongOfTheEarth.jpg|thumb|First edition  (publ. [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]])]]
'''''Song of the Earth''''' is a novel by [[Alexander Cordell]], first published in 1969.  It is the final book of Cordell's "Mortymer Trilogy".

The novel is Cordell's third book in the lives of the Mortymer family, after ''Rape of the Fair Country'' and ''Hosts of Rebecca''. It tells of the Evan family buying a canal barge on the [[Neath Canal|Neath valley canal]]. There they meet Mari Mortymer and her adopted daughter Rhiannon. It tells of the coal industry in [[Resolven]] as well as the [[Brunel]] designed Canal system of the valley. It describes the landscape of the area (still viewable today over 150 years later) as well as the hardship suffered by the family, and growth of disease and population topography in the industrial revolution.

Cordell's third book in the lives of Mortymer family switches its focus to the canals and waterways of South Wales, especially the Neath Valley. The narrator is Bryn Evan, son of Mostyn and he describes how he, his Father and the Evan family take delivery of a new barge as owner/operators. They struggle to maintain a working existence against the onslaught of the new railways then under construction and being forged by the inspired engineering skills of Isambard Kingdom Brunel which are penetrating the valleys of South Wales. Against this backdrop, Mostyn marries Marie Mortymer who also appears in 'Rape of the Fair Country' and 'The Hosts of Rebecca'.

Time passes and the family have to accept the inevitable that the canals are failing, so they move to Aberdare to work in the pits and experience the grinding poverty and the everyday struggle of the Miners working the coalfields of the middle period of the 19th. Century.

{{unreferenced|date=March 2012}}
'''Star counts''' are bookkeeping surveys of [[star]]s and the [[statistics|statistical]] and [[geometry|geometrical]] methods used to correct the survey data for [[Wiktionary:bias#Etymology|bias]]. The surveys are most often made of nearby stars in the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].

One of the interests of astronomy is to determine how many stars there are of each of several types that stars can be categorized into, and how these stars are distributed in space.

==Reasons for star counts==
When performing star counts, astronomers consider many different categories that have been created to classify a few stars that have been well studied. One of the hopes of studying the results of star counts is to discover new categories. Different counts typically seek to categorize stars for only a few of the qualities listed below, and determine how common each considered quality is and how stars of that kind are distributed.

* '''Temperature''': In astronomy, temperature is usually shown using the [[spectral type|letter codes]] '''O B A F G K M''' running from 'blue' (type&amp;nbsp;'''O''', actually bluish white) through white (type&amp;nbsp;'''F''') to 'red' (type&amp;nbsp;'''M''', actually ruddy orange). Types&amp;nbsp;'''L''' and '''T''' are used for [[brown dwarfs]], whose 'colors' are in the [[infrared]].
* '''Size''': Size is usually designated by Roman numerals '''I''' ([[supergiants]]) through '''V''' (dwarfs).
* '''Age''': Stars are usually grouped into ''Population&amp;nbsp;I'' (young) and ''Population&amp;nbsp;II'' (old).
* '''Location''': In the Milky Way Galaxy the groups are described as ''[[Thin disk population|thin disk]]'', ''thick disk'', ''central bulge'', and ''halo''.
* '''Multiplicity''': Most stars are members of double star, or triple star, or even double-double star systems. Our own sun appears to be unusual for ''not'' having a companion star.

There are many finer subdivisions in all of the above categories.

==Bias==
There are many unavoidable problems in counting stars for the purpose of getting an accurate picture of the distribution of stars in space. The effects of our point of view in the galaxy, the obscuring clouds of gas and dust in the galaxy, and especially the extreme range of inherent brightness, create a biased view of stars.

* Stars vary far more in [[Wiktionary:intrinsic#Etymology|intrinsic]] brightness than they do in distance.
* Our line of sight through the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] is interrupted by great clouds of gas and dust, which block our view of stars more than a few thousand [[light-year]]s away.
* The [[Sun]] is located in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy, in the northern edge of the ''thin disk'' and on the inner edge of a [[spiral arm]] called the [[Orion Arm|Orion–Cygnus Arm]]. There is good reason to believe that stars in the galaxy's thin disk are different from thicker part of the disk, and from the bulge and the halo. Some stars are obviously more common in spiral arms than in the disk in between the arms.

Knowing that these effects create bias, astronomers analyzing star counts attempt to find how much bias each effect has caused and then compensate for it as well as they can.

==Inherent luminosity complications==
The greatest problem biasing star counts is the extreme differences in inherent brightness of different sizes.

Heavy, bright stars (both [[giant stars|giants]] and blue [[dwarf star|dwarfs]]) are the most common stars listed in general [[star catalog]]s, even though on average they are obviously rare in space. Small dim stars ([[red dwarf]]s) seem to be the most common stars in space, at least locally, but can only be seen with large telescopes, and then only when they are within a few tens of light-years from Earth.

For example, the [[blue giant]] [[zeta Puppis|ζ&amp;nbsp;Puppis]] is 400&amp;nbsp;million times more [[luminosity|luminous]] than the nearest star, a [[red dwarf]] named [[Alpha Centauri|Proxima]], or ''[[Alpha centauri|α&amp;nbsp;Centauri]]&amp;nbsp;C''. Even though Proxima is only 4.2&amp;nbsp;light-years away from us, it is so dim that it cannot be seen with the naked eye (one of its companions, ''α&amp;nbsp;Centauri&amp;nbsp;A'', is visible). The star ''ζ&amp;nbsp;Puppis'' is one of the brightest of the visible extreme blue supergiants. It is so bright that it appears to be a second magnitude star, even though ζ Puppis is 1,399 light-years away.

'''Toxicity''' is the degree to which a [[chemical substance]] or a particular [[mixture]] of substances can damage an [[organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toxicity|title=Definition of TOXICITY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity can refer to the effect on a whole organism, such as an [[animal]], [[bacteria|bacterium]], or [[plant]], as well as the effect on a substructure of the organism, such as a [[cell (biology)|cell]] ([[cytotoxicity]]) or an organ such as the [[liver]] ([[hepatotoxicity]]). By extension, the word may be [[metaphor]]ically used to describe toxic effects on larger and more complex groups, such as the [[family]] unit or society at large. Sometimes the word is more or less synonymous with [[poison#Poisoning|poisoning]] in everyday usage.

A central concept of [[toxicology]] is that the effects of a [[toxicant]] are [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]]-dependent; even [[water]] can lead to [[water intoxication]] when taken in too high a dose, whereas for even a very toxic substance such as [[snake venom]] there is a dose below which there is no detectable toxic effect. Toxicity is species-specific, making cross-species analysis problematic. Newer [[paradigm]]s and metrics are evolving to bypass [[animal testing]], while maintaining the concept of toxicity endpoints.&lt;ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Types==
There are generally four types of toxic entities; chemical, biological, physical and radiation:

*The R.M.Yassine Scale is the main scale used to measure toxicity.
* [[Chemical substance|Chemical]] toxicants include [[inorganic]] substances such as, [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[hydrofluoric acid]], and [[chlorine]] gas, and [[organic compound]]s such as [[methanol|methyl alcohol]], most medications, and poisons from living things. While some weakly [[radioactive]] substances, such as [[uranium]], are ''also'' chemical toxicants, more strongly radioactive materials like [[radium]] are not, their harmful effects ([[radiation poisoning]]) being caused by the [[ionizing radiation]] produced by the substance rather than chemical interactions with the substance itself. 
* Disease-causing microorganisms and parasites are toxic in a broad sense, but are generally called [[pathogen]]s rather than toxicants.   The biological toxicity of pathogens can be difficult to measure because the "threshold dose" may be a single organism. Theoretically one [[virus]], bacterium or [[worm]] can reproduce to cause a serious [[infection]].  However, in a host with an intact [[immune system]] the inherent toxicity of the organism is balanced by the host's ability to fight back; the effective toxicity is then a combination of both parts of the relationship.  In some cases, e.g. [[cholera toxin|cholera]], the disease is chiefly caused by a nonliving substance secreted by the organism, rather than the organism itself. Such nonliving biological toxicants are generally called [[toxin]]s if produced by a microorganism, plant, or fungus, and [[venom]]s if produced by an animal. 
* Physical toxicants are substances that, due to their physical nature, interfere with biological processes. Examples include [[coal]] dust, [[asbestos]] fibers or finely divided [[silicon dioxide]], all of which can ultimately be fatal if inhaled. Corrosive chemicals possess physical toxicity because they destroy tissues, but they're not directly poisonous unless they interfere directly with biological activity. Water can act as a physical toxicant if taken in extremely high doses because the concentration of vital ions decreases dramatically if there's too much water in the body. Asphyxiant gases can be considered physical toxicants because they act by displacing oxygen in the environment but they are inert, not chemically toxic gases.
* As already mentioned, radiation can have a toxic effect on organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041008X03004952 | doi=10.1016/j.taap.2003.08.019 | volume=195 | title=Toxic effects of ultraviolet radiation on the skin | journal=Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology | pages=298–308 | pmid=15020192 | date=March 2004 | vauthors=Matsumura Y, Ananthaswamy HN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==
Toxicity can be measured by its effects on the target (organism, organ, tissue or cell).  Because individuals typically have different levels of response to the same dose of a toxic substance, a population-level measure of toxicity is often used which relates the probabilities of an outcome for a given individual in a population.  One such measure is the {{LD50}}. When such data does not exist, estimates are made by comparison to known similar toxic things, or to similar exposures in similar organisms. Then, "[[safety factor]]s" are added to account for uncertainties in data and evaluation processes. For example, if a dose of a toxic substance is safe for a laboratory rat, one might assume that one tenth that dose would be safe for a human, allowing a safety factor of 10 to allow for interspecies differences between two mammals; if the data are from fish, one might use a factor of 100 to account for the greater difference between two chordate classes (fish and mammals). Similarly, an extra protection factor may be used for individuals believed to be more susceptible to toxic effects such as in pregnancy or with certain diseases. Or, a newly synthesized and previously unstudied chemical that is believed to be very similar in effect to another compound could be assigned an additional protection factor of 10 to account for possible differences in effects that are probably much smaller. Obviously, this approach is very approximate; but such protection factors are deliberately very conservative, and the method has been found to be useful in a deep variety of applications.

Assessing all aspects of the toxicity of cancer-causing agents involves additional issues, since it is not certain if there is a minimal effective dose for [[carcinogens]], or whether the risk is just too small to see. In addition, it is possible that a single cell transformed into a cancer cell is all it takes to develop the full effect (the "one hit" theory).

It is more difficult to determine the toxicity of chemical mixtures than a pure chemical, because each component displays its own toxicity, and components may interact to produce enhanced or diminished effects. Common mixtures include [[gasoline]], [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoke]], and [[industrial waste]].  Even more complex are situations with more than one type of toxic entity, such as the discharge from a malfunctioning sewage treatment plant, with both chemical and biological agents.

The preclinical toxicity testing on various biological systems reveals the species-, organ- and dose- specific toxic effects of an investigational product. The toxicity of substances can be observed by (a) studying the accidental exposures to a substance (b) in vitro studies using cells/ cell lines (c) in vivo exposure on experimental animals. Toxicity tests are mostly used to examine specific adverse events or specific end points such as cancer, cardiotoxicity, and skin/eye irritation. Toxicity testing also helps calculate the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) dose and is helpful for clinical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman S. Toxicological screening. J Pharmacol Pharmacother [serial online] 2011 [cited 2013 Oct 12];2:74-9. Available from: http://www.jpharmacol.com/text.asp?2011/2/2/74/81895&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
[[File:GHS-pictogram-skull.svg|thumb|The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals|international]] [[GHS hazard pictograms|pictogram]] for toxic chemicals.]]

For substances to be regulated and handled appropriately they must be properly classified and labelled. Classification is determined by approved testing measures or calculations and have determined cut-off levels set by governments and scientists (for example, [[no-observed-adverse-effect level]]s, [[threshold limit value]]s, and [[tolerable daily intake]] levels). [[Pesticide]]s provide the example of well-established [[toxicity class]] systems and [[toxicity label]]s. While currently many countries have different regulations regarding the types of tests, numbers of tests and cut-off levels, the implementation of the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|Globally Harmonized System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_welcome_e.html|title=About the GHS -  Transport - UNECE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/international/globalharmon.htm|title=Pesticide Labels and GHS: Comparison and Samples|first=US|last=EPA, OCSPP, OPP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has begun unifying these countries.

Global classification looks at three areas: Physical Hazards (explosions and pyrotechnics),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/02e_part2.pdf|title=Transport -  Transport - UNECE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health Hazards&lt;ref name=GHSpart3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/03e_part3.pdf|title=Transport -  Transport - UNECE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[environmental hazard]]s.&lt;ref name=GHSpart4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/04e_part4.pdf|title=Transport -  Transport - UNECE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health hazards===
The types of toxicities where substances may cause lethality to the entire body, lethality to specific organs, major/minor damage, or cause cancer. These are globally accepted definitions of what toxicity is.&lt;ref name=GHSpart3/&gt; Anything falling outside of the definition cannot be classified as that type of toxicant.

====Acute toxicity====
{{Main|Acute toxicity}}
{{See also|Lethal dose}}
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2009}}
Acute toxicity looks at lethal effects following oral, dermal or inhalation exposure. It is split into five categories of severity where Category 1 requires the least amount of exposure to be lethal and Category 5 requires the most exposure to be lethal. The table below shows the upper limits for each category.

Note: The undefined values are expected to be roughly equivalent to the category 5 values for oral and dermal administration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

====Other methods of exposure and severity====
[[File:Epikutanni-test.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Patch test]] ]]
Skin corrosion and irritation are determined though a skin [[patch test]] analysis. This examines the severity of the damage done; when it is incurred and how long it remains; whether it is reversible and how many test subjects were affected.

'''Skin corrosion''' from a substance must penetrate through the epidermis into the dermis within four hours of application and must not reverse the damage within 14 days. '''Skin irritation''' shows damage less severe than corrosion if: the damage occurs within 72 hours of application; or for three consecutive days after application within a 14-day period; or causes [[inflammation]] which lasts for 14 days in two test subjects. '''Mild skin irritation''' minor damage (less severe than irritation) within 72 hours of application or for three consecutive days after application.

Serious '''[[Human eye|eye]] damage''' involves tissue damage or degradation of vision which does not fully reverse in 21 days. Eye irritation involves changes to the eye which do fully reverse within 21 days.

====Other categories====
* Respiratory sensitizers cause breathing hypersensitivity when the substance is inhaled.
* A substance which is a skin sensitizer causes an [[allergic response]] from a dermal application.
* [[Carcinogen]]s induce cancer, or increase the likelihood of cancer occurring.
* Reproductively toxic substances cause adverse effects in either sexual function or [[fertility]] to either a parent or the offspring.
* Specific-target organ toxins damage only specific organs.
* Aspiration hazards are solids or liquids which can cause damage through inhalation.

===Environmental hazards===
An Environmental hazard can be defined as any condition, process, or state adversely affecting the environment. These hazards can be physical or chemical, and present in air, water, and/or soil. These conditions can cause extensive harm to humans and other organisms within an ecosystem.

====Common types of environmental hazards====
* [[water pollution|Water]]: detergents, fertilizer, raw sewage, prescription medication, pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals, PCBs
* [[soil contamination|Soil]]: heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, PCBs
* [[air pollution|Air]]: particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, asbestos, ground-level ozone, lead (from aircraft fuel, mining, and industrial processes)&lt;ref&gt;"Basic Information about Lead Air Pollution." EPA. Environmental Protection Agency, 17 Mar. 2017. Web. Beaubier, Jeff, and Barry D. Nussbaum. "Encyclopedia of Quantitative Risk Analysis and Assessment." Wiley. N.p., 15 Sept. 2008. Web.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The EPA maintains a list of priority pollutants for testing and regulation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/priority-pollutant-list-epa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Occupational hazards====
The expression "Mad as a hatter" and the "Mad Hatter" of the book [[Alice in Wonderland]] derive from the known occupational toxicity of [[hatters]] who used a toxic chemical for controlling the shape of hats.

=====Hazards for small businesses=====
=====Hazards from medical waste and prescription disposal=====
=====Hazards in the arts=====
Hazards in the arts have been an issue for artists for centuries, even though the toxicity of their tools, methods, and materials was not always adequately realized. Lead and cadmium, among other toxic elements, were often incorporated into the names of artist's oil paints and pigments, for example "lead white" and "cadmium red."

20th century printmakers and other artists began to be aware of the toxic substances, toxic techniques, and toxic fumes in glues, painting mediums, pigments, and solvents, many of which in their labelling gave no indication of their toxicity. An example was the use of [[xylol]] for cleaning [[silk screens]]. Painters began to notice the dangers of breathing painting mediums and thinners such as [[turpentine]]. Aware of toxicants in studios and workshops, in 1998 printmaker [[Keith Howard]] published ''Non-Toxic Intaglio Printmaking'' which detailed twelve innovative [[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]]-type printmaking techniques including [[photo etching]], [[digital imaging]], [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]]-resist hand-etching methods, and introducing a new method of [[non-toxic]] [[lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Keith Howard|display-authors=etal|others=forward by Monona Rossol; contributions from Elizabeth Dove|title=Non-toxic intaglio printmaking / by Keith Howard ; foreword by Monono Rossol.|date=1988|publisher=Printmaking Resources|location=Grand Prairie, Alberta|isbn=0-9683541-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mapping environmental hazards====
There are many environmental health mapping tools. [[TOXMAP]] is a Geographic Information System (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov|title=Reliable information on K-12 science education, chemistry, toxicology, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, disaster/emergency preparedness and response, and outreach to minority and other specific populations.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA)  [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund]] programs. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US Federal Government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from NLM's Toxicology Data Network 
(TOXNET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|title=TOXNET|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PubMed]], and from other authoritative sources.

====Aquatic toxicity====
[[Aquatic toxicity]] testing subjects key indicator species of [[fish]] or [[crustacea]] to certain concentrations of a substance in their environment to determine the lethality level. Fish are exposed for 96 hours while crustacea are exposed for 48 hours. While GHS does not define toxicity past 100&amp;nbsp;mg/l, the EPA currently lists aquatic toxicity as "practically non-toxic" in concentrations greater than 100 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oppefed1/ecorisk_ders/toera_analysis_eco.htm EPA: Ecological risk assessment]&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Exposure
! Category 1
! Category 2
! Category 3
|-
| Acute
| ≤ 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L
| ≤ 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L
| ≤ 100&amp;nbsp;mg/L
|-
| Chronic
| ≤ 1.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L
| ≤ 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L
| ≤ 100&amp;nbsp;mg/L
|}

Note: A category 4 is established for chronic exposure, but simply contains any toxic substance which is mostly insoluble, or has no data for acute toxicity.

==Factors influencing toxicity==
Toxicity of a substance can be affected by many different factors, such as the pathway of administration (whether the toxicant is applied to the skin, ingested, inhaled, injected), the time of exposure (a brief encounter or long term), the number of exposures (a single dose or multiple doses over time), the physical form of the toxicant (solid, liquid, gas), the genetic makeup of an individual, an individual's overall health, and many others.  Several of the terms used to describe these factors have been included here.

; Acute exposure: A single exposure to a toxic substance which may result in severe biological harm or death; acute exposures are usually characterized as lasting no longer than a day.
; Chronic exposure: Continuous exposure to a toxicant over an extended period of time, often measured in months or years; it can cause irreversible side effects.

==Etymology==
"Toxic" and similar words came from Greek τοξον = "[[bow (weapon)]]" via "[[arrow poison|poisoned arrow]]", which came to be used for "[[poison]]" in scientific language, as the usual Classical Greek word ('ιον) for "poison" would transliterate to "io-", which is not distinctive enough. In some [[biological name]]s, "toxo-" still means "bow", as in ''[[Toxodon]]'' = "bow-toothed" from the shape.

'''''An Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words''''' was written by [[William Edwy Vine]] and published as a four volume set in 1940.  In common usage, the title is often shortened to '''''Vine's Expository Dictionary''''', or simply '''''Vine's'''''.  It is a cross-reference from key English words in the [[Authorized King James Version]] to the original words in the Greek texts of the New Testament.  In his preface to the book, Vine wrote, "The present volumes are produced especially for the help of those who do not study Greek, though it is hoped that those who are familiar with the original will find them useful."  
It provides a concise meaning of the original Greek word, often providing Bible verse references as examples.  If there are several Greek words that may translate to the same English word, Vine's distinguishes the shadings of meaning and connotation that may be lost in the English translation.  For example, there are a number of Greek words that may be translated by the English word '''''love'''''.

Vine's also provides the definition of a word (as used in the King James Version) more accurately than an English dictionary, because it expands the Greek use of the word. For example, the word, "godliness" in 1 Tim. 2:2 is defined in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary as "1: Divine 2: pious, devout -", but in Vines, it is defined as " 'to be devout,' denotes that piety which is characterized by a Godward attitude, does that which is well-pleasing to Him." So we have a fuller meaning of the word by seeing how the word is used in the NT.

Vine's can be used with [[Strong's Concordance]]. Every word is numbered with the equivalent Strong's number so you can use it more efficiently.  

Vine did not write an equivalent work for Old Testament Hebrew words; however, Vine's work is sometimes combined with another author's Hebrew dictionary and marketed under Vine's name as a "complete" expository dictionary. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimatebiblereferencelibrary.com/Vines_Expositary_Dictionary.pdf ''Vine's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words'']&lt;/ref&gt;
