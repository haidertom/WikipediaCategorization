      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1966">'''ANK '64'''  was an [[Estonia]]n artist collective active in the years 1964 to 1969 in [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref name="estonica.org"&gt;[http://www.estonica.org/et/Kultuur/Kunst/Mentaliteedi_muutused/ Estonian encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The group included originally 10 artists: [[Jüri Arrak]], {{ILL|Kristiina Kaasik|et}}, [[Tõnis Laanemaa]], [[Malle Leis]], [[Marju Mutsu]], {{ILL|Enno Ootsing|et}}, [[Tiiu Pallo-resin]], {{ILL|Vello Tamm|et}}, {{ILL|Aili Vint|et}} and [[Tõnis Vint]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/art-of-the-baltics-the-struggle-for-freedom-of-artistic-expression-under-the-soviets-1945-1991/oclc/46918250/viewport ANK group] discussed by Eda Sepp in ''Estonian Non-conformist art from the Soviet occupation in 1944 to Perestroika'', p. 67 in chapter 2 in ''Art of the Baltics: The Struggle for Freedom of Artistic Expression under the Soviets, 1945-1991'', edited by Jane Voorhees, Alla Rosenfeld and Norton T. Dodge, exhibition catalog Zimmerli Art Museum, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 2001/2002, {{ISBN|978-0813530420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group did not practice any specific style of art, but recognized as works of art anything related to modern youth culture such as [[pop-art]]. Members of the group were not only active as artists, but also organized and attended lectures on foreign artists and their activities. Members of the group were involved in the Leningrad and Moscow underground [[Soviet Nonconformist Art|non-conformist art]] movement.

The first group exhibition was held in 1964 on the premises of the Estonian Theatre. A retrospective of their work 50 years after they first gathered was held in the [[Tallinn Art Hall]] from 6 November-15 December 2013. Many of the original artists were still active at the time and showed their recent work in addition to a historical overview.

{{Chinese|t=天涯織女|s=天涯织女|p=Tiānyá Zhínǚ|pic=A Weaver on the Horizon (intertitle).jpg|210px|piccap=''A Weaver on the Horizon'' [[intertitle]]&lt;br&gt;([[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]] version)}}'''''A Weaver on the Horizon''''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 天涯织女) is a 2010 Chinese television series based on the life story of [[Huang Daopo]], who revolutionized the textile industry during the [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty]] and the beginning of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The story is considered to be [[historical fiction]], as the plot deviates from factual accounts. A central theme of [[feminism]] is also present, as more focus is placed on the female protagonists than their male counterparts. The series premiered on Nanning Television on 14 August 2010 and ran for 36 episodes.

==Synopsis==
[[Huang Daopo|Huang Qiao'er]] (Ivy Lu, [[Janine Chang]]) was born to a poverty-stricken family. She lost her parents at an early age and was raised by her aunt, who taught her [[textile arts]]. While growing up in a weaving mill, Huang developed a close bond with the neighboring dyehouse owner's son, Fang Ning ([[Edwin Siu]]), who fell in love with her. Eventually, Splendid Mill's weavers produce outstanding results and earn an opportunity to work in the palace. Through Huang's friendship with the [[Emperor Duzong of Song|emperor]]'s niece, Zhao Jiayi ([[Cecilia Liu]]), Huang is able to gain access to the palace's study, deepening her knowledge of weaving from its collection. However, the weavers become embroiled in a power struggle with the emperor's concubines, as well as a rivalry with the Iridescent Cloud Mill's weavers, who also work at the palace. 
 
While in the palace, Huang falls in love with a young general, Lin Mufei ([[Justin Yuan]]), at the expense of her friendship with the princess. Lin also rejects the princess' affections, due to his prejudice against imperial family members' corruption, and in spite of his vows to defend the [[Song dynasty]]. During Lin's absence, Fang Ning's legs are crippled while saving Huang from the corrupt members of the imperial court. Feeling guilty for Fang's plight, and hearing rumors that Lin had been killed in battle at the city of Chuzhou (present day [[Huai'an]]), Huang decides to marry Fang. Lin, however, has survived and is heartbroken when he sees the two marry, thus complicating the love triangle between Lin, Huang, and Zhao Jiayi. 
 
Despite Huang Qiao'er's awareness that she cannot be with the man she still loves, due to her marriage to another, she recognizes that being Fang Ning's wife also has its benefits. Her mother-in-law ([[Cheng Pei-pei]]) imparts the family's dyeing secrets, which helps her hone her textile skills. However, Fang is aware that his wife still has feelings towards Lin Mufei. This prompts Fang to become an alcoholic, leading him to repeatedly abuse her. As for Zhao Jiayi, she remains devoted to Lin, and, after learning that he did not die, eventually sneaks away from the palace to search for him. With the help of Lin's mother, Zhao locates him in the city of [[Changzhou]]. She claims that she only wishes to be with Lin Mufei in battle, regardless of whether he would ultimately love her or not. 
 
Not long afterwards, the [[Mongols]], who establish the [[Yuan dynasty]] under the leadership of [[Kublai Khan]], conquer the Song dynasty.  After experiencing a series of personal misfortunes and tragedies, Lin is traumatized and decides to focus on protecting Zhao Jiayi, and her surviving [[House of Zhao|clan members]], as well as liberating China from the Mongols' tyranny. For three years, while battling their enemies and taking care of one another, Lin and Zhao begin to develop a close bond and mutual understanding. Zhao helps Lin nurse his emotional wounds, resulting from Huang's marriage to Fang Ning and his mother's execution by one of their adversaries. He starts to reciprocate the princess’s affection, when he realizes that there is more to her than her apparent vain behavior.

While fleeing from the Mongols' conquest, Huang has a chance encounter with an extraordinary [[Woodworking|woodwork]] instructor, Feng Jiujin ([[Damian Lau]]), and becomes his apprentice. She ultimately wanders to [[Sanya|Yazhou]] (present day [[Hainan]]), where she learns the arts of cotton farming and weaving, and helps the [[Li people|natives]] improve their textile technology. 
 
After Fang Ning's death, Huang finally resolves the entanglement with Lin and Zhao, by reuniting with them in the city of [[Hangzhou]] (former Song capital [[Lin'an City|Lin'an]]). Huang sadly realizes that she has inadvertently brought two men who loved her nothing but heartbreak, instead of happiness. Regretting her mistakes, she gives her blessing to Lin and Zhao of their newfound love for each other, and accepts her fate as a widow. Huang also realizes her dream of revolutionizing the art of textile weaving and manufacturing, for the welfare of her people. With support from her family and friends, Huang becomes an innovator of the Chinese textile industry. After numerous battles against the Yuan forces with Song remnants, the [[Battle of Yamen]] officially ends to the Song dynasty. Lin and Zhao, after enduring these defeats, realize that the enemy is too powerful and not yet ready for the resistance to overthrow. Desiring to escape from the violence and tragedies in their lives, they choose to elope and go into seclusion together.
 
Lin Mufei and Zhao Jiayi are happily married and return to Hangzhou after spending three years in hiding. By this time, the Splendid Mill and Fang Family Dyehouse have brought in many apprentices and achieved business success, with Huang Qiao'er fulfilling her purpose in life.

==Production==
The Song and Mongol military costumes are originally made for the two television series ''[[The Young Warriors (TV series)|The Young Warriors]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes (2008 TV series)|The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'' (2008).

Originally considered for the part of Huang Qiao'er by the casting department, [[Cecilia Liu]] expressed her interest to portray Zhao Jiayi instead, after reading the script. As a result, [[Janine Chang]] was chosen for the starring role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eladies.sina.com.cn/news/2009/1112/0957933715.shtml 劉詩詩入主《衣被天下》 首度挑戰刁蠻公主] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002145702/http://eladies.sina.com.cn/news/2009/1112/0957933715.shtml |date=2011-10-02 }}. Eladies.sina.com.cn. Retrieved on 2012-01-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deviations from historic accounts ==
In Chinese history, [[Emperor Lizong of Song|Emperor Lizong]] and [[Emperor Duzong of Song|Emperor Duzong]] of the Song dynasty were actually uncle and nephew. In ''A Weaver on the Horizon'', they are changed to brothers to explain Zhao Jiayi's existence. In reality, Zhao Jiayi never existed and is a fictional character solely created for ''A Weaver on the Horizon''. The screenwriters were unwilling to write Zhao as the daughter of Duzong due to his well-known corrupted reputations.

Almost all of the characters in the series are fictional except [[Huang Daopo]], Emperor Duzong, Mongol general [[Bayan of the Baarin|Bayan]], and [[Yelü Chucai]]. Most of the plot does not match actual historic accounts. There are references to the death of Emperor Duzong, the succession and abdication of [[Emperor Gong of Song|Emperor Gongzong]], [[Battle of Xiangyang]], [[Battle of Yamen]] and the deaths of the Song's last two emperors; [[Emperor Duanzong of Song|Emperor Duanzong]] and [[Emperor Bing of Song|Emperor Huaizong]].

[[File:Chinese acrobat in midair being watched by other acrobats.jpg|thumb|upright|Chinese acrobat in midair after being propelled off a [[Springboard (gymnastics)|springboard]], China, 1987]]

'''Acrobatics''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ἀκροβατέω, ''akrobateo'', "walk on tiptoe, strut"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29krobate%2Fw ἀκροβατέω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is the performance of extraordinary human feats of [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[agility]], and [[motor coordination]]. It can be found in many of the [[performing arts]], [[sports]] (sporting) events, and [[martial arts]]. Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as [[acro dance]], [[circus]], and [[gymnastics]], but many other athletic activities — such as [[ballet]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]] — may also employ acrobatics. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as [[aerobatics]].

==History==

[[File:Hydria acrobat BM VaseF232.jpg|thumb|170px|A female acrobat depicted on an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[hydria]], c. 340-330 BC.]]
[[File:Antikensammlung Berlin 525.JPG|170px|thumb|Female acrobat shooting an [[Bow and arrow|arrow with a bow]] in her feet; [[Red-figure pottery|Gnathia style]] [[Ancient Greek pottery|''pelikai'' pottery]]; 4th century BC]]
Acrobatic traditions are found in many cultures, and there is evidence that the earliest such traditions occurred thousands of years ago. For example, [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] art from c. 2000 BC contains depictions of [[bull-leaping|acrobatic feats on the backs of bulls]]. [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] practiced acrobatics{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}, and the [[noble court]] displays of the [[Europe]]an [[Middle Ages]] would often include acrobatic performances that included [[juggling]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}.

In [[China]], acrobatics have been a part of the culture since the [[Han Dynasty|Western Han Dynasty]] (206 BC-AD 220). Acrobatics were part of village harvest [[festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redpanda2000.com/history.htm redpanda2000]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tang Dynasty]], acrobatics saw much the same sort of development as European acrobatics saw during the Middle Ages, with court displays during the 7th through 10th century dominating the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasadena.edu/chinese/cultural/acrobatics.html Pasadena.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Acrobatics continues to be an important part of modern [[Chinese variety art]].

Though the term initially applied to tightrope walking{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}, in the 19th century, a form of performance art including [[circus]] acts began to use the term as well. In the late 19th century, tumbling and other acrobatic and gymnastic activities became competitive sport in Europe.

Acrobatics has often served as a subject for fine art. Examples of this are paintings such as ''Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)'' by [[Impressionist]] [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which depicts two German acrobatic sisters, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1905 ''[[Acrobat and Young Harlequin]]'', and ''[[:File:Vasnetsov Acrobats.jpg|Acrobats in a Paris suburb]]'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].

==Types==

===Aerial===
An '''aerialist''' is an acrobat who performs in the air, on a suspended apparatus such as a [[trapeze]], [[corde lisse|rope]], [[cloud swing]], [[Cradle (circus act)|aerial cradle]], aerial pole, [[aerial silk]], or [[aerial hoop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nica.com.au/dictionary|publisher=National Institute of Circus Arts|title=Circus Dictionary|accessdate=2009-10-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719162832/http://www.nica.com.au/dictionary|archivedate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Genre fiction}}

'''Action fiction''' is the [[literary genre]] that includes [[Spy fiction|spy novels]], [[Adventure fiction|adventure]] stories, tales of terror and intrigue ("[[cloak and dagger]]"), and [[Mystery fiction|mysteries]].  This kind of story utilizes [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]], the tension that is built up when the reader wishes to know how the [[Conflict (narrative)|conflict]] between the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] is going to be resolved or what the solution to the puzzle of a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|pp=58,116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre fiction==
Action fiction is a form of [[genre fiction]] whose subject matter is characterized by emphasis on exciting [[Action (narrative)|action]] sequences. This does not always mean they exclude character development or story-telling.  Action fiction is related to other forms of [[fiction]], including [[action film]]s, [[action game]]s and analogous media in other formats such as [[manga]] and [[anime]]. It  includes martial arts action, extreme sports action, car chases and vehicles, suspense action, and action [[comedy]], with each focusing in more detail on its own type and flavor of action. It is usually possible to tell from the creative style of an action sequence, the emphasis of an entire work, so that, for example, the style of a combat sequence will indicate whether the entire work can be classified as action adventure, or a martial work. Action is mainly defined by a central focus on any kind of exciting movement.

{{Culture of Albania}}

The '''Albanian art''' ({{IPA-sq|aˈr:ti ʃcipˈta:rɛ}} — {{Lang-sq|Arti Shqiptarë}}) refers to all [[art|artistic expressions]] and [[artwork]]s in [[Albania]] or produced by [[Albanians]]. The country's art is either work of arts produced by its [[Albanian people|people]] and influenced by its [[Culture of Albania|culture]] and [[Traditions of Albania|traditions]]. It has preserved its original elements and traditions despite its long and eventful [[History of Albania|history]] around the time when Albania was populated to [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greek]]s and subsequently conquered by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s, [[Eastern Roman Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Empire|Venetian]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. 
 
At different times, [[Illyrian art|Illyrian]], [[Ancient Greek art|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman art|Roman art]] developed in Albania and survived in a number of media inclusive of [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[pottery]], and [[mosaic]]. The [[Rock inscriptions of the Grama Bay|rock inscriptions]] in [[Bays of Albania|Grama Bay]] and [[mosaic]] in [[The Beauty of Durrës|Durrës]] can be traced back to the [[4th century BC]] and there are nonetheless ancient remains of extraordinary quality available at [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Byllis]], [[Rozafa Castle|Shkodër]], [[Butrint]] and [[Protected areas of Albania#Archaeological Parks|elsewhere]] across the country.

The centerpiece of medieval Albanian art started with the successor of the [[Roman Empire]], namely the [[Byzantine Empire]] that ruled the great majority of Albania and the [[Balkan Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="ByzantineAlbania"&gt;{{cite web|title=Icons from the Orthodox Communities of Albania - COLLECTION OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF MEDIEVAL ART, KORCË|url=https://helios-eie.ekt.gr/EIE/bitstream/10442/8555/1/INR_Drakopoulou_06_01.pdf|website=helios-eie.ekt.gr|page=20|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised gradually of [[fresco]]es, [[mural]]s, and [[icon]]s painted with an admirable use of color and [[Gold (color)|gold]]. [[Onufri]], [[David Selenica]], [[Kostandin Shpataraku]] and the [[Zografi Brothers]] are the most eminent representatives of medieval Albanian art. The [[Epitaph of Gllavenica]], an [[epitaph]] written on a [[shroud]], is one of the best artifacts of this genre in the [[Balkans]].

During the [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman invasion]] of Albania, many [[Albanians]] migrated out of the area to escape either various socio-political and economic difficulties. Among them, the medieval [[painter]]s [[Marco Basaiti]] and [[Viktor Karpaçi]], [[Sculpture|sculptor]] and [[architect]] [[Andrea Alessi|Andrea Nikollë Aleksi]] and [[art collector]] [[Alessandro Albani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walker Art Gallery|title=Annual Report and Bulletin of the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-W0rAAAAIAAJ|quote=Andrea Alessi, architect and sculptor, was a native of Durazzo in Albania and possibly of local rather than Italian origin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babinger|first=Franz|title=L'origine albanese del pittore Marco Basaiti (ca. 1470 - ca. 1530),|journal=Atti. Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, Classe di Scienze Morali e Lettere|year=1962|series=CXX|pages=497–500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who resided in the [[Venetian Empire]] established the [[Scuola degli Albanesi]] that served as a cultural and social center for Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carol M. Richardson|title=Locating Renaissance Art|publisher=Yale University Press, 2007|isbn=9780300121889|page=19|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ac_Bbk8dLXUC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Albanian Renaissance]], in the field of arts, developed for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] in rather different directions especially toward the [[occident]] and was initially dominated by the central figure of [[Kolë Idromeno]]. Painters were searching for meaning, traditions and identity, leading initially to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and later with [[impressionism]].

== History ==

=== Early period ===

[[File:Kamenica07-00.jpg|190px|thumb|right|An Devollian pottery from [[Kamenica Tumulus|Kamenica]].]]

Within the boundaries of Albania there have been several [[prehistoric]] Mediterranean cultures that left a number of pictoral records located in the Kryegjata Valley, [[Goranxi]], [[Maliq]], [[Konispol|Konispol Cave]], [[Urakë|Blaz Cave]], [[Gajtan Cave]], [[Treni Cave]] and numerous other sites throughout Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ceka|2013|page=25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|2009|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Templer|2016|page=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|2009|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Templer|2016|page=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacques|2009|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Aleks Trushaj, Ermal Sina|title=The Particularity of Prehistoric Culture in Vlora Region (Albania)|url=http://www.mcser.org/journal/index.php/ajis/article/download/3069/3026|website=mcser.org|pages=1-8|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Bronze Age]], a number of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] tribes started to emerge itself on the territory of Albania and established several artistic centers at the same time. [[Terracotta]] was widely used by both cultures most notably for reliefs and other architectural purposes. Quite a number of terracotta figures, among others from the Illyrians, were found near [[Belsh]] but besides that as well throughout Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of Illyrian terracotta ﬁgurines of Aphroditeand other ceramic objects using EDXRF spectrometry†|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/xrs.945/epdf?r3_referer=wol&amp;tracking_action=preview_click&amp;show_checkout=1&amp;purchase_referrer=www.google.de&amp;purchase_site_license=LICENSE_DENIED_NO_CUSTOMER|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|location=Tirana|page=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Bagnell Bury, Stanley Arthur Cook, Frank Ezra Adcock|title=The Cambridge Ancient History: The Augustan Empire, 43 B.C.-A.D. 69, 2nd ed., 1996 - Band 10 von The Cambridge Ancient History, Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards|publisher=University Press, 1996|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=1OTgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=illyrian+pottery+albania&amp;dq=illyrian+pottery+albania&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxspPF67TZAhWECewKHf-OATo4ChDoAQg-MAM|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bashkia Belsh|url=http://www.qarkuelbasan.gov.al/?crd=0,8,1,0,0,74&amp;ln=1&amp;uni=20101209233420201012092334129193|website=qarkuelbasan.gov.al|accessdate=10 December 2010|language=Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From earliest times [[mosaic]]s have been used to cover floors in principal rooms of buildings, palaces, and tombs, as well as in the formal rooms of private houses. The use of mosaic became widespread in [[Illyria]] and [[Ancient Greek colonies in Illyria|Ancient Greek]] colonies within the Illyrian coast on the [[Adriatic]] and the [[Ionian Sea]]. The earliest examples of mosaic flooring date to the ancient period are housed in [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]],
[[Butrint]], [[Tirana]], [[Lin, Korçë|Lin]], and [[Durrës]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ferid Hudhri|title=2.10.

The [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period is marked by the production of [[sculpture]]s presented as [[symbolic art]]. [[Roman sculpture]] was largely influenced by the sculptures of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and the [[Etruscan civilization]] whereas impressive examples can be mostly found in the cities of [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]] and [[Butrint]], which flourished during that period.

=== Medieval period ===

[[File:Epitafi.jpg|160px|thumb|right|The [[Epitaph of Gllavenica]] is often considered the highlight of medieval Albanian art that was commissioned by [[Gjergj Arianiti]] in 1373.]]

When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided in the fourth century, most of [[Illyria]] remained in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] that was conventionally known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Byzantine art]], the art of the Eastern Roman Empire from about the 5th century until the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, was predominantly marked by religious expressions and a renewed interest in techniques of the [[Roman Empire]] mixed with the themes of [[Christianity]].

[[Icon]]s and [[fresco]]es emerged as a significant art form with an extensive church building in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=L. Shumka from [[Agricultural University of Tirana]]|title=Considering Importance of Light in the PostByzantine Church in Central Albania|url=https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2013/november/8B_Considering.pdf|website=ijirset.com|location=Tirana|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They covered [[Sacred architecture|sacred building]] interior walls, floors and domes increased and expanded in size and importance. The use of [[Gold (color)|gold]] and bright [[color]]s was important indeed each color had its own value and meaning. In addition, colors were never mixed together but were always used pure.

The earliest icons of Albania date from the thirteenth century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="ByzantineAlbania"/&gt; No paintings before the thirteenth century, produced by Albanians, have been located to date.&lt;ref name="ByzantineAlbania"/&gt; Nonetheless few older structures in the country house different collections of paintings dating to the Byzantine period.

[[Illuminated manuscript|Manuscript]]s were another significant feature of Albanian medieval art. The handwritten [[Codex Beratinus]] and [[Codex Beratinus II]] are two ancient [[Gospel Book|Gospel]]s from [[Berat]], dating from the sixth and ninth centuries. They represent one of the most valuable treasures of the Albanian cultural heritage that was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2005.
 
By the fifteenth century after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and the invasion of [[Southeastern Europe]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]], art produced by [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] living in the [[Balkans]] was often named [[Post-Byzantine art]]. In that period many valuable monuments and artifacts were made by Albanian painters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KONFERENCA E DYTË E STUDIMEVE ALBANOLOGJIKE|url=http://www.albanianorthodox.com/ikonografi/shkolla-e-korces.pdf|website=albanianorthodox.com|location=Tirana|page=2|language=Albanian|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Voskopojë St.Nikolaos - Innenraum Fresko 4b.jpg|270px|thumb|left|[[Fresco]] of [[Saint Stephen]] by [[David Selenica]].]]

The most famous Albanian painter was [[Onufri]] who worked almost his entire life in Albania and Macedonia.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Onufri was distinguished for its rich use of colors and decorative shades with certain [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] national elements that are more visible with his successors [[David Selenica]], [[Kostandin Shpataraku]] and the [[Zografi Brothers]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; They lavishly painted diverse churches and monasteries throughout Albania and neighboring countries, especially visible in [[Berat]], [[Elbasan]], [[Voskopojë]], and [[Korçë]].

The [[Ottoman period in the history of Albania|Ottoman period]] of Albania during the fifteenth century is traditionally said to have had a negative impact on Albanian art and so the influences of [[Renaissance]] were extinguished. This influence was absorbed and reinterpreted with an extensive construction of [[mosque]]s that opened a new section in Albanian art, that of [[Islamic art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Edmond Manahasa, İlknur Aktug Kolay|title=Observations on the existing Ottoman mosques in Albania|url=http://www.az.itu.edu.tr/azvol12no2web/09-Manahasa-Kolay-1202.pdf|website=az.itu.edu.tr|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of art was usually portrayed by the highest degree of [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s, [[arabesque]]s and [[Ornament (art)|ornamentation]] of interlacing geometrical patterns of polygons, circles and interlocked lines and curves.

=== Albanian Renaissance ===
{{See also|Albanian Renaissance}}

[[File:Kole_Idromeno,_Motra_tone.jpg|160px|thumb|''[[Motra Tone]]'' by [[Kolë Idromeno]].]]

In the nineteenth century, a significant era for Albanian art begins. The great liberation acts starting with [[League of Prizren]] in 1878, that led to the [[Declaration of independence of Albania|Independence]] in 1912, established the climate for a new [[artistic movement]], which would reflect life and history more realistically and [[Impressionism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] came into dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=MaryLee Knowlton|title=Albania - Band 23 von Cultures of the world|publisher=Marshall Cavendish, 2004|isbn=9780761418528|pages=102–103|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=alNsb0fpX9IC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=impressionism+in+albania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fPpah7v3Kz&amp;sig=JGfwa8DMK_VAyq_75OHNgJni3qw&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj274SevZzZAhVDxxQKHQytBusQ6AEIUzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=impressionism%20in%20albania&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kolë Idromeno]] is perhaps the most famous of the Realist painters in the country and often considered as the introducer of Realism in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ferid Hudhri|title=Albania Through Art|date=2003|publisher=Onufri|location=Tirana|isbn=9992753676|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists captured the [[History of Albania|historical]] past and identity of [[Albanians]] in landscapes of vast forests, wide rivers, pristine lakes as well as portraits. Other artists have been focused on social criticism, showing the conditions of the people. By the early twentieth century, a radical artistic change occurred and experienced a patriotic renaissance. The year 1883 is dominated and celebrated for the creation of the most crucial and finest paintings The Portrait of Skanderbeg by Jorgji Panariti and [[Motra Tone]] by [[Kolë Idromeno]].

[[Impressionism]] did not make itself evident among Albanian artists until after 1900. It did inspired numerous painters among them Vangjush Mio, the first impressionist painter of Albania.

By the middle of the twentieth century, a [[communist]] government took rule over Albania and the artwork that arrived during the communist era reflects its time. Art was censored by the government and artists were urged to create works that endorsed [[socialism]]. The dominant theme of Albanian paintings was the [[proletariat]], the backbone of the socialist system. Much of the country's art focused on domestic scenes such as men working in the fields and women feeding chickens. Also, landscape scenes were highly popularized by Albanian painters.

=== Modern period ===
[[File:Detail_of_Painting_of_Female_Partisan_in_Battle_-_National_Historical_Museum_-_Tirana_-_Albania_-_01_(42748115122).jpg|thumb|Detail of female partisan in battle, National History Museum, Tirana, Albania]]
Although Albania left communism for democracy in 1991, scholars currently label Albanian artwork under the category of "[[socialist realism]]", for its emphasis on portraying real people and situations. Although much of Albanian artwork is influenced by [[impressionism]] and [[expressionism]], it is most [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] in its depiction of everyday life. Such works can be found at the National Arts Gallery of Albania and the National History Museum both located in Tirana. Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however, new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message. Albanian artists continue to move art forward, while their art still remains distinctively Albanian in content.
 
Alt post-modernism was only introduced fairly recently among Albanian artists, there are a number of artists and works known internationally. Among the most famous Albanian post-modernists are [[Anri Sala]], [[Sislej Xhafa]], and [[Helidon Gjergji]].

Post-modern tendencies among Albanians were first spotted during the 1980s in [[Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.divus.cz/umelec/en/pages/umelec.php?id=1005&amp;roc=2003&amp;cis=3 |title=Shkëlzen Maliqi, Umelec Magazine |access-date=2009-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206231152/http://www.divus.cz/umelec/en/pages/umelec.php?id=1005&amp;roc=2003&amp;cis=3#clanek |archive-date=2008-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptures of national icons became popular throughout the country. In 1968, Sculptor [[Odhise Paskali]] (with help from fellow sculptors [[Andrea Mana]] and [[Janaq Paço]]) constructed a monument of [[Skanderbeg]], Albania’s national hero, in honor of the 500th anniversary of his death, and it is placed in the center of the capital city of [[Tirana]].

The Tirana Biennale is the main contemporary, international art event. Founded in 2001 by Edi Muka, Gezim Qëndro, and [[Giancarlo Politi]], it has enjoyed over the years the contribution of many international curators, like [[Francesco Bonami]], [[Adela Demetja]], [[Massimiliano Gioni]], [[Jens Hoffmann]], [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], and [[Harald Szeemann]]. Many famous Albanian and foreign artists are usually invited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tica-albania.org/TICAB/ TICA]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dedications ==

Through different times, various [[visual art]] works of foreign artists throughout [[Europe]], such as [[painting]]s, [[portrait]]s, [[etching]]s, [[sculpture]]s, [[relief]]s and works of other genres of art has been dedicated to [[Albania]] and the [[Albanian people]].

'''Bird of Happiness''' ({{lang-rus|пти́ца сча́стья|p=ˈptʲitsə ˈɕːasʲtʲjə}}) is the traditional North [[Russia]]n wooden [[toy]], carved in the shape of a bird. It was invented by [[Pomors]], the inhabitants of the coasts of the [[White Sea|White]] and [[Barents Sea]]s. The Bird of Happiness is made without glue or other fasteners, by carving thin petals for the bird’s wings and tail and then using a special method of spreading and curving them, also found in other products of the North Russian handicraft. The amulet is usually made of pine, fir, spruce, or [[Siberia]]n cedar. It is suspended inside a house, guarding the family hearth and well-being.

Wood chip bird is a carved wooden item with thin wavy plumage of the wings. The plumage and tail of these birds were usually made of split pine, that is why the birds were called "wood chip". The place of the wooden toy origin in the form of a bird is the Arkhangelsk region. It’s also called a "Pomor dove".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305102039/http://ushankarussia.com/wood-chip-bird-bird-of-happiness]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legends wood chip bird brings many benefits to the house. In addition, this bird is the symbol of the sun. The bird was hung in the house as the hearth and well-being keeper. These birds used to hang in almost every home of a farmer in the icon corner, above the dining table, opposite the Russian stove or over a child's cradle. From the movement of warm air they revolved in a circle.

'''The history of the bird''': In the far North in Arkhangelsk province, there lived a hunter. Winter in the North is long and cold: snowstorm, blizzard and freezing cold. This year the winter stayed for a long time and cooled the hunter’s house completely and the hunter's younger son fell ill.  He was ill for a long time, got very thin and pale; neither doctors nor wise men could help him.  The hunter grieved. He felt sorry for the little boy. The hunter asked his son: “What do you want?” The boy whispered quietly: “I want to see the sun...”. And where can you get the sun in the North? The hunter was lost in thoughts, heated the furnace to warm the house. But the fire is not the sun.

Suddenly the hunter noticed a splinter that was glowing in the fire. A smile lit up his face; and he knew how to help his son.
The hunter was working all the night. He carved a wood bird, made wood chips, decorated them with fretwork. He hung the bird above his son’s bed, and the bird suddenly came to life: it began spinning and moving in the hot air that was coming from the furnace.
The boy woke up, smiled and exclaimed: “Well, here is the sun!”
From that day on, the child began to recover rapidly. So, miraculous power was attributed to the wood chip bird and it was called the “Holy spirit”, the guardian of children, the symbol of family happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305102039/http://ushankarussia.com/wood-chip-bird-bird-of-happiness]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cahiers d'Art''''' is a French artistic and literary journal founded in 1926 by [[Christian Zervos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Serafin|first=Amy|title=Archive covers from relaunched French magazine Cahiers d'Art|url=http://www.wallpaper.com/art/archive-covers-from-relaunched-french-magazine-cahiers-dart/6237|work=Wallpaper*|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cahiers d'Art'' is also an eponymous publishing house which has published many monographs on artists living in France in the first half of the twentieth century. Publications include the definitive catalogue of works by [[Pablo Picasso]], ''Pablo Picasso par Christian Zervos'', in 33 volumes, with over 16,000 images.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt;

''Cahiers d'Art'' carries no advertising and is published on an irregular schedule.&lt;ref name=FT /&gt;

== History ==
The journal, founded by the art critic [[Christian Zervos]] in Paris at 14, rue du Dragon in 1926, was published with an interruption from 1941 to 1943, until 1960. The first post-war issue was dated 1940-1944 and focused on poets and writers from the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], including [[Vercors (writer)|Vercors]]. ''Cahiers d'Art'' also published selections from poet [[Paul Éluard]]'s ''Open Book I'' (1940) and ''Open Book II'' (1942).

After World War II, the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] was invited by Zervos to publish two articles on logic: ''Logical Time and the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty'' (1945) and ''The Number Thirteen and the Logical Form of Suspicion'' (1946). [[Samuel Beckett]] also contributed one of his earliest texts in French,''The Painting of Van de Velde or the World and the Pants.''

The journal has been noted for the quality of its articles and illustrations which promoted [[Modern Art]] in France for over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=36e année, n°1, 2012 : Renaissance des " Cahiers d’art " au détour d’une rue|url=http://www.artmediaagency.com/56319/36e-annee-n1-2012-renaissance-des-cahiers-dart-au-detour-dune-rue/|work=Art Media Agency|accessdate=23 January 2013}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists represented include [[Picasso]], [[Matisse]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Brâncuși]], [[Van Gogh]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Henry Laurens]], [[Moholy-Nagy]], [[Jean Lurçat]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[De Chirico]], [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Man Ray]].

Swedish collector [[Staffan Ahrenberg]] purchased the publication and relaunched it in October 2012.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news|last=Adam|first=Georgina|title=Mixed messages in the Middle East; lawsuits in London and New York; Les Cahiers relaunched|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/ea635ede-0306-11e2-a284-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2AV1ZmlIi|accessdate=27 October 2012|newspaper=Financial Times|date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maus|first=Burkhard|title=Cahiers d'Art – nouveau et à partir d'aujourd'hui|url=http://www.art-magazin.de/blog/2012/10/19/cahiers-dart-nouveau-et-a-partir-daujourdhui/|work=art|accessdate=23 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231033327/http://www.art-magazin.de/blog/2012/10/19/cahiers-dart-nouveau-et-a-partir-daujourdhui/#|archive-date=2012-12-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since 2012==
*The first issue featured works by [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Cyprien Gaillard]], [[Sarah Morris]] and [[Adrián Villar Rojas]], and the architecture of [[Oscar Niemeyer]].&lt;ref name=Cahiers&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ellsworth Kelly|journal=Cahiers d'Art|date=October 2012|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the re-launch of ''Cahiers d'Art,'' 14 rue du Dragon has reopened as a gallery and library, while 15 rue du Dragon now operates as an exhibition space for limited edition prints and editions by contemporary artists.
*In October 2013, ''Cahiers d'Art'' presented an exhibition of [[Philippe Parreno]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saywho.fr/mondanites/3226/vernissage-cahiers-d-art-philippe-parreno/164009|title=Vernissage Cahiers d'art - Philippe Parreno|work=SAYWHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; including recent drawings of the artist as well as a dozen master drawings : [[Francisco de Goya]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Case]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Matthew Barney]], Koo Jeong-A and [[John Cage]].
*In 2014 ''Cahiers d'Art'' released the newly published edition of the [[Pablo Picasso]] by [[Christian Zervos]] catalogue, known by many simply as 'the Zervos', in French and for the first time in English. This catalogue of more than 16,000 works in 33 volumes contains updates from the Picasso Administration.
*The second issue of the revue, N°1-2, 2013 features the work of [[Rosemarie Trockel]] who created especially for ''Cahiers d'Art'' a vinyl inserted in each revue that you can squeeze to make a sculpture. She also designed a plexiglass box for the limited edition. The publication also introduces the work of Peter Fischli and David Weiss, [[Le Corbusier]], Inge Mahn, [[:de:Absalon (Künstler)|Absalon]], and Riccardo Paratore, as well as texts by [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], Brigid Doherty, Joan Simon, [[Jean-Louis Cohen|Jean Louis Cohen]] and poems by [[Rolf Dieter Brinkmann]]. On the occasion of this release ''Cahiers d'Art'' presented an exhibition of Trockel's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saywho.fr/mondanites/3445/lancement-de-la-revue-cahiers-d-art-2-w-rosemarie-trockel/180504|title=Lancement de la revue Cahiers d'art #2 w/ Rosemarie Trockel|work=SAYWHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their galleries of 14 and 15 rue du Dragon in Paris.

The {{nihongo|'''Casio Loopy'''|ルーピー|Rūpī|lead=yes}}, subtitled ''My Seal Computer SV-100'', is a [[32-bit]] [[home video game console]]. Released exclusively in [[Video gaming in Japan|Japan]] in October 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.playright.dk/raretitel.php?id=29220|title=Play:Right Rare &gt; Hardware &gt; Casio Loopy|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was unique in that the marketing for it was completely targeted to [[Women and video games|female gamers]].

The Loopy includes a built-in thermal color [[Computer printer|printer]] that can be used to create [[sticker]]s from game screenshots. An optional accessory, called {{nihongo|''Magical Shop''|マジカルショップ|Majikaru Shoppu}}, is a video capture device to obtain images from [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] and [[DVD player]]s. Users may add text to these images and make stickers. Including Magical Shop's own built-in software, the Loopy game library contains 11 titles. The Loopy features one controller port for use with a standard [[game controller]] or with a mouse (sold separately). Developer [[Kenji Terada]] worked on ''Loopy Town no Oheya ga Hoshii!''.

Casio dropped the support of the console in 1996, only one year after its release.

'''''Chair''''' is a public artwork designed as an advertisement by Bassett Furniture, located at the intersection of Martin Luther King Ave. and V. Street S.E., in the [[Anacostia]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States of America]]. ''Chair'' was originally surveyed as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] survey in 1994. It was once considered the world's largest chair,&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculptures! | year=1994 | title=Chair, (sculpture). | work=SOS! | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!323187~!0#focus | accessdate= 1 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been overtaken by works like ''[[Broken Chair]]'' in [[Geneva]] and the temporary ''The Writer'' on [[Hampstead Heath]] in London.

==Description==

The chair, which stands 19 1/2 feet high, is a detail-to-detail replica of a [[Duncan Phyfe]] style chair. Painted brown with a white and brown striped "cushion", the chair is entirely made of [[aluminum]]. Weighing between 4,000 and 4,600 pounds, the chair sits on a concrete base.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Acquisition==

The chair was built in 1959 by Virginia-based furniture maker [[Bassett Furniture]]. The concept for the chair came from Charles Curtis, of the Curtis Brothers Furniture company, as a clever way to bring customers to their family showroom which was located on the grounds where the chair is currently placed.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

The piece was dedicated on July 11, 1959, and a plaque was placed with it, stating:

:THE WORLD'S LARGEST CHAIR
:PRESENTED TO
:CURTIS BROS.
:FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP
:AND SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC/BY THE
:BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES.
:THE CHAIR MADE OF SOUND HONDURAS MAHOGANY
:IS 19 1/2 FEET TALL AND WEIGHS 4000 POUNDS
:DEDICATED JULY 11, 1959
:DESIGNED
:LEO M. HIRAMETT
:BUILT BY J. E. BASSETT, JR.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Re-dedication==
John Kidwell, the caretaker of the Chair, frequently patched holes that would form after heavy rains with cement. During the days of August 23–24, 2005, the original Chair was disassembled by a backhoe and taken away for restoration. Made entirely of [[Honduras Mahogany]], the legs had begun to [[Dry rot|rot]]. On April 25, 2006, the chair was returned by Curtis Properties (was Curtis Brothers), however, this was a new chair, made entirely of brown aluminum. Over 250 people attended the re-dedication including [[Anthony A. Williams|Mayor Anthony A. Williams]].&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Schwartzman | title=The Big Chair, Rebuilt to Last | work=Anacostia | publisher=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/15/AR2006041500871.html | accessdate= 2 Feb 2011 | date=April 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the dedication of a new chair, a new plaque was placed, reading:

:THE BIG CHAIR
:RE-DEDICATION APRIL 25, 2006
:THIS COMMUNITY LANDMARK REPRESENTS THE CURTIS COMPANIES
:LONG-STANDING ALLEGIANCE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND
:STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO UNITY, PROSPERITY, AND GOOD WILL
:TO ALL WASHINGTONIANS AND FRIENDS OF ANACOSTIA.

This new chair was designed by Devery Lomax managed by John Kidwell. It was fabricated by Cinnbar, an Orlando-based business known for their oversized objects, and Nelson's Welding. The new chair cost over $40,000 to build. Upon its delivery, by flatbed truck, overpasses had to be avoided due to the size of the chair.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

==Looking Glass House==

On August 13, 1960, Rebecca Kirby (aka Lynn Arnold) moved "onto" the chair. A 10-by-10-foot cubicle was built and placed on the seat, furnished with a shower, bed, toilet, heater, air conditioner and balcony. Placed upon the chair by way of forklift, Kirby lived in the chair for 42 days. In the cubicle, she would watch TV, read books, and talk on the telephone, as well as dine, as her meals were delivered every day.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

Kirby would step outside onto the balcony every few hours to greet visitors who learned about her living situation due to newspapers advertising her as "Alice in the Looking Glass House". Visitors would be encouraged to guess how long she'd maintain her residency. Her then 14-month-old son, Richard, visited often, being placed in a dumb waiter and sent up to see her.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

After 42 days, Kirby "decided to return to earth," earning $1,500 for her stay.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

==Community reception==

The Chair has been received as a part of neighborhood life since its original installation. Anacostia, a neighborhood that has seen economic and cultural ups and downs prides itself on a landmark that withstands the community's evolution.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

The Chair is often used as a geographic marker for direction giving and holiday celebration; [[Santa Claus]] sits upon the chair during [[Christmas]]. When the Chair was reinstalled in 2006, community members surrounded the giant, clapping, yelling and photographing the new chair.&lt;ref name="Rebuilt"/&gt;

During the [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots]] the Chair was one of the few landmarks to go unscathed in a neighborhood heavily affected by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s death.&lt;ref name="Schwartzman"&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Schwartzman | title=The Return of the Big Chair: A Very Big Deal | work=Anacostia | publisher=The Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/25/AR2006042501682.html | accessdate= 1 Feb 2011 | date=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27414">{{Mythology}}
'''Comparative mythology''' is the comparison of [[myth]]s from different cultures in an attempt to identify shared themes and characteristics.&lt;ref name="Littleton 32"&gt;Littleton, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative mythology has served a variety of academic purposes. For example, scholars have used the relationships between different myths to trace the development of [[religion]]s and [[culture]]s, to propose common origins for myths from different cultures, and to support various [[psychology|psychological theories]].

==Comparativists versus particularists==
The [[anthropologist]] [[C. Scott Littleton]] defined comparative mythology as "the systematic comparison of myths and mythic themes drawn from a wide variety of cultures".&lt;ref name="Littleton 32" /&gt; By comparing different cultures' mythologies, scholars try to identify underlying similarities and/or to reconstruct a "protomythology" from which those mythologies developed.&lt;ref name="Littleton 32" /&gt; To an extent, all theories about mythology follow a comparative approach: as the scholar of religion Robert Segal notes, "by definition, all theorists [of myth] seek similarities among myths".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, "The Romantic Appeal of Joseph Campbell"&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars of mythology can be roughly divided into particularists, who emphasize the differences between myths, and comparativists, who emphasize the similarities. Particularists tend to "maintain that the similarities deciphered by comparativists are vague and superficial", while comparativists tend to "contend that the differences etched by particularists are trivial and incidental".&lt;ref&gt;Segal, ''Theorizing About Myth'', p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative approaches to mythology held great popularity among eighteenth- and nineteenth-century scholars. Many of these scholars believed that all myths showed signs of having evolved from athought which interpreted nearly all myths as poetic descriptions of the sun's behavior. According to this theory, these poetic descriptions had become distorted over time into seemingly diverse stories about gods and heroes.&lt;ref name="Leonard"&gt;Leonard&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern-day scholars lean more toward particularism, feeling suspicious of broad statements about myths.&lt;ref name="Northup 8"&gt;Northup, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; A recent exception is the historical approach followed in E.J. [[Michael Witzel]]'s reconstruction of many subsequent layers of older mythologies &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;E.J.M. Witzel, "The Origins of the World's Mythologies, New York : OUP 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==
Comparative mythologists come from various fields, including [[folklorist|folklore]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], and [[religious studies]], and they have used a variety of methods to compare myths. These are some important approaches to comparative mythology.

===Linguistic===
{{See also|Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion}}
Some scholars look at the linguistic relationships between the myths of different cultures. For example, the similarities between the names of gods in different cultures. One particularly successful example of this approach is the study of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] mythology. Scholars have found striking similarities between the mythological and religious terms used in different cultures of Europe and India. For example, the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] sky-god [[Zeus Pater]], the Roman sky-god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and the Indian (Vedic) sky-god [[Dyaus Pita|Dyauṣ Pitṛ]] have linguistically identical names.

This suggests that the Greeks, Romans, and Indians originated from a common ancestral culture, and that the names [[Zeus]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Dyaus]] and the Germanic [[Týr|Tiu]] (cf. English Tues-day) evolved from an older name, [[Dyēus|*Dyēus ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ter]], which referred to the sky-god or, to give a perfect English cognate, the ''day-father'' in a [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural===
{{See also|Lévi-Strauss#The structuralist approach to myth|Structuralist theory of mythology|Structural anthropology|Vladimir Propp}}
Some scholars look for underlying structures shared by different myths. The folklorist [[Vladimir Propp]] proposed that many [[Russian language|Russian]] [[fairy tales]] have a common plot structure, in which certain events happen in a predictable order.&lt;ref&gt;Propp, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] examined the structure of a myth in terms of the abstract relationships between its elements, rather than their order in the plot. In particular, Lévi-Strauss believed that the elements of a myth could be organized into binary oppositions (raw vs. cooked, nature vs. culture, etc.). He thought that the myth's purpose was to "mediate" these oppositions, thereby resolving basic tensions or contradictions found in human life or culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
{{See also|Oedipus complex|Analytical psychology|Jungian archetypes}}
Some scholars propose that myths from different cultures reveal the same, or similar, psychological forces at work in those cultures. Some [[Freudian]] thinkers have identified stories similar to the Greek story of [[Oedipus]] in many different cultures. They argue that these stories reflect the different expressions of the [[Oedipus complex]] in those cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson and Price-Williams, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Jungian]]s have identified images, themes, and patterns that appear in the myths of many different cultures. They believe that these similarities result from [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] present in the [[unconscious mind|unconscious levels]] of every person's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical and comparative===
A new approach, which is both historical and comparative, has recently been proposed by E.J. [[Michael Witzel]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He compares collections of mythologies of various cultures, from Iceland and Egypt to the Mayas, and reconstructs increasingly older levels, parallel to but not necessarily dependent on language families (see above). The most prominent common feature is a story line that extends from the creation of the world and of humans to their end. This feature is found in the northern mythologies of Eurasia and the Americas ("[[Laurasia]]") while it is missing in the southern mythologies of Subsaharan Africa, New Guinea and Australia ("[[Gondwana]]land"). The latter is the older one, going back to the dispersal of [[Homo sapiens]] out of Africa, some 65,000 years ago. Based on these two reconstructions he offers some suggestions about the tales of the (genetic) "[[African Eve]]". Close attention is paid to the largely parallel developments in archaeology, paleontology, genetics and linguistics. He also makes some suggestions about the persistence of these Stone Age myths in current religions.

===Phylogenetical===
It is speculated that like [[genes]], myths evolve by a process of descent with modification. The striking parallels between biological and mythological [[evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012a, 2013a, b&lt;/ref&gt; allow the use of [[computational statistics]] to infer evolutionary relatedness and to build the most likely [[phylogenetic tree]] for a mythological family. Mythological phylogenies constructed with [[mytheme]]s clearly support low horizontal transmissions (borrowings), historical (sometimes pre-historic) diffusions and [[punctuated evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012b, c; d'Huy 2013a, b, c, d&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the protoversion could be statistically reconstructed. Mythological phylogenies also are a potentially powerful way to test hypotheses about cross-cultural relationships among [[folklore|folktales]]&lt;ref&gt;Ross and al. 2013; Tehrani 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some mythological parallels==
[[File:Gustave Doré - The Holy Bible - Plate I, The Deluge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''The Deluge'', frontispiece to [[Gustave Doré]]'s illustrated edition of the Bible. Based on the story of [[Noah's Ark]], this engraving shows humans and a tiger doomed by the flood futilely attempting to save their children and cubs.]]
Comparative mythology has uncovered a number of parallels between the myths of different cultures, including some very widespread recurring themes and plot elements.&lt;ref&gt;van der Sluijs (2011) provides a detailed listing of parallels, see van der Sluijs, Marinus Anthony: ''Traditional Cosmologies. The Global Mythology of Cosmic Creation and Destruction''. 2011. London: All Round Publications ([http://www.mythopedia.info/traditionalcosmology-contents.pdf table of contents])&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some examples.

===Flood myth===
{{Main|Flood myth}}
Cultures around the world tell stories about a great flood.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, untitled, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the flood leaves only one survivor or group of survivors. For example, both the Babylonian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' and the [[Hebrew Bible]] tell of a global flood that wiped out humanity and of a man who saved the Earth's species by taking them aboard a boat.&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Similar stories of a single flood survivor appear in [[Hindu mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;Dimmitt and van Buitenen, pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Ancient Greek flood myths|Greek]], [[Norse mythology]] and [[Aztec mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;Urton, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===The creative sacrifice===
Many cultures have stories about divine figures whose death creates an essential part of reality.&lt;ref name="Eliade Cosmos 20"&gt;Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt; These myths seem especially common among cultures that grow crops, particularly [[tubers]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; One such myth from the [[Wemale people]] of [[Seram]] Island, [[Indonesia]], tells of a miraculously-conceived girl named [[Hainuwele]], whose murdered corpse sprouts into the people's staple food crops.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 104–5&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myth]] of [[Pangu]],&lt;ref&gt;Railsback, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[India]]n [[Vedic mythology|Vedic myth]] of [[Purusha]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rig Veda'' 10:90&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Norse mythology|Norse myth]] of [[Ymir]] all tell of a cosmic giant who is killed to create the world.&lt;ref name="Eliade Cosmos 20" /&gt;

===The dying god===
[[File:Dumuzi aux enfers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ancient Sumerian [[cylinder seal]] impression showing the god [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] being tortured in the [[Kur|Underworld]] by ''[[gallu|galla]]'' demons]]
{{Main|Life-death-rebirth deity}}
{{See also|Descent to the underworld|Jesus Christ and comparative mythology}}
Many myths feature a god who dies and often returns to life.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, ''passim''; Tortchinov, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Such myths are particularly common in [[Near East]]ern mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Masks of God'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist [[Sir James Frazer]] compared these "dying god" myths in his multi-volume work ''[[The Golden Bough]]''. The [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god [[Osiris]] and the [[Mesopotamian]] god [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] are examples of the "dying god", while the Greek myths of [[Adonis]] (though a mortal) has often been compared to Osiris and the myth of [[Dionysos]] also features death and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have noted similarities between polytheistic stories of "dying gods" and the [[Christian]] story of [[Jesus of Nazareth]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

===The structure of hero stories===
{{See also|Monomyth|Hero}}
A number of scholars have suggested that [[hero]] stories from various cultures have the same underlying structure. Other scholars, including [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan]] and, more recently, [[Joseph Campbell]], have also suggested that hero stories share a common structure.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 118–19&lt;/ref&gt; Some comparative mythologists look for similarities only among hero stories within a specific geographical or ethnic range. For example, the [[Austrians|Austrian]] scholar [[Johann Georg van Hahn]] tried to identify a common structure underlying "[[Aryan]]" hero stories.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, ''Hero Myths'', p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Campbell, propose theories about hero stories in general. According to Campbell's "[[monomyth]]" hypothesis, hero stories from around the world share a common plot structure.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its extremely comparative nature, the monomyth hypothesis is currently out of favor with some religious scholars such as Lesley Northup.&lt;ref name="Northup 8" /&gt;

===''Axis mundi''===
{{Main|Axis mundi}}
{{See also|Yggdrasil|Omphalos|Mount Meru}}
Many mythologies mention a place that sits at the center of the world and acts as a point of contact between different levels of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; This "''[[axis mundi]]''" is often marked by a sacred tree or other mythical object. For example, many myths describe a great tree or pillar joining heaven, earth, and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedic]] [[India]], ancient [[China]], [[Mayans]], [[Incas]] and the [[Germanic peoples]] all had myths featuring a "Cosmic Tree" whose branches reach heaven and whose roots reach hell.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titanomachy===
[[File:Cornelis Cornelisz. van Haarlem - The Fall of the Titans - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''[[The Fall of the Titans]]'' (1596-98) by [[Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem]]]]
{{See also|Titanomachy|Theomachy|Theogony}}
Many cultures have a [[creation myth]] in which a group of younger, more civilized gods conquers and/or struggles against a group of older gods who represent the forces of chaos.

In [[Hindu mythology]], the younger ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'' (gods) battle the older ''[[asura]]s'' (demons),&lt;ref name="Squire 47" /&gt; though both are born from the same father, [[Kashyap]], the grandson of Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manuscrypts.com/myth/2011/06/21/kashyapa-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Greek myth of the [[Titanomachy]], the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian gods]] defeat the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], an older and more primitive divine race, and establish cosmic order.&lt;ref name="Squire 47"&gt;Squire, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, especially pp. 64–87&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic gods]] of life and light struggle against the [[Fomorians]], ancient gods of death and darkness.&lt;ref name="Squire 47" /&gt;

This myth of the gods conquering demons - and order conquering chaos - is especially common in [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] mythologies. Some scholars suggest that the myth reflects the ancient Indo-Europeans' conquest of native peoples during their expansion over Europe and India.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, ''The Masks of God'', pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Squire, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''deus otiosus''===
{{See also|Deus otiosus|Sky father|Urmonotheismus}}
Many cultures believe in a celestial [[Supreme Being|supreme being]] who has cut off contact with humanity. Historian [[Mircea Eliade]] calls this supreme being a ''[[deus otiosus]]'' (an "idle god"),&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; although this term is also used more broadly, to refer to any god who doesn't interact regularly with humans. In many myths, the Supreme Being withdraws into the heavens after the creation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 93–98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baluba mythology]] features such a story, in which the supreme god withdraws from the earth, leaving man to search for him.&lt;ref&gt;Leslau, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the mythology of the [[Hereros]] tells of a sky god who has abandoned mankind to lesser divinities.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In the mythologies of highly complex cultures, the supreme being tends to disappear completely, replaced by a strongly [[polytheistic]] belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Myths, Dreams and Mysteries, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding myths===
[[File:Maria Saal Dom Grabrelief Romulus und Remus 27122013 774.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ancient Roman relief from the [[Maria Saal#Cathedral|Cathedral of Maria Saal]] showing the infant twins [[Romulus and Remus]] being suckled by a she-wolf]]
{{Main|Founding myth}}
{{See also|National myth}}
Many cultures have myths describing the origin of their customs, rituals, and identity. In fact, ancient and traditional societies have often justified their customs by claiming that their gods or mythical heroes established those customs.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Cosmos and History'', pp. 21–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to the myths of the [[Australia|Australian]] [[Karadjeri]], the mythical [[Bagadjimbiri]] brothers established all of the Karadjeri's customs, including the position in which they stand while urinating.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation of [[cultural heritage]] involves protection and restoration using "any methods that prove effective in keeping that property in as close to its original condition as possible for as long as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Walston, S.|year=1978|page=9 |title=The Preservation and Conservation of Aboriginal and Pacific Cultural Material in Australian Museums|journal= ICCM Bulletin |volume=4 |issue= 1|url=http://www.aiccm.org.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=319:the-preservation-and-conservation-of-aboriginal-and-pacific-cultural-material-in-australian-museums&amp;catid=79:1978-iccm-bulletin-volume-4-no-4&amp;Itemid=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation of cultural heritage is often associated with [[Collection (artwork)|art collections]] and [[museum]]s and involves collection care and management through tracking, examination, documentation, exhibition, storage, preventative conservation, and restoration.&lt;ref name = Szczepanowska2013&gt;Szczepanowska, Hanna M.. 2013. Conservation of cultural heritage: key principles and approaches. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415674744}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope has widened from art conservation, involving protection and care of artwork and architecture, to conservation of cultural heritage, also including protection and care of a broad set of other cultural and historical works. Conservation of cultural heritage can be described as a type of ethical [[stewardship]].

Conservation of cultural heritage applies simple ethical guidelines:
* Minimal intervention;
* Appropriate materials and reversible methods;
* Full documentation of all work undertaken.

Often there are compromises between preserving appearance, maintaining original design and material properties, and ability to reverse changes. Reversibility is now emphasized so as to reduce problems with future treatment, investigation, and use.

In order for conservators to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy and apply their professional expertise accordingly, they must take into account views of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]], the [[Values (heritage)|values]] and [[Preservation of meaning|meaning]] of the work, and the physical needs of the material.

Cesare Brandi in his ''Theory of Restoration'', describes restoration as "the methodological moment in which the work of art is appreciated in its material form and in its historical and aesthetic duality, with a view to transmitting it to the future".&lt;ref&gt;[Cesare Brandi, ''Teoria del restauro''; Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1963: reprint, Turin: G. Einaudi, 1977]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Key dates===
{{main article|List of dates in the history of art conservation}}

Some consider the tradition of conservation of cultural heritage in Europe to have begun in 1565 with the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes]], but more ancient examples include the work of [[Cassiodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pergoli Campanelli|first=Alessandro|title=Cassiodoro alle origini dell'idea di restauro|year=2013|publisher=Jaca book|location=Milano|isbn=978-88-16-41207-1|page=140|url=https://www.academia.edu/3522730/Cassiodoro_alle_origini_dellidea_di_restauro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brief history===
[[File:Achter de schermen van het Rijksmuseum Weeknummer 50-11 - Open Beelden - 30641.ogv|thumb|An early video showing some activities in a conservation laboratory at the [[Rijksmuseum]]]]
[[File:Cloître Saint-Trophime Arles Conservation.jpg|thumb|A temporary windowed partition along restoration work area in the cloister of the [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles]]]]
The care of cultural heritage has a long history, one that was primarily aimed at fixing and mending objects for their continued use and aesthetic enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;Pye, E, 2001. Caring for the Past: Issues in Conservation for Archaeology and Museums. London: James and James&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early 20th century, artists were normally the ones called upon to repair damaged artworks. During the 19th century, however, the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as [[Michael Faraday]] began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art. [[Louis Pasteur]] carried out scientific analysis on paint as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. 2005. p. 41. [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11413&amp;page=41 “Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present”] in (Sackler NAS Colloquium) Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; However, perhaps the first organized attempt to apply a theoretical framework to the conservation of cultural heritage came with the founding in the [[United Kingdom]] of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in 1877. The society was founded by [[William Morris]] and [[Philip Webb]], both of whom were deeply influenced by the writings of [[John Ruskin]]. During the same period, a French movement with similar aims was being developed under the direction of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], an architect and theorist, famous for his restorations of medieval buildings.

[[File:Bixi stele (wrapped), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4607.JPG|thumb|Since 1998, [[Harvard University]] wraps some of the valuable statues on its campus, such as this "[[Harvard Bixi|Chinese stele]]", with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from erosion caused by [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]", Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Conservation of cultural heritage as a distinct field of study initially developed in Germany, where in 1888 [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became the first [[chemist]] to be employed by a [[Museum]], the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin ([[Royal Museum (Berlin)|Royal Museums of Berlin]]). He not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach by publishing a Handbook of Conservation in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gilberg, Mark.|year=1987|title= Friedrich Rathgen: The Father of Modern Archaeological Conservation|journal= Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=26|issue= 2|pages=105–120 |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/jaic/articles/jaic26-02-004_2.html|doi=10.2307/3179459}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. In the United Kingdom, pioneering research into painting materials and conservation, ceramics, and stone conservation was conducted by [[Arthur Pillans Laurie]], academic chemist and Principal of [[Heriot-Watt University]] from 1900. Laurie's interests were fostered by [[William Holman Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |title=Brief biography of Professor AP Laurie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714201324/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 the chemist [[Dr Harold Plenderleith]] began to work at the [[British Museum]] with Dr. Alexander Scott in the recently created Research Laboratory, although he was actually employed by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] in the early years. Plenderleith's appointment may be said to have given birth to the conservation ''profession'' in the UK, although there had been craftsmen in many museums and in the commercial art world for generations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_science/history.aspx History]. British Museum (2012-06-14). Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; This department was created by the museum to address the deteriorating condition of objects in the collection, damages which were a result of their being stored in the [[London Underground]] tunnels during the [[First World War]]. The creation of this department moved the focus for the development of conservation theory and practice from Germany to Britain, and made the latter a prime force in this fledgling field. In 1956 Plenderleith wrote a significant handbook called The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art, which supplanted Rathgen's earlier tome and set new standards for the development of art and [[Conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]].

In the [[United States]], the development of conservation of cultural heritage can be traced to the [[Fogg Art Museum]], and Edward Waldo Forbes, its director from 1909 to 1944. He encouraged technical investigation, and was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the first technical journal, Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts, published by the Fogg from 1932 to 1942. Importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists. [[Rutherford John Gettens]] was the first of usch in the US to be permanently employed by an art museum. He worked with [[George L. Stout]], the founder and first editor of Technical Studies. Gettens and Stout co-authored Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia in 1942, reprinted in 1966. This compendium is still cited regularly. Only a few dates and descriptions in Gettens' and Stout's book are now outdated.&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill. "Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present". The publication exists in two editions. The earlier one is "Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques on Conservation and Analysis" and was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2003. The later edition of the publication is "Arthur M. Sackler Colloquia: Scientific Examination of Art: Modern Techniques in Conservation and Analysis". It was published by the National Academies Press in 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

George T. Oliver, of [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers Art Restoration and Art Conservation-Boston]]
(Est. 1850 in New York City) invented the vacuum hot table for [[lining of paintings|relining]] paintings in 1920s; he filed a patent for the table in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Patent# 2,073,802 [http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PALL&amp;s1=Oliver-George-T.INNM.&amp;OS=IN/Oliver-George-T&amp;RS=IN/Oliver-George-T U.S. "Art of Oil Painting Restoration"], March 16, 1937. Patft1.uspto.gov. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's prototype table, which he designed and constructed, is still in operation. Oliver Brothers is believed to be the first and the oldest continuously operating art restoration company in the United States.

The focus of conservation development then accelerated in Britain and America, and it was in Britain that the first International Conservation Organisations developed. [[International Institute for Conservation|The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)]] was incorporated under British law in 1950 as "a permanent organization to co-ordinate and improve the knowledge, methods, and working standards needed to protect and preserve precious materials of all kinds."&lt;ref name="Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003"/&gt; The rapid growth of conservation professional organizations, publications, journals, newsletters, both internationally and in localities, has spearheaded the development of the conservation profession, both practically and theoretically. Art historians and theorists such as [[Cesare Brandi]] have also played a significant role in developing conservation science theory. In recent years ethical concerns have been at the forefront of developments in conservation. Most significantly has been the idea of [[preventive conservation]]. This concept is based in part on the pioneering work by [[Garry Thomson]] [[CBE]], and his book the Museum Environment, first published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Museum Environment (2nd Edition), 1986, by Garry Thomson CBE {{ISBN|978-0-7506-2041-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson was associated with the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London; it was here that he established a set of guidelines or environmental controls for the best conditions in which objects could be stored and displayed within the museum environment. Although his exact guidelines are no longer rigidly followed, they did inspire this field of conservation.

==Ethics==
The conservator's work is guided by ethical standards. These take the form of [[applied ethics]]. Ethical standards have been established across the world, and national and international ethical guidelines have been written. One such example is:

* [[American Institute for Conservation]] Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=858 AIC – Code of Ethics]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation OnLine (CoOL). cool.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; including examples of codes of ethics and guidelines for professional conduct in conservation and allied fields; and charters and treaties pertaining to ethical issues involving the preservation of cultural property.

As well as standards of practice conservators deal with wider ethical concerns, such as the debates as to whether all art is worth preserving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weil|first=Stephen E.|date=October 1989|title=Too much Art?|journal=[[ArtNews]]|page=232|issn=0004-3273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caring for cultural heritage==

===Collections care===
{{Main article|Collections care}}
Many cultural works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to [[light|visible light]] and [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]]. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels. For example, [[watercolour painting|watercolour paintings]] usually require shielding from sunlight to prevent fading of [[pigment]]s.

Collections care is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.

[[Image:Preventive Conservation - Serra da Capivara.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Work of preventive conservation in a rock wall with prehistoric paintings at the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]]. The work consists of filling the cracks to prevent the fragmentation of the wall.]]

===Interventive conservation===
[[File:FurnitureConservation2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Furniture conservation – Re-glueing loose element of solid nut marriage chest (probably Italy, 19th century)]]
A principal aim of a cultural conservator is to reduce the rate of deterioration of an object. Both non-interventive and interventive methodologies may be employed in pursuit of this goal. Interventive conservation refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object. Interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons, including aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for structural integrity, or cultural requirements for intangible continuity. Examples of interventive treatments include the removal of discolored varnish from a painting, the application of wax to a sculpture, and the washing and rebinding of a book. Ethical standards within the field require that the conservator fully justify interventive actions and carry out documentation before, during, and after the treatment.

One of the guiding principles of conservation of cultural heritage has traditionally been the idea of reversibility, that all interventions with the object should be fully reversible and that the object should be able to be returned to the state in which it was prior to the conservator's intervention. Although this concept remains a guiding principle of the profession, it has been widely critiqued within the conservation profession&lt;ref&gt;[[William Andrew Oddy|Andrew Oddy]] and Sara Carroll (eds). 1999. Reversibility – Does it Exist? British Museum Occasional Paper Number 135. London: British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now considered by many to be "a fuzzy concept."&lt;ref&gt;p. 185. Muñoz-Viñas, Salvador. 2005. Contemporary Theory of Conservation. London: Elsevier/Butterworth Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important principle of conservation is that all alterations should be well documented and should be clearly distinguishable from the original object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom-cc.icom.museum/Start/ ICOM-CC] International Council of Museums Committee for Conservation]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a highly publicized interventive conservation effort would be the conservation work conducted on the [[restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes|Sistine Chapel]].

==Conservation laboratories==
[[Image:The Lunder Conservation Center Laboratory.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Lunder Conservation Center. Conservation staff for both the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] are visible to the public through floor-to-ceiling glass walls that allow visitors to see firsthand all the techniques that [[Conservator (museum)|conservators]] use to examine, treat and preserve artworks within a functioning conservation Laboratory.]]
Conservators routinely use chemical and scientific analysis for the examination and treatment of cultural works. The modern conservation laboratory uses equipment such as [[microscope]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, and various [[x-ray]] regime instruments to better understand objects and their components. The data thus collected helps in deciding the conservation treatments to be provided to the object.

==Country by country look==

===United States===
Heritage Preservation, in partnership with the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]], a U.S. federal agency, produced The Heritage Health Index. The results of this work was the report [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/summary.html A Public Trust at Risk: The Heritage Health Index Report on the State of America's Collections], which was published in December 2005 and concluded that immediate action is needed to prevent the loss of 190 million artifacts that are in need of conservation treatment. The report made four recommendations:
* Institutions must give priority to providing safe conditions for the collections they hold in trust.
* Every collecting institution must develop an emergency plan to protect its collections and train staff to carry it out.
* Every institution must assign responsibility for caring for collections to members of its staff.
* Individuals at all levels of government and in the private sector must assume responsibility for providing the support that will allow these collections to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/ Heritage Health Index]. Heritagepreservation.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Victoria and Albert conservation.jpg|thumb|Conservation in Progress note, [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (2014)]]
In October 2006, the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], a governmental department, authored a document: "Understanding the Future: Priorities for England's Museums".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/consultations/cons_uf_prioritiesforenglandsmuseums.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. Department for Culture, Media and Sport. culture.gov.uk. October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This document was based on several years of consultation aimed to lay out the government's priorities for museums in the 21st century.

The document listed the following as priorities for the next decade:

# Museums will fulfil their potential as learning resources (pp 7–10).
#* Museums will be embedded into the delivery of education in every school in the country.
#* Understanding of the effectiveness of museum education will be improved further and best practice built into education programmes.
#* The value of museums' collections as a research resource will be well understood and better links built between the academic community and museums.
# Museums will embrace their role in fostering, exploring, celebrating and questioning the identities of diverse communities (pp 11–14).
#* The sector needs to work with partners in academia and beyond to create an intellectual framework supporting museums' capacity to tackle issues of identity.
#* The museum sector must continue to develop improved practical techniques for engaging communities of all sorts.
# Museums' collections will be more dynamic and better used (pp 15–18).
#* Government and the sector will find new ways to encourage museums to collect actively and strategically, especially the record of contemporary society.
#* The sector will develop new collaborative approaches to sharing and developing collections and related expertise.
# Museums' workforces will be dynamic, highly skilled and representative (pp 17–22).
#* Museums' governing bodies and workforces will be representative of the communities they serve.
#* Find more varied ways for a broader range of skills to come into museums.
#* Improve continuing professional development.
# Museums will work more closely with each other and partners outside the sector (pp 23–26).
#* A consistent evidence base of the contribution of all kinds of museums to the full range of public service agendas will be developed.
#* There will be deeper and longer lasting partnerships between the national museums and a broader range of regional partners.
#* Museums' international roles will be strengthened to improve museum programmes in this country and Britain's image, reputation and relationships abroad.

The conservation profession response to this report was on the whole less than favourable, the [[Institute of Conservation]] (ICON) published their response under the title "A Failure of Vision".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/images/stories/icon_understanding_the_future.pdf Understanding the Future: Priorities for England’s Museums]. The Institute of Conservation. icon.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; It had the following to say:

{{quote| "No sector can look with confidence to the future if its key asset is worked harder and harder across an ever broadening range of objectives while the inputs required to sustain it are neglected." }}

{{quote|"It is of major concern to us that the only part of this section which makes any acknowledgement of the need for greater resourcing is the part which refers to acquisitions. The original consultation paper made quite extensive reference to the importance of collections, the role of new technologies, and cultural property issues, but this appears to have been whittled away in the present document." }}

Concluding: {{quote| "When asked by the Commons Culture Media and Sport elect Committee CMS committee what he would like to see as a priority in the DCMS document arising from the 'Understanding the Future' consultation, Mr MacGregor responded 'I would like to see added there the need to conserve and research the collections, so that the collections can really play the role across the whole of the United Kingdom that they should.'
So would we."}}

Further to this the ICON website summary report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icon.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=400&amp;Itemid=15 The Future of Museums: A Failure of Vision]. Icon.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following specific recommendations:

* A national survey to find out what the public want from museums, what motivates them to visit them and what makes for a rewarding visit.
* A review of survey results and prioritisation of the various intrinsic, instrumental and institutional values to provide a clear basis for a 10-year strategy
* HR consultants to be brought in from the commercial sector to review recruitment, career development and working practices in the national and regional museums.
* A commitment to examine the potential for using Museum Accreditation as a more effective driver for improving recruitment, diversity, and career development across the sector.
* DCMS to take full account of the eventual findings of the current Commons Select Committee enquiry into Care of Collections in the final version of this document
* The adoption of those recommendations of the recent House of Lords enquiry into [[Heritage Science#Development of ‘Heritage Science’|Science and Heritage]] which have a potential impact on the future of museums.

In November 2008, the UK-based [[think tank]] [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos]] published an influential pamphlet entitled ''It's a material world: caring for the public realm'',&lt;ref&gt;
Holden, John. and Samuel Jones. 2008. [http://demos.co.uk/files/Material%20World%20-%20web.pdf It's A Material World: Caring for the public realm]. London: Demos.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they argue for integrating the public directly into efforts to conserve material culture, particularly that which is in the public, their argument, as stated on page 16, demonstrates their belief that society can benefit from conservation as a paradigm as well as a profession:

{{quote|"conservators provide a paradigm not just for fixing things when they are broken, but for a wider social ethos of care, where we individually and collectively take responsibility and action"}}

==Training==
{{main article|Art conservation training}}
Training in conservation of cultural heritage for many years took the form of an [[apprenticeship]], whereby an apprentice slowly developed the necessary skills to undertake their job. For some specializations within conservation this is still the case. However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation of cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="AIC training" &gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/training AIC – Becoming a Conservator]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an [[intern]].

Conservation of cultural heritage is an [[interdisciplinary]] field as conservators have backgrounds in the [[fine arts]], sciences (including [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[materials science]]), and closely related disciplines, such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[studio art]], and [[anthropology]]. They also have design, fabrication, artistic, and other special skills necessary for the practical application of that knowledge.

Within the various schools that teach conservation of cultural heritage, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself. This is acknowledged by the [[American Institute for Conservation]] who advise "Specific admission requirements differ and potential candidates are encouraged to contact the programs directly for details on prerequisites, application procedures, and program curriculum".&lt;ref name="AIC training" /&gt;

In France, training for heritage conservation is taught by the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). 

==Associations and professional organizations==
{{main article|Conservation associations and professional organizations}}
Societies devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in Britain to protect the built heritage, this society continues to be active today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spab.org.uk/html/what-is-spab/history-of-the-spab/ History of the SPAB]. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The built heritage was at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the [[United States]]. [[Preservation Virginia]], founded in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apva.org/ APVA Preservation Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613122322/http://www.apva.org/ |date=2008-06-13 }}. Apva.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field, and within their area of specialization.

These organizations exist to "support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservation-us.org/about About AIC – Overview]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

This involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators, allied professionals, and the public.

'''Design leadership''' is a concept complementary to [[design management]]. In practice, design managers within companies often operate in the field of design leadership and design leaders in the field of design management. However, the two terms are not interchangeable, they are interdependent. {{ref|TR|1|}} In essence, and at the highest level, design leadership helps to define the future and design management provides key tools for getting there. Both are critically important to business, government and society, and both are necessary in order to maximise value from design activity and investment.

Design leadership can be described as leadership that generates innovative design solutions. Turner{{ref|TR|1|}} defines design leadership by adding three additional aspects for design leadership,
*the difference in leading through design,
*the sustaining design leadership over time and
*the gaining of acknowledgment for achievements through design.

Turner{{ref label|TR|1|a}} separates the core responsibilities of design leadership in following six activities:
*envisionising of the future
*manifesting strategic intent
*directing design investment
*managing corporate reputation
*creating and nurturing an environment of [[innovation]]
*training for design leadership

The '''Freer Gallery of Art''' and the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]] form the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s national museums of [[Culture of Asia|Asian]] art in the United States. The Freer and Sackler galleries house the largest Asian art research library in the country and contain [[art]] from [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Islamic world]], the [[ancient Near East]], and [[ancient Egypt]], as well as a significant collection of [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. The gallery is located on the south side of the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], contiguous with the Sackler Gallery. The museum is open 364 days a year (being closed on [[Christmas]]), and is administered by a single staff with the Sackler Gallery. The galleries are among the [[List of most visited art museums in the world|most visited art museums in the world]].

The Freer houses over 26,000 objects spanning 6,000 years of history from the [[Neolithic]] to [[Modern art|modern]] eras. The collections include ancient Egyptian stone sculpture and wooden objects, ancient Near Eastern ceramics and metalware, [[Chinese painting]]s and [[Chinese ceramics|ceramics]], [[Korean pottery and porcelain]], Japanese [[folding screen]]s, Persian [[manuscript]]s, and [[Buddhist art|Buddhist sculpture]]. In addition to Asian art, the Freer also contains the famous ''[[The Peacock Room|Harmony in Blue and Gold: The Peacock Room]]'' (better known as ''The Peacock Room'') by American artist [[James McNeill Whistler]] which serves as the centerpiece to the Freer's [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] collection.

The museum offers free tours to the public and presents a full schedule events for the public including films, lectures, symposia, concerts, performances, and discussions. Over 11,000 objects from the Freer|Sackler collections are  fully searchable and available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/ |title=Collections &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Freer was also featured in the [[Google Art Project]], which offers online viewers close-up views of selected items from the Freer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.googleartproject.com/collection/freer-gallery-of-art-smithsonian/ |title=Freer&amp;#124;Sackler: The Smithsonian's Museums of Asian Art - Google Cultural Institute |publisher=Googleartproject.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Freer Gallery 1.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to the Freer Gallery of Art]]

===Founding===
The gallery was founded by [[Detroit]] railroad-car manufacturer and self-taught connoisseur [[Charles Lang Freer]]. He owned the largest collection of works by American artist James McNeill Whistler (1834-1903) and became a patron and friend of the famously irascible artist. Whistler made it very clear to Freer that if he helped him to build the premier Whistler collection, then that collection would have to be displayed in a city where tourists went.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Merrill, a former curator of American art at the Freer Gallery, editor of With Kindest Regards: The Correspondence of Charles Lang Freer and James McNeill Whistler, and co-author of Freer: A Legacy of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Charles Moore, a former aide to Michigan United States Senator, James McMillin and the chairman of the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]], moved from Washington, D.C., to Detroit. Moore became friends with Freer, who was director of the [[Michigan Car Company]], and persuaded Freer to permanently exhibit his 8,000-piece collection of Oriental art in Washington, D.C. Before then, Freer informally proposed to President Theodore Roosevelt that he give to the nation his art collection, funds to construct a building, and an endowment fund to provide for the study and acquisition of "very fine examples of Oriental, Egyptian, and Near Eastern fine arts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/history/freer-gallery-art Smithsonian Institution Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

Travelers impressed by the beauty of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., can thank three Detroiters for their role in creating it. 
The mall was the brainchild of James McMillan, a Michigan United States senator and former business competitor to Freer. Charles Freer for his enormous donation to the Smithsonian, and Moore for carrying out the Washington mall concept. The Freer gift was accepted on behalf of the government by the Smithsonian Board of Regents in 1906. Freer's will, however, contained certain requirements that only objects from the permanent collection could be exhibited in the gallery, and that none of the art could be exhibited elsewhere. Freer felt strongly that all of the museum's holding should be readily accessible to scholars at all times.  In addition, Freer's bequest to the Smithsonian came with the proviso that he would execute full curatorial control over the collection until his death.  The Smithsonian initially hesitated at the requirements but the intercession of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] allowed for the project to proceed. The Freer Gallery possesses an autographed letter from Roosevelt inviting Freer to visit him at the White House, reflecting the personal interest Roosevelt showed in the development of the museum. Freer died before the art gallery was completed.

===Construction and architecture===
Construction of the gallery began in 1916 and was completed in 1921, after a delay due to World War I.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Institution Archives"&gt;Smithsonian Institution Archives&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 1923, the Freer Gallery of Art was opened to the public. Designed by American architect and landscape planner [[Charles A. Platt]], the Freer is an Italian Renaissance-style building inspired by Freer's visits to palazzos in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Caemmerer, H. Paul. "Charles Moore and the Plan of Washington." ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society.'' Vol. 46/47 (1944/1945): 237-258, 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is reported that in a meeting with architect Charles Platt at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, Freer jotted down his ideas for a classical, well-proportioned building on a napkin.&lt;ref name="asia.si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/about/charleslangfreer.asp |title=Charles Lang Freer &amp;#124; About Us &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery is constructed primarily of granite: the exterior of the Freer is pink granite quarried in Milford, Massachusetts, the courtyard has a carnelian granite fountain and walls of unpolished Tennessee white marble. The gallery's interior walls are Indiana limestone, and the floors are polished Tennessee marble.

A major renovation of the building, which culminated in a grand reopening in 1993, greatly expanded storage and exhibition space by connecting the Freer and the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]]. With the addition of the connecting gallery, the Freer has 39,039 square feet of public space. The original structure designed by Platt remains intact, including the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Auditorium which serves as the venue for many public programs.

=== Current ===
After opening in 1923, the Freer served as the Smithsonian's first museum dedicated to the fine arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/about/freer.asp |title=The Freer Gallery of Art &amp;#124; About Us &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Freer was also the first Smithsonian museum created from a private collector's bequest.  Through the years, the collections have grown through gifts and purchases to nearly triple the size of Freer's original donation: nearly 18,000 works of Asian art have been added since Freer's death in 1919.

The Freer is now connected by an underground exhibition space to the neighboring [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]]. Although their collections are stored and exhibited separately, the two museums share a director, administration, and staff. The Freer closed for extensive renovations in January 2016 and reopened in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freer Gallery of Art To Reopen After Nearly Two Years|url=https://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/freer-gallery-art-reopen-after-nearly-two-years|website=newsdesk.si.edu|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=4 March 2018|language=en|date=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Because one of the main conditions of [[Charles Lang Freer]] donation was that only items from his collection may be exhibited at the gallery, the Freer does not borrow from or lend out items to other institutions.  However, due to the 26,000 objects in the gallery's collections, they are still able to present exhibitions internationally recognized for both depth and quality.

The Freer also has a number rotating/temporary exhibits.

==American art at the Freer==
[[File:The Peacock Room (2).jpg|thumb|''The Peacock Room'' by Whistler]]
Freer began collecting American art in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="asia.si.edu"/&gt; In 1890, after meeting [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], an American artist influenced by Japanese prints and Chinese ceramics, Freer began to expand his collections to include Asian art. He maintained his interest in American art, however, amassing a collection of over 1,300 works by Whistler, which is considered the world's finest.

One of the most well-known exhibits at the Freer is ''[[The Peacock Room]]'', an opulent London dining room painted by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] in 1876–77. The room was designed for British shipping magnate [[Frederick Richards Leyland|F.R. Leyland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/exhibitions/online/peacock/default.htm |title=A Closer Look - James McNeill Whistler - Peacock Room |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is lavishly decorated with green and gold peacock motifs. Purchased by Freer in 1904 and installed in the Freer Gallery after his death, ''The Peacock Room'' is on permanent display.

The Freer also has works by [[Thomas Dewing]] (1851–1938), [[Dwight Tryon]] (1849–1925), [[Abbott Handerson Thayer]] (1849–1921), [[Childe Hassam]] (1859–1935), [[Winslow Homer]] (1836–1910), [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] (1848–1907), [[Willard Metcalf]] (1858–1925), [[John Singer Sargent]] (1856–1925), and [[John Twachtman]] (1853–1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/american.asp |title=Freer and Sackler Galleries &amp;#124; Collections |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==F|S Online==

The Freer|Sackler provides several online resources for exploring the art and culture of Asia and its American art collections. Besides the collections objects viewable online, thousands of photographs, archeological diaries, maps, and archaeological squeezes (impressions of carvings) have been digitized and are used by researchers from around the world.

==F|S Archives and Library==
[[File:Dish from 9th century Iraq.jpg|thumb|This [[earthenware]] dish from 9th century [[Abbasid]] [[Iraq]] is one of the many artifacts exhibited at the Freer Gallery.]]

The Freer Sackler Archives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/research/archives.asp|title=Archives - Freer-Sackler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; houses over 120 important manuscripts collections relevant to the study of America's encounter with Asian art and culture.  The core collection is the personal papers of gallery founder Charles Lang Freer, which includes his purchase records, diaries, and personal correspondence with public figures such as artists, dealers and collectors.  Freer's extensive correspondence with [[James McNeill Whistler]] forms one of the largest sources of primary documents about the American artist.  Other significant collections in the Archives includes the papers (notebooks, letters, photography, squeezes) and personal objects of the German archaeologist [[Ernst Herzfeld]] (1879–1946), documenting his research at [[Samarra]], [[Persepolis]] and [[Pasargadae]]. The papers of [[Carl Whiting Bishop]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siarchives&amp;uri=full=3100001~!283455~!0#focus|title=The Carl Whiting Bishop Collection|first=Carl Whiting|last=Bishop|publisher=|via=siris-archives.si.edu Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dwight William Tryon]], [[Myron Bement Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siarchives&amp;uri=full=3100001~!283688~!0|title=Myron Bement Smith Collection|first=Myron Bement|last=Smith|publisher=|via=siris-archives.si.edu Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin March]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/archives/finding_aids/March.html|title=Benjamin March - A Finding Aid to His Papers at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M.

Highlights of photographic holdings include the Henry and Nancy Rosin Collection of 19th century photography of Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!235035!0|title=Henry and Nancy Rosin Collection of Early Photography of Japan|first1=Henry D.|last1=Rosin|first2=Benjamin Smith|last2=Lyman|first3=Hikoma|last3=Ueno|first4=Felice|last4=Beato|first5=Nancy|last5=Rosin|first6=Raimund|last6=Stillfried|publisher=|via=siris-archives.si.edu Library Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1903-1904 photographs of the Chinese [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], and photographs of Iran by [[Antoin Sevruguin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asia.si.edu/research/archivesHighlights.asp |title=Archives: Highlights &amp;#124; Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freer|Sackler Library is the largest Asian art research library in the United States. Open to the public five days a week (except federal holidays) without appointment, the library collection consists of more than 86,000 volumes, including nearly 2,000 rare books. Half the volumes are written and catalogued in Asian languages.
Originating from the collection of four thousand monographs, periodical issues, offprints, and sales catalogues that Charles Lang Freer donated to the Smithsonian Institution as part of his gift to the nation, the F|S Library maintains the highest standards for collecting materials an active program of purchases, gifts, and exchanges.

In July 1987 the library moved to its new home in the [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]]. Today it supports activities of both museums, such as collection development, exhibition planning, publications, and other scholarly and educational projects. Its published and unpublished resources—in the fields of Asian art and archaeology, conservation, painting, sculpture, architecture, drawings, prints, manuscripts, books, and photography—are available to museum staff, outside researchers, and the visiting public.

==Public programs==
The Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Auditorium, named after American financier and publisher [[Eugene Meyer (financier)|Eugene Meyer]]  and journalist/social activist [[Agnes E. Meyer]], is located in the Freer and provides a venue for a broad variety of free public programs.  These programs include concerts of music and dance, lectures, chamber music, and dramatic presentations. It is also known for its film series, highlighting a wide variety of Asian cultures (including a Korean Film Festival and Iranian Film Festival).

Most recently, the museums began the series Asia After Dark, opening up the space for musicians, dancing, Asian cuisine, and other after-work adventures. The Freer and Sackler's 'We Stand With Japan' in 2011 hosted [[Steve Aoki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/freersackler/5727778640/in/pool-asiaafterdark/ |title=Asia After Dark - Freer Gallery of Art - We Stand with Japan &amp;#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free drop-in tours are available daily and guide visitors through both featured exhibitions and specific themes in both the Freer and Sackler galleries, and a wide range of public lectures provide in-depth experiences with prominent artists and scholars.

==Conservation==
Care of the collections began before the museum came into existence as Charles Lang Freer, the founder of the Freer Gallery of Art, hired Japanese painting restorers to care for his works and to prepare them for their eventual home as part of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1932, the Freer Gallery of Art hired a full-time Japanese restorer and established what was to become the East Asian Painting Conservation Studio. This facility remains one of the few in the United States that specializes in the conservation of Asian paintings.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian Institution Archives"/&gt; The Technical Laboratory was established in 1951 when chemist Rutherford J. Gettens moved from the [[Fogg Museum]] at [[Harvard University]] to the Freer. The laboratory was the first Smithsonian facility devoted to the use of scientific methods for the study of works of art. Over the years, the work of the Technical Laboratory expanded to include objects, paper, and exhibits conservation. The Technical Laboratory and the East Asian Painting Conservation Studio merged in 1990 to create the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research for both the Freer and Sackler Galleries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asia.si.edu/visitor/conservation.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202110608/http://www.asia.si.edu/visitor/conservation.htm |date=February 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservators in the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research care for and treat works of art in the collection and prepare them for exhibition. The department works to ensure long-term preservation and storage, safe handling, exhibition, and transport of artworks in the permanent collection, as well as those on loan. In addition, conservators are responsible for conducting technical examinations of objects already in the collection and those under consideration for acquisition. They also collaborate frequently with the department's scientists on technical and applied research. Training and professional outreach efforts are an integral part of the department's commitment to educating future conservators, museum professionals, and the public about conservation.

==Scholarship==
The Freer has had a long tradition in serving as a center for inquiry and advanced scholarship about Asia.  The Freer not only presents a lectures and symposia to the public, it also copublishes the ''Ars Orientalis'' with the [[University of Michigan]] Department of History of Art. ''Ars Orientalis'' is a peer-reviewed annual volume of scholarly articles and occasional reviews of books on the art and archaeology of Asia, the ancient Near East, and the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/research/ArsOrientalis.asp |title=Ars Orientalis Freer and Sackler Galleries |publisher=Asia.si.edu |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freer and Sackler, along with the Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan, presents the Shimada Prize for distinguished scholarship in the history of East Asian art.  The award was established in 1992 in honor of Professor Shimada Shujiro, by the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and by The Metropolitan Center for Far Eastern Art Studies in Kyoto, Japan.  Several fellowships are also available to support graduate students and visiting scholars, including the [[Andrew W. Mellon]] Fellowship, Anne Van Biema Fellowship (Japanese Visual Arts), Iran Heritage Foundation (IHF) Fellowship (Persian art), Lunder Fellowship, J. S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42620">The following is '''a list of unproduced Guillermo del Toro projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his decades-long career, Mexican film director [[Guillermo del Toro]] has worked on a number of projects that never progressed beyond the pre-production stage. Some of these projects fell into [[development hell]] and are presumably canceled.

==1990s==

===''The Sandkings''===
Around 1995, before directing ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'', del Toro approached [[George R. R. Martin]] with the intent to make a film adaptation of his famous novelette ''[[Sandkings (novelette)|Sandkings]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/guillermo-del-toro-breaking-bad-game-of-thrones-interview/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121042914/http://collider.com/guillermo-del-toro-breaking-bad-game-of-thrones-interview/ |archivedate=2016-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project was quickly scrapped after the novel was adapted into the first episode of the television series ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''.

===''Domu: A Child's Dream''===
In the late 1990s, del Toro expressed interest in directing a [[Domu: A Child's Dream#Film adaptation|live-action film adaptation]] of [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s ''[[Domu: A Child's Dream]]''. In 2002, after the success of ''[[Blade II]]'', del Toro said that he tried to make the film in the following years, but his efforts were hamstrung by international legalities. &lt;blockquote&gt;"Goddamn it, we haven't even got the rights. We've been negotiating the rights for four years, which goes to prove Japanese lawyers are even more complex than American lawyers. The moment we have the rights I would go ahead and write it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-03-27/guillermo-del-toro-on-domu |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220150426/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-03-27/guillermo-del-toro-on-domu |archivedate=2016-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2000s==

===''Blade 3''===
In approximately 2003, [[New Line Cinema]] was in talks with del Toro to keep him on as director for ''Blade 3'', due his directing work on ''[[Blade II]]. However, D''el Toro turned down the offer in order to direct ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/hitfix/david-goyer-directing-blade-3-was-the-most-painful-thing-ive-ever-been-through/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119182045/http://uproxx.com/hitfix/david-goyer-directing-blade-3-was-the-most-painful-thing-ive-ever-been-through/ |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blade 3'' film ended up becoming the critically snubbed ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', directed by screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]], and released in 2004.

===''The Wind in the Willows''===
In 2003, del Toro reported that he was working with [[The Walt Disney Company]] on an [[The Wind in the Willows#Film and television|animated film adaptation]] of [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''. The film would have been animated using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI animation]], but the project was abandoned following many delays.&lt;ref&gt;http://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/more-related-content/?relatedmovieid=15120/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120309/http://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/more-related-content/?relatedmovieid=15120%2F |date=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''===
In 2003, del Toro was in talks to direct ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', the third installment of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] based on [[J. K. Rowlings]]' [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|novel of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2429331/guillermo-game-for-harry-potter/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119031251/http://www.mtv.com/news/2429331/guillermo-game-for-harry-potter/ |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he chose instead to direct ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]'', and ''The Prisoner of Azkaban'' was directed by [[Alfonso Cuarón]].

===''I Am Legend''===
On September 13, 2005, [[Warner Bros.]] approached del Toro and asked him to direct the third film adaptation of [[Richard Matheson]]'s novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/features/helmer-takes-on-legend-for-wb-1117929062/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120084856/http://variety.com/2005/film/features/helmer-takes-on-legend-for-wb-1117929062/ |archivedate=2016-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, del Toro chose to direct ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'' instead. ''I Am Legend'' was finally released in 2007, directed by [[Francis Lawrence]].

===''Tarzan''===
On December 15, 2006, [[ComingSoon.net]] reported that del Toro was in talks to direct a ''Tarzan'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/513701-del_toro_directing_tarzan |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120615/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/513701-del_toro_directing_tarzan |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in September 2008, [[/Film|Slashfilm.com]] reported that [[Stephen Sommers]] had replaced del Toro as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/stephen-sommers-replaces-guillermo-del-toro-on-tarzan/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119181837/http://www.slashfilm.com/stephen-sommers-replaces-guillermo-del-toro-on-tarzan/ |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, finally released in 2016 under the title ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]],'' was actually directed by [[David Yates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/11/david-yates-committing-to-tarzan-at-warner-bros.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411002805/http://www.vulture.com/2012/11/david-yates-committing-to-tarzan-at-warner-bros.html |archivedate=2014-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Orphanage'' remake===
In 2007, [[New Line Cinema]] bought the rights to produce an English-language [[The Orphanage (film)#Remake|remake]] with del Toro as producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117971541.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=New Line mulls 'Orphanage' remake  |accessdate=2008-10-28 |work=Variety|date=7 September 2007 | first1=Emiliano | last1=De Pablos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/451232/The-Orphanage-Remake-/details |title=The Orphanage (Remake)  |accessdate=2008-10-28 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On remakes, the original's director [[J. A. Bayona]] noted that "The Americans have all the money in the world but can't do anything, while we can do whatever we want but don't have the money" and "The American industry doesn't take chances, that's why they make remakes of movies that were already big hits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sitgesfilmfestival.com/eng/noticies/?id=1002893 |title="J.A. Bayona: "The important things are emotions, not awards""  |accessdate=2008-10-27 |publisher=[[Sitges Film Festival]] |date=9 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 2009, [[Larry Fessenden]] was announced as the director of the American remake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3if7a4852b0435babdb7b3ce2f7bf972ed|title='Orphanage' remake finds a director|author1=Kit, Borys |author2=Zeitchik, Steven |work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 4, 2009|accessdate=August 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fessenden later announced that he would not be involved with directing the remake, stating "Working on the script with Guillermo was a very exciting experience, but then I got into a casting miasma and that's where the thing is; I think they're gonna do it another way, actually. So I think I'm out of it. Hopefully they'll still use my script, but I'm not sure I'm directing it anymore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/index.php?id=19405 |title=Excl: Orphanage director out |accessdate=November 25, 2009 |work=Arrow in the Head|date=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, [[Mark Pellington]] replaced Larry Fessenden as director of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118013246.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=The+Orphanage|work=Variety|author=McNary, Dave|date=January 2, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2010|title='Orphanage' finds helmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro stated that the remake would reflect his original vision for the film, and that it had been planned even when the first version was in production. "Even when we produced [[The Orphanage (film)|the Spanish movie]], I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." Del Toro also praised the new film's director. "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his ''[[The Mothman Prophecies]]'' and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.ie/movies/news/a333542/guillermo-del-toro-orphanage-remake-will-be-different.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Uddin, Zakia|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=February 27, 2012|title=Guillermo del Toro: 'Orphanage remake will be different'}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress [[Amy Adams]] was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film. It was also stated that the current incarnation of the remake screenplay had been written by Larry Fessenden and [[Sergio G. Sánchez]], the sole writer of the original film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/26100|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=August 30, 2011|accessdate=February 27, 2012|title=BD Horror news – 3-Time Academy Award Nominee Amy Adams Checking Into 'The Orphanage'?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been no further development news, leading to a possible cancelation.

=== ''3993'' ===
On November 8, 2007, [[ComingSoon.net]] reported that del Toro was working on a [[spiritual sequel]] to ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'', titled ''[[Pan's Labyrinth#Sequel|3993]]'' and intended to be the third and final installment of a [[Spanish Civil War]] film trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/708222-guillermo-del-toros-3993-details |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120752/http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/708222-guillermo-del-toros-3993-details |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, del Toro scrapped the project after deciding to direct ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/pans-labyrinth-things-you-never-knew/ |title=Pan’s Labyrinth: 15 Things You Never Knew |accessdate=2018-11-06 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Death: The High Cost of Living''===
In 2008, a film based on ''[[Death: The High Cost of Living]]'', to be called ''Death and Me'', was under production at [[New Line Cinema]]. [[Neil Gaiman]] wrote the screenplay, and would also direct, with del Toro as [[executive producer]]. Gaiman spent several days on the set of del Toro's film ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'' to get pointers on how to direct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=45051 Del Toro Wants Gaiman On ''Death'']&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, 2010 it was reported in an interview with Gaiman that as of June or July, DC and Warner Bros. had closed down work on the film and it was unclear if they would start it up again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/10/the_vulture_transcript_neil_ga.html The Vulture Transcript: Neil Gaiman on Comics, Twilight, Twitter Etiquette, Killing Batman, and Sharing Porn With His Son]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Thor''===
Around 2008, del Toro was being considered to direct a ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' film for [[Marvel Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelz.com/movie-news/11437/guillermo-del-toro-sets-the-record-straight-on-his-involvement-with-thor-and-dr-strange-and-updates-the-hulk-tv-series/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213030848/http://www.reelz.com/movie-news/11437/guillermo-del-toro-sets-the-record-straight-on-his-involvement-with-thor-and-dr-strange-and-updates-the-hulk-tv-series/ |archivedate=2011-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his admiration of [[Jack Kirby]]'s work, del Toro entered into negotiations to direct the film. He said that he loved the character of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], and wished to incorporate more original [[Norse mythology]] into the film; including a "really dingy [[Valhalla]], [with] [[Vikings]] and mud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2012/08/guillermo_del_toro_reveal.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227234716/http://www.blastr.com/2012/08/guillermo_del_toro_reveal.php |archivedate=2017-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, del Toro left the project to direct [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film adaptation.]] ''Thor'' was released in 2011 and directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]].

===''Halo''===
On February 8, 2008, it was reported that del Toro was in talks to direct a film adaptation of the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' video game series]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20111107052950/http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/Interview.asp?IID=740&lt;/ref&gt; However, he chose instead to focus on [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film adaptation]].

===''The Hobbit''===
In April 2008, it was reported that del Toro would direct a two-part film adaptation of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy novel ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Del Toro envisioned the first film as a direct adaptation of the novel, with the second bridging the gap between ''The Hobbit'' and the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' films. After spending two years in New Zealand working on pre-production, del Toro left the project due to ongoing delays and was replaced by ''Lord of the Rings'' director [[Peter Jackson]]. The films were expanded to a trilogy during production, and were released as ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'' (2012), ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]'' (2013), and ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' (2014), with del Toro still credited as co-writer of all three.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080730161821/http://www.wetanz.com/holics/index.php?itemid=695&amp;catid=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119142503/http://www.comingsoon.net/horror |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/66472-guillermo-del-toro-confirms-hobbit-delay |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923203942/http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/66472-guillermo-del-toro-confirms-hobbit-delay |archivedate=2016-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hater''===
On May 20, 2008, del Toro revealed that he was set to produce the film adaptation of ''Hater'' by [[David Moody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|title=Universal, del Toro love 'Hater'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117986200|accessdate=August 8, 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=May 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he has provided no updates after this announcement, suggesting the project's cancellation.

===''Hellboy III''===
On July 10, 2008, del Toro expressed his interest in directing a third ''[[Hellboy]]'' film, saying that he would work on the film after finishing ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/more-related-content/?relatedmovieid=771034116/ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120405/http://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/more-related-content/?relatedmovieid=771034116%2F |date=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, during the production of the unmade ''At the Mountain of Madness'', del Toro mentioned that he would direct ''Hellboy III'' after his next project, even though the script was not yet written.&lt;ref&gt;http://collider.com/2010/06/25/guillermo-del-toro-interview-the-hobbit-hellboy-3-frankenstein-at-the-mountains-of-madness-saturn-and-the-end-of-days/#more-34233 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206020646/http://www.collider.com/2010/06/25/guillermo-del-toro-interview-the-hobbit-hellboy-3-frankenstein-at-the-mountains-of-madness-saturn-and-the-end-of-days/ |date=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on July 8, 2013, del Toro said that the film was unlikely to be released, and suggested the possibility of telling its story in comic book form. ''[[Hellboy]]'' creator [[Mike Mignola]] refused to accept the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/hellboy-3-news-guillermo-del-toro/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710225239/http://collider.com/hellboy-3-news-guillermo-del-toro/ |archivedate=2013-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Reddit]] AMA on July 11, 2014, del Toro said:&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, you know, we don't have that movie on the horizon, but the idea for it was to have Hellboy finally come to terms with the fact that his destiny, his inevitable destiny, is to become the beast of the Apocalypse, and having him and Liz face the sort of, that part of his nature, and he has to do it, in order to be able to ironically vanquish the foe that he has to face in the 3rd film. He has to become the beast of the Apocalypse to be able to defend humanity, but at the same time, he becomes a much darker being. It's a very interesting ending to the series, but I don't think it will happen. ... We have gone through basically every studio and asked for financing, and they are not interested. I think that the first movie made its budget back, and a little bit of profit, but then it was very very big on video and DVD. The story repeated itself with the second already, it made its money back at the box office, but a small margin of profit in the release of the theatrical print, but was very very big on DVD and video. Sadly now from a business point of view all the studios know is that you don't have that safety net of the DVD and video, so they view the project as dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2agklw/i_am_guillermo_del_toro_director_writer_producer/ciuvi56/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525050751/http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2agklw/i_am_guillermo_del_toro_director_writer_producer/ciuvi56 |archivedate=2015-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On June 1, 2010, [[MTV News]] reported that del Toro was set to direct a film adaptation of ''[[Drood (novel)|Drood]],'' a novel by [[Dan Simmons]], for [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2436584/guillermo-del-toro-leaves-the-hobbit-so-whats-next-for-the-director/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119181927/http://www.mtv.com/news/2436584/guillermo-del-toro-leaves-the-hobbit-so-whats-next-for-the-director/ |archivedate=2016-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project fell into [[development hell]] and del Toro abandoned it.

===Untitled [[Van Helsing]] project===
On June 10, 2010, del Toro stated that he was working on an untitled film about [[Van Helsing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefilmstage.com/2010/06/10/guillermo-del-toro-writingproducing-new-van-helsing-film/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716233857/http://thefilmstage.com/2010/06/10/guillermo-del-toro-writingproducing-new-van-helsing-film/ |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but there have been no updates on the film since 2010.

===''At the Mountains of Madness''===
On July 28, 2010, del Toro announced that he would direct a film adaptation of [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'' for [[Universal Pictures]], with Canadian film director [[James Cameron]] as producer. The movie was originally set up as a [[DreamWorks]] project in 2004, but was later cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/cameron-produce-del-toros-madness-universal-19671 |title=Cameron to Produce Del Toro's 'Madness' for Universal |work=TheWrap |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100801174443/http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/cameron-produce-del-toros-madness-universal-19671 |archivedate=2010-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron suggested casting [[Tom Cruise]] in the lead role and releasing the film in [[3D film|3-D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/unproduced-and-unfinished-films-a-ongoing-film-comment-project/|title=Unproduced and Unfinished Films: An Ongoing Film Comment project - Film Comment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, del Toro said that the adaptation probably would not happen at all. He stated, "It doesn't look like I can do it. It's very difficult for the studios to take the step of doing a period-set, R-rated, tentpole movie with a tough ending and no love story. Lovecraft has a readership as big as any best-seller, but it's tough to quantify because his works are in the public domain."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/next-guillermo-del-toro/|title=What Next For Guillermo Del Toro?|last=Williams|first=Owen|website=Empire|language=en|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron and Del Toro put forward the idea to Universal, who greenlit it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/08/07/james-cameron-avatar-re-release-sequel-novel-titanic-3d-at-the-mountains-of-madness-guillermo-del-toro/ |title=James Cameron Talks 9 Minutes of AVATAR Re-Release Footage, Shooting the Sequels Back to Back, 3D Conversions, and AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS |work=Collider |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814124924/http://www.collider.com/2010/08/07/james-cameron-avatar-re-release-sequel-novel-titanic-3d-at-the-mountains-of-madness-guillermo-del-toro |archivedate=2010-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that same year, del Toro had also asked [[S.

===''The Haunted Mansion'' remake===
It was announced on July 22, 2010 at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] that a new film based on Disney's ''The Haunted Mansion'' was in development with [[Guillermo del Toro]] writing and producing.

==Background==
[[File:I.am.a.curator.13.11.03.jpg|thumb|right|''Installation view from I am a Curator''&lt;br&gt;Chisenhale Gallery, 13 November 2003, Muller Kneer Associates]]

Hüttner carried out a series of exhibitions that democratized or investigated the curatorial process in the late 1990s and in the early years of the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;A Tasty Treat, James Westcott, [[Zingmagazine]] 18; p.270-272; 2003; New York, United States&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were collaborative and took place at the Gallery [[Konstakuten]] in Stockholm, [[The Hood Gallery]] in Los Angeles but also in galleries and public spaces in London, New York City and [[Vancouver]] and involved artists from different generations and included [[Geoffrey Farmer]], [[Brian Jungen]], [[Lenke Rothman]], [[Neil Goldstein]] and curators like [[Reid Shier]] and [[Tone O Nielsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Amelie Nordenfelt, ''Introduction", ''Curatorial Mutiny'', p. 9, edited by Per Hüttner, 2003, 120 pages, texts by: Per Hüttner, Amelie Nordenfelt, Gavin wade, Tone O. Nielsen, Drabble+Sachs, Claire Canning and Tone Hansen. Design by Voodoo Graphics and Jonas Lindén. Published by Föreningen Curatorial MutinyStockholm, 2003. {{ISBN|91-631-3247-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he created the curatorial framework for an exhibition at [[Nylon (gallery)|Nylon]] in collaboration with [[Goshka Macuga]] and [[Gavin Wade]].&lt;ref&gt;Neal Brown, [http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ ''3 in 1 Curatorial Mutiny, Part 4'', ''Frieze'', Issue 60, June – August 2001.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203192526/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ |date=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 at Curatorial Market at [[Cuchifritos]] and various public venues including [[Essex Street Market]] in New York. In these projects he developed ideas and practices that pointed towards a new way of relating to the art object and exhibition making that eventually became manifest in I am a Curator.:&lt;ref&gt;A Tasty Treat, James Westcott, Zingmagazine 18; p.270-272; 2003; New York City&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Despite its populist ideals, the Curatorial Market raises complex, insider issues about the relationship between artist and curator. ‘These two disciplines are beginning to mix and merge in ways that some people find appalling and others see as a powerful new development in the history of art making,’ [[Paul Clay]] explains. However, abandoning the idea of the autonomous piece of art can be problematic. ‘Having art that relates very strongly to the market context can fuck up the commodification process in an interesting way. It both points it up as an object to consume, and at the same time makes it harder to effectively remove from its context in order to be sold.’ Furthermore, ‘There is a danger that when curators have too strong an {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} vision, the artists' works can end up simply as building blocks used to construct the curator's point. On the other hand if the curator's point is weak then the works can get stranded totally out of context’."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner has since developed these strategies both in projects like Repetitive Time,&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: Repetitive Time, 2006, 116 pages including 30 colour plates, texts by Lena Boëthius, Laurent Devèze, Per Hüttner, Claire Canning and Stéphanie Nava, language: English, design by Henrik Gistvall.

==Basic structure==

During six weeks people or groups of people with no prior experience in exhibition making undertook 36 investigative exercises into the process of putting together an exhibition. From the outset, the idea was to create an exhibition each day, but quickly the focus moved to investigate the 57 artworks as a resource. In order to realize this strategy the artist developed some basic concepts:

'''Curator of the Day''': The daily slots were administered through an application process through which we tried to give as many different people as possible, in relation to occupation, age, sex, social and ethnic background. More often than not, the Curator of Day was a small group. Meaning that in the end roughly 70 people were curators.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''The Gallery Crew''': The Gallery Crew was the Curators of the Day’s aid in developing their ideas and the project that they wanted to realize during the day. The Curator of the Day was not allowed to touch the artwork, except in those cases when this was an integral part of the piece. All the handling and mounting of the work was carried out by the Gallery Crew. The crew was also responsible for informing the visitors to the gallery about the project and answering questions.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''Support Structure''': Support Structure hosted all the artwork. It was mobile and it was also used to display work, as well as change the size and appearance of the space. It incorporated two tables and half a dozen chairs that could also be used as plinths to present work on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supportstructure.org&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Celine Condorelli]] and [[Gavin Wade]] took their brief further and allowed Support Structure be a questioning and critical tool and an important aspect of the process of the project. The structure took the centre stage, but in an unexpected way the Curators of the Day remained strangely blind to the eleven meter long monster object on wheels and few, if any, references were made to it in their reports.&lt;ref&gt;Support Structures, Celine Condorelli, p. 115-128, Sternberg Press (2009), {{ISBN|978-1-933128-45-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two also offered objects and lists of what to do if the Curator of the Day gets stuck and included phone numbers to well-known contemporary curators.&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Neill, p.168, Metropolis Rise: New Art from London, edited by Anthony Gross and Jen Wu, {{Proper name|temporarycontemporary}}, London 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Selectors''': To provide a dynamic collection for the Curator of the Day to choose from, six people were asked to select artwork for I Am a Curator. Each devised a different approach for his or her selection. They were [[Patrick Bernier]], [[Melanie Keen]], [[Lisa Le Feuvre]], Tone O. Nielsen, Reid Shier and Per Hüttner.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''The Interface Cards''': A5-sized plastic cards were designed and realized by American artist [[Scott Rigby]]. For each artwork available for selection there was one corresponding Interface Card. The Interface Cards along with the website (which used the same design) were the main tools for the Curator of the Day to select artwork and devise their exhibition.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

The Website: All the artwork available for selection could be browsed on Chisenhale Gallery’s website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chisenhale.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; There was also continually updated photographic documentation of the exhibitions created by the Curators of the Day.

==The exhibitions and the audience==

[[File:I.am.a.curator.14.12.03.jpg|thumb|''Installation view from I am a Curator''&lt;br&gt;Chisenhale Gallery, 14 December 2003, Lisa Maddigan and Fuyubi Nakamura]]

[[File:I.am.a.curator.11.12.03.jpg|thumb|''Installation view from I am a Curator''&lt;br&gt;Chisenhale Gallery, 11 December 2003, Anton Nikolotov]]

Each of the 36 exhibitions realized within the framework of I am a Curator took on very different forms and used the artwork and the space in very different ways. Artist [[Hannah Rickards]] who was leading the gallery crew describes an exhibition that had great impact on the development of the project:&lt;ref name="dialogue"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Embassy of Work With Me ([[å.b.ä.k.e]] /[[Royal College of Art|RCA]]), emptied Support Structure of all its contents, Jokers and artworks, and developed a chromatic scale around the walls of the gallery (the structure having been pushed to the corner). The colour of the individual group members’ clothes determined which works they had responsibility for placing. The process had a very easily achieved self-perpetuating logic that extended to colour-coding drill batteries, [[masking tape]], [[spirit level]]s, any tools that we may have set down for a moment. The colour-coding also included the covers of the CDs bought from the local junk shop in order to complete [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]]’ Playlist, along with all the book covers from [[Céline Condorelli]]’s and Gavin Wade's Joker selection of books. This seemed the most natural and successful exercise in [[devolution]] and levelling democratization that occurred during the run of the show. The ‘artworks’ suffered less in this [[melee]] than they often did when not surrounded by a [[chromatic]] sea of things; they were scrutinized and investigated by the curating group."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner talks about a few of the key experiences among the 36 exhibitions:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;”I have to mention Anton Nikolotov’s project (11/12/03). He wanted the work to be selected democratically. He thus devoted the whole day [[discussion|discussing]] with the visitors which works should be displayed. Each visitor who was present at a given moment was given some time to voice why a certain piece should or shouldn't be shown. When everyone had presented their case, the group [[election|voted]] and notes were taken on the different ideas and how many votes the different pieces got. In the end the only show that was presented was one made up of these notes shown in the massive empty space. This approach allowed I Am a Curator to be taken to another level. The boundaries between Curator of the Day and audience vanished entirely. It was wonderful to see how the process of democratization could be taken one step further than had originally been foreseen. This [[democratic process]] was at once extremely rewarding, but also hugely tiring. Rarely have I seen the members of the Gallery Crew leave so happy and tired. It was also great to see how visitors tended to stay for hours to join the discussion. At one point 15 people were present for the vote."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other shows included Sebastian Roach's Art for Wine Day 13/12/03 which took quite a [[nihilism|nihilist]] approach to the task of selecting work:&lt;ref&gt;”Sebastian Roach is a Curator”, e-mail sent out to Chisenhale mailing list, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;”In exchange for the donation of a bottle of wine (or beer, or spirits  – even a miniature, the important thing is the token) a visitor can select and display any piece of work in the show. Alternatively they can donate a new piece of work and I will give them a bottle of wine in exchange for it. In addition, through the course of the day I will install myself in an ‘office’ created by using the versatile structure as walls drinking wine, smoking cigarettes and writing.  What I write will be spontaneous and in response – directly, indirectly, or entirely [[tenuous]]ly – to the work, the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the situation, and will obviously also be tempered by the increasing consumption of alcohol. Whatever writing I do produce at the end of the day will also be available in [[Trade|exchange]] for wine."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The diversity of the Curator of the Day and how they interacted with the work can be exemplified by Hüttner's [[endnote]] in the catalogue:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;” The data that I Am a Curator generated is in itself something that would suffice for a research  project. I was pleased on the last day of the exhibition that the two [[anthropologist]]s Lisa Maddigan and Fuyubi Nakamura did a project that looked at the accumulated information. I think that they were slightly awestruck by the sheer bulk of information and work that could be hosted within the project. It is like the number of possibilities of arranging 57 artworks that Maki from å.b.ä.k.e. had calculated – 144,115,188,075,856,000. Considering that our [[solar system]] is roughly 2,400,000,000,000,000 minutes old [[probability|the number of possibilities]] is quite mind-boggling.
”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critique==

At the time of the realization of the project there was some rather loud critique towards the project.&lt;ref&gt;p. 157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfilment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Neill, The Culture of Curating and the Curating of Culture(s), 2012, p. 112-14, The MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts 02142, {{ISBN|9780262017725}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it offered a very traditional approach to the idea of how an exhibition might be made. In an interview with Barnaby Drabble the artist says.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner, '' Per Hüttner and Gavin Wade interviewed by Barnaby Drabble '', '' Marianne Eigenheer (Hg.) Curating Critique'', '' ICE Reader 1'', 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-86588-451-0}}]&lt;/ref&gt;":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I do agree, when you are faced with the possibility of just selecting existing art work that is a very traditional take on what a curator is. But then again, I think that I Am A Curator tried to do something that goes beyond that. By using a very traditional approach it enabled us to do something that was extremely creative and which opened new ideas about how to put together exhibitions. In terms of selecting the works, It wasn't as if they had only five pieces to choose from. To consider the work of fifty-seven artists in one afternoon is a major task. Also, a lot of the work was not finished, it was up to the curator of the day to complete it, a lot was interactive, and a lot had different elements that needed to be put together. So there were many different approaches on offer, reflecting the working methods of the original selectors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another criticism of the project was that the individual artwork never got the attention it deserved.&lt;ref&gt;"Le curating est le reponse...", Paul O'Neill, 02#35, p.14-16, 2005, Nantes, France&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Rickards who was leading the gallery crew writes:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Even the 57 official ‘artworks,’ depending on their treatment by the Curator of the Day, sometimes barely managed to retain their “artwork” status. There were times when they did slip into being things in cupboards or things on the wall. That slippage between artworks and objects, or between people’s roles in the process, is something I see as having been central to the project, so I don’t know if I necessarily see the need for a posthumous proliferation of the term “artwork.” It feels like [[lamination|laminating]] a piece of paper you are still making notes on. In the context of this project a wipe-clean definition seems to jar."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for ''C: International Contemporary Art Magazine'', [[Fergal Stapleton]] described the exhibition as "a game, mutative and feudal, with several tiers of collusion" and "a bid for curatorial practice as art, and for curatorial supremacy over its subject arts disciplines."&lt;ref name="Stapleton"&gt;{{cite journal|title='I am a curator'.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his PhD thesis Barnaby Drabble uses I am a Curator as one of three case studies. He quotes Stapleton and builds a severe critique to the project which he perceives as being elitist and self-promotional under the guise of being democratic.&lt;ref&gt;p. 155-157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfillment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On a more positive note British sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]] suggests that projects like I am a Curator expands art into being a visual sociology;&lt;ref&gt;David Gauntlett, "Creative Explorations New Approaches to Identities and Audiences", p. 119-20. Routledge, London, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We should note that, in some cases, the work of socially engaged visual artists and the work of visual sociologists can look very similar. Many artists have used art to explore identity, memory and the construction of selfhood [...]. Other contemporary artists have engaged in a more externally oriented art practice which involves ‘ordinary’ people in the making of work. Just as visual sociology sometimes blurs into something like art, in these projects, art expands into being a kind of visual sociology. There are many instances of such projects; here I will give just a few examples. A project by the artist Per Hüttner, at Chisenhale Gallery, London, entitled I Am a Curator, gave 30 individuals or groups the opportunity to be ‘Curator of the Day’, over a period of six weeks (5 November–14 December 2003). Each day a new exhibition was assembled, using work by 57 artists that was made available in the gallery."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is clear that, I am a Curator offered novel ways for the audience to interact with artwork and the idea of an exhibition. They were forced to deal with art in a more intimate way than in a traditional exhibition. This means that the art on display might have been visible to a smaller audience than in a normal situation and yet at the same time the [[intimacy]], reflection and constant change of context that the work was perceived in, meant that the audience was offered the possibility to understand the complexities and contradictions of artwork on a more profound level.&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt; This experimental approach to authorship and authenticity offers opportunity for creative interpretations.&lt;ref name="Form p.134-35"/&gt; This openness in its turn has led to that I am a Curator has been appropriated by various participants of the project as being 'their own' in publications and academic texts.&lt;ref name="Form p.134-35"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jes Fernie, Two Minds: Artists And Architects in Collaboration, p. 136-142, Black Dog Publishing, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten Year Anniversary==

For the 10 year anniversary of I am a Curator [[David Roberts Art Foundation]] in London invited Per Huttner to reflect on the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vision-forum.blogspot.nl/2013/09/i-am-curator-after-10-years-what.html Vision Forum website]&lt;/ref&gt; In the press release it is stated that "The project also provoked profound questions about artistic identity and its relationship to collectivity. Both shifts, in turn, lead to changed perspectives on the relationship between artworks, exhibitions, curators and artists. In short, IAAC opened a floodgate of problematics that overwhelmed the team working with the project. It is therefore important to revisit these questions after 10 years have passed, and to see how they have influenced individual artistic processes and how they can guide us into meaningful future reflections on related issues."&lt;ref&gt;Press release on The David Roberts Art Foundation website [http://davidrobertsartfoundation.com/projects/i-am-a-curator-after-10-years-what-defines-an-artistic-practice-tuesday-29-october-2013-6-30-to-8-30pm]/&lt;/ref&gt; Per Hüttner was joined by artist/architect [[Céline Condorelli]], [[neuroscientist]] [[Stephen Whitmarsh]] and Anette and [[Alberto Giacometti Foundation]] Director [[Véronique Wiesinger]].

'''Islamic art''' encompasses the [[visual arts]] produced from the 7th century onward by people who lived within the territory that was inhabited by or ruled by culturally [[Islamic]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, Richard Ettinghausen and [[Oleg Grabar]], 2001, ''Islamic Art and Architecture: 650–1250'', Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-300-08869-4}}, p.3; Brend, 10&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thus a very difficult art to define because it covers many lands and various peoples over some 1,400 years; it is not art specifically of a religion, or of a time, or of a place, or of a single medium like painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=J. M. Bloom |author2=S. S. Blair |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture, Vol. II |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-530991-1 |pages=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PR7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The huge field of [[Islamic architecture]] is the subject of a separate article, leaving fields as varied as [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[painting]], [[Islamic glass|glass]], [[Islamic pottery|pottery]], and textile arts such as [[Oriental rug|carpets]] and [[Islamic embroidery|embroidery]].

Islamic art is not at all restricted to religious art, but includes all the art of the rich and varied cultures of Islamic societies as well. It frequently includes secular elements and elements that are frowned upon, if not forbidden, by some Islamic theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, David L. Janson's History of Art, Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, {{ISBN|0-13-193455-4}} pg. 277&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the ever-present calligraphic inscriptions, specifically religious art is actually less prominent in Islamic art than in Western [[medieval art]], with the exception of Islamic architecture where [[mosque]]s and their complexes of surrounding buildings are the most common remains.  Figurative painting may cover religious scenes, but normally in essentially secular contexts such as the walls of palaces or illuminated books of poetry.  The calligraphy and decoration of manuscript [[Qur'an]]s is an important aspect, but other religious art such as glass [[mosque lamp]]s and other mosque fittings such as tiles (e.g. [[Girih tiles]]), woodwork and carpets usually have the same style and motifs as contemporary secular art, although with religious inscriptions even more prominent.

"Islamic art developed from many sources: [[Roman art|Roman]], [[Early Christian art]], and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] styles were taken over in early Islamic art and architecture; the influence of the [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]] art of pre-Islamic Persia was of paramount significance; Central Asian styles were brought in with various nomadic incursions; and [[Chinese art|Chinese]] influences had a formative effect on Islamic painting, pottery, and textiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=MSN Encarta: ''Islamic Art and architecture'' |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577725/Islamic_Art_and_Architecture.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrZY56V?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577725/Islamic_Art_and_Architecture.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the whole concept of "Islamic art" has been criticised by some modern art historians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Melikian |first=Souren |title=Qatar's Museum of Islamic Art: Despite flaws, a house of masterpieces |newspaper=International Herald Tribune|date=December 5, 2008 |quote=This is a European construct of the 19th century that gained wide acceptance following a display of Les Arts Musulmans at the old Trocadero palace in Paris during the 1889 Exposition Universelle.

the similarities between art produced at widely different times and places in the Islamic world, especially in the [[Islamic Golden Age]], have been sufficient to keep the term in wide use by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=De Guise |first=Lucien |title=What is Islamic Art? |publisher=Islamica Magazine |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are repeating elements in Islamic art, such as the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. The arabesque in Islamic art is often used to symbolize the transcendent, indivisible and infinite nature of God.&lt;ref name="JAACMadden"&gt;Madden (1975), pp.423–430&lt;/ref&gt; Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only God can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Textile Art: Anomalies in Kilims |author=Thompson, Muhammad |author2=Begum, Nasima |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |work=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |publisher=TurkoTek |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The future of art in a digital age: from Hellenistic to Hebraic consciousness |last=Alexenberg |first=Melvin L. |year=2006 |publisher=Intellect Ltd |isbn=1-84150-136-0 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Only God is Perfect |url=http://www.geometricdesign.co.uk/perfect.htm |work=Islamic and Geometric Art |author=Backhouse, Tim |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, though not entirely, Islamic art has focused on the [[Islamic interlace patterns|depiction of patterns]], whether [[Islamic geometric patterns|purely geometric]] or floral, and Arabic calligraphy, [[aniconism in Islam|rather than on figures]], because it is feared by many Muslims that the depiction of the human form is [[idolatry]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UxRoBmUnsYC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=islam+depiction+of+the+human+form+is+idolatry&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F6rsToKkBNP04QSbzOySCQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=islam%20depiction%20of%20the%20human%20form%20is%20idolatry&amp;f=false John L. Esposito (2010), ''The future of Islam'', Oxford University Press, page 42]&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby a sin against [[God in Islam|God]], forbidden in the [[Qur'an]].  Human portrayals can be found in all eras of Islamic art, above all in the more private form of miniatures, where their absence is rare.  Human representation for the purpose of worship is considered [[idolatry]] and is duly forbidden in some interpretations of Islamic law, known as ''[[Sharia]]'' law. There are also many [[depictions of Muhammad]], [[Mohammed|Islam's chief prophet]], in historical Islamic art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rpUuqLPPKK4C&amp;dq=wijdan&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QXySmKzsy6&amp;sig=a9V6tTTfsrTT5Ex01QGnwrL7XYY ''The Arab Contribution to Islamic Art: From the Seventh to the Fifteenth Centuries''], [[Wijdan Ali]], American Univ in Cairo Press, December 10, 1999, {{ISBN|977-424-476-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.let.uu.nl/solis/anpt/EJOS/pdf4/07Ali.pdf  ''From the Literal to the Spiritual: The Development of the Prophet Muhammad's Portrayal from 13th Century Ilkhanid Miniatures to 17th Century Ottoman Art''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041203232347/http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/pdf4/07Ali.pdf |date=2004-12-03 }}, [[Wijdan Ali]], [http://www2.let.uu.nl/Solis/anpt/ejos/EJOS-1.html EJOS (Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies)], volume IV, issue 7, p. 1-24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Small decorative figures of animals and humans, especially if they are hunting the animals, are found on secular pieces in many media from many periods, but portraits were slow to develop.

== Calligraphy ==

{{main|Islamic calligraphy}}

Calligraphic design is omnipresent in Islamic art, where, as in [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]], religious exhortations, including Qur'anic verses, may be included in secular objects, especially coins, tiles and metalwork, and most painted miniatures include some script, as do many buildings. Use of Islamic calligraphy in architecture extended significantly outside of Islamic territories; one notable example is the use of [[Chinese calligraphy]] of Arabic verses from the Qur'an in the [[Great Mosque of Xi'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondak|first1=Marwa|title=Islamic Art History: An Influential Period|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/islamic-art-history-an-influential-period/|website=Mozaico|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other inscriptions include verses of poetry, and inscriptions recording ownership or donation. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic ''[[kufic]]'' and ''[[Naskh (script)|naskh]]'' scripts, which can be found adorning and enhancing the visual appeal of the walls and domes of buildings, the sides of [[minbar]]s, and metalwork.&lt;ref name="JAACMadden"/&gt; Islamic calligraphy in the form of painting or sculptures are sometimes referred to as ''quranic art''.&lt;ref&gt;Islamic Archaeology in the Sudan - Page 22, Intisar Soghayroun Elzein - 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called "epigraphic ware", has been described as "probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery".&lt;ref&gt;Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278–290&lt;/ref&gt;  Large inscriptions made from tiles, sometimes with the letters raised in [[relief]], or the background cut away, are found on the interiors and exteriors of many important buildings.  Complex carved calligraphy also decorates buildings. For most of the Islamic period the majority of coins only showed lettering, which are often very elegant despite their small size and nature of production.  The [[tughra]] or monogram of an Ottoman sultan was used extensively on official documents, with very elaborate decoration for important ones.  Other single sheets of calligraphy, designed for albums, might contain short poems, Qur'anic verses, or other texts.

The main languages, all using [[Arabic script]], are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], always used for Qur'anic verses, [[Farsi|Persian]] in the [[Persianate]] world, especially for poetry, and [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Turkish]], with [[Urdu]] appearing in later centuries.  Calligraphers usually had a higher status than other artists.

== Painting ==

{{see also|Arabic miniature|Ottoman miniature|Persian miniature|Mughal miniature}}

Although there has been a tradition of wall-paintings, especially in the [[Persianate]] world, the best-surviving and highest developed form of painting in the Islamic world is the [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, or later as a single page for inclusion in a ''[[muraqqa]]'' or bound album of miniatures and [[calligraphy]].  The tradition of the [[Persian miniature]] has been dominant since about the 13th century, strongly influencing the [[Ottoman miniature]] of Turkey and the [[Mughal miniature]] in India. Miniatures were especially an art of the court, and because they were not seen in public, it has been argued that constraints on the depiction of the human figure were much more relaxed, and indeed miniatures often contain great numbers of small figures, and from the 16th century portraits of single ones.  Although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts, notably several of the [[Umayyad Desert Castles]] (c. 660-750), and during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (c. 749–1258).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Bloom |author2=S. Blair |title=Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=192 and 207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA192&amp;lpg=RA1-PA192&amp;dq=cairo+egypt+miniature+paintings+mamluk#v=onepage&amp;q=cairo%20egypt%20miniature%20paintings%20mamluk&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest commissions of illustrated books were usually classics of [[Persian poetry]] such as the epic ''[[Shahnameh]]'', although the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s both produced lavish manuscripts of more recent history with the autobiographies of the Mughal emperors, and more purely military chronicles of Turkish conquests.  Portraits of rulers developed in the 16th century, and later in Persia, then becoming very popular. Mughal portraits, normally in profile, are very finely drawn in a realist style, while the best Ottoman ones are vigorously stylized.  Album miniatures typically featured picnic scenes, portraits of individuals or (in India especially) animals, or idealized youthful beauties of either sex.

Chinese influences included the early adoption of the vertical format natural to a book, which led to the development of a birds-eye view where a very carefully depicted background of hilly landscape or palace buildings rises up to leave only a small area of sky.  The figures are arranged in different planes on the background, with recession (distance from the viewer) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space, but at essentially the same size.  The colours, which are often very well preserved, are strongly contrasting, bright and clear.  The tradition reached a climax in the 16th and early 17th centuries, but continued until the early 19th century, and has been revived in the 20th.

== Rugs and carpets ==

[[File:Farsh1.jpg|400px|thumb|left|From the yarn fiber to the colors, every part of the [[Persian rug]] is traditionally handmade from natural ingredients over the course of many months]]
No Islamic artistic product has become better known outside the Islamic world than the pile carpet, more commonly referred to as the ''Oriental carpet'' ([[oriental rug]]). Their versatility is utilized in everyday Islamic and Muslim life, from floor coverings to architectural enrichment, from cushions to bolsters to bags and sacks of all shapes and sizes, and to religious objects (such as a [[prayer rug]], which would provide a clean place to pray).  They have been a major export to other areas since the late Middle Ages, used to cover not only floors but tables, for long a widespread European practice that is now common only in the [[Netherlands]].  Carpet weaving is a rich and deeply embedded tradition in Islamic societies, and the practice is seen in large city factories as well as in rural communities and nomadic encampments.  In earlier periods, special establishments and workshops were in existence that functioned directly under court patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, ''David L. Janson's History of Art'', Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, {{ISBN|0-13-193455-4}} pg. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antique oushak 418424.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] [[Ushak carpet]]]]
Very early Islamic carpets, i.e. those before the 16th century, are extremely rare. More have survived in the West and [[oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] from Europe are a major source of information on them, as they were valuable imports that were painted accurately.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, throughout, but 9–28, 49–50, &amp; 59 in particular&lt;/ref&gt;  The most natural and easy designs for a carpet weaver to produce consist of straight lines and edges, and the earliest Islamic carpets to survive or be shown in paintings have geometric designs, or centre on very stylized animals, made up in this way.  Since the flowing loops and curves of the arabesque are central to Islamic art, the interaction and tension between these two styles was long a major feature of carpet design.

There are a few survivals of the grand Egyptian 16th century carpets, including one almost as good as new discovered in the attic of the [[Pitti Palace]] in Florence, whose complex patterns of octagon roundels and stars, in just a few colours, shimmer before the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, 27, 61–62, as "The Medici Mamluk Carpet"&lt;/ref&gt;  Production of this style of carpet began under the [[Mamluks]] but continued after the Ottomans conquered Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, 59–66, 79–83&lt;/ref&gt;  The other sophisticated tradition was the [[Persian carpet]] which reached its peak in the 16th and early 17th century in works like the [[Ardabil Carpet]] and [[Coronation Carpet]]; during this century the Ottoman and Mughal courts also began to sponsor the making in their domains of large formal carpets, evidently with the involvement of designers used to the latest court style in the general Persian tradition.  These use a design style shared with non-figurative Islamic illumination and other media, often with a large central ''[[Gul (design)|gul]]'' motif, and always with wide and strongly demarcated borders.  The grand designs of the workshops patronized by the court spread out to smaller carpets for the merely wealthy and for export, and designs close to those of the 16th and 17th centuries are still produced in large numbers today.  The description of older carpets has tended to use the names of carpet-making centres as labels, but often derived from the design rather than any actual evidence that they originated from around that centre.  Research has clarified that designs were by no means always restricted to the centre they are traditionally associated with, and the origin of many carpets remains unclear.

As well as the major Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans.  Spanish carpets, which sometimes interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include [[coats of arms]], enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the [[Papal Palace, Avignon]], and the industry continued after the [[Reconquista]].&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester: Spanish carpets: 11–12, 50–52; Balkans: 77 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Armenian carpet]]-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought.  The [[Berber carpet]]s of North Africa have a distinct design tradition.  Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, there was also a large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs.  As well as pile carpets, [[kelim]]s and other types of flat-weave or [[embroidered]] textiles were produced, for use on both floors and walls.   Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.

== Ceramics ==
{{main|Islamic pottery}}
[[File:Iran orientale o asia centrale, coppa, x sec 02.JPG|thumb|left|10th-century dish from East Persia]]

Islamic art has very notable achievements in ceramics, both in [[pottery]] and [[tile]]s for walls, which in the absence of wall-paintings were taken to heights unmatched by other cultures.  Early pottery is often unglazed, but [[Tin-glazing|tin-opacified glazing]] was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[Stoneware|stonepaste ceramics]], originating from 9th century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The first industrial complex for [[glass]] and [[pottery]] production was built in [[Raqqa]], [[Syria]], in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=J. |last1=Henderson |first2=S. D. |last2=McLoughlin |first3=D. S. |last3=McPhail |year=2004 |title=Radical changes in Islamic glass technology: evidence for conservatism and experimentation with new glass recipes from early and middle Islamic Raqqa, Syria |journal=Archaeometry |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=439–68 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.2004.00167.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other centers for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lusterware]]s with iridescent colours may have continued pre-Islamic Roman and Byzantine techniques, but were either invented or considerably developed on pottery and glass in Persia and Syria from the 9th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 206–207&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic pottery was [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery|often influenced]] by [[Chinese ceramics]], whose achievements were greatly admired and emulated.&lt;ref&gt;See Rawson throughout; Canby, 120–123, and see index; Jones &amp; Mitchell, 206–211&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially the case in the periods after the [[Mongol invasion]]s and those of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]].  Techniques, shapes and decorative motifs were all affected.  Until the [[Early Modern]] period Western ceramics had very little influence, but Islamic pottery was very sought after in Europe, and often copied.  An example of this is the [[albarello]], a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of [[pharmacy]] jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. [[Hispano-Moresque]] examples were exported to Italy, stimulating the earliest Italian examples, from 15th century Florence.

[[File:Animal Decorated Ottoman Pottery P1000585.JPG|thumb|[[Iznik pottery|Iznik glazed pottery]] ca. 1575]]

The [[Hispano-Moresque]] style emerged in [[Al-Andaluz]] or Muslim Spain in the 8th century, under Egyptian influence, but most of the best production was much later, by potters presumed to have been largely Muslim but working in areas reconquered by the Christian kingdoms. It mixed Islamic and European elements in its designs, and much was exported across neighbouring European countries. It had introduced two [[ceramic]] techniques to [[Europe]]: [[ceramic glaze|glazing]] with an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] white [[tin-glazing|tin-glaze]], and [[Lusterware|painting in metallic lusters]].  Ottoman [[İznik pottery]] produced most of the best work in the 16th century, in tiles and large vessels boldly decorated with floral motifs influenced, once again, by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics.  These were still in earthenware; there was no porcelain made in Islamic countries until modern times, though Chinese porcelain was imported and admired.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, 175, suggests that the Persians had made some experiments towards producing it, and the earliest European porcelain, [[Medici porcelain]], was made in the late 16th century, perhaps with a Persian or [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantine]] assistant on the team.&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval Islamic world also had pottery with painted animal and human imagery. Examples are found throughout the medieval Islamic world, particularly in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |first=Eva |last=Baer |year=1983 |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=0-87395-602-8 |pages=58, 86, 143, 151, 176, 201, 226, 243, 292, 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiling===
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns|Tessellation}}

[[File:HeratFridayMosque.jpg|thumb|left|Tiled exterior of the [[Friday Mosque of Herat]], [[Afghanistan]]]]
The earliest grand Islamic buildings, like the [[Dome of the Rock]], in [[Jerusalem]] had interior walls decorated with [[mosaic]]s in the Byzantine style, but without human figures.  From the 9th century onwards the distinctive Islamic tradition of glazed and brightly coloured [[tile|tiling]] for interior and exterior walls and [[dome]]s developed.  Some earlier schemes create designs using mixtures of tiles each of a single colour that are either cut to shape or are small and of a few shapes, used to create abstract geometric patterns.  Later large painted schemes use tiles painted before firing with a part of the scheme – a technique requiring confidence in the consistent results of firing.

Some elements, especially the letters of inscriptions, may be moulded in three-dimensional [[relief]], and in especially in Persia certain tiles in a design may have figurative painting of animals or single human figures.  These were often part of designs mostly made up of tiles in plain colours but with larger fully painted tiles at intervals.  The larger tiles are often shaped as eight-pointed stars, and may show animals or a human head or bust, or plant or other motifs.  The geometric patterns, such as modern North African [[zellige]] work, made of small tiles each of a single colour but different and regular shapes, are often referred to as "[[mosaic]]", which is not strictly correct.

The Mughals made much less use of tiling, preferring (and being able to afford) "parchin kari", a type of [[pietra dura]] decoration from inlaid panels of semi-precious stones, with jewels in some cases.  This can be seen at the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra Fort]] and other imperial commissions.  The motifs are usually floral, in a simpler and more realistic style than Persian or Turkish work, relating to plants in Mughal miniatures.

== Glass ==
{{main|Islamic glass}}
[[File:Luckofedenhall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"The [[Luck of Edenhall]]", a 13th-century Syrian beaker, in England since the Middle Ages]]

For most of the Middle Ages Islamic glass was the most sophisticated in [[Eurasia]], exported to both Europe and China.  Islam took over much of the traditional glass-producing territory of [[Sassanian glass|Sassanian]] and [[Ancient Roman glass]], and since figurative decoration played a small part in pre-Islamic glass, the change in style is not abrupt, except that the whole area initially  formed a political whole, and, for example, Persian innovations were now almost immediately taken up in [[Egypt]].  For this reason it is often impossible to distinguish between the various centres of production, of which Egypt, Syria and Persia were the most important, except by scientific analysis of the material, which itself has difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131, 135. The Introduction (pp. 131–135) is by [[Ralph Pinder-Wilson]], who shared the catalogue entries with [[Waffiya Essy]].&lt;/ref&gt;  From various documentary references glassmaking and [[Ancient glass trade|glass trading]] seems to have been a speciality of the Jewish minority in several centres.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica, "Glass", [https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07392.html Online version]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosque lamp Met 91.1.1534.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mamluk]] [[mosque lamp]]]]

Between the 8th and early 11th centuries the emphasis in luxury glass is on effects achieved by "manipulating the surface" of the glass, initially by incising into the glass on a wheel, and later by cutting away the background to leave a design in relief.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;  The very massive [[Hedwig glass]]es, only found in Europe, but normally considered Islamic (or possibly from Muslim craftsmen in [[Norman Sicily]]), are an example of this, though puzzlingly late in date.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131, 141&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other glass pieces probably represented cheaper versions of vessels of carved [[rock crystal]] (clear [[quartz]]), themselves influenced by earlier glass vessels,&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 141&lt;/ref&gt; and there is some evidence that at this period glass cutting and [[hardstone carving]] were regarded as the same craft.&lt;ref&gt;Endnote 111 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ONUFZfcEkBgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA88&amp;dq=Islamic+glass+Jewish&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CRdUTcrcFYHQhAepnb2vCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Islamic%20glass%20Jewish&amp;f=false ''Roman glass: reflections on cultural change''], Fleming, Stuart. see also endnote 110 for Jewish glassworkers&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 12th century the industry in Persia and [[Mesopotamia]] appears to decline, and the main production of luxury glass shifts to Egypt and Syria, and decorative effects of colour on smooth surfaced glass.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131, 133–135&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the period local centres made simpler wares such as [[Hebron glass]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

Lustre painting, by techniques similar to [[lustreware]] in pottery, dates back to the 8th century in Egypt, and became widespread in the 12th century.  Another technique was decoration with threads of glass of a different colour, worked into the main surface, and sometimes manipulated by combing and other effects.  [[Gilding|Gilded]], painted and [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] glass were added to the repertoire, and shapes and motifs borrowed from other media, such as pottery and metalwork.  Some of the finest work was in [[mosque lamp]]s donated by a ruler or wealthy man.  As decoration grew more elaborate, the quality of the basic glass decreased, and it "often has a brownish-yellow tinge, and is rarely free from bubbles".&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 131–135, 141–146; quote, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aleppo]] seems to have ceased to be a major centre after the [[Mongol invasion]] of 1260, and [[Timur]] appears to have ended the Syrian industry about 1400 by carrying off the skilled workers to [[Samarkand]].  By about 1500 the [[Venice|Venetians]] were receiving large orders for mosque lamps.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Islamic brasswork}}

== Metalwork ==
[[File:Bassin Syrie 1.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of the "Baptistère de Saint-Louis," c. 1300, a [[Mamluk]] basin of engraved brass with gold, silver and [[niello]] inlay]]

Medieval Islamic metalwork offers a complete contrast to its European equivalent, which is dominated by modelled figures and brightly coloured decoration in [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], some pieces entirely in precious metals.  In contrast surviving Islamic metalwork consists of practical objects mostly in [[brass]], bronze, and steel, with simple, but often monumental, shapes, and surfaces highly decorated with dense decoration in a variety of techniques, but colour mostly restricted to inlays of gold, silver, copper or black [[niello]].  The most abundant survivals from medieval periods are fine brass objects, handsome enough to preserve, but not valuable enough to be melted down.  The abundant local sources of [[zinc]] compared to [[tin]] explains the rarity of [[bronze]].  Household items, such as ewers or water pitchers, were made of one or more pieces of sheet brass soldered together and subsequently worked and inlaid.&lt;ref name=Baer1983&gt;{{cite book |last=Baer |first=Eva |title=Metalwork in Medieval Islamic Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s__yi4pD-VEC |year=1983 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-602-4 |pages=whole book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the [[Hadith]]s, as was the wearing of gold rings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=24&amp;translator=2 Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels]&lt;/ref&gt;  One thing Islamic metalworkers shared with European ones was high social status compared to other artists and craftsmen, and many larger pieces are signed.

Islamic work includes some three-dimensional animal figures as fountainheads or [[aquamanile]]s, but only one significant enamelled object is known, using Byzantine [[cloisonne]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 201, and earlier pages for animal shapes.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Pisa Griffin]] is the largest surviving bronze animal, probably from 11th century Al-Andaluz.  More common objects given elaborate decoration include massive low candlesticks and lamp-stands, lantern lights, bowls, dishes, basins, buckets (these probably for the bath),&lt;ref&gt;But see Arts, 170, where the standard view is disputed&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ewer]]s, as well as caskets, pen-cases and plaques. Ewers and basins were brought for hand-washing before and after each meal, so are often lavishly treated display pieces.  A typical 13th century ewer from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] is decorated with foliage, animals and the [[Signs of the Zodiac]] in silver and copper, and carries a blessing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/91.1.530 "Base of a ewer with Zodiac medallions &amp;#91;Iran&amp;#93; (91.1.530)"].

(New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1997), 16. The inscription reads: ''“Bi-l-yumn wa al-baraka…”'' meaning “With bliss and divine grace…”&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialized objects include knives, arms and armour (always of huge interest to the elite) and scientific instruments such as [[astrolabe]]s, as well as [[jewellery]].  Decoration is typically densely packed and very often includes arabesques and calligraphy, sometimes naming an owner and giving a date.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 157–160, and exhibits 161–204&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other applied arts ==
[[File:Dagger horse head Louvre OA7891.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dagger with hilt in [[jade]], gold, [[rubies]] and [[emerald]]s.  Blade of [[damascening|damascened]] steel inlaid with gold.]]
High levels of achievement were reached in other materials, including [[hardstone carving]]s and jewellery, ivory carving, textiles and leatherwork. During the Middle Ages, Islamic work in these fields was highly valued in other parts of the world and often traded outside the Islamic zone.  Apart from miniature painting and calligraphy, other arts of the book are decorative illumination, the only type found in Qur'an manuscripts, and Islamic book covers, which are often highly decorative in luxury manuscripts, using either the geometric motifs found in illumination, or sometimes figurative images probably drawn for the craftsmen by miniature painters.  Materials include coloured, tooled and stamped leather and [[lacquer]] over paint.&lt;ref&gt;See the relevant sections in "Arts"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precious stones===

Egyptian carving of [[rock crystal]] into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040.  There are a number of these vessels in the West, which apparently came on the market after the [[Cairo]] palace of the [[Fatimid]] [[Caliph]] was looted by his mercenaries in 1062, and were snapped up by European buyers, mostly ending up in church treasuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://simerg.com/literary-readings/literary-reading-fatimid-rock-crystal-ewers-most-valuable-objects-in-islamic-art/ Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art]&lt;/ref&gt; From later periods, especially the hugely wealthy Ottoman and Mughal courts, there are a considerable number of lavish objects carved in semi-precious stones, with little surface decoration, but inset with jewels.  Such objects may have been made in earlier periods, but few have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

===House and furniture===
[[File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman [[marquetry]] and tile-top table, about 1560]]
Older wood carving is typically relief or pierced work on flat objects for architectural use, such as screens, doors, roofs, beams and friezes.  An important exception are the complex [[muqarnas]] and [[mocárabe]] designs giving roofs and other architectural elements a [[stalactite]]-like appearance. These are often in wood, sometimes painted on the wood but often plastered over before painting; the examples at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada, Spain]] are among the best known.  Traditional Islamic furniture, except for chests, tended to be covered with cushions, with cupboards rather than cabinets for storage, but there are some pieces, including a low round (strictly twelve-sided) table of about 1560 from the Ottoman court, with [[marquetry]] inlays in light wood, and a single huge ceramic tile or plaque on the tabletop.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:WLA vanda Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table 2.jpg|Table]] in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The fine inlays typical of Ottoman court furniture may have developed from styles and techniques used in weapons and musical instruments, for which the finest craftsmanship available was used.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers and Ward, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also intricately decorated caskets and chests from various periods.  A spectacular and famous (and far from flat) roof was one of the Islamic components of the 12th century Norman [[Cappella Palatina]] in [[Palermo]], which picked from the finest elements of Catholic, Byzantine and Islamic art.  Other famous wooden roofs are in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].

===Ivory===

[[File:Panel hunters Louvre OA 6265-1.jpg|left|upright=&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;1.3|thumb|Ivory with traces of paint, 11th–12th century, Egypt]]
[[Ivory carving#Islamic ivory|Ivory carving]] centred on the [[Mediterranean]], spreading from Egypt, where a thriving [[Copt]]ic industry had been inherited;  Persian ivory is rare.  The normal style was a deep relief with an even surface; some pieces were painted.  Spain specialized in caskets and round boxes, which were probably used to keep jewels and perfumes.  They were produced mainly in the approximate period 930–1050, and widely exported. Many pieces are signed and dated, and on court pieces the name of the owner is often inscribed; they were typically gifts from a ruler. As well as a court workshop, [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] had commercial workshops producing goods of slightly lower quality.  In the 12th and 13th century workshops in [[Norman Sicily]] produced caskets, apparently then migrating to Granada and elsewhere after persecution.  Egyptian work tended to be in flat panels and friezes, for insertion into woodwork and probably furniture – most are now detached from their settings.  Many were calligraphic, and others continued Byzantine traditions of hunting scenes, with backgrounds of arabesques and foliage in both cases.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 147–150, and exhibits following&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silk===

Despite [[Hadithic]] sayings against the wearing of silk, the Byzantine and Sassanian traditions of grand figured silk woven cloth continued under Islam.  Some designs are calligraphic, especially when made for palls to cover a tomb, but more are surprisingly conservative versions of the earlier traditions, with many large figures of animals, especially majestic symbols of power like the lion and eagle.  These are often enclosed in roundels, as found in the pre-Islamic traditions.  The majority of early silks have been recovered from tombs, and in Europe [[reliquaries]], where the relics were often wrapped in silk.  European clergy and nobility were keen buyers of Islamic silk from an early date and, for example, the body of an early bishop of [[Toul]] in France was wrapped in a silk from the [[Bukhara]] area in modern [[Uzbekistan]], probably when the body was reburied in 820.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 65–68; 74, no. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Shroud of St Josse]] is a famous [[samite]] cloth from East Persia, which originally had a carpet-like design with two pairs of confronted elephants, surrounded by borders including rows of [[camel]]s and an inscription in [[Kufic]] script, from which the date appears to be before 961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 Louvre, Suaire de St-Josse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623185919/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226262&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500781 |date=2011-06-23 }}.

[[File:Batik Indonesia.jpg|170px|left|thumb|upright|[[Javanese culture|Javanese]] court [[batik]]]]

Ottoman silks were less exported, and the many surviving royal [[kaftan]]s have simpler geometric patterns, many featuring stylized "tiger-stripes" below three balls or circles.  Other silks have foliage designs comparable to those on Iznik pottery or carpets, with bands forming ogival compartments a popular motif. Some designs begin to show Italian influence.  By the 16th century Persian silk was using smaller patterns, many of which showed relaxed garden scenes of beautiful boys and girls from the same world as those in contemporary album miniatures, and sometimes identifiable scenes from Persian poetry. A 16th-century circular ceiling for a tent, 97&amp;nbsp;cm across, shows a continuous and crowded hunting scene; it was apparently looted by the army of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in his invasion of Persia in 1543–45, before being taken by a Polish general at the [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1683. Mughal silks incorporate many Indian elements, and often feature relatively realistic "portraits" of plants, as found in other media.&lt;ref&gt;Arts, 68, 71, 82–86, 106–108, 110–111, 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesian batik===
{{main|Batik}}

The development and refinement of [[Indonesia]]n ''[[batik]]'' cloth was closely linked to Islam.  The Islamic prohibition on certain images encouraged ''batik'' design to become more abstract and intricate.  Realistic depictions of animals and humans are rare on traditional ''batik''.  However, mythical serpents, humans with exaggerated features and the [[Garuda]] of pre-Islamic mythology are common motifs.

Although its existence pre-dates Islam, ''batik'' reached its zenith in royal Muslim courts such as [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]], whose [[sultan]]s encouraged and patronised ''batik'' production.  Today, batik is undergoing a revival, and cloths are used for additional purposes such as wrapping the Quran.

== History ==

===Beginnings===

====Pre-dynastic====
[[File:Mschatta-Fassade (Pergamonmuseum).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mshatta facade|Palace facade from Mshatta]] in Jordan, now in the [[Pergamon Museum, Berlin]], c.&amp;nbsp;?740]]  
The period of a rapid expansion of the Islamic era forms a reasonably accurate beginning for the label of Islamic art. Early geographical boundaries of the Islamic culture were in present-day [[Syria]]. It is quite difficult to distinguish the earliest Islamic objects from their predecessors in Persian or [[Sassanid]] and [[Byzantine art]], and the conversion of the mass of the population, including artists, took a significant period, sometimes centuries, after the initial [[Muslim conquest]]. There was, notably, a significant production of unglazed ceramics, witnessed by a famous small bowl preserved in the [[Louvre]], whose inscription assures its attribution to the Islamic period. Plant motifs were the most important in these early productions.

Influences from the Sassanian artistic tradition include the image of the king as a warrior and the lion as a symbol of nobility and virility. [[Bedouin]] tribal traditions mixed with the more sophisticated styles of the conquered territories.  For an initial period coins had human figures in the Byzantine and Sassanian style, perhaps to reassure users of their continued value, before the Islamic style with lettering only took over.

====Umayyad====
[[File:Umayyad Mosque-Mosaics west.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaics from the ''riwaq'' (portico) of the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]]]]
Religious and civic architecture were developed under the [[Umayyad]] dynasty (661–750), when new concepts and new plans were put into practice.

The [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture, marked by a strong Byzantine influence ([[mosaic]] against a gold background, and a central plan that recalls that of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]), but already bearing purely Islamic elements, such as the great epigraphic [[frieze]]. The desert palaces in [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]] (for example, [[Mshatta facade|Mshatta]], [[Qasr Amra]], and Khirbat al-Mafjar) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated, including some wall-paintings, to promote an image of royal luxury.

Work in ceramics was still somewhat primitive (unglazed) during this period. Some metal objects have survived from this time, but it remains rather difficult to distinguish these objects from those of the pre-Islamic period.

'Abd al-Malik introduced standard coinage that featured Arabic inscriptions, instead of images of the monarch. The quick development of a localized coinage around the time of the Dome of the Rock's construction demonstrates the reorientation of Umayyad acculturation. This period saw the genesis of a particularly Islamic art.

In this period, Umayyad artists and artisans did not invent a new vocabulary, but began to prefer those received from Mediterranean and Iranian [[late antiquity]], which they adapted to their own artistic conceptions. For example, the mosaics in the [[Great Mosque of Damascus]] are based on [[Byzantine]] models, but replace the figurative elements with images of trees and cities. The desert palaces also bear witness to these influences. By combining the various traditions that they had inherited, and by readapting motifs and architectural elements, artists created little by little a typically Muslim art, particularly discernible in the aesthetic of the arabesque, which appears both on monuments and in illuminated [[Qur'ān]]s.

====Abbasid====
[[File:Cup Susa Louvre MAO568.jpg|thumb|[[Lusterware]] bowl from [[Susa]], 9th century, today in the Louvre]]
The [[Abbasid dynasty]] (750 [[AD]] – 1258&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, World of Art&lt;/ref&gt;) witnessed the movement of the capital from [[Damascus]] to [[Baghdad]], and then from Baghdad to [[Samarra]]. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. [[Art history|Art historian]] Robert Hillenbrand (1999) likens the movement to the foundation of an "Islamic [[Rome]]", because the meeting of Eastern influences from Iranian, Eurasian steppe, Chinese, and Indian sources created a new paradigm for Islamic art. Classical forms inherited from Byzantine Europe and Greco-Roman sources were discarded in favor of those drawn from the new Islamic hub. Even the design of the city of Baghdad placed it in the "navel of the world", as 9th-century historian al-Ya'qubi wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient city of Baghdad cannot be excavated well, as it lies beneath the modern city. However, [[Abbasid Samarra]], which was largely abandoned, has been well studied, and is known for its surviving examples of [[stucco]] reliefs, in which the prehistory of the [[arabesque]] can be traced.  Motifs known from the stucco at Samarra permit the dating of structures built elsewhere, and are furthermore found on portable objects, particular in wood, from Egypt through to Iran.

[[Samarra]] witnessed the "coming of age" of Islamic art. Polychrome painted [[stucco]] allowed for experimentation in new styles of moulding and carving. The Abbasid period also coincided with two major innovations in the ceramic arts: the invention of [[faience]], and of metallic [[lusterware]]. [[Hadith]]ic prohibition of the use of golden or silver vessels led to the development of metallic [[lusterware]] in pottery, which was made by mixing sulphur and metallic oxides to ochre and vinegar, painted onto an already glazed vessel and then fired a second time. It was expensive, and difficult to manage the second round through the kiln, but the wish to exceed fine [[Chinese porcelain]] led to the development of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiraz Textile Fragment with Inscriptions with Name of Caliph al-Muti', 946-974.jpg|thumb|upright=&lt;!--size for low image--&gt;1.3|Tiraz Textile Fragment, 946–974 [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Though the common perception of Abbasid artistic production focuses largely on pottery, the greatest development of the Abbasid period was in textiles. Government-run workshops known as ''[[tiraz]]'' produced silks bearing the name of the monarch, allowing for aristocrats to demonstrate their loyalty to the ruler. Other silks were pictorial. The utility of silk-ware in wall decor, entrance adornment, and room separation was not as important as its cash value along the "[[silk route]]".

Calligraphy began to be used in surface decoration on pottery during this period. Illuminated [[Qur'an]]s gained attention, letter-forms now more complex and stylized to the point of slowing down the recognition of the words themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period (9th–15th centuries)===
Beginning in the 9th century, Abbasid sovereignty was contested in the provinces furthest removed from the Iraqi center. The creation of a [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] dynasty, that of the north African [[Fatimid]]s, followed by the [[Caliph of Córdoba|Umayyads in Spain]], gave force to this opposition, as well as small dynasties and autonomous governors in Iran.

====Spain and the Maghreb====

[[File:Pyxid Al Mughira OA 4068.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pyxis of al-Mughira]], Madinat al-Zahra, Spain, 968]]

The first Islamic dynasty to establish itself in Spain (or [[al-Andalus]]) was that of the Spanish Umayyads. As their name indicates, they were descended from the great Umayyads of Syria. After their fall, the Spanish Umayyads were replaced by various autonomous kingdoms, the [[taifa]]s (1031–91), but the artistic production from this period does not differ significantly from that of the Umayyads. At the end of the 11th century, two Berber tribes, the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]] and the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohads]], captured the head of the Maghreb and Spain, successively, bringing Maghrebi influences into art. A series of military victories by Christian monarchs had reduced Islamic Spain by the end of the 14th century to the city of [[Granada]], ruled by the Nasirid dynasty, who managed to maintain their hold until 1492.

Al-Andalus was a great cultural center of the Middle Ages. Besides the great universities, which taught philosophies and sciences yet unknown in Christendom (such as those of [[Averroes]]), the territory was an equally vital center for art.

Many techniques were employed in the manufacture of objects. Ivory was used extensively for the manufacture of boxes and caskets. The [[pyxis of al-Mughira]] is a masterwork of the genre. In metalwork, large sculptures in the round, normally rather scarce in the Islamic world, served as elaborate receptacles for water or as fountain spouts. A great number of textiles, most notably silks, were exported: many are found in the church treasuries of Christendom, where they served as covering for saints’ [[reliquaries]]. From the periods of [[Maghreb]]i rule one may also note a taste for painted and sculpted woodwork.

The art of north Africa is not as well studied. The Almoravid and Almohad dynasties are characterized by a tendency toward austerity, for example in mosques with bare walls. Nevertheless, luxury arts continued to be produced in great quantity. The Marinid and Hafsid dynasties developed an important, but poorly understood, architecture, and a significant amount of painted and sculpted woodwork.

====Arab Mashriq====
The Fatimid dynasty, which reigned in Egypt from 909 and 1171 introduced crafts and knowledge from politically troubled Baghdad to Cairo.

By the year 1070, the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]]s emerged as the dominant political force in the Muslim world after they liberated Baghdad and defeated the Byzantines at [[Manzikert]]. During the rule of [[Malik Shah I|Malik Shah]] the Seljuks excelled in architecture at the same time in Syria, the [[atabeg]]s (governors of Seljuk princes) assumed power. Quite independent, they capitalized on conflicts with the Frankish [[Crusades|crusaders]]. In 1171, [[Saladin]] seized Fatimid Egypt, and installed the transitory [[Ayyubid dynasty]] on the throne. This period is notable for innovations in metallurgy and the widespread manufacture of the Damascus steel swords and daggers and the production ceramics, glass and metalwork of a high quality were produced without interruption, and enameled glass became another important craft.

In 1250, the [[Mamluk]]s seized control of Egypt from the Ayyubids, and by 1261 had managed to assert themselves in Syria as well their most famous ruler was [[Baibars]]. The Mamluks were not, strictly speaking, a dynasty, as they did not maintain a patrilineal mode of succession; in fact, Mamluks were freed Turkish and Caucasian slaves, who (in theory) passed the power to others of like station. This mode of government persevered for three centuries, until 1517, and gave rise to abundant architectural projects (many thousands of buildings were constructed during this period), while patronage of luxury arts favored primarily enameled glass and metalwork, and is remembered as the golden age of medieval Egypt.  The "Baptistère de Saint-Louis" in the [[Louvre]] is an example of the very high quality of metalwork at this period.

====Iran and Central Asia====
[[File:SamarkandBibiKhanym.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]], [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]], built by [[Timur]] in 1399]]
In Iran and the north of India, the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirids]], [[Samanid]]s, [[Ghaznavids]], and [[Ghurids]] struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as [[Neyshabur|Nishapur]] and [[Ghazni]], and the construction of the Great Mosque of [[Isfahan]] (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated, while potters developed quite individual styles: kaleidoscopic ornament on a yellow ground; or marbled decorations created by allowing colored glazes to run; or painting with multiple layers of slip under the glaze.

The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]], nomads of Turkic origin from present-day Mongolia, appeared on the stage of Islamic history toward the end of the 10th century. They seized Baghdad in 1048, before dying out in 1194 in Iran, although the production of "Seljuq" works continued through the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century under the auspices of smaller, independent sovereigns and patrons. During their time, the center of culture, politics and art production shifted from [[Damascus]] and [[Baghdad]] to [[Merv]], [[Nishapur]], [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], and [[Isfahan]], all in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.89&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze and designed by anthropic figure with bull head Golestan, Gorgan 9th century CE, Early Islamic period.jpg|thumb|Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze, Gorgan, 9th century CE, Early Islamic period, National Museum of Iran]]
Popular patronage expanded because of a growing economy and new urban wealth.   Inscriptions in architecture tended to focus more on the patrons of the piece.  For example, sultans, viziers or lower ranking officials would receive often mention in inscriptions on mosques.  Meanwhile, growth in mass market production and sale of art made it more commonplace and accessible to merchants and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), p.91&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of increased production, many relics have survived from the Seljuk era and can be easily dated.  In contrast, the dating of earlier works is more ambiguous.  It is, therefore, easy to mistake Seljuk art as new developments rather than inheritance from classical Iranian and Turkic sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand (1999), Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware and the manufacture of vessels, not out of clay, but out of a [[silicon]] paste ("[[fritware]]"), while metalworkers began to encrust bronze with precious metals.  Across the Seljuk era, from Iran to Iraq, a unification of book painting can be seen.  These paintings have animalistic figures that convey strong symbolic meaning of fidelity, treachery, and courage.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.100&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th century, the [[Mongols]] under the leadership of [[Genghis Khan]] swept through the Islamic world. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons, forming many dynasties: the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] in China, the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] in Iran and the [[Golden Horde]] in northern Iran and southern Russia.

=====Ilkhanids=====
A rich civilization developed under these "little khans", who were originally subservient to the Yuan emperor, but rapidly became independent. Architectural activity intensified as the Mongols became sedentary, and retained traces of their nomadic origins, such as the north-south orientation of the buildings. At the same time a process of "iranisation" took place, and construction according to previously established types, such as the "Iranian plan" mosques, was resumed. The [[Persian miniature|art of the Persian book]] was also born under this dynasty, and was encouraged by aristocratic patronage of large manuscripts such as the ''[[Jami' al-tawarikh]]'' by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]. New techniques in ceramics appeared, such as the lajvardina (a variation on luster-ware), and Chinese influence is perceptible in all arts.

=====The Golden Horde and the Timurids=====
The early arts of the nomads of the Golden Horde are poorly understood. Research is only beginning, and evidence for town planning and architecture has been discovered. There was also a significant production of works in gold, which often show a strong Chinese influence. Much of this work is preserved today in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].

The beginning of the third great period of medieval Iranian art, that of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], was marked by the invasion of a third group of nomads, under the direction of [[Timur]]. During the 15th century this dynasty gave rise to a golden age in Persian manuscript painting, including renowned painters such as [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād]], but also a multitude of workshops and patrons.

====Syria, Iraq, Anatolia====
[[File:Erzurum Cifte Minareli Sunrise.JPG|thumb|[[Çifte Minareli Medrese]] in Erzurum. Before 1265]]
The Seljuq Turks pushed beyond Iran into Anatolia, winning a victory over the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (1071), and setting up a sultanate independent of the Iranian branch of the dynasty. Their power seems largely to have waned following the Mongol invasions in 1243, but coins were struck under their name until 1304. Architecture and objects synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. The art of woodworking was cultivated, and at least one illustrated manuscript dates to this period.

[[Caravanserai]]s dotted the major trade routes across the region, placed at intervals of a day's travel. The construction of these caravanserai [[inns]] improved in scale, fortification, and replicability. Also, they began to contain central mosques.

The [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] were nomads who settled in the area of [[Lake Van]]. They were responsible for a number of mosques, such as the [[The Blue Mosque of Tabriz|Blue Mosque]] in [[Tabriz]], and they had a decisive influence after the fall of the Anatolian Seljuqs. Starting in the 13th century, Anatolia was dominated by small Turkmen dynasties, which progressively chipped away at Byzantine territory. Little by little a major dynasty emerged, that of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]], who, after 1450, are referred to as the "first Ottomans". Turkmen artworks can be seen as the forerunners of Ottoman art, in particular the "Milet" ceramics and the first blue-and-white Anatolian works.

Islamic book painting witnessed its first golden age in the thirteenth century, mostly from Syria and Iraq. Influence from Byzantine visual vocabulary (blue and gold coloring, angelic and victorious motifs, symbology of drapery) combined with Mongoloid facial types in 12th-century [[book frontispiece]]s.

Earlier coinage necessarily featured Arabic [[epigraphy|epigraph]]s, but as Ayyubid society became more cosmopolitan and multi-ethnic, coinage began to feature [[astrology|astrological]], figural (featuring a variety of Greek, Seleucid, Byzantine, Sasanian, and contemporary Turkish rulers' busts), and animal images.

Hillenbrand suggests that the medieval Islamic texts called ''[[Maqama]]t'', copied and illustrated by [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti]] were some of the earliest "[[coffee table book]]s". They were among the first texts to hold up a mirror to daily life in Islamic art, portraying humorous stories and showing little to no inheritance of pictorial tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hillenbrand, p.128-131&lt;/ref&gt;

====Indian subcontinent====
[[File:RedFortAgra-Musamman-Burj-20080211-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] inlays at the  [[Agra Fort]], India.]]
The Indian subcontinent, some northern parts of which conquered by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids in the 9th century, did not become autonomous until 1206, when the Muizzi, or slave-kings, seized power, marking the birth of the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Later other competing sultanates were founded in [[Bengal]], [[Kashmir region|Kashmir]], [[Gujarat]], [[Jaunpur Sultanate|Jaunpur]], [[Malwa (Madhya Pradesh)|Malwa]], and in the north [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmanids]]). They separated themselves little by little from Persian traditions, giving birth to an original approach to architecture and urbanism, marked in particular by interaction with [[Hindu]] art. Study of the production of objects has hardly begun, but a lively art of manuscript illumination is known. The period of the sultanates ended with the arrival of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], who progressively seized their territories.

===The Three Empires===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}

====Ottomans====
[[File:Iznik ware 1500 1510.jpg|thumb|left|16th century [[İznik pottery]]]]
The [[Ottoman Empire]], whose origins lie in the 14th century, continued in existence until shortly after [[World War I]]. This impressive longevity, combined with an immense territory (stretching from Anatolia to Tunisia), led naturally to a vital and distinctive art, including plentiful architecture, mass production of ceramics for both tiles and vessels, most notably [[İznik pottery|Iznik ware]], important metalwork and jewellery, Turkish paper marbling [[Ebru]], [[Turkish carpet]]s as well as tapestries and exceptional [[Ottoman miniature]]s and decorative [[Ottoman illumination]].

Masterpieces of Ottoman manuscript illustration include the two "[[Surname-I Hümayun|books of festivals]]" (Surname-I Hümayun), one dating from the end of the 16th century, and the other from the era of Sultan [[Murad III]]. These books contain numerous illustrations and exhibit a strong [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] influence; thus they may have been inspired by books captured in the course of the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 16th century.

The Ottomans are also known for their development of a bright red pigment, "Iznik red", in ceramics, which reached their height in the 16th century, both in tile-work and pottery, using floral motifs that were considerably transformed from their Chinese and Persian models.  From the 18th century, Ottoman art came under considerable European influence, the Turks adopting versions of [[Rococo]] which had a lasting and not very beneficial effect, leading to over-fussy decoration.

====Mughals====
[[File:The marriage procession of Dara Shikoh - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|An illustrated manuscript of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] attending the marriage procession of his eldest son [[Dara Shikoh]]. Mughal-Era [[fireworks]] brightened the night throughout the wedding ceremony.]]
The [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] lasted from 1526 until (technically) 1858, although from the late 17th century power flowed away from the emperors to local rulers, and later European powers, above all the [[British Raj]], who were the main power in India by the late 18th century. The period is most notable for luxury arts of the court, and Mughal styles heavily influenced local Hindu and later [[Sikh]] rulers as well. The [[Mughal miniature]] began by importing Persian artists, especially a group brought back by [[Humayun]] when in exile in [[Safavid]] Persia, but soon local artists, many Hindu, were trained in the style.  Realistic portraiture, and images of animals and plants, was developed in Mughal art beyond what the Persians had so far achieved, and the size of miniatures increased, sometimes onto canvas.  The Mughal court had access to European prints and other art, and these had increasing influence, shown in the gradual introduction of aspects of Western [[graphical perspective]], and a wider range of poses in the human figure.  Some Western images were directly copied or borrowed from.  As the courts of local [[Nawab]]s developed, distinct provincial styles with stronger influence from traditional [[Indian painting]] developed in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts.

The arts of jewelry and [[hardstone carving]] of gemstones, such as [[jasper]], [[jade]], adorned with rubies, diamonds and emeralds are mentioned by the Mughal chronicler [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l Fazl]], and a range of examples survive; the series of hard stone daggers in the form of horses’ heads is particularly impressive.

The Mughals were also fine metallurgists they introduced [[Damascus steel]] and refined the locally produced [[Wootz steel]], the Mughals also introduced the "bidri" technique of metalwork in which silver motifs are pressed against a black background. Famous Mughal metallurgists like [[Ali Kashmiri]] and [[Muhammed Salih Thatawi]] created the [[wikt:seamless|seamless]] [[celestial globes]].

====Safavids and Qajars====
[[File:Sheykh lotfollah mosque.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to [[Sheykh Lotfollah mosque]], [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]], [[Isfahan]]]]
The Iranian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], a dynasty stretching from 1501 to 1786, is distinguished from the Mughal and Ottoman Empires, and earlier Persian rulers, in part through the Shi'a faith of its shahs, which they succeeded in making the majority denomination in Persia.  Ceramic arts are marked by the strong influence of Chinese porcelain, often executed in [[blue and white porcelain|blue and white]]. Architecture flourished, attaining a high point with the building program of [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas]] in [[Isfahan]], which included numerous gardens, palaces (such as [[Ālī Qāpū|Ali Qapu]]), an immense bazaar, and a [[Shah Mosque|large imperial mosque]].

[[File:Fes Medersa Bou Inania Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bou Inania Madrasa]], [[Fes]], [[Morocco]], [[zellige]] mosaic tiles forming elaborate [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]] [[tessellations]]]]

The art of manuscript illumination also achieved new heights, in particular in the [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] [[Shahnameh]], an immense copy of [[Ferdowsi]]’s poem containing more than 250 paintings. In the 17th century a new type of painting develops, based around the album ([[muraqqa]]). The albums were the creations of conoisseurs who bound together single sheets containing paintings, drawings, or calligraphy by various artists, sometimes excised from earlier books, and other times created as independent works. The paintings of [[Reza Abbasi]] figure largely in this new art of the book, depicting one or two larger figures, typically idealized beauties in a garden setting, often using the [[grisaille]] techniques previously used for border paintings for the background.

After the fall of the Safavids, the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]], a [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribe established from centuries on the banks of the [[Caspian Sea]], assumed power. Qajar art displays an increasing European influence, as in the large oil paintings portraying the Qajar shahs. Steelwork also assumed a new importance. Like the Ottomans, the Qajar dynasty survived until 1925, a few years after the First World War.

== Modern period ==
From the 15th century, the number of smaller Islamic courts began to fall, as the Ottoman Empire, and later the Safavids and European powers, swallowed them up; this had an effect on Islamic art, which was usually strongly led by the patronage of the court.  From at least the 18th century onwards, elite Islamic art was increasingly influenced by European styles, and in the applied arts either largely adopted Western styles, or ceased to develop, retaining whatever style was prevalent at some point in the late 18th or early 19th centuries.  Many industries with very long histories, such as [[Persian pottery|pottery in Iran]], largely closed, while others, like metalwork in [[brass]], became generally frozen in style, with much of their production going to tourists or exported as oriental exotica.

The carpet industry has remained large, but mostly uses designs that originated before 1700, and competes with machine-made imitations both locally and around the world.  Arts and crafts with a broader social base, like the [[zellige]] mosaic tiles of the [[Maghreb]], have often survived better.  Islamic countries have developed modern and contemporary art, with very vigorous art worlds in some countries, but the degree to which these should be grouped in a special category as "Islamic art" is questionable, although many artists deal with Islam-related themes, and use traditional elements such as calligraphy.  Especially in the oil-rich parts of the Islamic world much modern architecture and interior decoration makes use of motifs and elements drawn from the heritage of Islamic art.

'''John Zerzan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɜr|z|ə|n}} {{respell|ZUR|zən}}; born August 10, 1943) is an American [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[anarcho-primitivism|primitivist]] philosopher and author. His works criticize agricultural [[civilization]] as inherently oppressive, and advocate drawing upon the ways of life of [[hunter-gatherer]]s as an inspiration for what a free society should look like. Some subjects of his criticism include [[domestication]], [[language]], [[Anarcho-primitivism#Critique of symbolic culture|symbolic thought]] (such as [[mathematics]] and [[art]]) and the concept of time.

His six major books are ''Elements of Refusal'' (1988), ''[[Future Primitive and Other Essays]]'' (1994), ''Running on Emptiness'' (2002), ''[[Against Civilization: Readings and Reflections]]'' (2005), ''Twilight of the Machines'' (2008), and ''Why hope? The Stand Against Civilization'' (2015).

==Early life and education==
Zerzan was born in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], Oregon. He received his bachelor's degree from [[Stanford University]] and later received a master's degree in History from [[San Francisco State University]]. He completed his coursework towards a PhD at the [[University of Southern California]] but dropped out before completing his [[Thesis|dissertation]]. He is of [[Czechs|Czech]] descent.

==Zerzan's anarchism==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Zerzan's theories draw on [[Theodor Adorno]]'s concept of [[Negative Dialectics|negative dialectics]] to construct a theory of [[civilization]] as the cumulative construction of [[social alienation|alienation]].  According to Zerzan, original human societies in [[paleolithic]] times, and similar societies today such as the [[!Kung people|!Kung]] and [[Mbuti]], live a non-alienated and non-oppressive form of life based on [[Original Affluent Society|primitive abundance]] and closeness to nature. Constructing such societies as an instructive comparison against which to denounce contemporary (especially industrial) societies, Zerzan uses [[anthropology|anthropological]] studies from such societies as the basis for a wide-ranging critique of aspects of modern life. He portrays contemporary society as a world of misery built on the [[psychology|psychological]] production of a sense of scarcity and lack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/massmisery.htm John Zerzan – The Mass Psychology of Misery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323052844/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/massmisery.htm |date=March 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of civilization is the history of renunciation; what stands against this is not progress but rather the [[Utopia]] which arises from its negation.&lt;ref name=WhyPrimitivism&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whyprim.htm John Zerzan – Why Primitivism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214075548/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whyprim.htm |date=December 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan is an anarchist philosopher, and is broadly associated with the philosophies of [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[green anarchism]], anti-civilisation, [[post-left anarchy]], [[Neo-Luddism|neo-luddism]], and in particular the [[critique of technology]].&lt;ref name=GUARDIAN&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,475181,00.html John Zerzan] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He rejects not only the state, but all forms of hierarchical and authoritarian relations.  "Most simply, anarchy means 'without rule.' This implies not only a rejection of government but of all other forms of domination and power as well."&lt;ref name=WhatIsAnarchism&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatisanarchism.htm John Zerzan – What is Anarchism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101213/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatisanarchism.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan's work relies heavily on a strong dualism between the "primitive" – viewed as non-alienated, wild, non-hierarchical, ludic, and socially [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] – and the "civilised" – viewed as alienated, domesticated, hierarchically organised and socially discriminatory. Hence, "life before domestication/agriculture was in fact largely one of leisure, intimacy with nature, sensual wisdom, sexual equality, and health."&lt;ref name=FuturePrimitive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/future-primitive.htm |title=John Zerzan – Future Primitive |publisher=Primitivism.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan's claims about the status of primitive societies are based on a certain reading of the works of anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard B. Lee]]. Crucially, the category of primitives is restricted to pure hunter-gatherer societies with no domesticated plants or animals. For instance, hierarchy among Northwest Coast Native Americans whose main activities were fishing and foraging is attributed to their having domesticated dogs and tobacco.&lt;ref name=FuturePrimitive/&gt;&lt;ref name = RunningOnEmptiness/&gt;

Zerzan calls for a "Future Primitive", a radical reconstruction of society based on a rejection of alienation and an embracing of the wild.  "It may be that our only real hope is the recovery of a face-to-face social existence, a radical [[decentralization]], a dismantling of the devouring, estranging productionist, high-tech trajectory that is so impoverishing."&lt;ref name=WhatIsAnarchism/&gt; The usual use of anthropological evidence is comparative and demonstrative – the necessity or naturality of aspects of modern western societies is challenged by pointing to counter-examples in hunter-gatherer societies.  "Ever-growing documentation of human prehistory as a very long period of largely non-alienated life stands in sharp contrast to the increasingly stark failures of untenable modernity."&lt;ref name=WhyPrimitivism/&gt; It is unclear, however, whether this implies a re-establishment of the literal forms of hunter-gatherer societies or a broader kind of learning from their ways of life in order to construct non-alienated relations.

Zerzan's political project calls for the destruction of technology.  He draws the same distinction as [[Ivan Illich]], between tools that stay under the control of the user, and technological systems that draw the user into their control.  One difference is the [[division of labour]], which Zerzan opposes. In Zerzan's philosophy, technology is possessed by an [[elite]] which automatically has power over other users; this power is one of the sources of alienation, along with [[domestication]] and [[symbol]]ic thought.

Zerzan's typical method is to take a particular construct of civilisation (a technology, belief, practice or institution) and construct an account of its historical origins, what he calls its destructive and alienating effects and its contrasts with hunter-gatherer experiences.  In his essay on number, for example, Zerzan starts by contrasting the "civilized" emphasis on counting and measuring with a "primitive" emphasis on sharing, citing [[Dorothy D. Lee|Dorothy Lee]]'s work on the [[Trobriand Islands|Trobriand Islanders]] in support, before constructing a narrative of the rise of number through cumulative stages of state domination, starting with the desire of [[Egypt]]ian kings to measure what they ruled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/number.htm John Zerzan – Number: Its Origin and Evolution] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618100924/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/number.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach is repeated in relation to time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/time.htm John Zerzan – Time and its Discontents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101958/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/time.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gender inequality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/patriarchy.htm John Zerzan – Patriarchy, Civilization, and the Origins of Gender] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206011455/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/patriarchy.htm |date=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; work,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/organisedlabour.htm John Zerzan – Organized Labor versus "The Revolt Against Work"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101748/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/organisedlabour.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/technology.htm John Zerzan – Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101934/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/technology.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; art and ritual,&lt;ref name=RunningOnEmptiness&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/emptiness.htm |title=John Zerzan – Running on Emptiness: The Failure of Symbolic Thought |publisher=Primitivism.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; agriculture&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/agriculture.htm John Zerzan – Agriculture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831022318/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/agriculture.htm |date=August 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and globalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/globalization.htm John Zerzan – Globalization and its Apologists: An Abolitionist Perspective] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206011133/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/globalization.htm |date=February 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zerzan also writes more general texts on anarchist,&lt;ref name=WhatIsAnarchism/&gt; primitivist theory,&lt;ref name=WhyPrimitivism/&gt;&lt;ref name=FuturePrimitive/&gt; and critiques of "[[postmodernism]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100618100950/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/pmanarchist.htm John Zerzan – "Hakim Bey," Postmodern Anarchist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zerzan was one of the editors of ''[[Green Anarchy]]'', a controversial journal of anarcho-primitivist and [[insurrectionary anarchist]] thought. He is also the host of ''Anarchy Radio'' in Eugene on the [[University of Oregon]]'s radio station [[KWVA]]. He has also served as a contributing editor at ''[[Anarchy Magazine]]'' and has been published in magazines such as ''[[AdBusters]]''. He does extensive speaking tours around the world, and is married to an independent consultant to museums and other [[nonprofit organization]]s.

==Political development==
In 1966, Zerzan was arrested while performing [[civil disobedience]] at a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] anti-[[Vietnam War]] march and spent two weeks in the [[Contra Costa County]] [[county jail|Jail]]. He vowed after his release never again to be willingly arrested. He attended events organized by [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] and was involved with the [[psychedelic drug]] and [[psychedelic music|music]] scene in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/18/mayday.features11 |title=Profile of American anarchist John Zerzan &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |date=April 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s he worked as a [[social worker]] for the city of San Francisco [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] department. He helped organize a social worker's [[trade union|union]], the SSEU, and was elected vice president in 1968, and president in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/nopaid/main.html History of the union] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828045251/http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/nopaid/main.html |date=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The local [[Situationist International|Situationist]] group Contradiction denounced him as a "[[leftist]] [[bureaucracy|bureaucrat]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contradiction |url=http://www.bopsecrets.org/PH/zerzan.htm |title=Open Letter to John Zerzan, anti-bureaucrat of the San Francisco Social Services Employees Union |publisher=Bopsecrets.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Black and Red Press published ''Unions Against Revolution'' by Spanish [[ultra-left]] theorist [[Grandizo Munis]] that included an essay by Zerzan which previously appeared in the journal ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]''.  Over the next 20 years, Zerzan became intimately involved with the ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'', ''Demolition Derby '' and other anarchist periodicals. He began to question civilization in the early 80's, after having sought to confront issues around the neutrality of technology and division of labour, at the time when [[Fredy Perlman]] was making similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/john_zerzan |title=Interview: Anarcho-Primitivist Thinker and Activist John Zerzan &amp;#124; CORRUPT.org: Conservation &amp; Conservatism |publisher=CORRUPT.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002121547/http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/john_zerzan |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw civilization itself as the root of the problems of the world and that a hunter-gatherer form of society presented the most [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian model]] for human relations with themselves and the natural world.

==Zerzan and the "Unabomber"==
In the mid-1990s, Zerzan became a confidant to [[Theodore Kaczynski]], the "Unabomber", after he read ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', the so-called ''Unabomber Manifesto.''  Zerzan sat through the Unabomber trial and often conversed with Kaczynski during the proceedings.  After Zerzan became known as a friend of the Unabomber, the mainstream media became interested in Zerzan and his ideas.

On May 7, 1995, a full-page interview with Zerzan was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3DD113FF934A35756C0A963958260 Prominent Anarchist Finds Unsought Ally in Serial Bomber] (New York Times article)&lt;/ref&gt; In Zerzan's essay "Whose Unabomber?" (1995), he signaled his support for the Kaczynski doctrine, but criticised the bombings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he mailing of explosive devices intended for the agents who are engineering the present catastrophe is too random. Children, mail carriers, and others could easily be killed. Even if one granted the legitimacy of striking at the high-tech horror show by terrorizing its indispensable architects, collateral harm is not justifiable ...&lt;ref name=WhoseUnabomber&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm John Zerzan – Whose Unabomber?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618101228/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm |date=June 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Zerzan in the same essay offered a qualified defense of the Unabomber's actions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The concept of justice should not be overlooked in considering the Unabomber phenomenon. In fact, except for his targets, when have the many [[little Eichmanns]] who are preparing the [[Brave New World]] ever been called to account?... Is it unethical to try to stop those whose contributions are bringing an unprecedented assault on life?&lt;ref name=WhoseUnabomber/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two years later, in the 1997 essay "He Means It&amp;nbsp;— Do You?," Zerzan wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Enter the Unabomber and a new line is being drawn. This time the bohemian schiz-fluxers, Green yuppies, hobbyist anarcho-journalists, condescending organizers of the poor, hip nihilo-aesthetes and all the other "anarchists" who thought their pretentious pastimes would go on unchallenged indefinitely&amp;nbsp;— well, it's time to pick which side you're on. It may be that here also is a [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon]] from which there will be no turning back.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2001 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Will there be other Kaczynskis? I hope not. I think that activity came out of isolation and desperation, and I hope that isn't going to be something that people feel they have to take up because they have no other way to express their opposition to the brave new world.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2014 interview Zerzan stated that he and Kaczynski were "not on terms anymore." He criticized his former friend's 2008 essay "[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-truth-about-primitive-life-a-critique-of-anarchoprimitivism The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Anarchoprimitivism]" and expressed disapproval of [[Individuals Tending Towards the Savage|Individuals Tending Towards the Wild]], a Mexican group influenced by the Unabomber's bombing campaign.&lt;ref name="vice.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/john-zerzan-wants-us-to-give-up-all-of-our-technology |title=The Anarcho-Primitivist Who Wants Us All To Give Up Technology |work=Vice Media Inc |location=USA |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zerzan and the Eugene Anarchist Scene==
{{see also|1999 Seattle WTO protests}}
Zerzan was associated with the [[Eugene, Oregon anarchist scene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|title=Part. III: Eco-Anarchy Imploding|newspaper=[[Eugene Weekly]]|date=November 22, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403004049/http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|archive-date=April 3, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism: history, catastrophe and anarchism==
In his essay "Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm", [[Murray Bookchin]] directed criticism from an anarchist point of view at Zerzan's anti-civilizational and anti-technological perspective. He argued that Zerzan's representation of hunter-gatherers was flawed, selective and often patronisingly racist, that his analysis was superficial, and that his practical proposals were nonsensical.

Aside from Murray Bookchin, several other anarchist critiques of Zerzan's primitivist philosophies exist. The pamphlet, "Anarchism vs. Primitivism" by Brian Oliver Sheppard criticizes many aspects of the primitivist philosophy.&lt;ref name="Libcom.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/anarchism-vs-primitivism |title=Anarchism vs. Primitivism by Brian Oliver Sheppard |publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It specifically rejects the claim that primitivism is a form of anarchism.

Some authors, such as Andrew Flood, have argued that destroying civilization would lead to the death of a significant majority of the population, mainly in poor countries.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1451 |title=Civilization, Primitivism, Anarchism by Andrew Flood |publisher=Anarkismo.net |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Zerzan responded to such claims by suggesting a gradual decrease in population size, with the possibility of people having the need to seek means of sustainability more close to nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/fp.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910091422/http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/fp.htm |date=September 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flood suggests this contradicts Zerzan's claims elsewhere, and adds that, since it is certain that most people will strongly reject Zerzan's supposed utopia, it can only be implemented by authoritarian means, against the will of billions.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo.net"/&gt;

In his essay "Listen Anarchist!", Chaz Bufe criticized the primitivist position from an anarchist perspective, pointing out that primitivists are extremely vague about exactly which technologies they advocate keeping and which they seek to abolish, noting that smallpox had been eradicated thanks to medical technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.seesharppress.com/listen.html| author=Chaz Bufe| title=Listen Anarchist!| publisher=See Sharp Press| year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodore J. Kaczynski]], better known as the [[Unabomber]], is a surprisingly harsh critic of the current Anarcho-Primitivist mainstream and Zerzan in particular for what he sees as a foolish and invalid projection of leftist values such as gender equality, pacifism and leisure time onto the primitive way of life. Kaczynski holds that the values of gender equality, pacifism, leisure time, etc., while still admirable, are exactly the values of techno-industrial civilization and its promised techno-utopia. Second, he holds that having such an interpretation is counter-productive to the ultimate anti-civilization/anti-tech goal as it attracts "leftist types" who are by nature uncommitted and act to dilute the movement.  Kaczynski insists that the core values of freedom, autonomy, dignity, and human fulfillment must be emphasized above all others.&lt;ref&gt;Technological Slavery: The collected writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, pp. 128–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Käthe Fanny Schuftan''' (12 January 1899 – 21 February 1958) was a German Jewish artist whose paintings and drawings expressed both human suffering and the aspiration of spirit,&lt;ref&gt;Tribute given at her funeral by [[Eugene Halliday]], {{cite web|url=http://www.eugenehalliday.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Halliday-Review-Winter-2012-2013-Vol-2-Issue-2.pdf|title=Halliday Review Winter 2012–2013|accessdate=1 February 2015}} p. 21 (22 of pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid 20th century. Josef Paul Hodin wrote that she "worked in an Expressionist style reminiscent of [[Käthe Kollwitz]]' social pathos".&lt;ref name="Hodin"&gt;Josef Paul Hodin, "[[John Milne (sculptor)|John Milne]]: sculptor, life and work", London: Latimer New Dimensions 1977, Section 2, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; An artist at the time of the [[Weimar culture]], she was tortured and imprisoned by the Nazis in the early 1930s, and her work was destroyed. She escaped in 1939, arriving in [[Manchester]], England, not long before the outbreak of the [[World War II]]; she lived and worked there until her death in 1958.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;Obituary, by [[Margo Ingham]], ''[[The Guardian|The Manchester Guardian]]'', 24 February 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breslau==
Käthe Fanny Schuftan was born on 12 January 1899 in [[Breslau]], now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]; her father was the chemist Dr. Georg Schuftan, her mother Else née Mugdan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archeion.net/repo/82/1425/PL_82_1425_0_0_337/index.djvu|title=Archiwum Państwowe we Wrocławiu, sygn. 1425 (Standesamt Breslau I), seria 1 (Geburtenregister), 1899, tom 1|accessdate=1 February 2015}} Nr. 88, p. 49/206 in DejaVu version&lt;/ref&gt; The chemist [[Paul Schuftan]] was her older brother.

==Berlin==
In Berlin, Käthe Schuftan and her younger sister Lotte were involved in underground activities of the SAP.&lt;ref name="Urteil"&gt;de Gruyter online database ''National Socialism, Holocaust, Resistance and Exile 1933–1945'', {{cite web|url=http://db.saur.de/DGO/basicFullCitationView.jsf?documentId=wh41|title=Urteil 2H 20/34 – 8J 1713/33|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1933, she was detained and tortured by the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] at the former Volkshaus (People's House) in [[Berlin]]-[[Charlottenburg]],&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Rainer Sandvoß, ''Die "andere" Reichshauptstadt: Widerstand aus der Arbeiterbewegung in Berlin von 1933 bis 1945'', Berlin: Lukas 2007, pp. 195–196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.klausenerplatz-kiez.de/archive/2011/09/19/rede_zur_einweihung_der_stele|title=Dr. Heinrich-Wilhelm Wörmann, Rede zur Einweihung der Stele zur Erinnerung an das Volkshaus Charlottenburg am 10.

==Manchester==

Schuftan arrived in [[Manchester]], England in June 1939.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; During the war years she worked in a munitions factory.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Her obituary stated that after the war she earned her living at commercial art. She had two one-person shows of her work and exhibited in group exhibitions in Manchester.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Schuftan befriended the young [[John Milne (sculptor)|John Milne]] who later went on to work as an assistant to [[Barbara Hepworth]] before making his own career.&lt;ref name="Hodin" /&gt; Her work was selected for the annual exhibition of the [[Manchester Academy of Fine Arts]] three times between 1940–1942.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Academy of Fine Arts Exhibition Catalogues 1940, 1941, 1942, Manchester City Art Gallery Archive&lt;/ref&gt; She exhibited with the [[Manchester Group]], which included [[L.

'''''La Caricature''''' was a satirical weekly published French periodical that was distributed in Paris between 1830 and 1843 during the [[July Monarchy]].  Its cartoons repeatedly attacked King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]], whom it typically depicted as a pear.

==History==
[[File:Caricature Charles Philipon pear.jpg|thumb|The famous cartoon of Louis Philippe as a pear, drawn by [[Honoré Daumier]] after the sketch by [[Charles Philipon]] and published in ''La Caricature'' in 1831]]
''La Caricature morale, politique et littéraire'' was published from 1830 to 1843.  Auguste Audibert was editor and [[Charles Philipon]] (1800–61) was director and main author.{{sfn|La Caricature ... Gallica}} Honoré de Balzac and Louis Desnoyers assisted Philipon in writing some of the magazines issues. Primary artists were Honoré Daumier and Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville with caricature contributions from many artists including  Henry Monnier, Alexandre Decamps, Auguste Raffet, Paul Gavarni, Achille Devéria, Auguste Desperret, Eugène Forest, Benjamin Roubaud. The journal was founded after the censorship laws had been relaxed following the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 in which Louis Philippe came to power. It covered both politics and art. 251 issues appeared between 1830 and 1835, each of four pages, with two or three lithographs.{{sfn|Mellby|2009}}

Philipon was the owner of the largest printing house in Paris equipped with lithographic presses, and used them to print ''La Caricature'' and ''[[Le Charivari]]'', another illustrated paper. He drew together a group of skilled artists who mostly worked for these two papers, through which they attacked the king and the system of government with growing violence.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=3}} The major contributors were [[Honoré Daumier]] (1808–79) and [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville]] (1803–47), but there were many others.{{sfn|Mellby|2009}} For example, a caricature by [[Jules David]] appeared in ''La Caricature'' of 31 May 1831.  The king is depicted as an illusionist who uses the ''[[juste milieu]]'' and some ''poudre de non-intervention'' to make liberty and revolution vanish.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=75}}

In 1830–31 there were revolutionary uprisings in Italy. The Austrians intervened to suppress the revolts, and the French did nothing to prevent them. The Pope broke his promise to grant the rebels in the [[Papal States]] an amnesty. ''La Caricature'' published a cartoon that showed the Pope on his throne surrounded by corpses.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=75}} Similarly, Philipon published cartoons that associated the French government with that of Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] when Russia suppressed a revolt in Poland. The fall of Warsaw was announced by [[Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta|Horace Sebastiani]], the French foreign minister, as "L'ordre règne à Varsovie" (Order reigns in Warsaw). The phrase was used as a caption for one of the cartoons.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=76}}

The journal became increasingly vocal in its opposition to Louis-Philippe, and was seized more than twelve times. The publishers were prosecuted, and Philipon was jailed for a year. In 1835 the government passed legislation that forced ''La Caricature'' to cease publication.{{sfn|Mellby|2009}} The journal began publication again in 1838 and continued until 1843.{{sfn|La Caricature ... Gallica}} Writing in 1840, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] talked of the "curious contest between the State and M. Philipon's little army."{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=3}} Thackery wrote,
{{quote|Half-a-dozen poor artists on the one side, and his Majesty Louis-Philippe, his august family, and the numberless [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]] and supporters of his monarchy, on the other.... The King of the French suffered so much, his ministers were so mercilessly ridiculed, his family and his own remarkable figure drawn with such odious and grotesque resemblance, in fanciful attitudes, circumstances, and disguises, so ludicrously mean, and so often appropriate, that the King was obliged to descend into the lists and battle his ridiculous enemies in form.{{sfn|Kerr|2000|p=4}} }}

==Historical overview==

''Las Damas Romanas'' is one of the early works of Luna as a painter that resurfaced in the past quarter of a century after being thought lost or missing.&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atrium&gt;[http://www.atrium-media.com/rogueclassicism/Posts/00008851.html Lost Luna work found], rogueclassicism, atrium-media.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Before its reappearance in Paris many years before 2008&lt;!--did it reappear in 2008, or "many years before"?--&gt;, it had been documented only as a title and as a listed work of Luna in the 1957 biography of Luna written by Carlos E. Da Silva.  The painting had also been documented through a black and white photograph from the files of Alfonso T. Ongpin, a historian and pre-war art dealer.  In 1980, the image from Ongpin was reprinted by Santiago Pilar&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt; in the book "Juan Luna: The Filipino As Painter".&lt;ref name=Ocampo/&gt;

==Description==
 
The concept for the 100 cm x 170 cm size&lt;ref name=Ocampo/&gt; painting was based by Luna on [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[Roman history|history]].  It depicted a domestic scene in ancient [[Roman citizenship|Roman]] life, portraying two [[Women in Ancient Rome|women]] lying on the steps of a house.  The hand of one [[List of Roman women|woman]] was holding the [[rein]]s of two pet dogs&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt; or hunting dogs,&lt;ref name=Art/&gt; in order to prevent them from scaring away some [[dove]]s.&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt;  The doves symbolized divinity&lt;ref name=Art/&gt;  The background of the painting presented a shelf of artifacts.  To the left of the shelf was a [[shrine]] with a [[pediment]] shaped like a triangle.  In front of the pediment was a [[Oil burner|burner]] with a smoking [[incense]].&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt;
 
There are three major elements of ''Las Damas Romanas'', namely the women, the dogs, and the doves.  Roman life involved having dogs because they were employed by the ancient Romans for hunting activities, guardians of the home and their property, and as pets.  In Luna's painting, the leashed pet dogs were acting as companions of women.  Doves, on the other hand, were animals that connote [[eroticism]].&lt;ref name=Christies/&gt;  In relation to one of the women, there was a suggestion that the woman on the right with dark hair could be Maria de la Paz Pardo de Tavera&lt;!--explain who this is--&gt;.  The notion was discarded because Luna was unmarried when he painted ''Las Damas Romanas''.&lt;ref name=Ocampo/&gt;

Luna finished ''Las Damas Romanas'' after winning a silver medal for ''[[The Death of Cleopatra]]'' painting in 1881 and before obtaining a gold medal for the masterpiece ''[[Spoliarium]]'' in 1884 (both were presented during the Madrid Exposition during the years mentioned).&lt;ref name=Christies&gt;Ocampo, Ambeth R.

==Valuation==
Long thought lost or missing, the painting emerged in an estate sale outside Paris, France, before&lt;!--just before?  long before?--&gt; 2008.  During this art auction, the painting was originally priced between 10,000 and 20,000 [[euro]]s ([[Philippine peso|₱]]623,000 and ₱1.3 million), a range that rose to greater than 200,000 euros (₱12.4 million) when the painting was bought by a French art dealer.  The painting was auctioned once again on November 30, 2008, at [[Christie's]] in [[Hong Kong]] with an estimated value ranging from [[US dollar|$]]1 million to $1.2 million,&lt;ref name=Ocampo/&gt; the equivalent of [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]8,000,000 to HK$10,000,000.&lt;ref name=Art&gt;[http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=26674&amp;int_modo=2 ''(...)

'''''Leda Atomica''''' is a painting by [[Salvador Dalí]], made in 1949. The picture depicts [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]], the mythological queen of [[Sparta]], with the [[swan]]. Leda is a frontal portrait of Dalí's wife, [[Gala Dalí|Gala]], who is seated on a pedestal with a swan suspended behind and to her left. Different objects such as a book, a set square, two stepping stools and an egg float around the main figure. In the background on both sides, the rocks of [[Cap Norfeu]] (on the [[Costa Brava]] in [[Catalonia]], between [[Roses, Girona|Roses]] and [[Cadaqués]]) define the location of the image.

The painting is exhibited in the [[Dalí Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]].

==Mythological background==

Leda was admired by [[Zeus]], who seduced her in the guise of a swan on her wedding night when she slept with her husband [[Tyndareus]]. This double consummation of her marriage resulted in two eggs, each of them hatching twins: from the first egg [[Castor and Pollux]], and from the second [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]].

==Structure of the painting==
''Leda Atomica'' is organized according to a rigid mathematical framework, following the "[[golden ratio|divine proportion]]". Leda and the swan are set in a pentagon inside which has been inserted a five-point star of which Dalí made several sketches. The five points of the star symbolize the seeds of perfection: love, order, light (truth) willpower and word (action).
 
The harmony of the framework was calculated by the artist following the recommendations of Romanian mathematician [[Matila Ghyka]]. Unlike his contemporaries who took the view that mathematics distracted from or interrupted artistic inspiration, Dalí considered that any work of art, to be such, had to be based on composition and calculation.&lt;ref name="Maurell"&gt;{{cite web |first=Rosa M. |last=Maurell |title= Mythological References in the work of Salvador Dalí: the myth of Leda |work=Centre for Dalinian Studies |location= Hora Nova |date= May 30, 2000 |url=http://www.salvador-dali.org/serveis/ced/articles/en_article2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghyka's influence is clear in the mathematical formula of the [[golden ratio]] in the lower right of the image

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

which Ghyka specifically cites to calculate the side of a regular pentagon.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;Elliott H. King  - Dalí Atomicus, or the Prodigious Adventure of the Lacemaker and the Rhinoceros - Society for Literature and Science Annual Meeting  October 10–13, 2002, Pasadena, California [http://sls-2002.caltech.edu/king_paper.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism of the painting==

After the atomic bomb was dropped on [[Hiroshima]], Dalí took his work in a new direction based on the principle that the modern age had to be assimilated into art if art was to be truly contemporary. Dalí acknowledged the discontinuity of matter, incorporating a mysterious sense of levitation into his ''Leda Atomica''. Just as one finds that at the atomic level particles do not physically touch, so here Dalí suspends even the water above the shore—an element that would figure into many other later works.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; Every object in the painting is carefully painted to be motionless in space, even though nothing in the painting is connected. Leda looks as if she is trying to touch the back of the swan’s head, but doesn’t do it.

Dalí himself described the painting in the following way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Dalí shows us the hierarchized libidinous emotion, suspended and as though hanging in midair, in accordance with the modern 'nothing touches' theory of intra-atomic physics. Leda does not touch the swan; Leda does not touch the pedestal; the pedestal does not touch the base; the base does not touch the sea; the sea does not touch the shore. . . .''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934162,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |title=And Now to Make Masterpieces - Time. December 8, 1947 |publisher=Time.com |date=1947-12-08 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In reference to the classical myth Dalí identified himself with the immortal [[Castor and Pollux|Pollux]] while his deceased older brother (also called Salvador) would represent [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], the mortal of the twins. Another equivalence could be made regarding the other twins of the myth, Dalí’s sister Ana María being the mortal Clytemnestra, while Gala would represent divine Helen.&lt;ref name="Maurell"/&gt;  Salvador Dalí himself wrote: "I started to paint Leda Atómica which exalts Gala, the metaphysical goddess and succeeded to create the ‘suspended space’".

Dalí’s Catholicism enables also other interpretations of the painting. The painting can be conceived as Dalí's way of interpreting the [[Annunciation]]. The swan seems to whisper her future in her ear, possibly a reference to the legend that the conception of [[Jesus]] was achieved by the introduction of the breath of the [[Holy Ghost]] into the Virgin Mary’s ear. Leda looks straight into the bird's eyes with an understanding expression of what is happening to her and what will happen in the future to her and to her unsure reality. Dalí's transformation of Mary is the result of love as if he created his love to Gala, like God to Mary.&lt;ref name="Leda"&gt;[http://www.planetpapers.com/Assets/1368.php Leda Atomica] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207071754/http://www.planetpapers.com/Assets/1368.php |date=February 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Murals in Northern Ireland''' have become symbols of [[Northern Ireland]], depicting the region's past and present political and religious divisions.

[[Belfast]] and [[Derry]] contain arguably the most famous political [[murals]] in [[Europe]]. It is believed that almost 2,000 murals have been documented since the 1970s. In 2014, the book, ''The Belfast Mural Guide'' estimated that, in Belfast, there were approximately 300 quality murals on display, with many more in varying degrees of age and decay. Murals commemorate, communicate and display aspects of culture and history. The themes of murals often reflect what is important to a particular community. A mural therefore exists to express an idea or message and could generally be seen as reflecting values held dear to that community.

In [[Irish republican]] areas the themes of murals can range from the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]], with particular emphasis on strike leader [[Bobby Sands]]; murals of international solidarity with revolutionary groups are equally common, as are those which highlight a particular issue, for example the [[Ballymurphy Massacre]] or the [[McGurk's Bar bombing]]. In working class [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] communities, murals are used to promote [[Ulster loyalist]] paramilitary groups such as the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] and commemorate their deceased members. However traditional themes such as [[William III of England]] and the [[Battle of the Boyne]], the [[Battle of the Somme]] and the [[36th Ulster Division]] are equally common.&lt;ref&gt;Maxamillian Rapp: Murals in Ulster: Symbol kultureller Revolution im nordirischen Bürgerkrieg. In: KultuRRevolution Nr. 61/62 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Early loyalist mural.jpg|thumb|A Loyalist political mural in Londonderry circa 1920]]
Murals can be described as a mirror of political change, as they have been painted throughout the last century and display all important historic as well as political developments in the scope of unique wall paintings. In 1908 [[Ulster loyalist]]s started to portray [[William III of England]] on a white horse in order to strengthen the [[Orange Order|Orange identity]] of [[Ulster Protestants]]. [[Irish republican]] wall-paintings started in the late 1970s and can be seen in particular as a visual display of a social movement, which was radicalized after the IRA began to fight for a greater political voice and a [[United Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Rapp and Markus Rhomberg: The importance of Murals during the Troubles: Analyzing the republican use of wall paintings in Northern Ireland. In: Machin, D. (Ed.) Visual Communication Reader. De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Murals are for the most part located in working class areas of Northern Ireland, primarily in [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]].  Arguably the most well-known and easily identified mural is that of [[Bobby Sands]], on the side wall of [[Sinn Féin]]'s [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] office.  A close second is the collection of Irish republican and international-themed murals which are located at what is known as 'The International Wall', also in Belfast. In Derry, [[Free Derry Corner]], where the slogan "You Are Now Entering Free Derry" was painted in 1969 shortly after the [[Battle of the Bogside]], is prominent. Not everyone considers Free Derry Corner to be a true mural, as it consists only of words and not images. Free Derry Corner has been used as a model for other murals in Northern Ireland, including the "You Are Now Entering Loyalist Sandy Row" mural in Belfast, which was a response to the republican message of Free Derry Corner, and the "You Are Now Entering ''[[Derry Journal]]'' Country" mural, which is an advertisement for a Derry publication.

Not all murals in Northern Ireland are directly political or sectarian in nature, with some commemorating events such as the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]], and other moments in [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]. Many portray events from [[Irish mythology]], and images from Irish myths are often incorporated into political murals. A few murals avoid the subject of Ireland altogether, instead focusing on such neutral subjects as litter prevention and the [[C. S. Lewis]] novel ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''. Murals representing peace and tolerance are becoming increasingly popular with school groups who have children either design or actually paint murals in areas around their schools. With many paramilitaries now involved in community work, there has been a move to decommission many of the hard-edged murals across Northern Ireland (although this trend is reversed in times of tension).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4562793.stm |title= Old masters change murals |accessdate=28 November 2008 |last=  |first= |coauthors= |date= 31 May 2005 |work= |publisher= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change was further highlighted in 2007, when the [[Bogside Artists]] were invited to Washington, D.C. for the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] Folk Life Festival. The three artists were invited to recreate murals in the [[National Mall|Washington Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6231216.stm |title= Painting a New Image of NI |accessdate=28 November 2008 |last= Taggart |first= Maggie |coauthors= |date= 22 June 2007 |work= |publisher= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48420">'''Protestant views on [[contraception]]''' are markedly more pluralistic than the views expressed by the [[Magisterium]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], due to historical divergences of theological thought that began during the [[Protestant Reformation]], including the rejection of an infallible doctrinal authority other than Scripture. The doctrine of Protestantism from the Reformation until 1930 strongly condemned contraception. Since the 1930 Seventh Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion, major Protestant denominations shifted their doctrine to accepting contraception. 
In general, most liberal Protestants and Anglicans hold relatively settled views that accept use of contraception, while debate is ongoing among conservative Evangelicals, especially as to which types are and are not acceptable. Others, such as [[Laestadian Lutheran|Laestadian Lutheran Church]]es do not permit the use of birth control.&lt;ref name="Kivisto2014"/&gt;

==Denominational positions==

===Anglicanism===
[[The Church of England]] has stated in the 1958 Lambeth Conference that the responsibility for deciding upon the number and frequency of children was laid by God upon the consciences of parents 'in such ways as are acceptable to husband and wife'.&lt;ref name="anglican"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/socialpublic/smte.html#contraception|title=Statements on Science, Medicine, Technology &amp; Environment|accessdate=2006-10-01|publisher=The Church of England|year=2005|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810021928/http://www.cofe.anglican.org/info/socialpublic/smte.html#contraception &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheranism===
The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] allows for contraception in the event the potential parents do not intend to care for a child.&lt;ref&gt;''When a woman and man join their bodies sexually, both should be prepared to provide for a child, should conception occur. When that is not their intention, the responsible use of safe, effective contraceptives is expected of the male and the female.''{{cite web|url=http://www.elca.org/faithfuljourney/pdf/study01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Journey Together Faithfully: ELCA Studies on Sexuality, Part One |accessdate=2006-10-01 |publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church in America |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060929001942/http://www.elca.org/faithfuljourney/pdf/study01.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Lutheran churches or synods take other positions, or do not take any position at all. For example, in 1990 the [[Lutheran Churches of the Reformation]] passed a resolution titled "Procreation" stating that birth control, in all forms, is sin, although they "allow for exegetical differences and exceptional cases (casuistry)", for example, when the woman's life is at risk.&lt;ref&gt;See http://lutheransandcontraception.blogspot.com/2006/01/gods-word-and-procreation.html .

The LCR also notes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Such was the united teaching of [[Martin Luther|Dr. Martin Luther]] and the "Old [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Missouri]]" fathers ([[C. F. W. Walther|C.F.W. Walther]], [[Franz Pieper|F. Pieper]], A.L. Graebner, C.M. Zorn, W.H.T. Dau, J.T. Mueller, W. Dallman, F. Bente, E.W.A. Koehler, L. Fuerbringer, T. Engelder, Th. Laetsch, G. Luecke, [[Walter A. Maier|W.A. Maier]], M.J. Naumann, et al.) and LCR leaders such as P.E. Kretzmann and W.H. McLaughlin.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Likewise, the Hausvater Project (not an LCR organization) states,&lt;blockquote&gt;We therefore find ourselves sympathetic to the long-standing consensus of Lutheran church fathers from the Reformation through the mid twentieth century that neither abortion, abortifacient birth control, nor barrier contraception should be practiced. See http://www.hausvater.org/faqs.php&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laestadian Lutheran|Laestadian Lutheran Church]]es do not permit the use of birth control.&lt;ref name="Kivisto2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kivisto|first=Peter|title=Religion and Immigration: Migrant Faiths in North America and Western Europe|date=16 October 2014|publisher=Wiley|language=English |isbn=9780745686660|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) nor the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) have an official position on contraception.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031226232737/http://www.lcms.org/pages/internal.asp?NavID=2122 What is the LCMS stance on voluntary contraception?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080102121628/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=27&amp;cuItem_itemID=490 WELS Topical Q&amp;A: Birth Issues]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=meIpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;vq ''Birth Control a Curse''], a Lutheran Witness (LCMS) reprint of a Northwestern Lutheran (WELS) article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Concordia Cyclopedia, an LCMS reference book, condemns contraception, Fuerbringer, L., ''[https://archive.org/details/concordiacyclope009499mbp Concordia Cyclopedia]'' Concordia Publishing House. 1927. p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; Christian News, a weekly paper edited by a pastor of an LCMS congregation, opposes contraception.&lt;ref&gt;"Christian News is one of the few religious publications which still defends the position most of Christendom took opposing birth control until the resolution of the Anglican’s Lambeth Conference in 1930." &lt;cite&gt;Otten, Herman, Larry Marquardt: Founder—Christian Life Resources. Christian News Vol. 46., No.47. p.5 (December 8, 2008)&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodism===
The [[United Methodist Church]], holds that "each couple has the right and the duty prayerfully and responsibly to control conception according to their circumstances."  Its Resolution on Responsible Parenthood states that in order to "support the sacred dimensions of personhood, all possible efforts should be made by parents and the community to ensure that each child enters the world with a healthy body, and is born into an environment conducive to realization of his or her potential." To this end, the United Methodist Church supports "adequate public funding and increased participation in family planning services by public and private agencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc-gbcs.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=fsJNK0PKJrH&amp;b=848309&amp;content_id=%7BD78C069C-1151-4E3C-8840-B707FC4B96EF%7D&amp;notoc=1|title=Responsible Parenthood |publisher=The United Methodist General Board of Church and Society|accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcrc.org/calltojustice/perspectives_pharmacy.php |title=Perspectives: Pharmacy Refusals - A New Threat to Women's Health |publisher=Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice |accessdate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007160017/http://www.rcrc.org/calltojustice/perspectives_pharmacy.php |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Methodist Church of Great Britain]] also supports responsible use of birth control, welcoming its use as a means "towards fulfilment in marriage, the spacing of children, and the need to avoid pregnancy altogether, for example for medical reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Views of the Church: Abortion and Contraception|url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/who-we-are/views-of-the-church/abortion-and-contraception|publisher=The Methodist Church in Britain|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presbyterianism===
[[Presbyterian Church (USA)|The Presbyterian Church (USA)]] supports “full and equal access to contraceptive methods.” In a recent resolution endorsing insurance coverage for contraceptives, the church affirmed that “contraceptive services are part of basic health care” and cautioned that “unintended pregnancies lead to higher rates of infant mortality, low birth weight, and maternal morbidity, and threaten the economic viability of families.”&lt;ref name="Perspectives: Pharmacy Refusals - A New Threat to Women's Health."&gt;Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. 2006. ''Religious Support For Family Planning'' (retrieved 16 May 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mennonites===
The [[Mennonite Church USA]], the [[General Conference Mennonite Church]], and the [[Conservative Mennonite Conference]] have adopted statements indicating approval of modern methods of contraception. For example, while also teaching and encouraging love and acceptance of children, the Conservative Mennonite Conference maintains, "The prevention of pregnancy when feasible by birth control with pre-fertilization methods is acceptable."&lt;ref name="mennobeliefs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmcrosedale.org/about/beliefs.shtml |title=What We Believe |accessdate=2006-10-01 |publisher=Conservative Mennonite Conference |year=1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927033751/http://www.cmcrosedale.org/about/beliefs.shtml |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 1975 found that only 11% of Mennonites believed use of birth control was "always wrong".&lt;ref name="mennonite" /&gt;  Old Colony Mennonites, like the [[Amish]], do not officially allow birth control practices.

===Amish===
All types of birth control, including forms of [[natural family planning]] such as [[calendar-based methods]], are forbidden in Old Order [[Amish]] communities.&lt;!--

==History==
Before the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]] viewed [[procreation]] as the primary purpose of [[sexual intercourse]] and unity of spouses.  As part of the Reformation, Reformers began to more strongly emphasize the unitive pleasures of marriage.&lt;ref name="rich_vincent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theocentric.com/relationships/parenting/responsible_family_planning.html |title=Responsible Family Planning: The Legitimacy of Contraceptive Use for Christian Couples |accessdate=2006-10-01 |year=2005 |author=Rich Vincent |work=TheoCenTric |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130200513/http://www.theocentric.com/relationships/parenting/responsible_family_planning.html |archivedate=2006-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, all major early [[Protestant Reformers]], and indeed Protestants in general until the twentieth century, condemned birth control as a contravention of God's procreative purpose for marriage.&lt;ref name="flann"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Campbell, Flann| title=Birth Control and the Christian Churches| journal=Population Studies| date=Nov 1960| volume= 14| issue= 2| pages=131–147| doi=10.2307/2172010 | publisher=Population Investigation Committee | jstor=2172010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Carlson, Allan| title=Children of the Reformation| journal=Touchstone|date=May 2007| volume= 20| issue= 4| url=http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=20-04-020-f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As scientists advanced birth control methods during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some Protestants continued to reject them, while other [[Nonconformists]] welcomed these advances. ([[Moncure Conway]] preached on the subject at [[South Place Chapel]] in London.)&lt;ref name="flann" /&gt;&lt;ref name="malthusian"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Untitled| journal=The Malthusian|date=June 1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conway"&gt;{{cite book|title=Liberty and Morality: A Discourse given at the [[South Place Chapel]], Finsbury| last=Conway| first=Moncure D.| year=1878| publisher=Freethought Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the dissent, the editor of a Nonconformist weekly journal in the United States wrote in 1893,&lt;blockquote&gt;''There was a time when any idea of voluntary limitation was regarded by pious people as interfering with Providence. We are beyond that now and have become capable of recognizing that Providence works through the commonsense of individual brains. We limit population just as much by deferring marriage for prudential reasons as by any action that may be taken after it.''&lt;ref name="flann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nonconform"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Editorial entitled 'A Marriage Problem'| journal=The Christian World Weekly| year=1893| volume=June 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Christian denomination|Non-Catholic denominations]] were slow to officially go along with such a view, although followers were not as reluctant.

===1930 Seventh Lambeth Conference shift===

Then in 1930, at the [[Lambeth Conference#Seventh Conference (1930)|Seventh Lambeth Conference]], the [[Anglican Communion]], after years of considerable internal debate, issued the first statement permitting birth control "when there is a clearly felt moral obligation to limit or avoid parenthood and where there is a morally sound reason for avoiding complete abstinence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noroomforcontraception.com/Resources/Contraception-Lambeth.htm No Room For Contraception] ''Lambeth Conferences of the Anglican Church''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Allan Carlson recounts how this affected the other Protestants:

:There was an immediate American Protestant echo. In 1931, the Committee on Home and Marriage of the Federal Council of Churches (an ecumenical body that embraced Methodist, Presbyterian, Congregational, and Church of the Brethren denominations) issued a statement defending family limitation and urging the repeal of laws prohibiting contraceptive education and sales...In the late 1940′s, a leading LCMS [Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod ] professor of theology, Alfred Rehwinckel, said that Luther had simply been wrong: the Genesis phrase, “Be fruitful and multiply,” was merely a blessing, not a command. Such views spread at a still more rapid pace among the Protestant “mainline” churches. Held near the end of the post World War II “baby boom,” when American family life for a brief period again seemed somewhat healthy, the 1961 North American Conference on Church and Family of the National Council of Churches (successor to the FCC) can only be called extraordinary....Not a single speaker spoke in the spirit of the old Protestant pronatalist ethic. Indeed, this ethic now stood as the chief enemy. The conference endorsed development of a new evangelical sexual ethic, one “relevant to our culture,” sensitive to the overpopulation crisis, and grounded in modern science. Member denominations soon complied. In a 1970 Report, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) rejected the old “taboos and prohibitions” and gave its blessing to “mass contraceptive techniques,” homosexuality, and low-cost abortion on demand. The same year, the Lutheran Church in America fully embraced contraception and abortion as responsible choices. And in 1977, the United Church of Christ celebrated the terms “freedom,” “sensuousness,” and “androgyny,” and declared free access to contraception and abortion as matters of justice.&lt;ref&gt;http://bound4life.com/history-of-contraception-in-the-protestant-church/&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005 acceptance had increased such that a [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] poll conducted online among 2,242 U.S. adults found that 88% of non-Catholic Christians who identified as either "very religious" or [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] supported the use of birth control/contraceptives.&lt;ref&gt;Harris_poll&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestants Reformers’ views vs. modern Protestant views===
Highly conservative Protestants such as [[Mary Pride]], [[Charles D. Provan]], Hess and Hess, and Rachel Scott, argue that Protestants should not have moved away from traditional Protestant views of contraception such as given by [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]]. Such modern authors contrast the views of early Reformers who rejected contraception with modern Christians who accept it, and point to primarily [[feminist]], [[secular]], or [[Satan]]ic influences as causative to the change.&lt;ref name="mary_pride"/&gt;&lt;ref name="provan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Charles D. Provan.jpg|thumb|100px|left| '''[[Charles D. Provan]]''''s ''The Bible and Birth Control'' is frequently cited by [[Quiverfull]] adherents, who eschew all forms of birth control.]] --&gt;
Provan in his ''The Bible and Birth Control'' extensively quotes early Protestant views of birth control, which Provan uses to conclude,&lt;blockquote&gt;''If Martin Luther were alive today, would he not disapprove of many Christians who view children as a bad thing, and so practice birth control to prevent God from sending more blessings to them? ... Truly Scriptural principles do not change at all: therefore Christians should willingly receive the blessings which God has for us, and not try to prevent them.''&lt;ref name="provan"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reformed scholars such as [[James B. Jordan]], however, maintain that Provan's view has the effect of adding a law to the Bible it does not contain. Jordan states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Jesus repeatedly denounced the Pharisees for their additions to the Law of God. Thus, we must be extremely careful about what laws we lay down for people. Does the Bible clearly state that contraception is sinful, or that people are obligated to have as many children as possible? If the Bible does not say these things, we need to fear God and be frightened of adding to His Word.&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jordan argues also that the views of early Protestant Reformers on contraception are unreliable because they were heavily influenced by not just the Bible but [[Neo-Platonic]] [[mysticism]] ([[Asceticism|otherworldliness]]) and [[Aristotle|Aristolean]] [[teleologism]] (measuring all things only by their result), philosophies they inherited from their Catholic predecessors such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]]. Bart Garrett describes it, "They operated in a time and context that unhealthily looked at sex as a base, physical pleasure that carried with it spiritual detriments."&lt;ref name="IIIM"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bart Garrett| title=Christians and Contraception: Convenience or Kingdom Thinking?| journal=IIIM Magazine| year=2001| volume=3| issue=25| url=http://www.thirdmill.org/newfiles/bar_garrett/PT.Garrett.Contraception.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan further points to the Reformers' unreliability based upon their rejection of [[Song of Solomon]] as a description of passionate sexual expression within marriage. He also cites [[technophobia]] among Protestants, as evident by their rejection of things ranging from buttons to airplanes ("if God meant for man to fly he would have given him wings"). As well, Jordan points to what he describes as the Reformers' own mantra, "reformed and always reforming" (''ecclesia reformata est semper reformanda''), as evidence that Protestants should not crystallize their position on the matter at some point in the past, and says that rejecting contraceptives based upon their correlative rise alongside feminism exhibits the [[genetic fallacy]].&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt;

==Ongoing debates==
There are numerous ongoing debates at core of Protestant differences concerning contraceptives. These include whether contraceptive use or non-use is a matter of individual conscience or binding Biblical commands, what types of birth control are permissible if any, and the amount of weight modern Protestants should give early Protestant Reformers' views on contraception.

===Individual conscience or commandment?===
The [[majority]] of Protestants, irrespective of [[Christian denomination|denomination]], maintain that use or non-use of birth control in its various methods is a matter of [[conscience]] for individual Christians before God, and that individual couples should be convinced in their own minds of what is and is not permissible for them particularly (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2014;&amp;version=49; Romans 14]). In this view, God has a [[Priesthood of all believers|personal relationship]] with individual Christians and, because he has given no [[Argument from silence|explicit Biblical commandment]] against birth control and uses [[Common grace|and has even caused and overseen]] modern [[Technology|technological advancements]] (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012:4;&amp;version=49; Daniel 12:4]), he guides particular couples' birth control practices in accordance with his particular will for their lives. Conservative evangelical leader [[John F. MacArthur]] states the view,

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Nothing in Scripture prohibits married couples from practicing birth control, either for a limited time to delay childbearing, or permanently when they have borne children and determine that their family is complete ... In our viewpoint, birth control is biblically permissible. At the same time, couples should not practice birth control if it violates their consciences (Romans 14:23)—not because birth control is inherently sinful, but because it is always wrong to violate the conscience. The answer to a wrongly informed conscience is not to violate it, but rather to correct and rightly inform one's conscience with biblical truth.''&lt;ref name="macarthur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/resources.php?section=issues&amp;aid=176403|title=What does the Bible teach about birth control?|accessdate=2006-10-12|publisher=Grace to You|year=2005|author=John F.

[[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]], the ninth president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] states,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Evangelical couples may, at times, choose to use contraceptives in order to plan their families and enjoy the pleasures of the marital bed. The couple must consider all these issues with care, and must be truly open to the gift of children. The moral justification for using contraceptives must be clear in the couple's mind, and fully consistent with the couple's Christian commitments.''&lt;ref name="mohler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/commentary_read.php?cdate=2004-03-30|title=Can Christians Use Birth Control?|accessdate=2006-10-01|year=2004|author=Mohler, R. Albert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additional adherents of this view include Rainey, [[James Dobson]],&lt;ref name="fofposstament"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.org/corrpdfs/Miscellaneous/Position_Statement-Birth_Control_Pills_and_Other_Hormonal_Contraception.pdf|title=Position Statement: Birth Control Pills and Other Hormonal Contraception|accessdate=2006-10-21|publisher=Focus on the Family|year=2005|author=Focus on the Family|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan, Mohler, and evangelical [[ethicists]] Franklin E. Payne&lt;ref name="payne1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biblical/Medical Ethics: The Christian and the Practice of Medicine| last=Payne| first=Franklin E.| year=1985| publisher=Mott Media| location=Milford, MI| isbn=0-8010-7099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="payne2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Making Biblical Decisions: Birth Control, Artificial Reproduction and Genetic Engineering| last=Payne| first=Franklin E.| year=1989| publisher=Hosanna House| location=Escondido, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Feinberg|John]] and [[Paul Feinberg]].&lt;ref name="feinberg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics for a Brave New World| last=Feinberg| first=John and Paul| publisher=Crossway| location=Wheaton, IL| isbn=0-89107-736-7|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most Protestants adhere to this view, some such as Rainey may nonetheless advocate for one of the categories he describes, depending upon which [[Christian values]] they deem most important.

Some Protestants, however, reject the position that contraceptive use is a matter of conscience. Although some [[Quiverfull]] adherents accept that birth control use is a matter of individual conscience, other such adherents may argue that the Bible commands their position for all Christians. For example, David Crank, publisher of ''Unless The Lord Magazine'', states, "The 'Quiverfull' approach is universal in the sense that it is not something unusual that only a few are called to. Rather it is God's basic design and plan for mankind, and it was the way most of mankind lived most of the time, until the 20th century."&lt;ref name="QF-Digest-#3380"&gt;{{cite journal | author=David Crank | title=Quiverfull: universal or specific? | journal=Quiverfull Digest | year=2006| issue= #3380|url=http://www.quiverfull.com|pages=#20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles D. Provan]] additionally argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, indeed the first command to a married couple. Birth control obviously involves disobedience to this command, for birth control attempts to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. Therefore birth control is wrong, because it involves disobedience to the Word of God. Nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; therefore it still remains valid for us today.''&lt;ref name="provan"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Bible and Birth Control| last=Provan| first=Charles D.| year=1989| publisher=Zimmer Printing| location=Monongahela, PA| isbn=99917-998-3-4}}. Quote and its chapter available at http://www.jesus-passion.com/contraception.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quiverfull authors such as Hess and Hess disagree and say the matter is simply one of clear obedience or disobedience to God's words in the Bible.&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Behold, children are a gift of the Lord" (Psa. 127:3). Do we really believe that? If children are a gift from God, let’s for the sake of argument ask ourselves what other gift or blessing from God we would reject. Money? Would we reject great wealth if God gave it? Not likely! How about good health? Many would say that a man’s health is his most treasured possession. But children? Even children given by God? "That’s different!" some will plead! All right, is it different? God states right here in no-nonsense language that children are gifts. Do we believe His Word to be true?''&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To such statements, Protestants such as Jordan point out that Christians will, in fact, choose against the blessing of money and great wealth. Jordan also maintains that, while children are indeed blessings, they are only one among a wide range of blessings God offers, and prayerfully choosing foci among them is part of prudent Christian [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]].&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt; [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s ''Desiring God'' ministry further explains,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Scriptures also say that a wife is a gift from the Lord (Proverbs 18:22), but that doesn't mean that it is wrong to stay single (1 Corinthians 7:8). Just because something is a gift from the Lord does not mean that it is wrong to be a steward of when or whether you will come into possession of it. It is wrong to reason that since A is good and a gift from the Lord, then we must pursue as much of A as possible. God has made this a world in which tradeoffs have to be made and we cannot do everything to the fullest extent. For kingdom purposes, it might be wise not to get married. And for kingdom purposes, it might be wise to regulate the size of one's family and to regulate when the new additions to the family will likely arrive. As Wayne Grudem has said, "it is okay to place less emphasis on some good activities in order to focus on other good activities."''&lt;ref name="piper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/QuestionsAndAnswers/ByTopic/45/1440_Does_the_Bible_permit_birth_control/|title=Does the Bible permit birth control?|accessdate=2006-10-27|publisher=Desiring God|year=2006|author=Desiring God Staff|work=Questions and Answers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====“Be fruitful and multiply”—command or blessing?====
Protestants, including Quiverfull adherents, also disagree over whether the Biblical statement "be fruitful and multiply" in Genesis 1:28 and 9:7 is a [[Cultural mandate|command]] or simply a [[blessing]] God spoke over its recipients. [[Mary Pride]] and [[Charles D. Provan]] see it as a binding command upon married Christians, while Dobson, MacArthur, Jordan, and Raymond C. Van Leeuwen do not see the statement as prohibiting family planning by contraceptive use.&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/november12/4.58.html|title="Be Fruitful and Multiply": Is this a Command, or a Blessing?|accessdate=2006-10-21|publisher=Christianity Today|year=2005|author=Raymond C. Van Leeuwen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Sin of Onan—condemnation of contraceptive use?====
{{Main article|Onan}}
As part of this debate, Protestants (as well as some Catholics) disagree over [[Onan|the Sin of Onan]] as found in the Bible verses of Genesis 38:1-10. Protestants within the "children in abundance" group (see discussion of below)  often see Onan's act of ''[[coitus interruptus]]'' as condemning contraceptive use, while most see Onan's real sin as ongoing rebellion against God, with his failure to fulfill the terms of his [[Yibbum|Levirate marriage (Yibbum)]] being his final rebellious act.&lt;ref name="JBJ" /&gt;

===Which methods are permissible?===
:''Also see: [[Natural Family Planning]], [[Barrier contraception]] and [[Hormonal contraception]]''

Protestants who accept that birth control is permissible may disagree over which methods are impermissible.

====Natural Family Planning only or "artificial" methods too?====
In Sam and Bethany Torode's 2002 book, ''Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception'', the young couple argued that only [[Natural Family Planning]] was permissible, citing their views borrowed from Catholicism including the [[Theology of the Body]].&lt;ref name="open_embrace"&gt;{{cite book | title=Open Embrace: A Protestant Couple Rethinks Contraception| last=Torode| first=Sam and Bethany| year=2002| publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-3973-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple later accepted barrier methods and stated,

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Strict NFP reaches a point where it is more harmful for a marriage than good. We think that Jesus' words in Luke 11:46 apply: "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry." How is it that spouses are saying "yes" to the gift of each other when they end up abstaining for much of their married lives? ... We also see honest congruity with the language of the body by saying "no" to conception with our bodies (via barrier methods or sensual massage) when our minds and hearts are also saying "no" to conception. We don’t believe this angers God, nor that it leads to the slippery slope of relativism or divorce. We strongly disagree with the idea that this is a mortal sin.''&lt;ref name="Torode_redact"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s ''Desiring God'' ministry states of [[Natural family planning|NFP]],''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Some conclude that "natural family planning" is acceptable but "artificial" means are not. But this seems to overlook something significant: in both cases, you are still seeking to regulate when you have children. And so if one concludes that it is wrong to seek to regulate the timing and size of a family, then it would have to be concluded that natural family planning is just as wrong as "artificial" means. But if one concludes that it is appropriate to steward the timing and size of one's family, then what makes "artificial" means wrong but natural family planning right? Surely it is not because God is "more free" to overrule our plans with natural family planning! Perhaps some have concluded that artificial forms are wrong because they allow one more fully to separate intercourse from the possibility of procreation. But if it is wrong to have intercourse without a significant possibility of procreation, then it would also be wrong to have intercourse during pregnancy or after a woman is past her childbearing years. There is no reason to conclude that natural family planning is appropriate but that "artificial" means are not.''&lt;ref name="piper"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In her book, ''Birth Control for Christians: Making Wise Choices'', Jenell Williams Paris, who is associate professor of anthropology at Bethel College in St. Paul, reviews the benefits and uncertainties of various birth control methods, and decidedly favors the Fertility Awareness Method (FAM), which is similar to NFP but is different. (Paris is a FAM instructor.) The main difference is that FAM is not tied to Roman Catholic teaching.  Regarding hormonal methods and abortion, Paris explains that both assertions that the hormonal methods are necessarily acting as abortifacients and the counter claim that they never do are impossible to substantiate from data, and that the probability of the hypothesized scenarios are so small such that the collection of data seems infeasible.&lt;ref name="JWP"&gt;{{cite book | title=Birth Control for Christians: Making Wise Choices| last=Paris| first=Jenell Williams| year=2003| publisher=Baker Books| location=Grand Rapids| isbn=978-0-8010-6437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hormonal contraceptives====
Based upon a view that [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|life begins at conception]], Protestant author [[Randy Alcorn]] rejects all forms of [[hormonal contraception|hormonal contraceptives]], while [[James Dobson]] and [[obstetrician]] and minister William R. Cutrer reject only certain forms of them. Dobson and Cutrer view [[Progestogen only pill|progesterone-only birth control pills]] as potentially problematic, since they may be [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|potentially abortive contraceptive]]s because of the theoretical possibility that they may have a slight secondary action of preventing a fertilized [[embryo]] from implanting within the [[uterus|uterine wall]], while Alcorn implicates all hormonal contraceptives as problematic in these regards.&lt;ref name="fofposstament"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cutrer"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contraception Guidebook: Options, Risks, and Answers for Christian Couples| url=http://www.zondervan.com/Cultures/en-US/Authors/Author.htm?ContributorId=CutrerW&amp;QueryStringSite=Zondervan| last=Cutrer| first=William R.|author2=Glahn, Sandra L. | year=2005| publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, MI| isbn=0-310-25407-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alcorn"&gt;{{cite book|title=Does the Birth Control Pill Cause Abortions?| url=http://www.epm.org/media-files/pdf/bcpill.pdf| last=Alcorn| first=Randy| year=2007| publisher=Eternal Perspective Ministries| location=Sandy, OR| isbn=0-9700016-0-6|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobson's [[Focus on the Family]] states,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Dr. Dobson would emphasize as foundational his strict concurrence with the biblical teaching that every child is a blessing from God ... While affirming that human life begins with fertilization (the union of sperm and egg), his interpretation of Scripture leads him to believe that the prevention of fertilization is not morally wrong. However, he would oppose any method of birth control that acts after fertilization and terminates a conceived human life by preventing its implantation in the womb ... After two years of extended deliberation and prayer, the PRC has not been able to reach a consensus as to the likelihood, or even the possibility, that these medications might contribute to the loss of human life after fertilization. The majority of the experts to which Dr. Dobson has spoken feel that the pill does not have an abortifacient effect. A minority of the experts feel that when conception occurs on the pill, there is enough of a possibility for an abortifacient effect [with the progesterine-only pill], however remote, to warrant informing women about it.''&lt;ref name="fofposstament"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists]], however, argues that it is inappropriate to implicate certain hormonal contraceptives as abortifacient based upon theory only, and points out that no empirical evidence exists to prove any abortifacient action. The organization states,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Is it appropriate to implicate a medication as an abortive agent without the data to support such a claim? To do so creates needless hostility and division among physicians and patients who genuinely respect life from the moment of conception. Where do we draw the line in informed consent for responsible disclosure of known medical risks vs. a theoretical risk which is not substantiated by current scientific knowledge? Is it accurate to implicate all hormonal contraceptive methods as one regarding their method of action, rather than evaluating each one individually?''&lt;ref name="aaplog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaplog.org/decook.htm|title=Hormone Contraceptives Controversies and Clarifications|accessdate=2006-10-23|publisher=[[American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists]]|year=1999|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061012022215/http://www.aaplog.org/decook.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Current views==
Author and [[Campus Crusade for Christ#Campus Crusade for Christ, Major Ministry Divisions in the U.S.|FamilyLife Today]] radio host Dennis Rainey suggests four categories as useful in understanding current Protestant views concerning birth control.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familylife.com/fltoday/default.asp?id=5868&amp;page=72&amp;search=&amp;strMonth=&amp;strDay=&amp;strYear=&amp;guests=&amp;keywords=&amp;showType= |title=The Value of Children (11 July 2002 FamilyLife Today Radio Broadcast) |accessdate=2006-09-30 |publisher=FamilyLife Today |year=2002 |author=Dennis Rainey |format=Transcript of radio broadcast |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001144025/http://www.familylife.com/fltoday/default.asp?id=5868&amp;page=72&amp;search=&amp;strMonth=&amp;strDay=&amp;strYear=&amp;guests=&amp;keywords=&amp;showType= |archivedate=1 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher G. Ellison and Patricia Goodson use very similar categories in their 1997 study of Protestant seminarians' attitudes on the matter.&lt;ref name="consvprots"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Christopher G. Ellison and Patricia Goodson| title=Conservative Protestantism and Attitudes toward Family Planning in a Sample of Seminarians| journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion| year=1997| volume=36| issue=4| pages=512–529| doi=10.2307/1387687 | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | jstor=1387687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Children in abundance" group===
{{Main article|Quiverfull}}
The first is the "children in abundance" group. Protestants within this group believe that birth control is a contravention of God’s purpose for marriage and that all children conceived during routine [[sexual intercourse]] (without regard to time of the month during the [[ovulation]] cycle or other matters) should be welcomed as blessings.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; The [[Quiverfull|Quiverfull movement]] and its authors such as [[Mary Pride]], Rick and Jan Hess, [[Charles D. Provan]], [[Nancy Leigh DeMoss]], Rachel Giove Scott, and others, predominate this group. Based upon [[Bible verses]] that describe God acting to "open and close the womb" (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2020:18;&amp;version=49; Genesis 20:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2029:31;&amp;version=49; 29:31], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2030:22;&amp;version=49; 30:22]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%201:5-6;&amp;version=49; 1 Samuel 1:5-6]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2066:9;&amp;version=49; Isaiah 66:9]), Quiverfull adherents believe that [[Divine Providence]] alone should control how many and how often children are conceived and born.&lt;ref name="thenation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20061127/joyce|title='Arrows for the War'|accessdate=2006-11-09|publisher=The Nation|date=9 November 2006|author=Kathryn Joyce|work=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestants in this group often connect birth control use with modern [[feminism]], an "anti-child mentality", "worldliness",&lt;ref name="mary_pride"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality| last=Pride| first=Mary| year=1985| publisher=Good News Publishers| location=Wheaton, IL|isbn=0-89107-345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="provan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hess"&gt;{{cite book | title=A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ| last=Hess| first=Rick and Jan| year=1990| publisher=Hyatt Publishers| location=Brentwood, TN|isbn=0-943497-83-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite book | title=Birthing God's Mighty Warriors| last=Scott| first=Rachel| year=2004| publisher=Xulon Press| location=Longwood, FL|isbn=1-59467-465-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abortion because birth control is used for "the same reasons why a woman aborts her child".&lt;ref name="nikki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiverfull.com/birth_control/my_contraceptive_convictions.html|title=My contraceptive convictions|accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=Quiverfull.com|author=Nikki Keith|work=Quiverfull Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Children in managed abundance" group===
The second is the "children in managed abundance" group. According to Rainey, Protestants within this group are open to however many children they may conceive during their fertile years yet believe that only [[Natural Family Planning]] is acceptable and may use it.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; A young couple Sam and Bethany Torode advocated for this view in their 2002 book,&lt;ref name="open_embrace" /&gt; although they later accepted [[barrier contraception]] such as [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]] and [[condoms]].&lt;ref name="Torode_redact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openembrace.com/ |title=Udates |accessdate=2006-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026170034/http://www.openembrace.com/ |archivedate=2006-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denny Kenaston]] of Charity Christian Fellowship also advocates for this position,&lt;ref name="Kenaston_menno"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pursuit of Godly Seed| last=Kenaston| first=Denny| year=2003| publisher=Home Fires Publishers|isbn=0-9742751-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Presbyterian]] seminary professor Daniel Doriani.&lt;ref name="doriani"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Doriani, Daniel| title=Birth Dearth or Bring on the Babies?: Biblical Perspectives on Family Planning| journal=Journal of Biblical Counseling| year=1993| volume=12| issue=1| pages=24–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Children in moderation" group===
The third is the "children in moderation" group. In Rainey’s view, these Protestants are very pro-child but feel free to use artificial birth control to prudently plan their families. Those within this group see Divine Providence and [[Free will in theology|Biblically required responsibility]] acting via man's free will as working complementarily. They thus may feel freedom to use non-"natural" birth control in making personal choices in [[prayer|consultation with God]] about the number and spacing of children.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt;

==="No children" group===
{{See also|Childfree}}
The fourth group is the [[Childfree|"no children"]] group. Rainey sees couples in this group as believing they are within their Biblical rights to define their lives around [[natalism|non-natal]] concerns.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; While not their main emphasis on the subject, Protestant authors such as Samuel Owen and [[James B. Jordan]] support this as an acceptable option, but only when a [[Hierarchy#Ethics, behavioral psychology, philosophies of identity|higher ethical principle]] intervenes to make child bearing imprudent, such as health concerns or a calling to serve [[orphan]]s or as [[missionary|missionaries]] in a dangerous location, etc. A small activist group, the Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree, argues their position, "Jesus loved children but chose to never have any, so that he could devote his life to telling the Good News."&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eilertech.com/cyberchurch/cyberchurch.htm|title=The Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree|accessdate=2006-12-08|publisher=The Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan also maintains that modern birth control methods, as well as Natural Family Planning, are acceptable tools of prudent family planning. Jordan also strongly supports the option for couples to have very large families, while Owen believes that non-use of birth control in any form should be normative.&lt;ref name="JBJ"&gt;{{cite journal|author=James B. Jordan |title=The Bible and Family Planning: An Answer to Charles Provan's "The Bible and Birth Control" |journal=Contra Mundum |year=1993 |issue=Fall 1993, no. 9 |url=http://www.contra-mundum.org/cm/cm09.pdf |format=PDF |issn=1070-9495 |pages=2–14 (Article begins on PDF page 4 of source) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204052122/http://www.contra-mundum.org/cm/cm09.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mohler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Letting God Plan Your Family| last=Owen, Jr.| first=Samuel A.| year=1990| publisher=Crossway Books| location=Wheaton, IL|isbn=0-89107-585-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainey sees infertile couples as falling into this group apart from their choice in the matter.&lt;ref name="rainey_ref_2"/&gt; [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|Sterilized]] couples may as well. According to [[Southern Baptist]] [[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]], "Couples are not given the option of chosen childlessness in the biblical revelation".&lt;ref name="mohler-child"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/167/story_16748.html|title=Deliberate Childlessness: Moral Rebellion With a New Face|accessdate=2006-10-23|publisher=www.albertmohler.com|year=2006|author=Albert Mohler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sterilization reversals===
{{Main article|Sterilization reversal}}

Stemming from ideas from the [[Quiverfull]] movement, some Protestants such as [[Bill Gothard]] advocate for couples to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] reversal surgery, while Brad and Dawn Irons of ''Blessed Arrows Sterilization Reversal Ministry'' advocate for Quiverfull ideas while providing funding, physician referrals, and support to Protestants wishing to undergo reversal surgery.&lt;ref name="reverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blessedarrows.org/|title=Blessed Arrows: A Sterilization Reversal Ministry|accessdate=2006-10-14|publisher=Brad and Dawn Irons|author=Brad and Dawn Irons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}
{{Nihongo|'''Dr. Ichirō Irabu'''|伊良部 一郎|Irabu Ichirō}} is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[psychiatrist]] in a series of [[Short story|short stories]] by [[Japanese literature|Japanese]] writer Hideo Okuda, originally published primarily in the [[literary magazine]] ''All Yomimono'' from August 2000 to January 2006 and later collected in three ''[[tankōbon]]'': {{Nihongo|'''''In the Pool'''''|イン・ザ・プール|In Za Pūru}}, {{Nihongo3|"[[Flying Trapeze]]"|空中ブランコ|'''Kūchū Buranko'''}} and {{Nihongo3|"Mayoral Election"|町長選挙|'''Chōchō Senkyo'''}}. Of these, ''Kūchū Buranko'' is particularly acclaimed, having won Okuda the 131st [[Naoki Prize]] (given for a book published in the first half of 2004) but, as of January 2011, only ''In the Pool'' has been published in English. Works in other media based on the stories include a [[#Film|feature film]], [[#Television drama|television drama]], [[#Play|stage play]] and [[#Anime|anime series]].

==Premise==
{{Nihongo|Ichiro Irabu|伊良部 一郎}} is a psychiatrist from the Irabu General Hospital. He is fat and pale skinned, with a fetish for administering injections to patients. An unreasonable and rather immature person, he normally ignores Yamashita's plights while challenging him to mid-air trapeze flying due to his self-proclaimed "light-weightedness." During his student days, he frequently misunderstood his lectures. Treated as a general nuisance at the School of Medicine, he entered [[pediatrics]] soon after graduation. However, due to claims of his tantrums and quarrels with child patients, he switched to psychiatry instead. Doubts remain about his actual grades.

==Stories and characters==

===''Kūchū Buranko''===

; {{Nihongo3|"Flying Trapeze"|空中ブランコ|"Kūchū Buranko"|January, 2003 ''All Yomimono''}}
: {{Nihongo|Kōhei Yamashita|山下 公平|Yamashita Kōhei}} is a member of [[circus]] troupe of seven years and is the leader of a flying trapeze team. Both his parents are fellow members. After suffering repeated failures on the trapeze act, he visits a psychiatrist on his wife's and fellow members' advice. Due to his failure during an act, he believes his partner is harassing him. He has been played by [[Masato Sakai]] in the television drama, Kenji Sakamoto in the stage play and [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] in the animated series.
; {{nihongo3|"[[Hedgehog]]"|ハリネズミ|"Harinezumi"|July, 2003 ''All Yomimono''}}
: {{nihongo|Seiji Ino|猪野 誠司|Ino Seiji}} is an [[underboss]] of the [[yakuza]] "Kioi family" from Shibuya. He suffers from such serious [[trypanophobia]] that he cannot use [[chopsticks]] and must instead use a [[spoon]] at meals. He takes a psychiatric test on his common-law wife's advice.
; {{nihongo|''Gifu no Zura''|義父のヅラ||"The wig of the father-in-law"}} (the first publishing "All Yomimono", October, 2003 issue,
: {{nihongo|Tatsuro Ikeyama|池山 達郎}} is a university lecturer and is a doctor of neurology working in a University-affiliated hospital. His father of law is the Dean of the School of Medicine, which supposedly could aid in his future employment prospects. A classmate of Irabu's during their college days. He has a type of obsessive-compulsive neurosis that compels him to force any place of tidiness into disarray. This disorder is so strong, that with just one glance at it, Ikeyama becomes agonized with the impulse of wanting to strip off his father-in-law's wig. Originally published in the ''All Yomimono'' with the title {{nihongo|''Kyōju no Zura''|教授のヅラ||"The wig of the professor"}}.
; {{nihongo|''Hot Corner''|ホットコーナー||"[[Third base]]"}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Wasei-eigo|Japanese English]]&lt;/ref&gt; (the first publishing "All Yomimono", April, 2003 issue)
: {{nihongo|Shinichi Bando|坂東 真一}} is a pro-[[baseball]] player and is ten-year veteran [[third baseman]]. He suffered from [[yips]], and he leaves the first team by pretending to have an injured right shoulder.
; {{Nihongo3|"[[Chick Lit]] Writer"|女流作家|"Joryū Sakka"|January, 2004 ''All Yomimono''}}
: {{nihongo|Aiko Hoshiyama|星山 愛子}} is a popular novelist known for her stories which "express the subtleties of the hearts of today's urban men and women."

{{main|List of Welcome to Irabu's Office episodes}}
{{Nihongo|''Welcome to Irabu's Office''|空中ブランコ|Kūchū Buranko}} is a 2009 [[anime]] of 11 episodes based on the ''Psychiatrist Irabu'' series of short stories, produced at [[Toei Animation]] under the series direction of [[Kenji Nakamura]] for [[Fuji Television]]'s [[noitamina]] [[programming block]]. Though ostensibly an animated series, its visuals are more specifically an experimental mélange of [[traditional animation]] with [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] or otherwise processed [[Live action|live-action]] footage and other imagery.&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt; Manabu Ishikawa's series composition adapts the stories to be set in [[Tokyo|Tōkyō]] during about one week from December 17 to [[Christmas]] (corresponding with the original broadcast, which concluded on [[Christmas Eve]]) and for the chief characters of each story to appear also as supporting players in each other's.

The plot of each episode follows a common thread. Irabu is consulted by a patient suffering from a psychological problem or a problem where other medical approaches have been exhausted. Each of the patients' heads are morphed into an animal head in some scenes after Mayumi administers the vitamin shot to them. Each patient somehow ties into one another, for example the first patient meets with the second patient and the seventh patient, all in the first episode.

The series won the [[Pulcinella]] award for Best Television Series in the "Young Adults" (14–17 years) division at the 2010 Cartoons on the bay international animation festival in the [[province of Genoa]], [[Italy]], the [[Gary Goldman]]-presided jury of that year commending it as a "unique representation of the complex inner world of adolescents.".&lt;ref name="bay" /&gt; Noted animation [[blog]]ger Benjamin Ettinger found it to be lacking in interest in the animation itself and the extreme eclecticism of the visual design no substitute for the finely crafted world of Nakamura and character designer and chief [[animation director]] Takashi Hashimoto's earlier ''[[Bakeneko (anime)]]'' and ''[[Mononoke (TV series)|Mononoke]]'' but still highly enjoyable thanks to the excellence on the part of Nakamura and the episode directors with which the material has been handled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ettinger|first=Benjamin|title=Charles Huettner short film yay|url=http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php?title=huettner&amp;c=1|work=AniPages Daily|accessdate=15 January 2011|date=26 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and highlighted the incorporation of real-life [[gravure idol]] [[Yumi Sugimoto]] as Mayumi as a welcome subversion of ''[[moe (slang)|moe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ettinger|first=Benjamin|title=Recent viewing|url=http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php?title=recent_viewing_3&amp;c=1|work=AniPages Daily|accessdate=15 January 2011|date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Characters====
;{{nihongo|Ichiro Irabu|伊良部 一郎|Irabu Ichirō}}
: {{animevoices|[[Yūji Mitsuya]]}} as Big &amp; Middle Irabu
: {{animevoices|[[Romi Park]]}} as Little Irabu
: Dr. Irabu is son of the founder of the Irabu General Hospital. Irabu is a psychiatrist with a care-free, eccentric, and childlike personality. He changes appearance throughout scenes. In his first form, he is slightly overweight wearing bright clothes under his labcoat with a large green bear head that can change expression to suit his. "Middle Irabu" is slimmer, wearing his normal attire. In this form he has long blond hair, red glasses, and a pair of green bear ears. His personality in this form is notably effeminate. His final form is "little Irabu" (him as a boy), with an over sized lab coat, and shorts instead of trousers. He is quite mellow in this form, but can get ecstatic.
: Irabu has a strange angle to his line of medicine, insisting that all his patients have a vitamin shot (Irabu has a fetish for injections) and insisting that his patients face their problems head on. He is seen by other psychiatrists as obscene and childish, although his treatments seem to work.

She doesn't have a cell phone, but uses one at the end of episode 6 to contact with Yuta, the patient from the "Friends" episode.

It is one of several programming strategies television networks employ to capitalize further on successful programs; among the other methods are [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]], [[remakes]], [[Casting (performing arts)|cast]] reunions, and [[television film|television movies]].

Unlike spin-offs, in which a television network creates an entirely new series around an existing [[Fictional character|character]], a revival reintroduces most or many of the original program's [[Plot (narrative)|storylines]], characters, and locales. Revivals usually take place at some point after the original series ends. By contrast, [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]] and [[remake]]s may feature many of the original characters, but are usually played by new cast members and without taking into account events or [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that occurred during the original series.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/driving-resurgence-reboots-remakes-revivals-tv-film/story?id=47645549&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rover chair''' is the first piece of furniture designed by [[industrial designer]] [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]]. It was made in 1981 as a fusion of two [[readymade]]s and launched Arad's career. The chair is a [[postmodernist]] design, combining a car seat with a [[structural tubing]] frame.

Arad had left his employment with a firm of architects,&lt;ref name="creativepool fountain"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fountain|first=John|title='Rover Chair' by Ron Arad|url=http://blogs.creativepool.co.uk/blog/rover-chair-by-ron-arad/|work=Creativepool Blog|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained the parts to make the chair from a [[scrapyard]] in [[Chalk Farm]], London.&lt;ref name="creativepool fountain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph gleadell 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleadell|first=Colin|title=Ron Arad: the designer who redrew the borders|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/5078224/Ron-Arad-the-designer-who-redrew-the-borders.html|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 Mar 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[readymade]]&lt;ref name="artnet manson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Manson|first=Neil|title=Chairmaster|url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/reviews/manson/manson5-25-05.asp|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=[[artnet]]|date=25 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; chair was the first piece of furniture he produced.&lt;ref name="bmivoyager cohen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Tobi|title=Design of the times|url=http://www.bmivoyager.com/2009/11/01/design-of-the-times/|work=BMI Voyager|publisher=[[British Midland International]]|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idfxmagazine burnett 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burnett|first=Kate|title=Ron Arad|url=http://www.idfxmagazine.com/features/ron-arad/|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=idfx|date=11 March 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rover P6 is sometimes known as the 2000.

Furniture maker Joe Hall visited Arad's [[Covent Garden]] shop in the {{nowrap|mid-1980s}} and then collaborated with him to make further chairs. Hall scoured the country's scrapyards for P6 seats, which cost £5{{ndash}}£15 each and were in excellent condition.&lt;ref name="telegraph baxter 2001" /&gt;

The chairs sold for £99 each in 1981,&lt;ref name="telegraph gleadell 2009" /&gt; about three times the production cost.&lt;ref name="creativepool fountain" /&gt; Original chairs made by Arad's [[One Off(company)|One Off]] company&lt;ref name="nytimes browne 2009" /&gt; have been auctioned by [[Christie's]],&lt;ref name="christies 1994"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christies.com/lotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=3746893 | title=SALE 6533 LOT 127 | work=[[Christie's]] | date=25 May 1994 | accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="christies 2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=2050456 | title=SALE 9098 LOT 322 | work=[[Christie's]] | date=16 May 2001 | accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonhams]],&lt;ref name="bonhams 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Arad for One Off Ltd, a 'Rover' chair, designed 1981|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/18807/lot/71/|work=Auction 18807|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bonhams 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ron Arad for One Off Ltd|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20166/lot/26/|work=Auction 20166|publisher=[[Bonhams]]|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bonhams &amp; Butterfield]]&lt;ref name="c-artsmag soetriyono 2008" /&gt; and [[Göteborgs Auktionsverk]].&lt;ref name="hittaauktion 2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hittaauktion.com/2011/11/goteborgs-auktionsverk-dags-for.html | title=Göteborgs Auktionsverk, Dags för kvalitetsauktion i Göteborg | work=hittaauktion.com | date=21 November 2011 | accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mynewsdesk 2011"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressroom/goeteborgs-auktionsverk/image/view/kvalitetsauktion-28-november-2011-auktionsnummer-37-ron-arad-102136 | title=Göteborgs Auktionsverk – Kvalitetsauktion 28 november 2011.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5444">'''Saskia Weishut-Snapper''' (born 5 August 1938 in [[Amsterdam]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[fiber artist]]. 

== Early life and family==
Saskia grew up in [[Bergen, North Holland]], a town with an art colony in which both her parents were active. Her mother was {{ill|Mies Bloch|nl}}, a painter and illustrator, mostly known for her [[cross-stitch]] designs. Her father was {{ill|Rein Snapper|nl||WD=}}, a painter, illustrator, and wood printer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bottercourant.nl/nieuws/algemeen/5393-peintisseries-van-saskia-weishut-snapper|title=Peintisseries van Saskia Weishut-Snapper|date=2015-07-15|work=Bottercourant|access-date=2018-08-07|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saskia is married, has five sons, and lives in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
Weishut-Snapper turned to textile arts in 1970. Creating mixed media scenes somewhere between painting and quilting, she  refers to her works as 'peintisseries'. The subjects of her art are often textile landscapes, fantasy buildings, abstract compositions and themes based on Jewish tradition. She mostly exhibits in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rheden.nieuws.nl/nieuws/100557/opening-expositie-peintisseries-saskia-weishut-snapper/|title=Opening expositie Peintisseries van Saskia Weishut-Snapper|date=2017-05-28|work=Rheden|access-date=2018-08-07|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crescas.nl/nieuws/2013-03-22/wlooz/Peintisseries-van-Saskia-Weishut-Snapper/|title=Crescas nieuws: 'Peintisseries' van Saskia Weishut-Snapper - Crescas|website=www.crescas.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wevershuis.nl/tag/saskia-weishut-snapper/|title=Saskia Weishut-Snapper {{!}} Museum Het Leids Wevershuis|website=www.wevershuis.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vezel.org/agenda/tentoonstelling-kunst-met-nesjomme-peintisseries-van-saskia-weishut-snapper/|title=Van Textiel tot Tyvek, werk van Saskia Weishut-Snapper - Vezel|website=www.vezel.org|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pkcastricum.nl/foto-album/kunstwerken-saskia-weishut-snapper-pk-castricum/item1390|title=Kunstwerken Saskia Weishut - Snapper {{!}} PK Castricum|last=Castricum|first=Protestantse Kerk|website=www.pkcastricum.nl|language=nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.destentor.nl/deventer/wandkleden-van-saskia-weishut-in-magna-domus~aa180751/|title=Wandkleden van Saskia Weishut in Magna Domus {{!}} destentor.nl|last=|first=|date=|website=www.destentor.nl|language=nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.galeries.nl/expo.asp?exponr=11241|title=Saskia Weishut-Snapper: Tyvek Sandwiches - Museum Jan van der Togt : Expositie / Exhibition at GALERIES.NL|website=www.galeries.nl|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also showed her paintings in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Japan, Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.viralagenda.com/pt/events/418928/exposicao-saskia-weishut-snapper|title=Exposição - Saskia Weishut Snapper - Viral Agenda|website=www.viralagenda.com|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityguideny.com/article/Gallery-Shows-in-New-York-City-This-Week-Jun-4-Jun-11#.W2lPT4kzbIU|title=Gallery Shows in New York City This Week - Jun 4-Jun 11|website=www.cityguideny.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityguideny.com/event/Agora-Gallery-2017-12-07-2017-12-07|title=Tripping the Light Fantastic - Agora Gallery 12/07/17  through 01/18/18|website=www.cityguideny.com|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sedgeford Torc ''' is a broken [[Iron Age]] [[gold]] [[torc]] found near the village of [[Sedgeford]] in [[Norfolk]].  The main part of the torc was found during [[Harrow (tool)|harrowing]] of a field in 1965,&lt;ref name=BMQ&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Brailsford | first = J.

The torc is now displayed at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=BM&gt;{{cite web | title = Gold torc | publisher = [[British Museum]] | author =  | url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/g/gold_torc.aspx | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091204223439/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/g/gold_torc.aspx | archivedate = 2009-12-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The torc dates from 200-50 BC&lt;ref name=AF/&gt; and is made from twisted gold wires.  Forty-eight 2mm wires were twisted in pairs to form 24 wires.  Then three of these paired wires were twisted together in the opposite direction to make a rope (comprising six original wires).  These eight thicker ropes were then twisted together to form the body of the torc.  In total, 25 metres of gold wire was used to form the torc.  The hollow gold terminals, in a ring shape, were cast using the [[lost wax]] method, and is decorated in the [[La Tène style]] with moulded raised decoration of trumpet voids and circles, highlighted with pellets and cold hammering.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;&lt;ref name=AF/&gt;  The torc is similar to the [[Snettisham Great Torc|Great Torc from Snettisham]] and also to the Ipswich torcs, all of which are also in the British Museum.  It is considered so similar to the [[Newark Torc]], found in [[Newark-on-Trent]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], that it might have been made by the same craftsman.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news | title = Metal detector man's £350,000 Iron Age neckband | publisher = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' | author = Stephen Adams | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3484377/Metal-detector-mans-350000-Iron-Age-neckband.html | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | location=London | date=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The torc was buried deliberately, and as such is considered a [[hoard]]ed object. It may have been broken when it was buried, or broken at a later date by ploughing. It is thought to have been buried in about 75 BC.&lt;ref name=BM/&gt;

==Discovery==
The major part of the torc was found on 6 May 1965 in a field at West Hall Farm in Sedgeford, Norfolk, while the field was being lightly harrowed.  As the harrow only penetrated a few inches, it is thought that the torc had been brought to near the surface by earlier deep ploughing.  The findspot is only two miles west of the site of the large [[Snettisham Hoard]], which included many gold torcs.  The torc was declared [[treasure trove]] during an inquest held at Sedgeford on 29 December 1966.  The torc was acquired for the British Museum through the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] and with the assistance of the Christy Trust, and the finder, farmworker A. E. Middleton (landowner B. G. Campbell), was awarded the full market value of £3,300.  The British Museum arranged for a replica to be made, to be displayed at the [[Norwich Castle|Norwich Castle Museum]].

In Easter 2004 the missing terminal was found during an archaeological [[Archaeological field survey#Field walk .28transects.29|fieldwalking]] survey, using metal detectors, arranged by the [[Sedgeford Historical and Archaeological Research Project]].&lt;ref name=SHARP&gt;{{cite web | title = The Sedgeford Torc Terminal | publisher = [[Sedgeford Historical and Archaeological Research Project]] | author =  | url = http://www.sharpinfo.org.uk/itemsofinterest/torc.htm | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090105174852/http://www.sharpinfo.org.uk/itemsofinterest/torc.htm | archivedate = 2009-01-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terminal was found by retired chemistry lecturer Dr. Steve Hammond about 400 metres from the findspot of the main body of the torc.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Unsung heroes of heritage' extolled for unearthing hoard of treasure | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | author = Maev Kennedy | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/18/artnews.arts | accessdate = 2009-12-01 | location=London | date=2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terminal was also declared treasure trove and purchased for the British Museum with assistance from [[The Art Fund]].&lt;ref name=AF&gt;{{cite web | title = Sedgeford torc terminal | publisher = [[The Art Fund]] | author = | url = http://www.artfund.org/artwork/9651/sedgeford-torc-terminal | accessdate = 2009-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has since been reunited with the rest of the Sedgeford Torc at the British Museum.

In [[literature]], a '''serial''' is a printing format by which a single larger [[Work of art|work]], often a work of [[Narrative|narrative fiction]], is published in smaller, sequential ''installments''. The installments are also known as ''numbers'', ''parts'' or ''fascicles'', and may be released either as separate [[Publication|publications]] or within sequential issues of a [[periodical publication]], such as a magazine or newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century Journalism|last1= Law|first1= Graham|editor1-first= Laurel|editor1-last= Brake|editor2-first= Marysa|editor2-last= Demoor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;printsec=frontcover|chapter= Serials and the Nineteenth-Century Publishing Industry|year= 2009|publisher= Academia Press|location= London|isbn= |page= 567|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;pg=PA567|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
The growth of moveable type in the 17th century prompted episodic and often disconnected narratives such as ''[[L'Astrée]]'' and ''[[Artamène|Le Grand Cyrus]]''. At that time, books remained a premium item, so to reduce the price and expand the market, publishers produced large works in lower-cost installments called fascicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagedorn|first=Roger|title=Technology and Economic Exploitation: The Serial as a Form of Narrative Presentation|journal=Wide Angle: A Film Quarterly of Theory, Criticism and Practice|year=1988|volume=10|issue=4|pages=4–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th and early 20th centuries ==
Serialized fiction surged in popularity during Britain's [[Victorian era]], due to a combination of the rise of literacy, technological advances in printing, and improved economics of distribution.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite book |title= Serializing Fiction in the Victorian Press |last= Law |first= Graham |year= 2000 |publisher= Palgrave |location= New York &amp; Hampshire, UK |isbn= 0-312-23574-7|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dOuhyJIJkUMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=serial+fiction+victorian+graham+law&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vF6kToWdEqXo0QHN9oSfBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=serial%20fiction%20victorian%20graham%20law&amp;f=false | accessdate= October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} Most [[Victorian novels]] first appeared as installments in monthly or weekly periodicals.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;{{rp|13}} The wild success of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', first published in 1836, is widely considered to have established the viability and appeal of the serialized format within periodical literature.  During that era, the line between "quality" and "commercial" literature was not distinct.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;{{rp|31}} Other famous writers who wrote serial literature for popular magazines were [[Wilkie Collins]], inventor of the [[detective fiction|detective novel]] with ''[[The Moonstone]]'' and Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who created the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories originally for serialization in ''[[Strand Magazine|The Strand]]'' magazine.

While American periodicals first syndicated British writers, over time they drew from a growing base of domestic authors. The rise of the periodicals like ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' and the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' grew in symbiotic tandem with American literary talent. The magazines nurtured and provided an economic sustainability for writers, while the writers helped grow the periodicals' circulation base. During the late 19th century, those that were considered the best American writers first published their work in serial form and then only later in a completed volume format.&lt;ref name=Lund&gt;{{cite book |title= AMERICAS CONTINUING STORY An Introduction to Serial Fiction, 1850-1900 |last= Lund |first= Michael |year= 1993 |publisher= Wayne State University Press |location=Detroit |isbn= 0-8143-2401-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dOuhyJIJkUMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=serialized+fiction+victorian+&amp;ots=VywkLjckG4&amp;sig=XUtZjmFc3-LidHeTA8yBNt6UYRI#v=onepage
| accessdate= October 23, 2011}} As [[Scribner's Monthly]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} As a piece in ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'' explained in 1878, "Now it is the second or third rate novelist who cannot get publication in a magazine, and is obliged to publish in a volume, and it is in the magazine that the best novelist always appears first."&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;{{rp|52}} Among the American writers that wrote in serial form were [[Henry James]] and [[Herman Melville]]. A large part of the appeal for writers at the time was the broad audiences that serialization could reach, which would then grow their following for published works. One of the first significant American works to be released in serial format is ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], which was published over a 40-week period by ''[[The National Era]]'', an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851 issue.

Serialization was so standard in American literature that authors from that era often built installment structure into their creative process. James, for example, often had his works divided into multi-part segments of similar length.&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;{{rp|30}} The consumption of fiction during that time was different than in the 20th century. Instead of being read in a single volume, a novel would often be consumed by readers in installments over a period as long as a year, with the authors and periodicals often responding to audience reaction.&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;

In France, [[Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Eugène Sue]] were masters of the serialized genre. ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' each appeared as a ''[[feuilleton]]''. ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' was stretched out to 139 installments. Eugène Sue's serial novel ''Le Juif errant'' increased circulation of ''Le Constitutionnel'' from 3,600 to 25,000. Production in book form soon followed and serialization was one of the main reasons that nineteenth-century novels were so long. Authors and publishers kept the story going if it was successful since authors were paid by line and by episode. [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' was serialized in ''[[La Revue de Paris]]'' in 1856.

Some writers were prolific. Alexandre Dumas wrote at an incredible pace, oftentimes writing with his partner twelve to fourteen hours a day, working on several novels for serialized publication at once. However, not every writer could keep up with the serial writing pace. [[Wilkie Collins]], for instance, was never more than a week before publication. The difference in writing pace and output in large part determined the author's success, as audience appetite created demand for further installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|year=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=153–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[German-speaking countries]], the serialized novel was widely popularized by the weekly family magazine ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', which reached a circulation of 382,000 by 1875.&lt;ref name = Belgum1&gt;Kirsten Belgum: "Domesticating the Reader: Women and Die Gartenlaube" in: ''Women in German Yearbook 9'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993) {{ISBN|0-8032-9754-8}} pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, ''[[The Russian Messenger]]'' serialized [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' from 1873 to 1877 and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' from 1879 to 1880. In Poland, [[Bolesław Prus]] wrote several serialized novels: ''[[The Outpost (Prus novel)|The Outpost]]'' (1885–86), ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (1887–89), ''[[The New Woman]]'' (1890–93), and his sole [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (the latter, exceptionally, written entire over a year's time in 1894–95 and serialized only after completion, in 1895–96).

In addition, works in late [[Qing dynasty]] China had been serialized. ''[[The Nine-tailed Turtle]]'' was serialized from 1906 to 1910.&lt;ref name=WangDeweip181&gt;[[David Der-wei Wang|Wang, David Der-wei]].

== Late 20th and early-21st centuries ==
With the rise of broadcast—both radio and [[television series]]—in the first half of the 20th century, printed periodical fiction began a slow decline as newspapers and magazines shifted their focus from entertainment to information and news. However, some serialization of novels in periodicals continued, with mixed success.

The first several books in the ''[[Tales of the City]]'' series by [[Armistead Maupin]] appeared from 1978 as regular installments in San Francisco newspapers. Similar serial novels ran in other city newspapers, such as ''[[The Serial]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificsun.com/marin_a_and_e/book_reviews/article_3f9b2c1e-65b4-11e2-9dd9-001a4bcf6878.html|title=That '70s book|publisher=Pacific Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1976; [[Marin County]]), ''Tangled Lives'' (Boston), ''Bagtime'' (Chicago), and ''Federal Triangle'' (Washington, D.C.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915212,00.html |title=The Press: Soap Operas Come to Print |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 8, 1977 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1984, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'', about contemporary New York City, ran in 27 parts in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', partially inspired by the model of Dickens. The magazine paid $200,000 for his work, but Wolfe heavily revised the work before publication as a standalone novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ragen|first=Brian Abel|title=Tom Wolfe: A Critical Companion|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT:|isbn=0-313-31383-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander McCall Smith]], author of ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'' series, experimented in 2004 with publishing his novel ''[[44 Scotland Street]]'' in instalments every weekday in ''[[The Scotsman]]''. [[Michael Chabon]] serialized ''[[Gentlemen of the Road]]'' in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 2007.

The emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] prompted some authors to revise a serial format. [[Stephen King]] experimented with ''[[The Plant]]'' (2000), and [[Michel Faber]] allowed ''The Guardian'' to serialise his novel ''[[The Crimson Petal and the White]]''. In 2005, [[Orson Scott Card]] serialized his out-of-print novel ''[[Hot Sleep]]'' in the first issue of his online magazine, ''[[InterGalactic Medicine Show]]''. In 2008 McCall Smith wrote a serialized online novel ''[[Corduroy Mansions]]'', with the audio edition read by [[Andrew Sachs]] made available at the same pace as the daily publication. In 2011, [[pseudonym]]ous author Wildbow published ''[[Worm (web serial)|Worm]]'', which remains one of the most popular web serials of all time.&lt;ref name="Beacon-Villager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maynard.wickedlocal.com/article/20150702/NEWS/150709367|title=Adam Sherman of Maynard publishes web serial|first=Jesse|last=Collings|publisher=Wicked Local}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Star"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/online-exclusive/reading-revolution/2014/02/20/discipline-and-determiniation/|title=Discipline and determination pay off for webserial writer|date=20 February 2014|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/Wildbow|title=Wildbow is creating Web serials|publisher=[[Patreon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[fan fiction]] on the internet also follows a serial fiction style of publication, as seen on websites such as [[FanFiction.Net]] and [[Archive of Our Own#Archive of Our Own|Archive of Our Own (AO3)]].

Many aspiring authors also used the web to publish free-to-read works in serialized format independently as well as web-based communities such as [[LiveJournal]], Fictionpress.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fictionpress.com Fictionpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; fictionhub,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fictionhub.io|title = fictionhub|date = |accessdate = |website = fictionhub|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wattpad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wattpad.com Wattpad]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these books receive as many readers as successful novels; some have received the same number of readers as New York Times bestsellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Many Books Do You Need To Sell To Become A Bestseller?|url=http://www.bookpromotionhub.com/6103/how-many-books-do-you-need-to-sell-to-become-a-bestseller/|website=www.bookpromotionhub.com|publisher=book promotion hub|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wildbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/monthly-views-june.jpg|website=wildbow.wordpress.com|title=Thoughts: A Reflection on growth over two years|date=26 June 2013|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the prevalence of mobile devices made the serial format even more popular with the likes of JukePop Serials&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jukepopserials.com/ JukePop Serials]&lt;/ref&gt;, and Serial Box&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/8/6/16849756/serial-box-serialized-books-peak-tv|title=Meet a new kind of book, designed for the age of Peak TV|work=Vox|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.serialbox.com/|title=Serial Box is the Newest Medium for Series Drama|website=www.serialbox.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with iOS&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-serial-stories-jukepop/id579377848?mt=8 JukePop Serials] (iOS)&lt;/ref&gt; and Android&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jukepop&amp;hl=en JukePop Serials] (Android)&lt;/ref&gt; apps that focuses entirely on curating and promoting serialized novels.

'''Soviet art''' is the [[visual art]] that was produced in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Soviet Avant-Garde art==

During the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The instrument for this was created just days before the [[October Revolution]], known as [[Proletkult]], an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]]. Initially [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. However the latter sought too much independence from the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of [[Bolsheviks]], gained negative attitude of [[Vladimir Lenin]], by 1922 declined considerably, and was eventually disbanded in 1932.
The ideas of Proletkult attracted the interests of [[Russian avantgarde]], who strived to  get rid of the conventions of "bourgeois art". Among notable persons of this movement was [[Kazimir Malevich]]. However the ideas of the avantgarde eventually clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

In search of new forms of expression, the Proletkult organisation was highly eclectic in its art forms, and thus was prone to harsh criticism for inclusion of such modern directions as [[impressionism]] and [[cubism]], since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with "decadent bourgeois art".

Among early experiments of Proletkult was [[pragmaic aesthetic|pragmatic aesthetic]] of [[industrial art]], the prominent theoretist being [[Boris Arvatov]].

Another group was [[UNOVIS]], a very short-lived but influential collection of young artists led by [[Kasimir Malevich]] in the 1920s.

==Socialist realism==
{{Main|Socialist realism}}

Officially approved art was required to follow the doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]]. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Moscow and Leningrad Union of Artists was established on August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Soviet artists were [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Aleksandr Deyneka]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]] and other painters from Moscow and Leningrad School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/outline.htm ''Segei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow artist [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]] during his career produced a large number of heroic paintings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later alleged that [[Kliment Voroshilov]] spent more time posing in Gerasimov's studio than he did attending to his duties in the People's Commissariat of Defense. Gerasimov's painting shows a mastery of classical representational techniques.

However, art exhibitions of 1935–1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called ‘social order’. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''Soviet Impressionist Painting.'' Woodbridge, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 2008; p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-1950s and 1960s, the [[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|Leningrad school]] was approaching its apex. Artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more. Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[:ru:Русов, Лев Александрович|Lev Russov]], [[:ru:Орешников, Виктор Михайлович|Victor Oreshnikov]], Boris Korneev, Semion Rotnitsky, Vladimir Gorb, Engels Kozlov, landscapes by [[:ru:Тимков, Николай Ефимович|Nikolai Timkov]], [[:ru:Овчинников, Владимир Иванович|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[:ru:Осипов, Сергей Иванович|Sergei Osipov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Александр Михайлович|Alexander Semionov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Арсений Никифорович|Arseny Semionov]], Nikolai Galakhov, genre paintings by [[:ru:Позднеев, Николай Матвеевич|Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]], Yevsey Moiseenko, Andrey Milnikov. Art of this period showed extraordinary taste for life and creative work.

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad and province. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form and painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians – become the most popular heroes of paintings.

At this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussions again. This greatly broadened artists’ understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that made this style dominates in the [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm ''Sergei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet Nonconformist Art==
{{Main|Soviet Nonconformist Art}}

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the [[Soviet Union]].  Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.

In the 1950s Moscow artist [[Ely Bielutin]] encouraged his students to experiment with [[abstractionism]], a practice thoroughly discouraged by the [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|Artists' Union]], which strictly enforced the official policy of [[Socialist Realism]].  Artists who chose to paint in alternative styles had to do so completely in private and were never able to exhibit or sell their work. As a result, [[Nonconformist Art]] developed along a separate path than the [[Official Art]] that was recorded in the history books.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and [[Anatoly Zverev]], an underground [[Russian avant-garde]] expressionist.  Serov's portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour.  When Khrushchev learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions.  And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage.

The [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo Group]] was formed around the artist [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]] in the 1960s and included artists such as [[Valentina Kropivnitskaya]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], and [[Lydia Masterkova]].  While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought to faithfully express themselves in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of [[Socialist Realism]].

Tolerance of Nonconformist Art by the authorities underwent an ebb and flow until the ultimate collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  Artists took advantage of the first few years after the death of Stalin to experiment in their work without the fear of persecution.  In 1962, artists experienced a slight setback when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared at the exhibition of the 30th anniversary of the Moscow Artist's Union at the [[Moscow Manege]] exhibition hall, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]].  Among the customary works of [[Socialist Realism]] were a few abstract works by artists such as [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and [[Eli Beliutin]], which Khrushchev criticized as being "shit," and the artists for being "homosexuals."  The message was clear: artistic policy was not as liberal as everyone had hoped.

The history of late Soviet art has been dominated by politics and simplistic formulae. Both within the artworld and the general public, very little consideration has been given to the aesthetic character of the work produced in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, the official and unofficial art of the period usually stood in for either "bad" or "good" political developments.  A more nuanced picture would emphasize that there were numerous competing groups making art in Moscow and Leningrad throughout this period. The most important figures for the international art scene have been the Moscow artists Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrsky, Vitaly Komar and Aleksandr Melamid.

The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 [[Bulldozer Exhibition]], which took place in a park just outside Moscow, and included work by such artists as [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Komar and Melamid]], [[Alexandr Zhdanov]], [[Nikolai Smoliakov]] and [[Leonid Sokov]].  The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request.  They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of [[Socialist Realism]].  The [[KGB]] put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present.  However, the foreign press had been there to witness the event, and the worldwide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in [[Izmailovsky Park]] in Moscow.

A few West European collectors, supported during the 60th and the 70th and until 1988 (the year of the Perestroika) many of the artists in the old Soviet Union. One of the leading collectors and philanthropists were the couple Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera. The Bar-Gera Collection consists of some 200 works of 59 Soviet Russian artists of who did not want to embrace the official art directive of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera, both are survivors of the holocaust, supported these partially persecuted artists by sending them money or painting material from Germany to the Soviet Union. Even though the Kenda and Jacob did not meet the artists in person, they bought many of their paintings and other art objects. The works were smuggled to Germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats, traveling businessmen, and students, thus making the Bar-Gera Collection of Russian Non-Conformists among the largest of its kind in the world. Among others, the collection content works of Bachtschanjan Vagritsch, Jankilevskij Wladimir,Rabin  Oskar, Batschurin Ewganij, Kabakov Ilja, Schablavin Sergei, Belenok Piotr, Krasnopevcev Dimitrij, Schdanov Alexander, [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]],
Bitt Galina, Kropivnitzkaja Walentina, Schemjakin Michail, Bobrowskaja Olga, Kropivnitzkij Lew,Schwarzman  Michail, Borisov  Leonid, Kropiwnizkij Jewgenij, Sidur  Vadim, Bruskin Grischa, Kulakov  Michail, Sitnikov  Wasili, and many others.

By the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression.  With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons.  Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

}}'''Stephen Eastaugh''' (born 1960) is an Australian contemporary artist from [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]], Australia. He is known for producing semi-[[Abstract art|abstract]], [[mixed media]]  art, and his work is often informed by his experiences traveling.

== Career ==
Eastaugh studied at the [[University of Melbourne Faculty of VCA and MCM|Victorian College of the Arts]] from 1979 to 1981. After completing his Bachelors of Fine Art, he began to travel, first to New Zealand and Norway,&lt;ref&gt;Hor-Chung Lau, J. “Stitches and stays”, ''South China Morning Post'', 8 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  and since then has not settled anywhere for more than a few months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Jonathan. “The Art of Travel”, ''Asian Art News'', Vol. 14 No.6, November/December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1980s, he has participated in over 100 solo exhibitions and 100 group exhibitions in Australia and internationally. He is represented in many of Australia’s state and national art collections including the National Gallery of Australia, the National Gallery of Victoria and Parliament House Canberra.

In 2012 Eastaugh self-published ''Unstill Life'', a book with a limited-edition of 500 copies, documenting his 30 years of traveling which he wrote over the winter of 2009 at [[Mawson station]] in Antarctica.

=== Artistic Style and Influences ===
Each of Eastaugh's semi-abstract, mixed-media artworks tells a story based on his travels&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley. “Wandering star”, The Australian, 26 June 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;, such as passing out after his drink was spiked in Peru (''Drugs'', 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Wardell, M “East(augh), West, North and South”, ''Stephen Eastaugh: Antarctica'', international touring exhibition catalogue, 2000-1&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Antarctichinoiserie-scape'' (2004), for example, was inspired by the rafting sea ice found in Antarctica while reminiscent of depictions of distance in Chinese landscape paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Jonathan. “The Art of Travel”, ''Asian Art News'', Vol. 14 No.6, November/December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  

Eastaugh calls his art of travel an ‘Unstill Life’.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lucinda. “Everysomewherever”, Mercedes magazine, Autumn 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He has made nine trips to Antarctica: three trips as the official [http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/antarctic-arts-fellowship/alumni/2000-2009/2000-stephen-eastaugh Australian Antarctic Arts fellow] (2000, 2002–3, 2009), and six times as an artist-in-residence on tourist ships. He travelled twice to the [[North Pole]] as part of a Polar art residency on Russian icebreakers.&lt;ref&gt;Hor-Chung Lau, J. “Stitches and stays”, ''South China Morning Post'', 8 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Ulan Bator (Mongolia), Nuuk (Greenland), Nufa Alofa (Tonga), Ushuaia (Argentina) are among the 80 plus countries Eastaugh has visited.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Jonathan. “The Art of Travel”, ''Asian Art News'', Vol. 14 No.6, November/December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; His 2006 Summer studio at Australia’s [[Davis Station]] in Antarctica was the subject of the [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] documentary ''AntarcticArt''.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lucinda. “Everysomewherever”, ''Mercedes magazine'', Autumn 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On Eastaugh's third official trip to Antarctica he over-wintered at Mawson station.&lt;ref&gt;Raw, Kristin. “Ice in your paintbrush”, ''Australian Antarctic Magazine'', Issue 29, December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The work Eastaugh produces in each country regularly uses materials that resonate with, or are particular to, the local culture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Jonathan. “The Art of Travel”, ''Asian Art News'', Vol. 14 No.6, November/December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These materials have a strong textural quality: encaustic wax, oilsticks, medical bandages, rugs, fabric, embroidery, damaged paper and pearl shells.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lucinda. “Everysomewherever”, ''Mercedes magazine'', Autumn 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rooted (Mongolia)'', 2004, for example, abstracts various Mongolian objects and views in 30 panels made from acrylic paint and embroidered medical bandages, wool and cotton thread.&lt;ref&gt;Hor-Chung Lau, J. “Stitches and stays”, ''South China Morning Post'', 8 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Personal life ==
An adopted child born in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Lucinda. “Everysomewherever”, ''Mercedes magazine'', Autumn 2008 &lt;/ref&gt; Eastaugh made contact with his biological parents when he was 28.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley. “Wandering star”, ''The Australian'', 26 June 2010 &lt;/ref&gt; His biological father is a former Dutch sailor, based in Broome, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley. “Wandering star”, ''The Australian'', 26 June 2010 &lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Eastaugh married Argentinian photographer and vigneron Carolina Furque in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Ashley. “Wandering star”, ''The Australian'', 26 June 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1965">In [[South Africa]], '''Swenkas''' are [[working-class]] [[Zulu people|Zulu]] men who participate in amateur competitions that are part [[fashion show]] and part [[choreography]], the purpose of which is to display one's [[Fashion|style]] and sense of attitude.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The practice, called "'''swenking'''", ultimately derives from the English word "[[:wikt:swank|swank]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Swenkas |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925881?refcatid=31 |last=Felperin |first=Leslie |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=Jan 17, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These well-dressed men are proud and considered to serve as an inspiration to others. Frequently, on Saturday nights they meet up to compete in a fashion show of sorts. The Swenkas are judged both on what they are wearing (typically, expensive designer suits with well-known European names on their labels) and their choreographed movements (their 'swank').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Swanky Swenkas: dressing sharp regardless of cost |url=https://www.vice.com/read/swank-v14n5 |last=Fleminger |first=David |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an entrance fee to compete in these swank-offs and the winner of the night goes home with a portion of the money collected from the competitors. The men follow certain set values of swanking, such as physical cleanliness, sobriety and above all self-respect. In 2004, [[Denmark|Danish]] filmmaker [[Jeppe Rønde]] created ''The Swenkas'', a documentary about the group.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{citation |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2005/11/09/movies/09swen.html |title=Saturday Night Peacocks in Squalid South Africa |last=Catsoulis |first=Jeanette |date= November 9, 2005 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Death of Nelson''''' is a wall painting in the [[Palace of Westminster#Royal Gallery|Royal Gallery]] of the [[Palace of Westminster]] by the Irish artist [[Daniel Maclise]].  A finished study for it, in the form of a painting, is in the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]].

==History==

Maclise received the commission for two wall paintings in the Royal Gallery in 1857; these were to depict ''[[The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher after the Battle of Waterloo]]'' and ''The Death of Nelson''.  However Maclise found that creating the works in [[fresco]] would prove too difficult, and he resigned the commission.  He then discovered the waterglass technique (infusing the surface with [[sodium silicate]]) and resumed the commission.  Maclise started work on ''The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher'' in January 1860 and completed it during the winter of 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.explore-parliament.net/nssMovies/06/0647/0647_.htm| title = 'The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher' by Daniel Maclise| accessdate = 23 April 2010 | publisher =  Armchair Travel Co }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then submitted a sketch for ''The Death of Nelson'' to the Fine Arts Commission.  However [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the prime promoter of the Commission, died in 1861 and the Commission lost some of its momentum.  It was not until 1863 that Maclise received permission to continue with the scheme.&lt;ref name=royal&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.explore-parliament.net/nssMovies/01/0100/0100_.htm| title = 'The Death of Nelson' by Daniel Maclise| accessdate = 23 April 2010 | publisher =  Armchair Travel Co }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1859 and 1864 Maclise created a plan for this picture; this was a painting that comprised a "finished study" for the work.  This painting was purchased by the Walker Art Gallery in 1892 from the Art Union of London; the money for this was obtained from the Liverpool Naval Exhibition.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.asp?venue=2&amp;id=37| title = ''The Death of Nelson' 1859-64', by Daniel Maclise (1806-70) | accessdate = 23 April 2010 | publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wall paintings did not survive well; by 1869 the colours were fading.  However modern critics continue to praise "their serious and sombre realism and their expressive power".&lt;ref name=royal/&gt;

==The two paintings==

[[File:The Death of Nelson - detail.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''The Death of Nelson'' in the [[Palace of Westminster]]]]
The study, copied for the wall painting, was created in 1859–64 and is organised as a [[frieze]], in a long narrow format.  It shows the dying [[Horatio Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] on the deck of ''[[HMS Victory]]'', cradled in the arms of [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Captain Hardy]], with other figures, including [[William Beatty (surgeon)|Dr&amp;nbsp;Beatty]], leaning over him. They are surrounded by members of the crew.  Maclise took trouble over the accuracy of details in the picture; he interviewed survivors of the battle and researched the naval equipment in use at the time.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt;  However the painting is not an accurate account of the event, because Nelson was quickly taken below decks, where he died; it is rather an idealisation of the event.&lt;ref name=royal/&gt;  Included in the painting are two [[black people]]; this is likely to be historically accurate as two men from Africa were included in the crew of ''HMS Victory''.  At this time people of African descent were integrated with other members of the crew, although they tended to work in the lower ranks. One of the Africans is pointing towards the [[Assassination|assassin]] of Nelson.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt;

==The Engraving==

The Maclise painting was engraved by Charles W. Sharpe in 1876 and published the Art Union of London. It sold widely around the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marinecurator.blogspot.ca/2013/10/trafalgar-day.html Dan Conlin, "Trafalgar Day: The Death of Nelson", ''The Marine Curaotr's Blog'' Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nelson engraving was often sold with an engraving of the companion work by Maclise, "Wellington Meeting Blucher at the Battle of Waterloo".

==Other depictions of the event==
In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century the death of Nelson was a popular subject for artists.  Other notable paintings of the event include ''[[The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805]]'' painted by [[Arthur William Devis]] in 1805 now found at [[National Maritime Museum]], and ''[[The Death of Nelson (West painting)|The Death of Nelson]]'' painted by [[Benjamin West]] in 1806 and now at the Walker Art Gallery.

'''''The Emerald Forest''''' is a 1985 [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] set in the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon Rainforest|Rainforest]], directed by [[John Boorman]], written by [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and starring [[Powers Boothe]], [[Meg Foster]], and [[Charley Boorman]] with supporting roles by Rui Polanah, [[Tetchie Agbayani]], [[Dira Paes]], Estee Chandler, and [[Eduardo Conde]]. It is allegedly based on a true story, although some dispute this. The film was screened out of competition at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/928/year/1985.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Emerald Forest |accessdate=8 July 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In promoting the film for awards competition, Boorman created the first [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] [[screener (promotional)|screener]]s, but the film received no Academy Award nominations.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes /&gt;

==Plot summary==
Bill Markham ([[Powers Boothe]]) is an engineer who has moved to [[Brazil]] with his family to work on a large hydro-electric dam. The film opens on Markham, his wife Jean ([[Meg Foster]]), his young son Tommy (William Rodriguez), and his daughter Heather (Yara Vaneau) having a picnic on the edge of the jungle, which is being cleared for the dam's construction. Tommy wanders from the cleared area, and an [[Uncontacted peoples|Indian]] (Rui Polanah) from one of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous tribes]] known as the Invisible People notices Tommy and abducts him. Markham pursues the pair into the forest but does not find his son.

Ten years later, the dam is nearing completion. A 17-year-old Tommy ([[Charley Boorman]]), now called Tomme, has become one of the Invisible People. Tomme marries a woman named Kachiri ([[Dira Paes]]) and undergoes a [[vision quest]], where his [[Power animal|spirit animal]] tells him he must retrieve sacred stones from a remote spot deep in the jungle. Chief Wanadi, the man who abducted and adopted Tommy, warns him that the quest will be dangerous, as it will take him into the territory of the cannibalistic Fierce People.

Meanwhile, Markham has finally identified his son's abductors. Markham and a journalist decide to set off bottle rockets to attract the attention of the Invisible People. Instead, they attract the Fierce People and are captured. Armed with a [[CAR-15]] carbine, Markham is able to defend himself long enough to talk with Chief Jacareh (Claudio Moreno) who releases Markham for the night, promising to hunt him down in the morning, while the Fierce People kill and butcher the journalist. Close to dawn, Markham stumbles into Tomme collecting the sacred stones. The two recognize each other just as the Fierce People arrive, shooting Markham in the shoulder. Tomme and his father manage to escape, leaving Markham's carbine behind. In the care of the Invisible People, Markham recovers from his injuries and undergoes a vision quest, waking up back at the dam's construction zone.

Jacareh, recognizing the destructive power of Markham's carbine, visits a seedy brothel at the edge of the construction zone and arranges to exchange women for ammunition and more guns. Tomme and his friends return to their village to discover that many of the Invisible People have been murdered and all the young women abducted by the Fierce People. Desperate for help, Tomme navigates the city to his parents' condo, and Markham agrees to help rescue the women from the brothel.

That night, Markham initiates a shootout in the brothel while Tomme and his friends release the enslaved women from captivity. In the ensuing battle, the Fierce People kill several members of the Invisible People, including Chief Wanadi. Tomme is later sworn in as the new chief of the tribe. Markham warns Tomme that the almost-completed dam will end the tribe's way of life, but Tomme insists that the Invisible People are safe. During a storm, Markham places demolition explosives at key points along the dam, but the detonator fails.  The storm, summoned by Tomme and his people, has been raging for two days by now, and the flow is enough to breach the dam.  Markham watches its destruction with mixed emotions.

The film ends with Tomme and Kachiri sitting at the swimming hole near their village in the jungle, watching the members of their tribe splash and play.

As of 2018, ''Rotten Tomatoes'' assigns it an 81% approval rating out of 16 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_emerald_forest/ |title=The Emerald Forest |last= |first= |date= |website=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Emerald Forest'' was designated a Critics' Pick by a ''[[New York Times]]'' reviewer, who called it "compelling and richly atmospheric".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/reviews/movies/critics-picks |title=New York Times' Critics' Picks |last= |first= |date= |website=New York Times |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a negative review, [[Paul Attanasio]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' called it "long, wheezy tribute to the Noble Savage" and more of "a National Geographic special" than a proper film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/07/03/its-rough-in-the-jungle/eb781990-c5e0-44fc-9006-dc564b11cd1a/ |title=It's Rough in the Jungle |last=Attanasio |first=Paul |date=July 3, 1985 |website=The Washington Post |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was nominated for 3 BAFTA Awards, for Cinematography, Make Up, and Score.

==Inspiration==
The film was promoted as "based on a true story". Critic [[Harlan Ellison]] in his book ''Harlan Ellison's Watching'' wrote that attempts by SCAN&lt;ref&gt;The Southern California Answer Network (SCAN) is a library reference / research company.&lt;/ref&gt; to get background information on the real story revealed that Rospo Pallenberg's original screenplay was based on several stories,&lt;ref name="ellison"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellison |first=Harlan |author-link=Harlan Ellison |title=Harlan Ellison's Watching |publisher=Underwood |year=1989 |pages=407–409}}&lt;/ref&gt; including an article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' about a Peruvian labourer whose child had been abducted by a local Indian tribe and located sixteen years later almost fully assimilated.&lt;ref name=latimes1972&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/684744122.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+8,+1972&amp;author=LEONARD+GRE&amp;puENWOODb=Los+Angeles+Times+(1886-Current+File)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=E10&amp;desc=Long+Hunt+for+Son+Ends+in+Success,+but--- |first=Leonard |last=Greenwood |title=Long hunt for son ends in success, but — |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=8 October 1972 |page=10 |archiveurl=http://www.nativeamericanfilms.org/ef-truestory.html |archivedate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pallenberg's agent told SCAN that while director [[John Boorman]] had said that he read the original ''L.A. Times'' article, in fact, he had not, but was simply working from Pallenberg's screenplay. According to SCAN, Boorman told NPR's ''All Things Considered'' that the son was still living with the tribe in 1985, and identified the tribe as "the [[Mayoruna]]", yet detailed anthropological studies of that tribe do not mention an adopted outsider.&lt;ref name="ellison"/&gt;

An additional possible source for ''The Emerald Forest'' is the book, ''Wizard of the Upper Amazon'', first published before 1975.&lt;ref name=CordovaRios1975&gt;{{cite book |title=Wizard of the upper Amazon: The story of Manuel Cordova-Rios |year=1975 |author-first=Manuel |author-last=Cordova-Rios |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0395199190 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is an account of Manuel Cordova-Rios’ kidnapping when he was a teenager working for rubber cutters in the Amazon in the early 1900s. He was taken by a [[Matsés|group of Native Amazonians]] to their remote Indian village. These Amazonians were fiercely independent and had fled into the interior because they refused to live under the subservient conditions imposed by the rubber barons at that time. Cordova-Rios was incorporated into their tribe and describes a life strikingly similar to the one depicted in ''The Emerald Forest''.&lt;ref name=CordovaRios1975/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wizard of the upper Amazon: The story of Manuel Cordova-Rios |year=1993 |author1-first=Manuel |author1-last=Cordova-Rios |author2-first=F. Bruce |author2-last=Lamb |publisher=North Atlantic Books |isbn=978-0938190806 |edition=3rd Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Ellison's conclusion, a contemporaneous January 1985 review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine states up front that the movie is "[b]ased on an uncredited true story about a Peruvian whose son disappeared in the jungles of Brazil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790680.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 |title=The Emerald Forest |magazine=Variety |date=1 January 1985 |access-date=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' article also mentioned that the Peruvian child had at the time decided as an adult to stay with his adoptive tribe.&lt;ref name=latimes1972/&gt;

==First Oscar screeners==
Because Embassy Pictures was struggling in the year of ''Emerald Forest'''s release, the film did not receive a traditional "For Your Consideration" advertising campaign for the [[58th Academy Awards|1985 Academy Awards]]. Boorman took the initiative to promote the film himself by making [[VHS]] copies available for no charge to [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] members at several [[Los Angeles]]-area video rental stores. Boorman's idea later became ubiquitous during [[Hollywood]]'s award season, and by the 2010s, more than a million Oscar [[screener (promotional)|screener]]s were mailed to Academy members each year. However, ''Emerald Forest'' itself received no nominations from Boorman's strategy.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-oscar-screeners-20180301-story.html |title=The Oscar screener was invented by accident, and other secrets of an awards season staple |last=Miller  |first=Daniel  |date=March 1, 2018  |website=The Los Angeles Times  |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote="The Emerald Forest" didn't get any Oscar nominations — but Boorman's gambit made an impact: He effectively invented the movie screener, now an integral part of Hollywood's awards season apparatus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Express''''' (also known as '''''The Express: The Ernie Davis Story''''') is a 2008 American [[List of sports films|sports film]] produced by [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] and directed by [[Gary Fleder]]. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by [[Charles Leavitt]] from a book titled ''Ernie Davis: The Elmira Express'', authored by Robert C. Gallagher. The film is based on the life of [[Syracuse University]] [[Syracuse Orange football|football]] player [[Ernie Davis]], the first [[African American]] to win the [[Heisman Trophy]], portrayed by actor [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]. ''The Express'' explores civil rights topics, such as racism, discrimination and athletics.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;[[Gary Fleder]]. (2008). ''The Express'' [Motion picture]. United States: [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was a co-production between the film studios of [[Relativity Media]] and [[Davis Entertainment]]. It was commercially distributed by [[Universal Pictures]] theatrically, and by [[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] for home media. [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Charles S. Dutton]] star in principal supporting roles. The original motion picture soundtrack with a musical score composed by [[Mark Isham]], was released by the [[Lakeshore Records]] label on October 28, 2008.

''The Express'' premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on October 10, 2008. Despite receiving generally positive reviews from critics, the film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $9.8 million against its $40 million budget. The [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] version of the film, featuring deleted scenes and the director's commentary was released on January 20, 2009.

==Plot==
[[Ernie Davis]] ([[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]]) is a young African American growing up in Pennsylvania with his same-age uncle Will Davis Jr. ([[Nelsan Ellis]]), in the late 1940s during a time of racism and discrimination. Davis lives with his extended family, including his grandfather, Willie 'Pops' Davis ([[Charles S. Dutton]]), who guides and educates him. Davis' mother, Marie Davis ([[Aunjanue Ellis]]), eventually returns to their residence to inform the family that she has remarried and can now afford to raise Ernie at her own home in [[Elmira, New York|Elmira]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Upon relocating to Elmira, Davis enrolls in a Small Fry Football League and excels on the field as a running back.

Several years later, Syracuse University football head coach [[Ben Schwartzwalder]] ([[Dennis Quaid]]) searches for a running back to address the absence of [[Jim Brown]] ([[Darrin Dewitt Henson]]), the graduating player completing his All-American senior season. Schwartzwalder is impressed with Davis after viewing footage of him playing for Elmira Free Academy. Schwartzwalder convinces Brown to accompany him on a recruiting visit to see Davis and his family in hopes of luring him to sign with Syracuse. After their visit, Davis decides to enroll at Syracuse and spurns the recruiting efforts of other colleges.

At the start of the 1959 college football season, Davis immediately excels playing for the varsity team, to lead Syracuse to victories over several college football teams. After Syracuse defeats UCLA to conclude the regular season undefeated, the team decides by choice to play the 2nd ranked Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic. During the game on January 1, 1960, Davis boldly attempts to lead his team to victory but is hampered by an injured leg and biased officiating. Towards the end of the game, Davis scores a crucial touchdown to preserve a Syracuse lead. The matchup concludes with a victory for Syracuse, and its first national championship.

In 1961, Davis goes on to win the Heisman Trophy following his senior season in college. He later becomes a professional athlete in the National Football League and signs a contract with the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Later however, following a series of health concerns, Davis is taken to a hospital to undergo medical testing. During a routine practice session, team owner [[Art Modell]] ([[Saul Rubinek]]) informs Davis he will be unable to play the upcoming season due to his condition. Subsequently, Davis holds a press conference and announces he has been diagnosed with leukemia. The Cleveland Browns honor Ernie by allowing him to suit up in uniform and join the team while running out before a televised game.

The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that Davis died on May 18, 1963 at the age of 23; while in condolence, President Kennedy expresses sympathy for Davis' fine character as a citizen and an athlete.

==Production==

===Development===
The premise of ''The Express'' is based on the true story of [[Ernie Davis]], the charismatic athlete who became the first African American to win the [[Heisman Trophy]], college football's greatest achievement. Excelling in high school football, Davis was later recruited by dozens of predominantly white universities. A local sports columnist dubbed him the ''Elmira Express''.&lt;ref name=nfl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d80b75df1/article/ernie-davis-legacy-lives-on-long-after-his-death |title=Ernie Davis' legacy lives on long after his death |publisher=National Football League |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was told of his terminal illness, leukemia, during the summer of 1962.&lt;ref name=nfl /&gt; According to a saddened Art Modell, he said "They told him as gently as they could that it was an incurable case of leukemia. It was awful, but the way he took it, it seemed like much more of a blow to me and his teammates than it was to him."&lt;ref name=nfl /&gt;

Following the NFL draft which saw the [[Washington Redskins]] trade their pick of Davis to Cleveland for Hall of Fame running back Bobby Mitchell, Davis signed a $100,000 contract with the Browns.&lt;ref name=nfl /&gt; On May 16, 1963, Davis visited [[Cleveland Browns]] owner Art Modell. He promised to make a career comeback even though he looked terminally ill.&lt;ref name=hnn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/55556.html |title=Why Ernie Davis Matters |publisher=History News Network |accessdate=2010-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later on May 18, Davis died from the then-incurable disease. Fellow teammate and close friend [[John Brown (offensive tackle)|John Brown]], remembered him as a "genuine gentle man as well as a gentleman."&lt;ref name=hnn /&gt; President [[John F. Kennedy]] called Davis "an outstanding young man of great character" and "an inspiration to the young people of this country."&lt;ref name=hnn /&gt; The book titled ''Ernie Davis: The Elmira Express'', authored by writer Robert C. Gallagher, became the basis for the film.

===Set design and filming===
Filming began in April 2007 at [[Chicago]] area locations including [[Lane Technical High School]], [[Amundsen High School]], [[J. Sterling Morton High School District 201|J.

Existing buildings that were not on the Syracuse University campus had to be digitally removed from shots, such as the [[Carrier Dome]].

===Soundtrack===
The original motion picture soundtrack for ''The Express'' was released by the [[Lakeshore Records]] label on October 28, 2008. It features songs composed with considerable use of the [[violin]], [[trombone]] and [[violoncello|cello]]. The score for the film was orchestrated by [[Mark Isham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.barnesandnoble.com/Express/e/780163403022/?itm=27&amp;USRI=ernie+davis ''Express Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''].

Syracuse quarterback Dick Easterly, who played with Davis, said shortly after the movie's release, "I don't blame people in West Virginia for being disturbed. The scene is completely fictitious."&lt;ref name=cdm&gt;Thompson, Matthew (October 8, 2008).

[[Bobby Lackey]], quarterback for the [[Texas Longhorns football (1950–59)#1959|1959 Texas Longhorns]], stated in 2008 that the racial tensions and Longhorn behavior depicted in the New Year's Day [[1960 Cotton Bowl Classic]] were made-up "stories to try and sell more movie tickets," and justifies the action of his roommate, Larry Stephens, as just "trying to get the guy (Davis) into a fight so he could get him thrown out of the game because their athletes were so much better than ours."&lt;ref&gt;Golden, Cedric (October 10, 2008).

For example, the film places the 1959 Penn State game in the first three of Syracuse's season, with Syracuse winning 32-6, when it was actually the seventh game and Syracuse had their toughest challenge of the season, winning [[1959 Syracuse Orangemen football team#Schedule|a close 20-18 game]] to advance to a 7-0 record. The [[1960 Cotton Bowl Classic#Game summary|order of scoring]] in the 1960 Cotton Bowl Classic was adjusted in the film for dramatic tension.

[[Art Modell]] is shown giving [[Jim Brown]] his first [[Cleveland Browns]] [[Jersey (clothing)#In sports|jersey]] in a photo op, but Modell did not purchase the Browns until four years after Brown joined the team. The scene in which [[Washington Redskins]] owner [[George Preston Marshall]] and Modell arrange a major trade was actually made by Browns coach and general manager [[Paul Brown]] behind Modell's back, adding to the tension between the two.

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregation]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 61% based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "This inspirational sports biopic set in the civil rights era is interesting even for non-football fans, and features a great performance by Dennis Quaid as tough-but-fair football coach."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1185801-the_express/ The Express (2008)]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. IGN Entertainment.

[[Roger Ebert]] wrote: "''The Express'' is involving and inspiring in the way a good movie about sports almost always is. The formula is basic and durable, and when you hitch it to a good story, you can hardly fail. Gary Fleder does more than that in telling the story of Ernie Davis ("The Elmira Express"), the running back for Syracuse who became the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy, in 1961."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;Ebert, Roger (October 8, 2008).

Fleder (expertly assisted by cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau and editors Padraic McKinley and William Steinkamp) ices the cake with some first-rate game footage."&lt;ref name="lane" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' called it "special" while remarking, "There is a lot of football in the movie. It's well presented, but there is the usual oddity that it almost entirely shows mostly success."&lt;ref name="ebert" /&gt; 

In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', Peter Hartlaub wrote that the film "deserves plenty of credit for abandoning the ''"Remember the Titans"/"Glory Road"'' school of screenwriting as laid out above and exploring the racial issues in Davis' story in more realistic terms." He thought Quaid gave a "memorable performance" by portraying Schwartzwalder as "sort of an accidental civil rights hero."&lt;ref&gt;Hartlaub, Peter (October 10, 2008).

On its production merits, he commented how the film displayed "Terrific editing by William Steinkamp and Padraic McKinley" which "intermarries the onfield action, flashbacks to Davis' Southern boyhood, a smattering of period footage and a great deal of stylized visualization to a degree that distracts from the very basic sports-movie arc of the story".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John (September 28, 2008).

He thought Brown portrayed Davis with "quiet subtlety (to the point where he almost disappears in some scenes)" and felt Quaid was "stuck with the thankless role of accidental civil-rights pioneer". He summed up his disappointment stating, "like all formulaic biopics, ''The Express'' sacrifices the details for the Big Picture—hagiography without the humanity (wait, is that his girlfriend? Wife?

The '''Toy Symphony''' (full title: ''[[Cassation (music)|Cassation]] in G major for toys, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[Horn (instrument)|horns]], [[string section|strings]] and [[Figured bass|continuo]]'') is a musical work with parts for toy instruments.

It was long reputed to be the work of [[Joseph Haydn]],&lt;ref&gt;p. 201, Ewen (1965) David.

Recent research on a newly found manuscript suggests the Austrian [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monk Edmund Angerer (1740–1794) to be the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikland-tirol.at/printable/kindersinfonie.php|title=15.

There is reason to believe that the true composer will likely never be known, in whole or in part, given its confused origins and the paucity of related manuscript sources.

'''Agnes Joseph Madeline Dillon''' (8 January 1903 – 4 April 1993), known as '''Una Dillon''', was a British bookseller. She founded [[Dillons Booksellers]].

==Life==
Agnes Joseph Madeline Dillon was born in [[Cricklewood]] and she was known as "Una". Dillon was born in Hendon to Teresa and Joseph Thomas Dillon. She was one of six children who their catholic parents paid to get well educated. The elder brother died during World War one, a sister became a nun and another brother emigrated. [[Carmen Dillon|Carmen]], Agnes (Una) and Teresa were left to fulfil their parent's ambition for them.&lt;ref name=una&gt;Jean H. Cook, ‘Dillon, Agnes Joseph Madeline [Una] (1903–1993)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51834, accessed 11 April 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Dillon was working for the charity now known as [[Mind (charity)|Mind]] dealing with books. She enjoyed this and decided to set herself up in business with a bookstore.

The '''Rev. William Keble Martin''' (9 July 1877, [[Radley]] – 26 November 1969, [[Woodbury, Devon|Woodbury]]) was a [[Church of England]] [[Anglican_ministry#Priests|priest]], [[botany|botanist]] and [[botanical illustrator]], known for his ''Concise British Flora in Colour''.

The ''Concise British Flora'' was published in May 1965 when the author was 88. The book was the result of 60 years' meticulous fieldwork and exquisite painting skills, and became an immediate best-seller. He completed over 1,400 paintings in colour and many black-and-white drawings before the book was finally published.
[[File:Keble Martin Chapel, Dartmoor - geograph.org.uk - 381510.jpg|thumb|Keble Martin "Chapel", by the [[Walla Brook|Western Walla Brook]], [[Dartmoor]]]]

==Life and work==
[[File:St Blaise, Haccombe - geograph.org.uk - 825022.jpg|thumb|St Blaise, [[Haccombe]], Reverend Martin held the position of Archpriest here from 1921 to 1934. ]]
Keble Martin was the grandson of Dr [[George Moberly]], headmaster of [[Winchester College|Winchester]]  and later [[Bishop of Salisbury]]. He was brother to architect Arthur Campbell Martin CVO FRIBA (1875-1963) and was also connected to [[John Keble]] of the [[Oxford Movement]]. His father was appointed as the Rector of [[Dartington]], near Totnes, when William was 14 years old.

He  was educated at [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]], and went up to [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1896 to read Greek Philosophy and Botany. He trained for the church at [[Cuddesdon Theological College]]. After ordination, he worked in industrial parishes in the north and Midlands (one of these was [[Wath-upon-Dearne]], the subject of his first book) and, in the First World War, as a [[Military chaplain|chaplain]] in France. In 1921 he was offered the benefice of [[Haccombe]] and [[Coffinswell]] in [[Devon]] and in 1934 became the incumbent of [[St Michael and All Angels, Great Torrington|St Michael and All Angels]], [[Great Torrington]]. (He was the [[Archpriest]] of Haccombe and Rector of Coffinswell.) Keble Martin saw a vision of a new church in a dream, and his brother architect transformed the dream into reality - now a listed building, St Luke the Evangelist Church at [[Milber]], [[Newton Abbot]] is remarkable for its exceptional interior space and extraordinary plan with three angled naves, linked by arcades with granite columns, which converge on the central altar. The exterior walls are white render with a pyramidal copper-clad roof on a squat square tower. Keble Martin retired in 1949 at the age of 72, but continued to work in the church.

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Linnean Society]] in 1928, and later edited with G. T. Fraser the first volume of a comprehensive ''Flora of Devon'' (1939). In June 1966 he received an honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from [[Exeter University]]. Four of his designs for an issue of wild flower stamps were accepted by the [[Royal Mail]] and issued in April 1967. He published his autobiography, ''Over the Hills'', shortly before he died in 1969 at the age of 92 at [[Woodbury, Devon|Woodbury]].

==Family life==
William Keble Martin married twice: in 1909 Violet Chaworth-Musters (d. 1963) and then in 1965 Florence Lewis. His children were three daughters and two sons.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (1968) Over the Hills&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wooster Collective''' is a [[website]] founded in 2003 that showcases [[street art]] from around the world. It features ephemeral art placed on streets in cities around the world. The site also offers [[podcast]]ing with music and interviews featuring street artists. The name Wooster comes from [[Wooster Street (Manhattan)|Wooster Street]], located in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of [[New York City]].

The website's archive starts in January 2003, and the category list is over 100 items long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.woostercollective.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027052728/http://woostercollective.com/ |archivedate=2015-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Categories include entries as "Cardboard" art and "[[Guerrilla gardening]]", as well as locations with a [[street art]] presence such as [[Tokyo]], [[Dublin]] and [[Milwaukee]].  It also contains interviews of street artists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.woostercollective.com/2003/11/profile_blek_le_rat.html Interview with Blek le Rat&lt;/ref&gt; with reviews of artists' new work or of recent gallery exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woostercollective.com/2003/02/review_tuesday_nights_opening.html|title=Wooster Collective: REVIEW: Tuesday Night’s Opening Night|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== 11 Spring Street Project ==
Wooster Collective was involved in gaining recognition for [[street art]] in its own neighborhood. In 2006,the website collaborated with Caroline Cummings and Bill Elias, members of a development group, with the idea of turning the building located at 11 [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]] in [[New York City]] into a temporary [[street art]] gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Last Hurrah for Street Art, as Canvas Goes Condo | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The address was about to be converted into [[condominium]] apartments.  

The idea for the project was set forth when Elias Cummings contacted  the Wooster Collective site and suggested that they curate a show at the location to celebrate the building's place in the history of [[street art]].

The show ran for three days, from December 15 to December 17, 2006.  Street artists who had been featured in the Wooster Collective, such as [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Swoon (artist)|Swoon]], [[Dan Witz]], [[Above (artist)|Above]], Bo130,  Doze Green,  [[D*Face]], [[The London Police]], Skewville, [[Lady Pink]], Microbo, Jace, Kostas Seremetis, [[John Fekner]] and [[Don Leicht]], Ruslan Karablin, [[Graffiti Research Lab]], Will Barras, WK Interact, and many more participated in the event.  The art was left on the walls and built over (a nod to a tradition in [[construction]] of leaving newspapers in the walls of a house as a sort of "time capsule"), thereby leaving a legacy of [[street art]] behind for future excavators.

== YouTube channel ==
In August 11, 2009, the Wooster Collective launched its own channel on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/TheWoosterCollective|title=TheWoosterCollective|website=YouTube|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With videos and reports similar to those found on its website.

== Books ==
In 2012, Wooster Collective released the second in a series of 'Wooster on Paper' books called ''Graphite'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woostercollective.com/post/announcing-wooster-on-paper-2-graphite|title=Wooster Collective: Announcing Wooster on Paper #2: Graphite|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured pencil drawings by a number of their favourite artists including Paul Alexander Thornton, Connor Harrington and Word to Mother.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">The '''Wynn Newhouse Award''' is an annual prize given to disabled artists in recognition of their artistic merit.&lt;ref&gt;http://wnewhouseawards.com/Pages/About.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Samuel I. Newhouse Foundation, a charitable organization founded by newspaper entrepreneur [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.]], inaugurated the award in 2006 at the suggestion of the late Wynn Newhouse, to draw attention to the contributions of [[artist]]s with [[disability|disabilities]] to [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Art in America'', May 2007; http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_5_95/ai_n25439083/&lt;/ref&gt; Wynn Newhouse, himself disabled, was a prominent [[New York City]] art collector and grandson of the newspaper magnate.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Jul 4, 1989. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipients==
Recipients share an annual award totaling $60,000, allocated by the judges. The selection committee changes each year. It is made up of four prominent members of the arts community including artists, curators and critics.

To be eligible for the Wynn Newhouse Awards, nominees must be artists of professional standing, and have a disability as recognized by the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. The awards are made in late December of each year.

In addition to the grants, many winning artists are offered an exhibition at the Palitz Gallery, a gallery space on East 61st Street in New York City. This exhibition is donated by Syracuse University in their Lubin Center in New York. An annual reception for winners attracts many persons in the arts community.  

The Wynn Newhouse Awards will be offered through 2016. They are currently coordinated by consultant Bill Butler of Alford, MA and by artist Gordon Sasaki of New York. Information can be obtained and artists can be
suggested via the website wnewhouseawards.com
