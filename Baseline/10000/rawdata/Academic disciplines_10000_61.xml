An '''adventure park''' is a place which can contain a wide variety of elements, such as rope climbing exercises, obstacle courses and zip-lines. They are usually intended for recreation.

"Recreational-oriented" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: ''Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in the Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.''

== History ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 2.jpg|thumb|Treetop Adventure Park in Bali|]]
[[File:Adventure Park, Ashramam, Kollam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adventure Park, Kollam|Asramam Adventure Park]], [[Kollam]], [[Kerala]]]]
It is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military.

In the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States.

In recent years, specifically recreation-oriented Adventure Parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe &amp; Asian countries.

== Related Outdoor Activities ==
As already mentioned, a [[ropes course]] is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section.

A [[canopy tour]] is a specific type of [[ziplining]] where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.

== Facts &amp; Figures Adventure Parks ==
The category Adventure Parks can be broken down into a huge variety of specific types. They differ according to the following main criteria:
* Type of parks: 	 	        stationary / mobile
* Structural System:                  trees / poles / buildings / metallic structure
* Target visitors:                       all / kids from 4 years old / disabled
* Height of the lifeline: 	        "mid-height", "out of reach"
* Belay system: 		        self / permanent / continuous
* Locations:			        touristic / urban

[[File:Indoor-Kletterpark.jpg|thumb|Indoor Adventure Park in Shopping Mall]]Forest Adventure Parks are very popular. They take advantage of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent rubbing from the ropes.

Depending on how they are used and where they are located, parks on poles are an excellent alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees at the edge of a forest has the potential to work well.
 
Indoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New parks on wood poles have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.

Adventure Parks can be found in a multitude of places/locations. Examples of trends:
*	Close to large tourist destinations
*	In Ski Resorts as an attraction during summer months (a boom in Switzerland and several European countries)
*	In Amusement Parks, Holiday Clubs/Villages, Hotel Club and Resorts, etc.
*	Urban parks or close to conglomerations (e.g. the park in the center of Lyon, France)
*	Close to a significant pool of potential customers, such as a large Shopping Mall, Zoo, Campsite, etc.
*	Small (kids) parks for shopping malls (as indoor), city events, etc.

Large Adventure Parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements).

The majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or “green trail” and progresses to a very challenging level or “black trail”. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20-30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled.

Most kids love Adventure Parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play.

The acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and [[zip-line]]s increases the diversity and interest of parks – People love zip-lines.

There are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak.

[[File:Capture d’écran 2012-06-12 à 14.09.01.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park with lifeline "out of reach"]]
There are 2 schools concerning the height of the lifeline:
*The more traditional approach, frequently seen on continental Europe, is the lifeline at mid-height. This height at {{convert|1.40|-|1.60|m|ft|abbr=on}} is well adapted for carabiners.
*The lifeline out of reach, at {{convert|2|-|2.30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, possible with continuous belay system, is more frequent in UK and shows several advantages:  (1) ''Higher throughput by peaks'' - up to 20% more (No manipulation on platforms and therefore gains of time - No need to install additional trolley for the ziplines).  (2) ''More impressive and challenging elements''  (No "mid-heigh" cables to help the visitors - Impressive and when necessary, the visitor can anytime help himself with the lanyard - Impressive and without risk of numerous rescues).  (3) ''Higher convenience for the park visitors''  (Platforms are free of any "mid-heigh" cable, ease for the visitors - Fun &amp; thrills on elements while relaxing on platforms).  (4) ''Much lower risk of injury''  (No contact with safety device - As the lanyard is already tighter, the distance of possible fall will be shorter)

Concerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.

== Safety systems ==
[[image:Seilpark Gantrisch - 03.jpg|thumb|Self belay with carabiners]]
[[File:Rheinfall Seilpark 4.jpg|thumb|Continuous Belay for Kids Trails from 4 years old]]
The safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails – relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used.

There are distinctions between the following main four belay systems:
* Self belay with carabiners
* Permanent belay with carabiners
* Continuous belay on rail
* Continuous belay on cable (with a hook or a trolley)

The traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.

The permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a "communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.

The continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application – it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe).

With a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail – in term of safety, no specific further action is required. 
For the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be “out of reach” which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)

== Adventure Parks Operation ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 3.jpg|thumb|Round Platform]]
Recreational-oriented Adventure Parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations).

The key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level &amp; risk management, needs of training &amp; supervision and flexible operation.

In order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential. The new technologies in safety systems bring Adventure Parks into a new era by dramatically reducing the risk of accident (permanent and continuous systems) and reducing the needs of training and supervision (continuous systems).

The EN 15567-1 and -2 standards regulate the construction and operation of high ropes Courses / Adventure Parks. The various associations as ERCA and IAPA in Europe or ACCT and PRCA in the USA are acting towards professionalization of the industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3887">The '''Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array''' ('''AMANDA''') is a [[neutrino]] [[telescope]] located beneath the [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]]. In 2005, after nine years of operation, AMANDA officially became part of its successor project, the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory]].

AMANDA consists of optical modules, each containing one [[photomultiplier]] tube, sunk in [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice cap at a depth of about 1500 to 1900 metres. In its latest development stage, known as AMANDA-II, AMANDA is made up of an array of 677 optical modules mounted on 19 separate strings that are spread out in a rough circle with a diameter of 200 metres. Each string has several dozen modules, and was put in place by "drilling" a hole in the ice using a hot-water hose, sinking the cable with attached optical modules in, and then letting the ice freeze around it.

[[File:DUMAND.svg|thumb|right|Diagram from the related precursor [[Project DUMAND]] illustrating the strings of sensors and detail of one of the sensors]]

AMANDA detects very high energy [[neutrinos]] (50+ [[Electronvolt|GeV]]) which pass through the Earth from the northern hemisphere and then react just as they are leaving upwards through the Antarctic ice. The neutrino interacts with [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[oxygen]] or [[hydrogen]] [[atoms]] contained in the surrounding water ice through the weak nuclear force, producing a [[muon]] and a [[hadron]]ic shower. The optical modules detect the [[Cherenkov radiation]] from these latter particles, and by analysis of the timing of photon hits can approximately determine the direction of the original neutrino with a spatial resolution of approximately 2 [[degree (angle)|degrees]].

AMANDA's goal was an attempt at [[neutrino astronomy]], identifying and characterizing extra-solar sources of neutrinos. Compared to underground detectors like [[Super-Kamiokande]] in Japan, AMANDA was capable of looking at higher energy neutrinos because it is not limited in volume to a manmade tank; however, it had much less accuracy because of the less controlled conditions and wider spacing of [[photomultiplier]]s. Super-Kamiokande can look at much greater detail at neutrinos from the Sun and those generated in the Earth's atmosphere; however, at higher energies, the spectrum should include neutrinos dominated by those from sources outside the solar system. Such a new view into the cosmos could give important clues in the search for [[Dark Matter]] and other astrophysical phenomena.

After two years of integrated operation as part of IceCube,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icecube.wisc.edu/science/publications/pdd/pdd12.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317003154/http://www.icecube.wisc.edu/science/publications/pdd/pdd12.php |archivedate=2010-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the AMANDA counting house (in the [[Martin A. Pomerantz]] Observatory) was decommissioned in July and August 2009.

A '''bill of attainder''' (also known as an '''act of attainder''' or '''writ of attainder''' or '''bill of pains and penalties''') is an act of a [[legislature]] declaring a person or group of persons guilty of some crime and punishing them, often without a trial. As with [[attainder]] resulting from the normal judicial process, the effect of such a bill is to nullify the targeted person's [[civil rights]], most notably the right to own property (and thus pass it on to heirs), the right to a title of nobility, and, in at least the original usage, the right to life itself. Bills of attainder passed in Parliament by Henry Vlll on 29 January 1542 resulted in the executions of a number of notable historical figures.

The use of these bills by Parliament eventually fell into disfavour due to the obvious potential for abuse and the violation of several legal principles, most importantly the right to [[due process]], the precept that a law should address a particular form of behaviour rather than a specific individual or group, and the [[separation of powers]].

==Jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Unlike the United States Constitution, there is no specific provision prohibiting the Commonwealth Government from passing bills of attainder. However, the [[High Court of Australia]] has ruled that bills of attainder are unconstitutional, because it is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine for any body other than a Chapter III court to wield judicial power.&lt;ref name="Wheat case"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|17|1915|link=New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915)|litigants=New South Wales v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1915/17.pdf (1915) 20 CLR 54] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Communist case"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|5|1951|litigants=[[Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1951/5.pdf (1951) 83 CLR 1] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boilermakers"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|1956|litigants=[[R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia]] |parallelcite=(1956) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 254 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the core aspects of judicial power is the ability to make binding and authoritative decisions on questions of law, that is, issues relating to life, liberty or property.&lt;ref name="Huddart"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1909|litigants=[[Huddart, Parker &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1909/36.pdf (1909)&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;CLR&amp;nbsp;330] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polyukhovich"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|32|1991|litigants=[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]] (War Crimes Act case) |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 501 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The wielding of judicial power by the legislative or executive branch includes the direct wielding of power and the indirect wielding of judicial power.&lt;ref name="Lim"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1992|litigants=[[Chu Kheng Lim v Minister of Immigration]] |parallelcite=(1992) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state constitutions in Australia contain few limitations on government power. Bills of attainder are considered permissible because there is no entrenched separation of powers at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;''Building Construction Employees and Builders' Labourers Federation of New South Wales v Minister of Industrial Relations'' (1986) 7 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 372, [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicRp|46|1994|litigants=City of Collingwood v Victoria [No2] |parallelcite=[1994] 1 [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 652 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[section 77 of the Constitution of Australia]] permits state courts to be invested with Commonwealth jurisdiction, and any state law that renders a state court unable to function as Chapter III court (Commonwealth jurisdiction) is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1996|litigants=[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]] |parallelcite=(1996) 189 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 51 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The States cannot structure their legal systems to prevent them from being subject to the Australian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|1|2010|litigants=[[Kirk v Industrial Court of NSW]] |parallelcite=(2010) 239 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 531 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important distinction is that laws seeking to direct judicial power (e.g. must make orders)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|49|2009|litigants=International Finance Trust Company Ltd v New South Wales Crime Commission (Criminal Assets Recovery case) |parallelcite=(2009) 240 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 319 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are unconstitutional, but laws that concern mandatory sentencing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NTSC|120|1997|litigants=Wynbyne v Marshall |parallelcite=(1997) 99 {{abbr|A Crim R|Australian Criminal Reports}} 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Moffatt'' [1998] 2 [[Victorian Reports|VR]] 229, [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Court of Appeal]] (Vic, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; rules of evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|9|1998|litigants=Nicholas v The Queen |parallelcite=(1998) 193 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 173 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; non-punitive imprisonment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|46|1998|litigants=Fardon v Attorney-General (QLD) |parallelcite=(2004) 223 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 575 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or tests,&lt;ref&gt;

===Canada===
In two cases of attempts to pass bills (in 1984 for [[Clifford Olson]] and in 1995 for [[Karla Homolka]]) to inflict a judicial penalty on a specific person, the speakers of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House]] and [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], respectively, have ruled that Canadian parliamentary practice does not permit bills of attainder or bills of pains and penalties.&lt;ref&gt;Canada: 32nd Parliament, 2nd Session, 14 May 1984 {{cite web|title=Debates of the House of Commons: "An Act respecting the execution of Clifford Robert Olson|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC3202_03/1321?r=0&amp;s=1|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=23 November 2015|page=3683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canada: 35th Parliament, 1st Session, 28 November 1995 {{cite web|title=Debates of the Senate: "Bill Concerning Karla Homolka|url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_SOC3501_02/366?r=0&amp;s=1|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=23 November 2014|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Usage under English law====
The word "[[attainder]]", meaning "taintedness", is part of English [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;The word "attainder" does not, in fact, derive from a Latin expression meaning "tainted", but from a French expression meaning "to attain", in the sense of condemn. http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/12725?redirectedFrom=attainder#eid&lt;/ref&gt; Under English law, a criminal condemned for a serious crime, whether [[treason]] or [[felony]] (but not [[misdemeanor|misdemeanour]], which referred to less serious crimes), could be declared "attainted", meaning that his civil rights were nullified: he could no longer own property or pass property to his family by will or testament. His property could consequently revert to the Crown or to the [[mesne lord]]. Any [[peerage]] titles would also revert to the Crown. The convicted person would normally be punished by [[execution (legal)|judicial execution]]—when a person committed a capital crime and was put to death for it, the property left behind [[escheat]]ed to the Crown or lord rather than being inherited by family. Attainder functioned more or less as the revocation of the feudal chain of privilege and all rights and properties thus granted.

Due to [[mandatory sentencing]], the due process of the courts provided limited flexibility to deal with the various circumstances of offenders. The property of criminals caught alive and put to death because of a guilty plea or jury conviction on a not guilty plea could be forfeited, as could the property of those who escaped justice and were outlawed; but the property of offenders who died before trial, except those killed during the commission of crimes (who fell foul of the law relating to ''[[felo de se]]''), could not be forfeited, nor could the property of offenders who refused to plead and who were tortured to death through ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.

On the other hand, when a legal conviction did take place, confiscation and "corruption of blood" sometimes appeared unduly harsh for the surviving family. In some cases (at least regarding the peerage) the Crown would eventually re-grant the convicted peer's lands and titles to his heir. It was also possible, as political fortunes turned, for a bill of attainder to be reversed. This sometimes occurred long after the convicted person was executed.

Unlike the mandatory sentences of the courts, acts of Parliament provided considerable latitude in suiting the punishment to the particular conditions of the offender's family. Parliament could also impose non-capital punishments without involving courts; such bills are called '''bills of pains and penalties'''.

Bills of attainder were sometimes criticised as a convenient way for the [[British monarchy|King]] to convict subjects of crimes and confiscate their property without the bother of a trial – and without the need for a conviction or indeed any evidence at all.

The first use of attainder was in 1321 against both [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester]] and his son [[Hugh Despenser the Younger|Hugh Despenser the Younger, Earl of Gloucester]]. They were both attainted for supporting [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] during his struggle with the [[Isabella of France|queen]] and barons.

In England, those executed subject to attainders include [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence]] (1478); [[Thomas Cromwell]] (1540); [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury]] (1540); [[Catherine Howard]] (1542); Baron [[Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley|Thomas Seymour]] (1549); [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Duke Thomas Howard of Norfolk]] (1572); [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Earl Thomas Wentworth of Strafford]] (1641); Archbishop [[William Laud]] of [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Canterbury]] (1645); and the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke James Scott of Monmouth]]. In the case of Catherine Howard, in 1541 King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the first monarch to delegate [[Royal Assent]], to avoid having to assent personally to the execution of his wife.

After defeating [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and replacing him on the throne of England, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] had Parliament pass a bill of attainder against his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/richard-iii-the-truth-may-yet-be-discovered-8142320.html|title=Richard III: The truth may yet be discovered|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noteworthy that this bill made no mention of the [[Princes in the Tower]], although it does declare him guilty of "shedding of Infants blood."&lt;ref name="Kendall, Richard IIIA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Paul Murray|ref=Kendall|title=[[Richard III (biography)|Richard the Third]]|authorlink=Paul Murray Kendall|publisher=[[W.

Although deceased by the time of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] [[John Bradshaw (judge)|John Bradshaw]], [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[Henry Ireton]] and [[Thomas Pride]] were served with a bill of attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|NS]]). After the committee stages, the bill passed both the Houses of Lords and Commons and was engrossed on 4 December 1660. This was followed with a resolution that passed both Houses on the same day:&lt;ref name="british-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26189 |title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8: 15 May 1660 &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="british-history2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26317 |title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8: 4 December 1660 &amp;#124; British History Online |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="british-history3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26867 |title=Index: A-J &amp;#124; British History Online &amp;#124; ''Journal of the House of Commons:'' volume 8 |publisher=british-history.ac.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685, when the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth| Duke of Monmouth]] landed in West England and started [[Monmouth Rebellion|a rebellion]] in an effort to overthrow his uncle, the recently enthroned [[James II of England|James II]], Parliament passed an bill of attainder against him. After the [[Battle of Sedgemoor]], this made it possible for King James to have the captured Monmouth put summarily to death. Though  legal, this was regarded by many as an arbitrary and ruthless act.

In 1753, the Jacobite leader [[Archibald Cameron of Locheil]] was summarily put to death on the basis of a seven-year-old bill of attainder, rather than being put on trial for his recent subversive activities in Scotland. This aroused some protests in British public opinion at the time, including from people with no Jacobite sympathies.

The last use of attainder was in 1798 against [[Lord Edward FitzGerald]] for leading the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].

====The Great Act of Attainder====
In 1688, King [[James II of England]] (VII of Scotland), driven off by the ascent of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]], came to Ireland with the sole purpose of reclaiming his throne. After his arrival, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] assembled a list of names in 1689 of those reported to have been disloyal to him, eventually tallying between two and three thousand, in a bill of attainder. Those on the list were to report to Dublin for sentencing. One man, [[William Stewart, 1st Viscount Mountjoy|Lord Mountjoy]], was in the [[Bastille]] at the time and was told by the Irish Parliament that he must break out of his cell and make it back to Ireland for his punishment, or face the grisly process of being [[Drawing and quartering|drawn and quartered]].&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, ''History of England from the Accession of James the Second'' (London, 1855), 216–220&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament became known in the 1800s as the "[[Patriot Parliament]]".

Later defenders of the Patriot Parliament pointed out that the ensuing "[[Treaty of Limerick#The Williamite Settlement forfeitures|Williamite Settlement forfeitures]]" of the 1690s named an even larger number of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] suspects, most of whom had been attainted by 1699.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/E800002-045/index.html TO Davis, "The Irish Parliament of James II"], 1843&lt;/ref&gt;

====Private bills====
{{main article|Private bill}}
{{About|legislation that affects a specific person|legislation proposed by a single MP|Private member's bill|section=yes}}

In the Westminster system (and especially in the United Kingdom), a similar concept is covered by the term "private bill" (a bill which upon passage becomes a private Act). Note however that "private bill" is a general term referring to a proposal for legislation applying to a specific person; it is only a bill of attainder if it punishes them; private bills have been used in some Commonwealth countries to effect divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Millar and Sheldon Goldenberg (1998). "Explaining Child Custody Determinations in Canada", ''Canadian Journal of Law and Society'', Vol. 13, No. 1, p. 209-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Other traditional uses of private bills include chartering corporations, changing the charters of existing corporations, granting monopolies, approving of public infrastructure and seizure of property for those, as well as enclosure of commons and similar redistributions of property. Those types of private bills operate to take away private property and rights from certain individuals, but are usually not called "bill of pains and penalties".

The last United Kingdom bill called a "Pains and Penalties Bill" was [[Pains and Penalties Bill 1820]] and was passed by the House of Lords in 1820, but not considered by the House of Commons; it sought to divorce [[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]] from King George IV and adjust her titles and property accordingly, on grounds of her alleged adultery, as did many private bills dealing with divorces of private persons.

It has been reported that no bills of attainder have been passed since 1820 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Zechariah Chafee, Jr., ''Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787 at 97'' (Univ. of Kans. Press, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Attainder as such was also a legal consequence of convictions in courts of law, but this ceased to be a part of punishment in 1870.&lt;ref name="british-civil-wars"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/impeachment-attainder.htm |title=BCW Project :: British Civil Wars, Commonwealth &amp;amp; Protectorate 1638-1660 &amp;#124; Impeachment &amp; Attainder |author=David Plant|publisher=british-civil-wars.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World War II====
Previously secret British [[War Cabinet#Second World War|War Cabinet]] papers released on 1 January 2006 have shown that, as early as December 1942, the War Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] had then advocated a policy of [[summary execution]] with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles. He was dissuaded by cabinet minister [[Richard Law, 1st Baron Coleraine|Richard Law]] who pointed out that the United States and Soviet Union still favoured trials.&lt;ref&gt;John Crossland [http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/article210371.ece "Churchill: execute Hitler without trial"], ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 1 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaustresearchproject.org/trials/nurnbergtrial.html Holocaust Education and Archive Research Team], "The 1st Nuremberg Trial"&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
==== Colonial era ====
Bills of attainder were used through the 18th century in England, and were applied to British colonies as well. Some colonists were inspired to the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] because of anger at the injustice of attainder. Although at least one American state used a bill of attainder to confiscate the property of a British [[United Empire Loyalist|loyalist]] (called [[Tory|Tories]]) during the war (New York, in the 1779 case of [[Parker Wickham]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parker Wickham (1727–1785)|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jwickham/parker.htm|website=Ancestry.com|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; American dissatisfaction with British attainder laws resulted in their being prohibited in the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1789.

==== Constitutional bans ====
[[File:Constitution Pg2of4 AC-attainder.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Excerpt from Article One, Section 9 of the United States Constitution, prohibiting the passing of bills of attainder]]

The [[United States Constitution]] forbids legislative bills of attainder: in federal law under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Article I, Section 9]], and in state law under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10]]. The fact that they were banned even under state law reflects the importance that the framers attached to this issue.

Within the U.S. Constitution, the clauses forbidding attainder laws serve two purposes. First, they reinforced the [[separation of powers]], by forbidding the legislature to perform [[judiciary|judicial]] or executive functions—since the outcome of any such acts of legislature would of necessity take the form of a bill of attainder. Second, they embody the concept of [[due process]], which was partially reinforced by the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution. The text of the Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 3 is "No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed".

The constitution of every state also expressly forbids bills of attainder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} For example, [[Wisconsin Constitution|Wisconsin's constitution]] Article I, Section 12 reads:

{{quote|No bill of attainder, [[ex post facto law]], nor any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall ever be passed, and no conviction shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate.}}

Contrast this with the Texas version: Article 1 (Titled Bill of Rights) Section 16, entitled ''Bills of Attainder; Ex Post Facto or Retroactive Laws: Impairing Obligation of Contracts'': "No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, retroactive law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall be made". It is unclear whether a contract that calls for heirs to be deprived of their estate is allowed under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jacob |last=Reynolds |title=The Rule of Law and the Origins of the Bill of Attainder Clause |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stlr18&amp;div=13&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals |journal=St. Thomas Law Review |year=2005 |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=177 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cases before the U.S. Supreme Court ====
The U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated laws under the Attainder Clause on only five occasions.&lt;ref&gt;"Nonattainder as a Liberty Interest", ''Wisconsin Law Review'', 2010, p. 1229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]'s first decisions on the meaning of the bill of attainder clause came after the [[American Civil War]]. In ''[[Ex parte Garland]]'', 71 U.S. 333 (1866), the court struck down a federal law requiring attorneys practising in federal court to swear that they had not supported the rebellion. In ''[[Cummings v. Missouri]]'', 71 U.S. 277 (1867), the [[Missouri]] constitution required anyone seeking a professional's license from the state to swear they had not supported the rebellion. The Supreme Court overturned the law and the constitutional provision, arguing that the people already admitted to practice were subject to penalty without judicial trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hart Ely|Ely, John H.]] ''On Constitutional Ground''. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of judicial trial was the critical affront to the Constitution, the Court said.&lt;ref&gt;Nabers, Deak. ''Victory of Law: The Fourteenth Amendment, the Civil War, and American Literature, 1852–1867''. Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two decades later, however, the Court upheld similar laws. In ''[[Hawker v. New York]]'', 170 U.S. 189 (1898), a state law barred convicted felons from practising medicine. In ''[[Dent v. West Virginia]]'', 129 U.S. 114 (1889), a state law imposed a new requirement that practising physicians had to have graduated from a licensed medical school or they would be forced to surrender their license. The Court upheld both laws because, it said, the laws were narrowly tailored to focus on an individual's qualifications to practice medicine.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, Theodore. ''The Second Amendment Controversy—Explained.'' 2d ed. Indianapolis: iUniverse, 2002, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; That was not true in ''Garland'' or ''Cummings''.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond481483"&gt;"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause". ''Virginia Law Review''. 70:475 (April 1984), p. 481-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court changed its "bill of attainder test" in 1946. In ''[[United States v. Lovett]]'', 328 U.S. 303 (1946), the Court confronted a federal law that named three people as subversive and excluded them from federal employment. Previously, the Court had held that lack of judicial trial and the narrow way in which the law rationally achieved its goals were the only tests of a bill of attainder. But the ''Lovett'' Court said that a bill of attainder 1) specifically identified the people to be punished; 2) imposed punishment; and 3) did so without benefit of judicial trial.&lt;ref&gt;Cushman, Robert Fairchild and Koniak, Susan P. ''Cases in Civil Liberties''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1994, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Heritage Guide to the Constitution''. Washington, D.C.: Heritage Foundation, 2005, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; As all three prongs of the bill of attainder test were met in ''Lovett'', the court held that a congressional statute that bars particular individuals from government employment qualifies as punishment prohibited by the bill of attainder clause.

The [[Taft–Hartley Act]] (enacted in 1947) sought to ban [[strike action|political strikes]] by [[Communism|Communist]]-dominated [[trade union|labour unions]] by requiring all elected labour leaders to take an oath that they were not and had never been members of the [[Communist Party USA]], and that they did not advocate violent overthrow of the U.S. government. It also made it a crime for members of the Communist Party to serve on executive boards of labour unions. In ''[[American Communications Association v. Douds]]'', 339 U.S. 382 (1950), the Supreme Court had said that the requirement for the oath was not a bill of attainder because: 1) anyone could avoid punishment by disavowing the Communist Party, and 2) it focused on a future act (overthrow of the government) and not a past one.&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;Welsh, Jane. "The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process". ''Brooklyn Law Review''. 50:77 (Fall 1983), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting current fears, the Court commented in ''Douds'' on approving the specific focus on Communists by noting what a threat communism was.&lt;ref&gt;Wiecek, William M. ''History of the Supreme Court of the United States: The Birth of the Modern Constitution: The United States Supreme Court, 1941–1953''. New York: Macmillan, 2006, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court had added an "escape clause" test to determining whether a law was a bill of attainder.&lt;ref name="Welsh" /&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Brown]]'', 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Court invalidated the section of the statute that criminalized a former communist serving on a union's executive board. Clearly, the Act had focused on past behaviour and had specified a specific class of people to be punished. But if this specific focus in ''Brown'' was constitutionally invalid, why was it ''not'' constitutionally invalid in ''Douds''?&lt;ref&gt;"Beyond Process: A Substantive Rationale for the Bill of Attainder Clause", ''Virginia Law Review'', April 1984, p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; (Many legal scholars assumed that the ''Brown'' case effectively, if not officially, overruled ''Douds''.)&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, Victor. ''Unrepentant Leftist: A Lawyer's Memoir''. Urbana, Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1996, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Court did not apply the punishment prong of its test, leaving legal scholars confused as to whether the Court still intended it to apply.&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, "The Bill of Attainder Clause: An Unqualified Guarantee of Process", ''Brooklyn Law Review'', Fall 1983, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court emphasised the narrowness and rationality of bills of attainder in ''[[Nixon v. Administrator of General Services]]'', 433 U.S. 425 (1977). During the [[Watergate scandal]], in 1974 Congress passed the [[Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act]], which required the [[General Services Administration]] to confiscate former President [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidential papers to prevent their destruction, screen out those which contained national security and other issues which might prevent their publication, and release the remainder of the papers to the public as fast as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Ripley, Anthony. "U.S. Judge Rules Nixon Documents Belong to Nation", ''New York Times'', 1 February 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court upheld the law in ''Nixon'', arguing that specificity alone did not invalidate the act because the President constituted a "class of one".&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;Stark, Jack. ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution''. Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 2002, p. 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, specificity was constitutional if it was rationally related to the class identified.&lt;ref name="Stark" /&gt; The Court modified its punishment test, concluding that only those laws which historically offended the bill of attainder clause were invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also found it significant that Nixon was compensated for the loss of his papers, which alleviated the punishment.&lt;ref name="Stark75"&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court modified the punishment prong by holding that punishment could survive scrutiny if it was rationally related to other, nonpunitive goals.&lt;ref name="Stark75" /&gt; Finally, the Court concluded that the legislation must not be intended to punish; legislation enacted for otherwise legitimate purposes could be saved so long as punishment was a side-effect rather than the main purpose of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, ''Prohibited Government Acts: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', 2002, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cases considered by lower courts ====
A number of cases which raised the bill of attainder issue did not reach or have not reached the Supreme Court, but were considered by lower courts.

In 1990, in the wake of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]], Congress enacted the [[Oil Pollution Act of 1990|Oil Pollution Act]] to consolidate various oil spill and oil pollution statutes into a single unified law, and to provide for a statutory regime for handling oil spill cleanup. This law was challenged as a bill of attainder by the shipping division of [[ExxonMobil]].&lt;ref&gt;''SeaRiver Maritime Fin. Holdings, Inc. v. Pena'', 952 F.Supp. 9, D.D.C. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carringan, Alison C. "The Bill of Attainder Clause: A New Weapon to Challenge the Oil Pollution Act of 1990", ''Boston College Environmental Affairs Law Review'' 28:119 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] struck down the [[Elizabeth Morgan Act]] as a bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;''Doris R. Foretich, et al. v. United States'', 351 F.3d 1198 (D.C.App. 2003); Leonning, Carol D. "Appeals Court Rules Against Morgan Law", ''Washington Post'' 17 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution in late 2009 barring the community organising group [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN) from receiving federal funding, the group sued the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;Fahim, Kareem. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/nyregion/13acorn.html "Acorn Sues Over Funding Vote in House"]. ''New York Times'', 12 November 2009.

In March 2010, a federal district court declared the funding ban an unconstitutional bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Michael B. "Funding Gone, Scandal-Plagued ACORN to Disband". ''Christian Science Monitor'', 23 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 August 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] reversed and remanded on the grounds that only 10 percent of ACORN's funding was federal and that did not constitute "punishment".&lt;ref&gt;"Federal Court Rules Against Acorn".

There is argument over whether the [[Palm Sunday Compromise]] in the [[Terri Schiavo case]] was a bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;Calabresi, Steven G.

Some analysts considered a proposed Congressional bill to confiscate 90 percent of the bonus money paid to executives at federally rescued investment bank [[American International Group]] a bill of attainder, although disagreement exists on the issue. The bill was not passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Ashby. "Would an AIG-Bonus Tax Pass Constitutional Muster? (A Tribe Calls 'Yes!')"

In 2009, the City of Portland's attempt to prosecute more severely those on a "secret list" of 350 individuals deemed by police to have committed "liveability crimes" in certain neighbourhoods was challenged as unconstitutional bill of attainder.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/secret-list-on-trial/Content?oid=1055123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.streetroots.org/2009/03/11/two-more-cases-add-list-trial&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the House voted to defund [[Planned Parenthood]]. Democratic Representative [[Jerrold Nadler|Jerry Nadler]] called that vote a bill of attainder, saying it was unconstitutional as such because the legislation was targeting a specific group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = House votes to defund Planned Parenthood - David Nather and Kate Nocera|url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/49830.html|accessdate = 23 July 2015|first = David Nather and Kate|last = Nocera|date = 18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the House reinstated the [[Holman Rule]], a procedural rule that enables lawmakers to reduce the pay of an individual federal worker down to $1.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thenation.com/article/the-holman-rule-once-allowed-congress-to-purge-leftists-from-government-agencies-now-its-back/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Mountain College''' was an experimental college founded in 1933 by [[John Andrew Rice]], Theodore Dreier, and several others. Based in [[Black Mountain, North Carolina]], the school was ideologically organized around [[John Dewey|John Dewey's]] principles of education, which emphasized holistic learning and the study of art as central to a [[Liberal arts|liberal arts education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/artists-black-mountain-college/5719/|title=The Artists of Black Mountain College {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=2006-10-16|work=American Masters|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the school's faculty and students were or would go on to become highly influential in the arts, including [[Josef Albers|Josef]] and [[Anni Albers]], [[Charles Olson]], [[Ruth Asawa]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Dorothea Rockburne]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Merce Cunningham]], [[John Cage]], [[Buckminster Fuller]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Willem de Kooning|Willem]] and [[Elaine de Kooning]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]]. Although it was quite notable during its lifetime, the school closed in 1957 after 24 years due to funding issues. The history and legacy of Black Mountain College are preserved and extended by the [[Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center]] located in downtown Asheville, NC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/in-the-spirit-of-black-mountain-college-an-avant-garde-incubator.html|title=In the Spirit of Black Mountain College, an Avant-Garde Incubator|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2015-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Black Mountain was founded in 1933 by [[John Andrew Rice]], Theodore Dreier, Frederick Georgia, and Ralph Lounsbury, who were controversially dismissed as faculty from [[Rollins College#Firing of John Andrew Rice and required loyalty pledge|Rollins College]] for refusing to sign a loyalty pledge.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Seymour, "The Ghosts of Rollins (and Other Skeletons in the Closet)", ''Rollins Magazine'', fall 2011, http://www.rollins.edu/magazine/fall-2011/ghosts-of-rollins-2.html; John Andrew Rice, ''I Came Out of the Eighteenth Century'' (1942), reissued, with new introduction by Rice's grandson, William Craig Rice, University of South Carolina Press, 2014, {{ISBN|1611174368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Mountain was experimental in nature and committed to an [[interdisciplinary]] approach, prioritizing art making as a necessary component of education and attracting a faculty and lecturers that included many of America's leading visual artists, composers, poets, and designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/artists-black-mountain-college/5719/|title=The Artists of Black Mountain College {{!}} American Masters {{!}} PBS|date=2006-10-16|work=American Masters|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1930s and 1940s the school flourished, becoming well known as an incubator for artistic talent. Notable events at the school were common; it was here that the first large-scale geodesic dome was made by faculty member [[Buckminster Fuller]] and students, where [[Merce Cunningham]] formed his dance company, and where [[John Cage]] staged his first musical [[happening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/in-the-spirit-of-black-mountain-college-an-avant-garde-incubator.html|title=In the Spirit of Black Mountain College, an Avant-Garde Incubator|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2015-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the College was an important incubator for the American [[avant-garde]]. Black Mountain proved to be an important precursor to and prototype for many of the alternative colleges of today, ranging from [[College of the Atlantic]], [[Naropa University]], the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], and [[Marlboro College]] to [[Evergreen State College]], [[Hampshire College]], [[Shimer College]], [[Prescott College]], [[Goddard College]], [[World College West]] (1973-1992), and [[New College of Florida]], among others, including [[Warren Wilson College]] located just minutes down the road from where Black Mountain College was located. [[Bennington College]], based on the samr philosophy, was founded one year before Black Mountain College.

== Structure ==
[[File:Black Mtn College.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Main Building of the former Black Mountain College, on the current grounds of Camp Rockmont]]
The school operated using non-hierarchical methodologies that placed students and educators on the same plane. Revolving around 20th-century ideals about the value and importance of balancing education, art, and cooperative labor, students were required to participate in farm work, construction projects, and kitchen duty as part of their holistic education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/school-black-mountain-college.htm|title=The Art Story: School - Black Mountain College|website=www.theartstory.org|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/in-the-spirit-of-black-mountain-college-an-avant-garde-incubator.html|title=In the Spirit of Black Mountain College, an Avant-Garde Incubator|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2015-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/arts/design/the-short-life-and-long-legacy-of-black-mountain-college.html|title=The Short Life and Long Legacy of Black Mountain College|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=2015-12-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students were involved at all levels of institutional decision-making. They were also left in charge of deciding when they were ready to graduate, which notoriously few ever did. There were no course requirements, grades, or degrees. Graduates were presented with handcrafted diplomas as purely ceremonial symbols of their achievement. The liberal arts program offered at Black Mountain was broad, and supplemented by art making as a means of cultivating creative thinking within all fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/arts/design/the-short-life-and-long-legacy-of-black-mountain-college.html|title=The Short Life and Long Legacy of Black Mountain College|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=2015-12-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Albers led the school, the only two requirements were a course on materials and form taught by Albers and a course on Plato.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/in-the-spirit-of-black-mountain-college-an-avant-garde-incubator.html|title=In the Spirit of Black Mountain College, an Avant-Garde Incubator|last=Kino|first=Carol|date=2015-03-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blue Ridge Assembly Robert E Lee Hall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|From 1933 to 1941, Black Mountain College was located at the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly.]]

== Sociopolitical context ==

In 1933, the Nazis shut down the [[Bauhaus]] in Germany, a similarly progressive arts-based educational institution. Many of the school's faculty left Europe for the US, and a number of them settled at Black Mountain, most notably,     [[Josef Albers]], who was selected to run the art program and his wife [[Anni Albers]], who taught weaving and textile design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww.albersfoundation.org/about-us/press/2015/|title=Josef and Anni Albers Foundation|website=ww.albersfoundation.org|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adolph Hitler's rise to power and the subsequent persecution taking place in Europe led many artists and intellectuals to flee and resettle in the US, populating Black Mountain College with an influx of both students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blackmountaincollege.org/history/|title=Black Mountain College: A Brief Introduction - Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center|work=Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the college was operating in the South during the period of legal racial segregation at other colleges and universities in the region. While not immune from racial tensions, the student [[Alma Stone Williams]], an African-American woman, is considered by some to be the first black student to enroll in an all-white institution of higher education in the South during the [[Jim Crow]] era.&lt;ref name="A Pioneer in Southern Racial Integration2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anonymous|title=Black Mountain College: A Pioneer in Southern Racial Integration|journal=[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]|volume=54|page=46|jstor=25073557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locations ==
For the first eight years the college rented the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly buildings south of Black Mountain, North Carolina. In 1941, it moved across the valley to its own campus at Lake Eden, where it remained until its closing in 1956. The property was later purchased and converted to an ecumenical Christian boys' residential summer camp ([[Camp Rockmont]]). This has been used for years as the site of the Black Mountain Festival and the [[Lake Eden Arts Festival]]. A number of the original structures are still in use as lodgings or administrative facilities.

== Closing ==
Black Mountain College closed in 1957, a few years after Albers left to direct the first design department at [[Yale University|Yale]]. The college suspended classes by court order due to debts, being unable to sustain their finances given the greatly decreased number of students. In 1962, the school's books were finally closed, with all debts covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artesmagazine.com/2010/09/north-carolina%E2%80%99s-black-mountain-college-a-new-deal-in-american-art-education/|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530070825/http://www.artesmagazine.com/2010/09/north-carolina%E2%80%99s-black-mountain-college-a-new-deal-in-american-art-education/|archivedate=2012-05-30|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2013-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:BMCRP VM Bx89 Nakagawa Portraits 11ee--Sum1949 (6506073429).jpg|thumb|[[Buckminster Fuller]] at Black Mountain College in 1949]]

== Legacy ==
The [[Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center|Black Mountain College Museum &amp; Arts Center]] continues the legacy of Black Mountain College through talks, exhibitions, performances, and an annual fall conference that examines the college's legacy. Black Mountain College was the subject of the museum exhibition ''Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957,'' which opened at the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]] on October 10, 2015. The show was curated by [[Helen Molesworth]] with Ruth Erickson.&lt;ref name="Art in America"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/ldquoleap-before-you-look-black-mountain-college-1933-1957rdquo/|title=Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957|last1=Swenson|first1=Kirsten|date=December 16, 2015|work=Art in America}} (exhibit review)&lt;/ref&gt; The show later exhibited at the [[Hammer Museum]] February 21, 2016 to May 15, 2016, which was organized by Anne Ellegood, senior curator, with MacKenzie Stevens, curatorial assistant, and January Parkos Arnall, curatorial assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2016/leap-before-you-look-black-mountain-college-1933-1957/|title=Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957|website=Hammer Museum|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Mountain College was featured in [[Nicholas Sparks]]' novel, ''[[The Longest Ride]]'' (2013) and the [[The Longest Ride (film)|2015 movie adaptation]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nicholassparks.com/stories/the-longest-ride/|title=The Longest Ride|last=Creative|first=The Uprising|website=Nicholas Sparks|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But I quickly found there was nothing like it there—in fact, the only other school I have found that offered the same kind of open experience was Black Mountain.’”&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12543">'''COLD-PCR''' ('''co'''-amplification at '''l'''ower '''d'''enaturation temperature-'''PCR''') is a modified [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) protocol that enriches variant [[alleles]] from a mixture of wildtype and [[mutation]]-containing [[DNA]].  The ability to preferentially amplify and identify minority alleles and low-level [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] DNA mutations in the presence of excess wildtype alleles is useful for the detection of mutations. Detection of mutations is important in the case of early [[cancer]] detection from [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[biopsies]] and body fluids such as [[blood plasma]] or [[Serum (blood)|serum]], assessment of residual [[disease]] after [[surgery]] or [[chemotherapy]], disease staging and molecular profiling for prognosis or tailoring therapy to individual patients, and monitoring of therapy outcome and cancer remission or relapse.  Common PCR will amplify both the major (wildtype) and minor (mutant) alleles with the same efficiency, occluding the ability to easily detect the presence of low-level mutations.  The capacity to detect a mutation in a mixture of variant/wildtype DNA is valuable because this mixture of variant DNAs can occur when provided with a heterogeneous sample – as is often the case with cancer biopsies.  Currently, traditional PCR is used in tandem with a number of different downstream assays for [[genotyping]] or the detection of [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] mutations.  These can include the use of amplified DNA for [[RFLP]] analysis, [[MALDI-TOF]] (matrix-assisted laser-desorption–time-of-flight) genotyping, or direct sequencing for detection of mutations by [[Sanger sequencing]] or [[pyrosequencing]].  Replacing traditional PCR with COLD-PCR for these downstream assays will increase the reliability in detecting mutations from mixed samples, including [[tumors]] and body fluids.

==COLD-PCR Method Overview==
[[File:COLD-PCR.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|alt=An overview of COLD-PCR compared to regular PCR.|Conventional PCR compared to COLD-PCR.]]
The underlying principle of COLD-PCR is that single [[nucleotide]] mismatches will slightly alter the melting temperature (Tm) of the double-stranded DNA.  Depending on the sequence context and position of the mismatch, Tm changes of 0.2-1.5&amp;nbsp;°C (0.36-2.7&amp;nbsp;°F). are common for sequences up to 200bp or higher. Knowing this the authors of the protocol took advantage of two observations:
*Each double-stranded DNA has a ‘critical temperature’ (Tc) lower than its Tm.  The PCR amplification efficiency drops measurably below the Tc.
*The Tc is dependent on DNA sequence.  Two template DNA fragments differing by only one or two nucleotide mismatches will have different amplification efficiencies if the denaturation step of PCR is set to the Tc.

Keeping these principles in mind the authors developed the following general protocol:
#Denaturation stage.  DNA is denatured at a high temperature{{spaced ndash}}usually {{Convert|94|C|F}}.
#Intermediate annealing stage.  Set an intermediate annealing temperature that allows hybridization of mutant and wildtype allele DNA to one another.  Because the mutant allele DNA forms the minority of DNA in the mixture they will be more likely to form mismatch heteroduplex DNA with the wildtype DNA.
#Melting stage.  These heteroduplexes will more readily melt at lower temperatures.  Hence they are selectively denatured at the Tc.
#Primer annealing stage.  The homo-duplex DNA will preferentially remain double stranded and not be available for primer annealing.
#Extension stage.  The DNA polymerase will extend complementary to the template DNA.  Since the heteroduplex DNA is used as template, a larger proportion of minor variant DNA will be amplified and be available for subsequent rounds of PCR.

There are two forms of COLD-PCR that have been developed to date.  Full COLD-PCR and Fast COLD-PCR.
[[File:Fast versus Full COLD-PCR.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|alt=An overview of Full COLD-PCR in comparison to Fast COLD-PCR.|Full COLD-PCR versus Fast COLD-PCR.]]

===Full COLD-PCR===
Full COLD-PCR is identical to the protocol outlined above.  These five stages are used for each round of amplification.

===Fast COLD-PCR===
Fast COLD-PCR differs from Full COLD-PCR in that the denaturation and intermediate annealing stages are skipped.  This is because, in some cases, the preferential amplification of the mutant DNA is so great that ensuring the formation of the mutant/wildtype heteroduplex DNA is not needed.  Thus the denaturation can occur at the Tc, proceed to primer annealing, and then polymerase-mediated extension.  Each round of amplification will include these three stages in that order.  By utilizing the lower denaturation temperature, the reaction will discriminate towards the products with the lower Tm – i.e. the variant alleles.  Fast COLD-PCR produces much faster results due to the shortened protocol.  However, it is important to note that Full COLD-PCR is essential for amplification of all possible mutations in the starting mixture of DNA.

Two-round COLD-PCR is a modified version of Fast COLD-PCR.  During the second round of Fast COLD-PCR nested primers are used.  This improves the sensitivity of mutation detection compared to one-round Fast COLD-PCR.&lt;ref name=nested&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Milbury CA, Li C, Makrigiorgos GM |title=Two-round COLD-PCR-based Sanger sequencing identifies a novel spectrum of low-level mutations in lung adenocarcinoma |journal=Human Mutation |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1583–90 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19760750 |pmc=2784016 |doi=10.1002/humu.21112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of COLD-PCR to Date==
COLD-PCR has been used to improve the reliability of a number of different assays that traditionally use conventional PCR.
[[File:COLD-PCR applications.jpg|thumb|alt=Some of the downstream applications for COLD-PCR.|Downstream applications using conventional PCR that can be replaced by COLD-PCR.]]

===RFLP and COLD-PCR===
A restriction fragment length polymorphism results in the cleavage (or absence thereof) of DNA for a specific mutation by a selected restriction enzyme that will not cleave the wildtype DNA.  In a study using a mixture of wildtype and mutation containing DNA amplified by regular PCR or COLD-PCR, COLD-PCR preceding RFLP analysis was shown to improve the mutation detection by 10-20 fold.&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Wang L, Mamon H, [[Matthew Kulke|Kulke MH]], Berbeco R, Makrigiorgos GM |title=Replacing PCR with COLD-PCR enriches variant DNA sequences and redefines the sensitivity of genetic testing |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=579–84 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18408729 |doi=10.1038/nm1708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanger Sequencing and COLD-PCR===
Sanger sequencing recently was used to evaluate the enrichment of mutant DNA from a mixture of 1:20 mutant:wildtype DNA.  The variant DNA containing a mutation was obtained from a [[breast cancer]] cell line known to contain [[p53]] mutations.&lt;ref name=nested /&gt;  Comparison of Sanger sequencing chromatograms indicated that the mutant allele was enriched 13 fold when COLD-PCR was used compared to traditional PCR alone.&lt;ref name=nested /&gt;  This was determined by the size of the peaks on the chromatogram at the variant allele location.

As well, COLD-PCR was used to detect p53 mutations from lung-[[adenocarcinoma]] samples.  The study was able to detect 8 low level (under 20% abundance) mutations that would likely have been missed using conventional methods that don’t enrich for variant sequence DNA .

===Pyrosequencing and COLD-PCR===
Similar to its use in direct Sanger sequencing, with pyrosequencing COLD-PCR was shown to be capable of detecting mutations that had a prevalence 0.5-1% from the samples used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zuo Z, Chen SS, Chandra PK |title=Application of COLD-PCR for improved detection of KRAS mutations in clinical samples |journal=Modern Pathology |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1023–31 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19430420 |doi=10.1038/modpathol.2009.59|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; COLD-PCR was used to detect p53 and KRAS mutations by pyrosequencing, and was shown to outperform conventional PCR in both cases.

===MALDI-TOF and COLD-PCR===
The same research group that developed COLD-PCR and used it to compare the sensitivity of regular PCR for genotyping with direct Sanger sequencing, RFLP, and pyrosequencing, also ran a similar study using MALDI-TOF as a downstream application for detecting mutations.  Their results indicated that COLD-PCR could enrich mutation sequences from a mixture of DNA by 10-100 fold and that mutations with an initial prevalence of 0.1-0.5% would be detectable.&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Makrigiorgos GM |title=COLD-PCR: a new platform for highly improved mutation detection in cancer and genetic testing |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=427–32 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19290875 |doi=10.1042/BST0370427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the 5-10% low-level detection rate expected with traditional PCR.

===QPCR and COLD-PCR===
COLD-PCR run on a [[quantitative PCR]] machine, using [[TaqMan]] probes specific for a mutation, was shown to increase the measured difference between mutant and wildtype samples.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;

==Advantages of COLD-PCR==
*Single-step method capable of enriching both known and unknown minority alleles irrespective of mutation type and position.
*Does not require any extra reagents or specialized machinery.  Therefore, the cost is not increased.
*Better than conventional PCR for the detection of mutations in a mixed sample.
*Does not significantly increase experiment run time compared to conventional PCR.

==Disadvantages of COLD-PCR==
*Optimal Tc must be measured and determined for each amplicon.  Adding an extra step to conventional PCR-based procedures.
*Requirement for precise denaturation temperature control during PCR to within ± 0.3&amp;nbsp;°C (0.54&amp;nbsp;°F).
*A suitable critical temperature may not be available that differentiates between mutant and wildtype DNA sequences.
*Restricted to analyzing sequences smaller than approximately 200bp.
*Vulnerable to polymerase-introduced errors.
*Variable overall mutation enrichment which depends on DNA position and nucleotide substitution.
*No guarantee that all low-level mutations will be preferentially enriched.

==History==
COLD-PCR was originally described by Li ''et al.'' in a Nature Medicine paper published in 2008 from Dr. Mike Makrigiorgos’s lab group at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute of Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref name=original /&gt;  As summarized above, the technology has been used in a number of proof-of-principle experiments and medical research diagnostic experiments.

Recently, the COLD-PCR technology has been licensed by Transgenomic, Inc.  The licensing terms include the exclusive rights to commercialize the technology combined with Sanger sequencing.  The plans are to develop commercial applications that will allow for rapid high-sensitivity detection of low-level somatic and mitochondrial DNA mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laboratorytalk editorial team|date=Oct 2009|title=Transgenomics licenses COLD-PCR technology|url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/trb/trb121.html|access-date=2010-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718232900/http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/trb/trb121.html#|archive-date=2011-07-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Other technologies are available for the detection of minority DNA mutations, and these methods can be segregated into their ability to enrich for and detect either known or unknown mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milbury CA, Li J, Makrigiorgos GM |title=PCR-Based Methods for the Enrichment of Minority Alleles and Mutations |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=632–40 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19201784 |pmc=2811432 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.113035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physics behind cellular dewetting ==
[[File:Liquid and cellular dewetting.png|alt=Diagram illustrating the analogy between liquid and cellular dewetting.|thumb|529x529px|'''Figure 2.''' Analogy between [[Dewetting|liquid dewetting]] and cellular dewetting.]]
The phenomenon of cellular dewetting can be interpreted by physical modeling (Figure 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez-Rodriguez|first=D.|date=2012|title=Cellular dewetting: opening of macroapertures in endothelial cells|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=108|issue=21|pages=218105|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.218105|pmid=23003307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''driving force''' responsible for the spontaneous formation of TEM tunnels and their opening is the [[Cell membrane|'''membrane''']] '''tension''' that results from the spreading of cells due to actomyosin relaxation. Opposite to liquid dewetting, TEMs reach a maximum diameter, at which the driving force is balanced by a resisting force that develops along TEM edges (Figure 2).  This resisting force is referred to as '''line tension''' and is uncharacterized at the molecular level.

== Physical parameters ==
'''Driving forces''' pulling on a tunnel of radius ''R'', as depicted in Figure 2. Here, pulling is due to the tensioning of the [[cell membrane]] (σ) that is partly counteracted by a line tension around the tunnel (''T''). In these conditions, the net driving force (''F&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'') consists of two contributions:

&lt;math&gt;F_D = \sigma - \frac{T}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Dewetting proceeds if ''F&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''&gt;0.

'''Membrane tension''' (''σ'') depends on the tunnel radius ''R''. A  tunnel increase in size relaxes the [[Cell membrane|membrane]], inducing a decrease in membrane tension, as described by [[Elasticity of cell membranes|Helfrich’s law]].

'''Line tension''' (''T'') corresponds to the resisting force along the edge of the tunnel that opposes membrane tension and limits dewetting. This line tension can have physical and molecular components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10014">A '''computer-assisted proof''' is a [[mathematical proof]] that has been at least partially generated by [[computer]].

Most computer-aided proofs to date have been implementations of large [[Proof by exhaustion|proofs-by-exhaustion]] of a mathematical [[theorem]]. The idea is to use a computer program to perform lengthy computations, and to provide a proof that the result of these computations implies the given theorem.  In 1976, the [[four color theorem]] was the first major theorem to be verified using a [[computer program]].

Attempts have also been made in the area of [[artificial intelligence]] research to create smaller, explicit, new proofs of mathematical theorems from the bottom up using [[machine reasoning]] techniques such as [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] search. Such [[automated theorem prover]]s have proved a number of new results and found new proofs for known theorems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}  Additionally, interactive [[proof assistant]]s allow mathematicians to develop human-readable proofs which are nonetheless formally verified for correctness.  Since these proofs are generally [[Non-surveyable proof|human-surveyable]] (albeit with difficulty, as with the proof of the [[Robbins conjecture]]) they do not share the controversial implications of computer-aided proofs-by-exhaustion.

== Methods ==
One method for using computers in mathematical proofs is by means of so-called [[validated numerics]] or [[rigorous numerics]]. This means computing numerically yet with mathematical rigour. One uses set-valued arithmetic and inclusion principle in order to ensure that the set-valued output of a numerical program encloses the solution of the original mathematical problem. This is done by controlling, enclosing and propagating round-off and truncation errors using for example [[interval arithmetic]]. More precisely, one reduces the computation to a sequence of elementary operations, say &lt;math&gt;(+,-,*,/)&lt;/math&gt;. In a computer, the result of each elementary operation is rounded off by the computer precision. However, one can construct an interval provided by upper and lower bounds on the result of an elementary operation. Then one proceeds by replacing numbers with intervals and  performing  elementary operations between such intervals of representable numbers.

==Philosophical objections==
{{main|Non-surveyable proof}}
Computer-assisted proofs are the subject of some controversy in the mathematical world, with [[Thomas Tymoczko]] first to articulate objections. Those who adhere to Tymoczko's arguments believe that lengthy computer-assisted proofs are not, in some sense, 'real' [[mathematical proof]]s because they involve so many logical steps that they are not practically [[Verification and validation|verifiable]] by human beings, and that mathematicians are effectively being asked to replace logical deduction from assumed axioms with trust in an empirical computational process, which is potentially affected by errors in the computer program, as well as defects in the runtime environment and hardware.&lt;ref name="tymoczko"&gt;{{Citation|last = Tymoczko|first = Thomas|author-link = Thomas Tymoczko|title = The Four-Color Problem and its Mathematical Significance|year = 1979|journal = [[The Journal of Philosophy]]|volume = 76|issue = 2|pages = 57–83|doi=10.2307/2025976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other mathematicians believe that lengthy computer-assisted proofs should be regarded as ''calculations'', rather than ''proofs'': the proof algorithm itself should be proved valid, so that its use can then be regarded as a mere "verification".  Arguments that computer-assisted proofs are subject to errors in their source programs, compilers, and hardware can be resolved by providing a formal proof of correctness for the computer program (an approach which was successfully applied to the four-color theorem in 2005) as well as replicating the result using different programming languages, different compilers, and different computer hardware.

Another possible way of verifying computer-aided proofs is to generate their reasoning steps in a machine-readable form, and then use an [[automated theorem prover]] to demonstrate their correctness. This approach of using a computer program to prove another program correct does not appeal to computer proof skeptics, who see it as adding another layer of complexity without addressing the perceived need for human understanding.

Another argument against computer-aided proofs is that they lack [[mathematical elegance]]—that they provide no insights or new and useful concepts.  In fact, this is an argument that could be advanced against any lengthy proof by exhaustion.

An additional philosophical issue raised by computer-aided proofs is whether they make mathematics into a [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical science]], where the [[scientific method]] becomes more important than the application of pure reason in the area of abstract mathematical concepts. This directly relates to the argument within mathematics as to whether mathematics is based on ideas, or "merely" an [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]] in formal symbol manipulation. It also raises the question whether, if according to the [[mathematical Platonism|Platonist]] view, all possible mathematical objects in some sense "already exist", whether computer-aided mathematics is an [[observational study|observational]] science like astronomy, rather than an experimental one like physics or chemistry. This controversy within mathematics is occurring at the same time as questions are being asked in the physics community about whether twenty-first century [[theoretical physics]] is becoming too mathematical, and leaving behind its experimental roots.

The emerging field of [[experimental mathematics]] is confronting this debate head-on by focusing on numerical experiments as its main tool for mathematical exploration.

==Theorems for sale==
In 2010, academics at The [[University of Edinburgh]] offered people the chance to "buy their own theorem" created through a computer-assisted proof. This new theorem would be named after the purchaser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herald Gazette article on buying your own theorem|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/your-own-maths-theorem-for-15-1.1068654|work=Herald Gazette Scotland|date=November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121000707/http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/education/your-own-maths-theorem-for-15-1.1068654|archivedate=2010-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Informatics, Univ.of Edinburgh website|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/recentnews/theorem|work=School of Informatics, Univ.of Edinburgh|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''ConsensusPathDB''' is a molecular functional interaction [[database]], integrating information on [[protein interaction]]s, [[genetic interaction]]s signaling, [[metabolism]], [[gene regulation]], and drug-target interactions in humans. ConsensusPathDB currently (release 30) includes such interactions from 32 databases.&lt;ref name="pmid21071422"/&gt; ConsensusPathDB is freely available for academic use under http://ConsensusPathDB.org.

==Integrated Databases==
* [[Reactome]] ([[Metabolic pathway|metabolic]] and [[signaling pathway]]s)
* [[KEGG]] (metabolic pathways only have been integrated in ConsensusPathDB)
* HumanCyc (metabolic pathways)
* PID - Pathway Interaction Database (signaling pathways)
* BioCarta (signaling pathways)
* [[Netpath]] (signaling pathways)
* IntAct (protein interactions)
* [[Database of Interacting Proteins|DIP]] (protein interactions)
* MINT (protein interactions)
* [[Human Protein Reference Database|HPRD]] (protein interactions)
* [[BioGRID]] (protein interactions)
* SPIKE (protein interactions, signaling reactions)
* [[WikiPathways]] ([[Metabolic pathway|metabolic]] and [[signaling pathway]]s)
* and many more.

==Functionalities==
The ConsensusPathDB is accessible via a [[web interface]] providing a variety of functions.

===Search and visualization===
Using the web interface users can search for [[Physical entity|physical entities]] (e.g. [[protein]]s, [[metabolite]]s etc.) or pathways using common names or accession numbers (e.g. [[UniProt]] identifiers). Selected interactions can be visualized in an interactive environment as expandable networks. ConsensusPathDB currently allows users to export their models in [[BioPAX]] format or as image in several formats.

[[File:cpdb network.png|center|800px]]

===Shortest path===
Users can search for shortest paths of functional interactions between physical entities, based on all interactions in the database. The pathway search can be constrained by forbidding passing through certain physical entities.

===Data upload===
Users can upload their own [[interaction network]]s in [[BioPAX]], PSI-MI or [[SBML]] files in order to validate and/or extend those networks in the context of the interactions in ConsensusPathDB.

===Over-representation analysis===
Using the web-interface of the database, one can perform overrepresentation analysis, based on [[biochemical pathway]]s or on neighbourhood-based entity sets (NESTs) that constitute sub-networks of the overall interaction network containing all physical entities around a central one within a "radius" (number of interactions from the center). For each predefined set (pathway / NEST), a [[P-value]] is computed based on the [[hypergeometric distribution]]. It reflects the significance of the observed overlap between the user-specific input gene list and the members of the predefined set.

Over-representation analyses can be performed with user-specified genes or metabolites.

In [[theoretical computer science]], '''correctness''' of an [[algorithm]] is asserted when it is said that the algorithm is correct with respect to a [[program specification|specification]]. ''Functional'' correctness refers to the input-output behaviour of the algorithm (i.e., for each input it produces the expected output).&lt;ref name="functional"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dunlop | first1 = Douglas D. | last2 = Basili | first2 = Victor R. | authorlink2 = Victor Basili | title = A Comparative Analysis of Functional Correctness | doi = 10.1145/356876.356881 | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 229&amp;ndash;244 | date=June 1982 | url = https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=356881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is made between '''partial correctness''', which requires that if an answer is returned it will be correct, and '''total correctness''', which additionally requires that the algorithm terminates. Since there is no general solution to the [[halting problem]], a total correctness assertion may lie much deeper. A [[termination proof]] is a type of [[mathematical proof]] that plays a critical role in [[formal verification]] because total correctness of an algorithm depends on termination.&lt;ref name="totalcorrectness"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Manna | first1 = Zohar | last2 = Pnueli | first2 = Amir | title = Axiomatic approach to total correctness of programs | doi = 10.1007/BF00288637 | journal = [[Acta Informatica]]| volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 243&amp;ndash;263 | date=September 1974 | url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00288637.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, successively searching through [[integer]]s 1, 2, 3, … to see if we can find an example of some phenomenon&amp;mdash;say an odd [[perfect number]]&amp;mdash;it is quite easy to write a partially correct program (using long division by two to check ''n'' as perfect or not). But to say this program is totally correct would be to assert something [[Perfect number#Odd perfect numbers|currently not known]] in [[number theory]].

A proof would have to be a mathematical proof, assuming both the algorithm and specification are given formally. In particular it is not expected to be a correctness assertion for a given program implementing the algorithm on a given machine. That would involve such considerations as limitations on [[computer memory]].

A [[deep result]] in [[proof theory]], the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]], states that a proof of functional correctness in [[constructive logic]] corresponds to a certain program in the [[lambda calculus]]. Converting a proof in this way is called ''program extraction''.

[[Hoare logic]] is a specific [[formal system]] for reasoning rigorously about the correctness of computer programs.&lt;ref name="hoare"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hoare | first1 = C. A. R. | authorlink1 = C.A.R. Hoare | title = An axiomatic basis for computer programming | doi = 10.1145/363235.363259 | journal = [[Communications of the ACM]] | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 576&amp;ndash;580 | date = October 1969  &lt;!-- | url=http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/Hoare-CACM-69.pdf --&gt; | url = http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~worboys/processes/hoare%20axiomatic.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304013345/http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~worboys/processes/hoare%20axiomatic.pdf | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses axiomatic techniques to define programming language semantics and argue about the correctness of programs through assertions known as Hoare triples.

Software testing is any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of a program or system and determining that it meets its required results. Although crucial to software quality and widely deployed by programmers and testers, software testing still remains an art, due to limited understanding of the principles of software. The difficulty in software testing stems from the complexity of software: we can not completely test a program with moderate complexity. Testing is more than just debugging. The purpose of testing can be quality assurance, verification and validation, or reliability estimation. Testing can be used as a generic metric as well. Correctness testing and reliability testing are two major areas of testing. Software testing is a trade-off between budget, time and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Diogenites''' are a group of the [[HED meteorite]] clan, a type of [[achondrite|achondritic]] stony [[meteorite]]s.

==Origin and composition==
Diogenites are currently believed to originate from deep within the crust of the [[asteroid]] [[4 Vesta]], and as such are part of the [[HED meteorite]] clan. There are about 40 distinct members known.

Diogenites are composed of [[igneous]] rocks of [[plutonic]] origin, having solidified slowly enough deep within [[4 Vesta|Vesta's]] crust to form crystals which are larger than in the [[eucrite]]s. These crystals are primarily [[magnesium]]-rich [[orthopyroxene]], with small amounts of [[plagioclase]] and [[olivine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beck |first=A. W. |last2=McSween |first2=H.

==Name==
Diogenites are named for [[Diogenes of Apollonia]], an ancient Greek philosopher who was the first to suggest an outer space origin for meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawn|first=Walter &amp; Audrey|title=Why is it called Diogenite?|url=http://www.diogenite.com/|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecotivity''' is an abbreviation, or blend, of the term, '''ecological activity'''.  An ecotivity is any activity that promotes the conservation or sustainability of [[ecosystems]] and [[bio-diversity]].

In more general terms, an ecotivity can be thought of as any ecologically friendly activity.  Ecotivities therefore make a positive contribution to averting the environmental crisis of the planet or means of effecting positive change.

Ecotivities include all associated values, actions, and choices either as a green consumer, or as an individual living a sustainable lifestyle, for example, by [[recycling]] or energy efficiency.  Ecotivity can also be of political, [[direct action]], hand-on [[environmental conservation]], and creative confrontational acts, that are a means to protect the environment.

== Types of ecotivity ==

* [[recycling]]
* energy conservation
* use of [[renewable energy]]
* [[ecotourism]]
* [[simple living]] / sustainable living
* use of alternative transport
* [[organic farming]] and other [[sustainable agriculture]]
* [[guerrilla gardening]] or [[permaculture]]
* [[Responsible Volunteering|conservation]] volunteering
* [[green politics]]
* eco blogging
* [[ecoterrorism]]
* green or [[environmental consumerism]]
* environment education &lt;ref name="environment education"&gt;{{

In [[environmental toxicology]], '''effects range low''' (ERL) and '''effects range median''' (ERM) are measures of [[toxicity]] in marine [[sediment]]. They are used by public agencies in the United States in formulating guidelines in assessing toxicity hazards, in particular from [[trace metal]]s or organic contaminants.

The ERL and ERM measures are expressed as specific chemical concentrations of a toxic substance in sediment. The ERL indicates the [[concentration]] below which toxic effects are scarcely observed or predicted: the ERM indicates that above which effects are generally or always observed.&lt;ref name=LONG1995&gt;Long, Edward R., Donald D. McDonald, Sherri L. Smith, and Fred D. Calder. "Incidence of Adverse Biological Effects Within Range of Chemical Concentrations in Marine and Estuarine Sediments." Environmental Management 19.1 (1995): 81-97.&lt;/ref&gt; They are derived from biological toxicity [[assay]]s and synoptic sampling.

The numerical values are incorporated in sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) that were developed by Long and Morgan&lt;ref name=LONG1990&gt;Long E.R., L.G. Morgan. "The Potential for Biological Effects of Sediment-Sorbed Contaminants Tested in the National Status and Trends Program". NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS OMA 52. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Seattle, Washington. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) National Status &amp; Trends program as informal tools to evaluate whether a concentration of a contaminant in sediment might have toxicological effects.&lt;ref name=NOAA1999&gt;[http://www.ccma.nos.noaa.gov/publications/sqg.pdf "Sediment Quality Guidelines Developed for the National Status and Trends Program"]. NOAA. 1999. Accessed: June 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  These guidelines are used for screening sediments for trace metals and organic contaminants.&lt;ref name=EPA2011&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/bpspill/sediment-benchmarks.html "Sediment Benchmarks for Aquatic Life"]. EPA. 2011. Accessed: May 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not [[regulatory]] criteria in any way and are not intended to be used as such.&lt;ref name=NOAA1999 /&gt;

==Derivation ==
NOAA originally calculated ERL/ERMs using existing toxicity data compiled from completed toxicity [[assays]] with varying endpoints, including effects on commonly tested organisms, particularly at sensitive life stages. The process is considered a "[[weight of evidence]] approach", in which results are based on a large database of previously conducted studies. The studies used included synoptically collected sediment [[analytical chemistry|chemical analyses]] and toxicity effects data. Using data already collected ("[[data mining]]") has the advantage of being able to quickly and inexpensively make an assessment with a large dataset that would otherwise require much more time-consuming and costly specific toxicity assays. Compiled data sets include a variety of endpoints including mortality, reproduction, growth rate, and juvenile survival in sediment toxicity data sets for all organisms for which tests have been conducted. Studies are screened, and only those assays using standardized methods and resulting in significant effects are used for the determination of ERL/ERM guidelines.

In summary, the key links between the compiled studies are the testing of a specific [[analyte]] - toxicity assays used are for sediment, and a significant effect must be determined. The data is arranged by ordering the concentrations from lowest to highest. After ranking, both the 10th and 50th [[percentile]] concentrations are determined over the range of endpoint concentrations. The 10th percentile of the ranked data is identified as the ERL, and is considered indicative of concentrations below which adverse effects (relatively) rarely occur. The 50th percentile of the ranked data is identified as the ERM, and is indicative of concentrations above which adverse effects (relatively) frequently occur.&lt;ref name=LONG1995 /&gt;

==Government agency use ==
Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) are used by US federal agencies, state agencies, and environmental consulting firms to characterize toxic levels of chemicals in [[Ocean|marine]] and [[freshwater]] sediment. Following here is a summary of how the ERL/ERM guidelines are used by the [[NOAA|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).

===NOAA===
NOAA scientists use SQGs as a way to estimate if a concentration of contaminant in a sediment sample may have [[toxicological]] effects. The original intent of using SQGs was to rank order areas that may need further toxicological testing and potential chemicals of concern. Across the United States, NOAA has used these guidelines in regional surveys to determine the degree of contamination relative to other areas, and to identify if the concentration of a chemical exceeded guidelines, indicating a possible adverse effect.&lt;ref name=NOAA1999 /&gt;

NOAA also reports ERLs and ERMs, along with other guidelines, on tables known as Screening Quick Reference Tables (SQuiRT) cards. These tables offer values that may be used in the preliminary screening of sediment or other media for toxic hazards.&lt;ref name=Buchman2008&gt;Buchman, M. F. NOAA Quick Screening Reference Tables. NOAA OR&amp;R Report 08-1 Seattle WA, Office of Response and Restoration Division, National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (2008): 34 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

===USGS===
The USGS makes use of both ERL and ERM on a case-by-case basis. During a study involving the concentration of heavy metals, [[pesticides]], and [[semi-volatile organic compounds]] in stream sediments from the [[Schuylkill River]] within the [[Valley Forge National Historical Park]], the USGS used the ERL and ERM to determine locations that could potentially pose a threat to living organisms.&lt;ref name=Reif1997&gt;Reif, A., Sloto, R. Metals, Pesticides, and Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds in Sediment in Valley Forge National Historic Park, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. United States Geological Survey. Water Resources Investigations Report (1997): 97-4120.&lt;/ref&gt; The USGS has also integrated ERL and ERM values into an Alert Range Table, a table that provides ranges of contaminant concentrations that predict the likelihood of adverse effects occurring in benthic organisms for the [[Lake Pontchartrain]] Basin in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=USGS2002&gt;United States Geological Survey. 2002. Lake Pontchartrain Basin: Bottom Sediments and Related Environmental Resources. http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1634j/html/fm_range.htm. Accessed June 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the ERL and ERM have proven to be useful guideline values for predicting toxicity during studies conducted by the USGS.

===EPA===
The EPA uses ERL and ERM values as a type of sediment “benchmark”. They define a benchmark as a concentration that, when exceeded, has the potential to cause harm or significant risk to humans or animals in the environment.&lt;ref name=EPA2011 /&gt; The EPA has also used ERL and ERM values for sediment contamination studies. Assessment categories defining the condition of sampled sediments have been used by the EPA in the past. Categories have been characterized as “good” for zero ERL exceedances, “intermediate” if there are ERL exceedances but zero ERM exceedances, and “poor” for any ERM exceedance.&lt;ref name=EPA2012&gt;EPA. 2012. Sediment Contamination. http://www.epa.gov/emap/maia/html/docs/Est5.pdf Accessed: May 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The EPA credits the ERL and ERM as valuable benchmarks that assist in providing a uniform context for evaluating contaminant levels within [[estuaries]].&lt;ref name=EPA2012 /&gt;

==Reliability==
Long and colleagues,&lt;ref name=LONG1995 /&gt; using both "effects" and "no effects" data, determined measures of the accuracy of the guidelines by calculating the percent incidence of effects occurring within the ranges delineated by ERL/ERM. The percent incidence of effects was calculated by dividing the number of effects entries by the total number of entries and multiplying by 100.

For trace metals, the guidelines for [[copper]], [[lead]], and [[silver]] were the most accurate - below the ERL concentration, there was less than a 10% incidence of effects. A steady increase was seen between the ERL and ERM concentrations, and above the ERM, the incidence of effects was greater than 83%.

The organic contaminant guidelines also appeared to be very accurate for all classes of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs) and most of the individual PAHs. The incidence of effects was 25% or below when the concentrations were below the respective ERL value, with only ([[fluorene]] as an exception, while the incidence of effects was 75% or greater at concentrations above the respective ERM, excepting dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, p,p’-DDE, total dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ([[DDT]]), and total [[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs). Importantly, one hundred percent effects were seen in concentrations above the ERM for [[acenaphthylene]], 2-methyl napthalene, and low-molecular weight PAHs, and ninety percent or greater effects in this range were seen for [[chromium]], lead, silver, [[benz(a)anthracene]], and [[fluoranthene]].

Contaminants that were reported as having low accuracies included [[nickel]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], chromium, total PCBs, p,p’-DDE, and total DDT.

==Comparison to other SQGs (case studies)==
Multiple case studies have been conducted to compare different sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) and their ability to predict sediment toxicity. The original intent of NOAA in developing ERL/ERMs was to create a ranking system for sediment site toxicity in order to compare one site to another.&lt;ref name=NOAA1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=OCONNER2004&gt;O’Connor, Thomas P. "The Sediment Quality Guideline, ERL, Is Not a Chemical Concentration at the Threshold of Sediment Toxicity." Marine Pollution Bulletin 49.5-6 (2004): 383-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not the original intent, these guidelines have been compared to other SQGs to assess their ability to predict sediment toxicity in different organisms.

Long and co-workers also &lt;ref name=LONG1998&gt;Long, Edward R., L. Jay Field, and Donald D. MacDonald. "Predicting Toxicity In Marine Sediments With Numerical Sediment Quality Guidelines." Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 17.4 (1998): 714.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a [[meta-analysis]] using 1068 sediment toxicity assays to evaluate the predictive ability of the ERL/ERM, PEL (predicted effects level), and TEL (threshold effects level) sediment quality guidelines.  They found that the ERL most accurately predicted no-effects toxicity in [[benthic]] organisms. Furthermore, it was shown that as the number of SQGs exceeded increased, the resulting toxicity of the sediment increased as well, providing strong evidence that SCGs are useful in predicting sediment toxicities. It was noted, however, that when chemicals existed in mixtures, the toxicity of sediments increased, possibly at concentrations lower than the ERL and TEL.

Vidal and Bay &lt;ref name=VIDAL2005&gt;Vidal, Doris E., and Steven M. Bay. "Comparative Sediment Quality Guideline Performance For Predicting Sediment Toxicity In Southern California, USA." Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry 24.12 (2005): 3173.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the ERM performed better than the AET (apparent effects threshold) and EqP (equilibrium partitioning) at predicting a non-toxic sediment concentration, and in general was more conservative in its estimates than the SQGQ1 (sediment quality guideline quotient) and MECq (moderate effects concentration). The purpose of their study was to compare common SQGs used for site assessments in California. Both of these studies suggested using multiple SQGs, and gave guidance on selecting the best method based on site characteristics and the contaminants of immediate concern.

==Drawbacks to the ERL/ERM approach==
ERLs and ERMs must be used with caution. Overestimating the ability of these values to signal whether or not sediment may be toxic can lead to poor decisionmaking. Certain considerations must be made, and the weaknesses of these values understood, so that ERL and ERM screening levels are used properly.

The ERL and ERM are not threshold values to determine whether toxicity will occur - they are relationships between bulk chemical concentrations and toxicity effects that are expressed along a continuum. There is no concentration above which toxicity will occur and below which toxicity will not occur.&lt;ref name=OCONNER2004 /&gt; This fact may be overlooked by some users of ERL/ERM's, and do so could mislead the decisionmaking process.

The derivation of ERL and ERM can also cause further misconceptions - since only effects data is used in determining an ERL/ERM, there are also overlapping concentrations where there is no [[co-occurrence]] of toxicity.&lt;ref name=OCONNER2004 /&gt; Concentrations that did not elicit a significant effect are left out of the calculation when determining the 10th and 50th percentile values (ERL and ERM respectively). Therefore, within the ranges delineated by the ERL and ERM values, concentrations exist that were found to not have a significant biological effect.

Many substances that are found to be very toxic do not have SQGs associated with them. The ability of an SQG to predict toxicity when other substances, without SQGs, are present, is currently unknown.&lt;ref name=NOAA1999 /&gt;

Particle size also plays an important role in chemical concentrations, and this factor is ignored in calculating the ERL and ERM. When using these values for screening contaminated sediment, it is likely that the ERL will be exceeded more often when the sediment contains a larger proportion of fine-grained material. This is due to the inverse relationship between chemical concentration and particle size.&lt;ref name=OCONNER2004 /&gt; Due to sediment concentrations being measured on a [[dry weight]] basis, other [[geochemical]] factors of sediment that may also influence contaminant bioavailibility are not considered.&lt;ref name=NOAA1999 /&gt;

Another consideration is that effects to wildlife and humans from [[bioaccumulation]] are not considered in ERL and ERM measurements.&lt;ref name=NOAA1999 /&gt;

Furthermore, Vidal and Bay &lt;ref name=VIDAL2005 /&gt; noted that the use of ERMs when DDT is present resulted in a less accurate predictive level. The authors suggested that this provides evidence that other methods could prove more protective in cases where mixtures of [[Organic matter|organics]] are present.

[[Engineering controls]] are physical changes to the workplace that isolate workers from hazards, and are considered the most important set of methods for controlling the [[health and safety hazards of nanomaterials]] after systems and facilities have been designed.

The primary hazard of nanomaterials is [[Nanotoxicology|health effects]] from inhalation of [[aerosol]]s containing nanoparticles.  Many engineering controls developed for other industries can be used or adapted for protecting workers from exposure to nanomaterials, including [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and [[Air filter|filtering]] using laboratory fixtures such as [[fume hood]]s, containment using [[glovebox]]es, and other non-ventilation controls such as [[sticky mat]]s.  Research is ongoing as to what engineering controls are most effective for nanomaterials.

== Background ==

=== Engineering controls ===
[[File:Hierarchy_of_Controls_(By_NIOSH).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hierarchy_of_Controls_(By_NIOSH).jpg|alt=An inverted triangle consisting of five colored horizontal levels, each containing one tee five hazard control methods: elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment|thumb|250x250px|[[Engineering controls]] are the third most effective member of the [[hierarchy of hazard controls]].  They are preferred over [[administrative controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]], but are less preferred than [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] or [[Hazard substitution|substitution]] of the hazards.]]
Controlling exposures to occupational hazards is considered the fundamental method of protecting workers.  Traditionally, a [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hierarchy of controls]] has been used as a means of determining how to implement feasible and effective controls, which typically include [[Hazard elimination|elimination]], [[Hazard substitution|substitution]], [[engineering controls]], [[administrative controls]], and [[personal protective equipment]].  Methods earlier in the list are considered generally more effective in reducing the risk associated with a hazard, with process changes and engineering controls recommended as the primary means for reducing exposures, and personal protective equipment being the approach of last resort. Following the hierarchy is intended to lead to the implementation of inherently safer systems, ones where the risk of illness or injury has been substantially reduced.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering controls are physical changes to the workplace that isolate workers from hazards by containing them in an enclosure, or removing contaminated air from the workplace through [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and [[Air filter|filtering]].  Well-designed engineering controls are typically passive, in the sense of being independent of worker interactions, which reduces the potential for worker behavior to impact exposure levels.  They also ideally do not interfere with productivity and ease of processing for the worker, because otherwise the operator may be motivated to circumvent the controls. The initial cost of engineering controls can be higher than [[administrative controls]] or [[personal protective equipment]], but the long-term operating costs are frequently lower, and can sometimes provide cost savings in other areas of the process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-102/default.html|title=Current Strategies for Engineering Controls in Nanomaterial Production and Downstream Handling Processes|last=|first=|date=November 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|10–11}}

=== Nanomaterials ===
[[Nanomaterials]] have at least one primary dimension of less than 100 [[Nanometre|nanometers]], and often have properties different from those of their bulk components that are technologically useful.  Because [[nanotechnology]] is a recent development, the health and safety effects of exposures to nanomaterials, and what levels of exposure may be acceptable, is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|1–3}}  Processing and manufacturing of nanomaterials involve a wide range of hazards.  The types of engineering controls optimal for each situation is influenced by the quantity and [[dustiness]] of the material as well as the duration of the task.  For example, stronger engineering controls are indicated if dry nanomaterials cannot be substituted with a suspension, or if procedures such as [[sonication]] or cutting of a solid matrix containing nanomaterials cannot be eliminated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-102/|title=Building a Safety Program to Protect the Nanotechnology Workforce: A Guide for Small to Medium-Sized Enterprises|last=|first=|date=March 2016|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|9–11}}

As with any new technology, the earliest exposures are expected to occur among workers conducting research in laboratories and pilot plants. It is recommended that researchers handling engineered nanomaterials in these contexts perform that work in a manner that is protective of their safety and health.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|1}}  Control measures for nanoparticles, dusts, and other hazards are most effective when implemented within the context of a comprehensive occupational safety and health management system, the critical elements of which include management commitment and employee involvement, worksite analysis, hazard prevention and control, and sufficient training for employees, supervisors, and managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/813044597|title=Occupational health and safety management systems|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] and [[American National Standards Institute]]|others=|year=2012|isbn=9781935082354|location=|pages=|oclc=813044597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ventilation ==
Ventilation systems are distinguished as being either local or general.  Local exhaust ventilation operates at or near the source of contamination, often in conjunction with an enclosure, while general exhaust ventilation operates on an entire room through a building's [[HVAC|HVAC system]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|11–12}}

=== Local exhaust ventilation ===
Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) is the application of an exhaust system at or near the source of contamination. If properly designed, it will be much more efficient at removing contaminants than dilution ventilation, requiring lower exhaust volumes, less make-up air, and, in many cases, lower costs. By applying exhaust at the source, contaminants are removed before they get into the general work environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|12}}

Examples of local exhaust systems include [[fume hood]]s, [[Vented balance safety enclosure|vented balance enclosures]], and [[biosafety cabinet]]s.  [[Exhaust hood]]s lacking an enclosure are less preferable, and [[Laminar flow cabinet|laminar flow hoods]] are not recommended because they direct air outwards towards the worker.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-147/|title=General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|pages=|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|18–28}}

In 2006, a survey was conducted of international nanotechnology firms and research laboratories that reported manufacturing, handling, researching, or using nanomaterials. All organizations participating in the survey reported using some type of engineering control. The most common exposure control used was the traditional laboratory fume hood, with two-thirds of firms reporting its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conti|first=Joseph A.|last2=Killpack|first2=Keith|last3=Gerritzen|first3=Gina|last4=Huang|first4=Leia|last5=Mircheva|first5=Maria|last6=Delmas|first6=Magali|last7=Harthorn|first7=Barbara Herr|last8=Appelbaum|first8=Richard P.|last9=Holden|first9=Patricia A.|date=2008-05-01|title=Health and safety practices in the nanomaterials workplace: results from an international survey|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=42|issue=9|pages=3155–3162|issn=0013-936X|pmid=18522088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fume hoods ====
[[File:Powder-handling enclosure 2.png|alt=A clear plastic box on a desk with clear tubes emerging from its top|thumb|[[Vented balance safety enclosure|Vented balance enclosures]] used in the pharmaceutical industry can be used for nanomaterials, with the advantages of smaller size and lower turbulence.]]
Fume hoods are recommended to have an average inward velocity of 80–100 feet per minute (fpm) at the face of the hood. For higher toxicity materials, a higher face velocity of 100–120 fpm is recommended in order to provide better protection. However, face velocities exceeding 150 fpm are not believed to improve performance, and could increase hood leakage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

New fume hoods specifically designed for nanotechnology are being developed primarily based on low-turbulence [[Vented balance safety enclosure|balance enclosures]], which were initially developed for the weighing of [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] powders; these nanomaterial handling enclosures provide adequate containment at lower face velocities, typically operating at 65–85 fpm.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Prudent Practices in the Laboratory: Handling and Management of Chemical Hazards, Updated Version|last=|first=|date=2011-03-25|publisher=U.S. [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]]|year=|isbn=9780309138642|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.17226/12654}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are useful for weighing operations, which disturb the nanomaterial and increase its aerosolization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|27–28}}

It is recommended that air exiting a fume hood should be passed through a [[HEPA]] filter and exhausted outside the work environment, with used filters being handled as hazardous waste.  [[Turbulence]] can cause nanomaterials to exit the front of the hood, and can be avoided by keeping the sash in the proper position, keeping the interior of the hood uncluttered with equipment, and not making fast movements while working.  High face velocities can result in loss of powdered nanomaterials; while as of 2012 there was little research on the effectiveness for low-flow fume hoods, there was evidence that [[Air door|air curtain]] hoods were effective at containing nanoparticles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|19–24}}

==== Other enclosures ====
[[File:Superciste prostory.jpg|alt=A person in white lab gear sits in front of a rigid transparent enclosure.|thumb|[[Biosafety cabinet]]s, although designed to contain [[bioaerosol]]s, can also be used to contain nanomaterials.]]
Biosafety cabinets are designed to contain [[bioaerosol]]s, which have a similar size to engineered nanoparticles, and are believed to be effective with nanoparticles.  However, common biosafety cabinets are more prone to turbulence.  As with fume hoods, they are recommended to be exhausted outside the facility.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|25–27}}

Dedicated large-scale ventilated enclosures for large pieces of equipment can also be used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|9–11}}

=== General exhaust ventilation ===
General exhaust ventilation (GEV), also called dilution ventilation, is different from local exhaust ventilation because instead of capturing emissions at their source and removing them from the air, general exhaust ventilation allows the contaminant to be emitted into the workplace air and then dilutes the concentration of the contaminant to an acceptable level. GEV is inefficient and costly as compared to local exhaust ventilation, and given the lack of established exposure limits for most nanomaterials, they are not recommended to be relied upon for controlling exposure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|11–12}}

However, GEV can provide [[negative room pressure]] to prevent contaminants from exiting the room.  The use of supply and exhaust air throughout the facility can provide pressurization schemes that reduce the number of workers exposed to potentially hazardous materials, for example keeping production areas at a negative pressure with respect to nearby areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|11–12}}  For general exhaust ventilation in laboratories, a nonrecirculating system is used with 4–12 air changes per hour when used in tandem with local exhaust ventilation, and sources of contamination are placed close to the air exhaust and downwind of workers, and away from windows or doors that may cause air drafts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|13}}

=== Control verification ===
Several control verification techniques can be used to assess room airflow patterns and verify the proper operation of LEV systems.  It is considered important to confirm that an LEV system is operating as designed by regularly measuring exhaust airflows. A standard measurement, hood static pressure, provides information on airflow changes that affect hood performance. For hoods designed to prevent exposures to hazardous airborne contaminants, the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] recommends the installation of a fixed hood static [[pressure gauge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Industrial ventilation: a manual of recommended practice for design.|last=|first=|publisher=|others=[[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]]|year=2006|isbn=9781607260875|edition=29th|location=|pages=|oclc=939428191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Pitot tube]]s, hot-wire [[anemometer]]s, [[Smoke testing (mechanical)|smoke generators]], and [[dry ice]] tests can be used to qualitatively measure hood slot/face and duct air velocity, while [[tracer-gas leak testing]] is a quantitative method.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|50–52, 59}}  Standardized [[Verification and validation|testing and certification procedures]] such as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Z9.5 and [[ASHRAE]] 110 can be used, as can qualitative indicators of proper installation and functionality such as inspection of gaskets and hoses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|59–60}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|14–15}}

== Containment ==

Non-ventilation engineering controls can also include devices developed for the pharmaceutical industry, including isolation containment systems. One of the most common flexible isolation systems is [[glovebox]] containment, which can be used as an enclosure around small-scale powder processes, such as mixing and drying. Rigid glovebox isolation units also provide a method for isolating the worker from the process and are often used for medium-scale operations involving transfer of powders. Glovebags are similar to rigid gloveboxes, but they are flexible and disposable. They are used for small operations for containment or protection from contamination.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Gloveboxes are sealed systems that provide a high degree of operator protection, but are more difficult to use due to limited mobility and size of operation.  Transferring materials into and out of the enclosure also is an exposure risk.  In addition, some gloveboxes are configured to use [[positive pressure]], which can increase the risk of leaks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|24–28}}

Another non-ventilation control used in this industry is the [[continuous liner system]], which allows the filling of product containers while enclosing the material in a polypropylene bag. This system is often used for off-loading materials when the powders are to be packed into drums.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/663998513|title=Containment systems: a design guide|last=Hirst|first=Nigel|last2=Brocklebank|first2=Mike|last3=Ryder|first3=Martyn|date=2002|publisher=[[Institution of Chemical Engineers]]|others=|year=|isbn=0852954077|location=|pages=|oclc=663998513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental adult education''' is recognized as a "hybrid outgrowth of the [[environmental movement]] and [[adult education]], combining an [[ecology|ecological]] orientation with a learning paradigm to provide a vigorous educational approach to environmental concerns" (Sumner, 2003).

In laymen's terms, environmental adult education refers to efforts in teaching environmental issues and how individuals and businesses can manage or change their lifestyles and their [[ecosystem]]s in order to achieve sustainable existence. The overarching goal of this field of study is to educate global citizens in order for them to gain sustainable lives within their respective societies. The content could also include [[Environmental justice|ecological justice]], integrating social concerns such as poverty, race, gender, and sexual orientation, among others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Adult Education|last=English|first=Leona|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|isbn=9780230201712|location=New York|pages=218-219}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is demonstrated in the impact of the excesses of global capitalism and its insatiable need for resources on people such as the polarization of power and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecojustice Adult Education|last=Dentith|first=Audrey|last2=Griswold|first2=Wendy|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2017|isbn=9781119383833|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Environmental adult education is a relatively new and unique field of study and practice. Using a community-based method, educators listen and respect the input of learners and all participants are considered essential.&lt;ref name=Haugen/&gt;

Although for more than a century, environmental and conservation organizations taught adults environmental education with very little structure, it has actually evolved during the last thirty years.

The [[United States]] was one of the first countries to officially recognize environmental education. During a joint House–Senate session in 1968, Congress acknowledged the importance of environmental education, and in 1970 passed the [[Environmental Education Act]], which established the [[Office of Environmental Education]].&lt;ref&gt;American Geological Institute 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, this framework began to emerge in Asia and Latin America, where it is considered a stream of adult education and sometimes referred to as environmental popular education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The United Nations, for its part, began integrating the concept of environmental sustainability to the [[Education For All|Education for All]] initiative, which is a set of UN policies with a goal of meeting learning needs of all people, as well as the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals (MDGs)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Adult and Continuing Education|last=Kasworm|first=Carol|last2=Rose|first2=Amy|last3=Ross-Gordon|first3=Jovita|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412960502|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the UN-organized Earth Summit in 1992, prompted the [[International Council for Adult Education]] to develop the Learning for Environmental Action Programme (LEAP) which took the initiative of facilitating the dialogue that connect environmental issues and adult learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Timeline===
*Mid-1970s: EAE recognized as distinct field of study
*Late 1980s: EAE focus on learner experience
*Late 1990s, Early 2000: Focus shifted to how to teach EAE
*1997: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) hosted conference on adult education with EAE being one of the 33 workshops presented

== Earlier environmental education initiatives ==
According to the UNESCO Web site,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} in 1968 it organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, now known as "sustainable development". In the following years, UNESCO and the [[United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP) initiated three major declarations that defined environmental education. Those included:
*1972: [[Stockholm Declaration]]. This document included seven proclamations and 26 principles "to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment."
*1975: [[Belgrade Charter]]. The product of the International Workshop on Environmental Education, this charter built upon the Stockholm Declaration by adding goals, objectives and principles for environmental education programs.
*1977: [[Tbilisi Declaration]]. This document updated and clarified the Stockholm Declaration and the Belgrade Charter by including new goals, objectives, characteristics, and guiding principles of environmental education.

== Methods ==

Educators in this field of study consider environmental problems with a [[holistic]] approach that combines social, political and environmental concerns into community dilemmas.&lt;ref name=Haugen&gt;Haugen 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Participatory methods allow learners to make connections between social issues and environmental problems. This connection allows adult learners to understand the core causes of major environmental issues and the resulting social inequalities. This method also allows educators to stress the importance of instilling environmental awareness so that learners do not forget their relationship with the natural world.

To summarize the methods of adult environmental education training, environmental adult educators strive to instil learners with: 
* a knowledge of environmental problems and their causes
* the skills to engage in social activism to combat those problems
* the attitude of respect and connection to the natural world
* a desire to change current practices to protect the Earth

Environmental adult education generally takes place in a nonformal education setting. This means that the organized learning can take place in many forms including vocational education, literacy education and on the job training.&lt;ref name=Haugen/&gt; There are, however, examples of formal learning such as the degree programs and courses in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sustainability in Higher Education: Stories and Strategies for Transformation|last=Barlett|first=Peggy|last2=Chase|first2=Geoffrey|publisher=MIT Press|year=2013|isbn=9780262019491|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also be a combination of these methods of environmental educational program delivery as demonstrated in the case of [[El Salvador]]'s National Environmental Education Strategy, which covered all aspect of education via a private-public partnership. The government - through its Ministry of Education - integrated environmental education in schools, including tertiary education institutions, while partners such as media outfits deliver meaningful environmental concepts to targeted audiences and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education and Sustainability: Responding to the Global Challenge|last=Tilbury|first=Daniella|last2=Stevenson|first2=Robert|last3=Fien|first3=John|last4=Schreuder|first4=Danie|publisher=IUCN|year=2002|isbn=2831706238|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs and organizations that encourage adult environmental education ==
{{globalize|date=February 2011}}

* Conservation education and governmental agencies such as the [[Forestry Service]] and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) were established to educate adults in broad areas of the environment.
* The [[Nature Conservancy]], originally the Ecological Society of America, was formed in 1915 with the missions of supporting ecologists and preserving natural ecosystems.
* The [[4-H Organization]] was also established to reach adults by educating youth in areas of new agricultural technology and environmental awareness.
*The [[Peace Corps]], established in 1961, has worked to incorporate adult environmental education and conservation practices into its international programming. Volunteers assist in:
* Environmental education
* [[Recycling]]
* [[Wildlife protection]]
* [[Park management]]
* Alleviating water-borne diseases
* Providing potable water
* [[Project WET]] (Water Education for Teachers) is a nonprofit water education program and publisher. This program "promotes awareness, appreciation, knowledge and stewardship of water resources through the dissemination of classroom-ready teaching aids and the establishment of internationally sponsored Project WET programs." Committed to global water education that is implemented at the community level, the mission of Project WET is to reach children, parents, educators, and communities of the world with water education.&lt;ref&gt;Project WET&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Project WILD]] is a conservation and environmental education program for educators of students in kindergarten through high school. Project WILD addresses the need for human beings to develop as responsible citizens of the planet. It is based on the belief that young adults and educators have an interest in learning about the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Project WILD&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Project Learning Tree]], a program of the American Forest Foundation, is an award winning, multi-disciplinary environmental education program for educators and students in PreK–Grade 12.
* ''[[Gobar Times]]'' a monthly environmental education magazine for the young adult.

'''Epigeal''', '''epigean''', '''epigeic''' and '''epigeous''' are [[biological]] terms describing an [[organism]]'s activity above the [[soil]] surface.

In [[botany]], a [[seed]] is described as showing '''[[epigeal germination]]''' when the [[cotyledon]]s of the [[germinate|germinating]] seed expand, throw off the seed shell and become [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] above the ground. The opposite kind, where the cotyledons remain non-photosynthetic, inside the seed shell, and below ground, is [[hypogeal germination]].

The terms '''epigean''', '''epigeic''' or '''epigeous''' are used for organisms that crawl (epigean), creep like a [[vine]] (epigeal), or grow (epigeous) on the soil surface: they are also used more generally for [[animal]]s that neither burrow nor swim nor fly. The opposite terms are [[hypogean]], [[hypogeic]] and [[hypogeous]].

An epigeal nest is a term used for a termite mound, the above ground nest of a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] of [[termite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Soil Ecology |last=Lavelle |first=P. |last2=Spain |first2=A. |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9780792371236 |page=503 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCC1sOmFTSMC&amp;pg=PA503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''epiphany''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] ἐπιφάνεια, ''epiphaneia'', "manifestation, striking appearance") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by [[psychologist]]s&lt;ref name="Jarvis1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2008"/&gt; and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of [[innovation]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeemingMadden2009"/&gt;

Epiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include [[Archimedes]]'s discovery of a method to determine the density of an object ("[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!") and [[Isaac Newton]]'s realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;

==History==
The word epiphany originally referred to insight through the [[divine]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platt, V. J. (2011) ''Facing the Gods. Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion''. Cambridge University Press.'' ''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is [[supernatural]], as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;

The word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist [[James Joyce]]. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as "a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it."&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, ''Epiphany in the Modern Novel.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971. P. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment ''[[Stephen Hero]],'' although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]]).
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flammarion engraving]]. From "L'atmosphère", book of 1888]]
In traditional and pre-modern cultures, [[initiation]] rites and [[western esotericism|mystery religion]]s have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The [[Greek drama]]tists and [[Greek poetry|poets]] would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of ''[[catharsis]]'' or ''[[kenosis]]'', respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of [[William Burroughs]]' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, "a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork." Both the [[Dadaist]] [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Pop Art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]] would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of [[fine art]] (for example a [[Fountain (Duchamp)|urinal as a fountain]]), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of "what art is" or is not.

==Process==
Epiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kounios|first1=John|last2=Beeman|first2=Mark|title=The Aha! Moment: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Insight|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=210–216|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01638.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.521.6014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt; The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt;

==Myth==
A common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt; Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that "the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems".&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ("I have found it!").&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt; The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly [[Albert Einstein]] was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in [[Bern]] and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, "a storm broke loose in my mind," which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called "the happiest thought of my life" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of [[holistic]] understanding in a prepared mind was said to give [[Charles Darwin]] his "hunch" (about [[natural selection]]), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story,&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt; and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Another myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-11"/&gt;

==In religion==
{{Further information|Epiphany (holiday)|theophany|hierophany}}
In Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the [[Visit of the Magi]] as the [[revelation]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the infant Christ, and commemorate the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]] on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or [[Theophany]]) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by [[John the Baptist]] and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6.&lt;ref name="The Season of Epiphany"/&gt; Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either [[Ash Wednesday]], or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.

In more general terms, the phrase "religious epiphany" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to [[Arjuna]]'s realization that [[Krishna]] (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the "[[Bhagavad Gita]]") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be [[bodhodaya]], from Sanskrit [[bodha]] 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the [[bodhi]] tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining [[Nirvana]]. The Zen term ''[[kensho]]'' also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a ''[[koan]]''.

{{Update|date=November 2018|reason=Much of the information on this article is old (not out of date). There have been many other studies, critiques, etc. of gender bias on Wikipedia and the article must be updated to reflect that.}}
[[File:LE15_Gender_overall_in_2018.png|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Pie chart for gender of Wikipedia editors: 90% male, 9% female, and 1% transsexual or transgender|Wikipedia editors surveyed by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] in 2018 were predominantly male.]]

'''Gender bias on Wikipedia''' reflects the fact that a dominant majority of volunteer Wikipedia editors, particularly on the [[English Wikipedia|English-language site]], are male. This has led to Wikipedia having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.

It figures among the most frequent [[criticism of Wikipedia|criticisms of Wikipedia]], and part of a more general criticism about [[systemic bias in Wikipedia]]. The [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which runs Wikipedia, agrees with these criticisms and has made an ongoing attempt to increase female editorship of Wikipedia. [[Edit-a-thon]]s have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.

''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out that Wikipedia's female participation rate may be in line with other "public thought-leadership forums".&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt; In 2009, a Wikimedia Foundation survey revealed that 6% of editors who made more than 500 edits were female, with the average male editor having twice as many edits.&lt;ref name=Clubhouse&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~lam/papers/wp-gender-wikisym2011.pdf |title = WP:Clubhouse?

In the English Wikipedia and five other language editions that were studied by researchers, the ratio of articles about women to articles about men was higher than in three other databases. However, analysis with computational linguistics concluded that the way women and men are described in articles demonstrates bias, with articles about women more likely to overuse words relating to gender and family. The researchers believe that this is a sign Wikipedia editors consider male the "null gender" (in other words, that "male" is assumed unless otherwise specified).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/534616/computational-linguistics-reveals-how-wikipedia-articles-are-biased-against-women/ |title = Computational Linguistics Reveals How Wikipedia Articles Are Biased Against Women |last = arXiv |first = Emerging Technology from the |work = MIT Technology Review |access-date = 21 August 2017 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critique of Wikipedia's approach, from a 2014 ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' editorial, is that it has difficulty making judgments about "what matters". To illustrate this point they noted that [[List of pornographic actresses by decade|the page listing pornographic actresses]] was better organized than [[List of women writers|the page listing women writers]].&lt;ref name=GuardianAugust2014&gt;''[[The Guardian]]'' 2014 (London) [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth The Guardian view on Wikipedia: evolving truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112212758/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/07/guardian-view-wikipedia-evolving-truth |date=November 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[United Nations University]] and [[UNU-MERIT]] jointly presented an overview of the results of a global Wikipedia survey.&lt;ref name=WPSurvey2010&gt;{{cite web |title = Wikipedia Survey: Overview Results |url = http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |last1 = Glott |first1 = Ruediger |last2 = Schmidt |first2 = Philipp |last3 = Ghosh |first3 = Rishab |date = March 2010 |website =  |publisher =  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100414165445/http://wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf |archivedate = 14 April 2010 |accessdate = 11 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 30 January 2011, ''New York Times'' article cited this [[Wikimedia Foundation]] collaboration, which indicated that fewer than 13% of contributors to Wikipedia are women.  [[Sue Gardner]], then executive director of the foundation, said that increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia "as good as it could be." Factors the article cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the "obsessive fact-loving realm", associations with the "hard-driving hacker crowd," and the necessity to be "open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists”.&lt;ref name=Cohen110130&gt;{{cite news |last = Cohen |first = Noam |date = 30 January 2011 |title = Define Gender Gap?

In February 2011, ''The New York Times'' followed up with a series of opinions on the subject under the banner, "Where Are the Women in Wikipedia?"&lt;ref name=WhereAretheWomen&gt;{{cite news |author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date = 2 February 2011 |title = Where Are the Women in Wikipedia? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 9 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715112226/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Herring|Susan C. Herring]], a professor of information science and linguistics, said that she was not surprised by the Wikipedia contributors gender gap. She said that the often contentious nature of Wikipedia article "talk" pages, where article content is discussed, is unappealing to many women, "if not outright intimidating."&lt;ref name=Herring110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Herring |first = Susan C. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Communication Styles Make a Difference |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140724050237/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/communication-styles-make-a-difference |archivedate = 24 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Reagle|Joseph M. Reagle]] reacted similarly, saying that the combination of a "culture of hacker elitism," combined with the disproportionate effect of high-conflict members (a minority) on the community atmosphere, can make it unappealing. He said, "the ideology and rhetoric of freedom and openness can then be used (a) to suppress concerns about inappropriate or offensive speech as "censorship" and (b) to rationalize low female participation as simply a matter of their personal preference and choice."&lt;ref name=Reagle110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Reagle |first = Joseph M. |date = 4 February 2011 |title = 'Open' Doesn't Include Everyone |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |location =  |publisher =  |accessdate = 11 August 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140715113229/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/open-doesnt-include-everyone |archivedate = 15 July 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justine Cassell]] said that although women are as knowledgeable as men, and as able to defend their point of view, "it is still the case in American society that debate, contention, and vigorous defense of one’s position is often still seen as a male stance, and women’s use of these speech styles can call forth negative evaluations."&lt;ref name=Cassell110204&gt;{{cite news |last = Cassell |first = Justine |date = 4 February 2011 |title = Editing Wars Behind the Scenes |url = https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |type = opinion |newspaper = New York Times |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170227113525/http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars |archivedate = 27 February 2017 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[International Journal of Communication]]'' published research by Reagle and Lauren Rhue that examined the coverage, gender representation, and article length of thousands of biographical subjects on the English-language Wikipedia and the online ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. They concluded that Wikipedia provided better coverage and longer articles in general, that Wikipedia typically has more articles on women than ''Britannica'' in absolute terms, but Wikipedia articles on women were more likely to be missing than articles on men relative to ''Britannica''. That is, Wikipedia dominated ''Britannica'' in biographical coverage, but more so when it comes to men. Similarly, one might say that ''Britannica'' is more balanced in whom it neglects to cover than Wikipedia.

In April 2011, the Wikimedia Foundation conducted its first semi-annual Wikipedia survey. It suggested that 9% of Wikipedia editors are women. It also reported, "Contrary to the perception of some, our data shows that very few women editors feel like they have been harassed, and very few feel Wikipedia is a sexualized environment."&lt;ref name=WES2011&gt;{{cite web |url = https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |title = Wikipedia Editors Study: Results From ''The Editor Survey, April 2011'' |date = April 2011 |website = [[Wikipedia]] |accessdate = 18 May 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141226041321/http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Editor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf |archivedate = 26 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an October 2011 paper at the [[WikiSym|International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration]] found evidence that suggested that Wikipedia may have "a culture that may be resistant to female participation".&lt;ref name=WPClubhouse&gt;{{cite conference |last1 = Lam |first1 = Shyong K. |last2 = Uduwage |first2 = Anuradha |last3 = Dong |first3 = Zhenhua |last4 = Sen |first4 = Shilad |last5 = Musicant |first5 = David R. |last6 = Terveen |first6 = Loren |last7 = Reidl |first7 = John |date = October 2011 |title = WP:Clubhouse?

A study published in 2014 found that there is also an "Internet skills gap" with regard to Wikipedia editors. The authors found that the most likely Wikipedia contributors are high-skilled men and that there is no gender gap among low-skilled editors, and concluded that the "skills gap" exacerbates the gender gap among editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Hargittai |first1 = Eszter |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Aaron |title = Mind the skills gap: the role of Internet know-how and gender in differentiated contributions to Wikipedia |journal = Information, Communication &amp; Society |date = 4 November 2014 |pages = 1–19 |doi = 10.1080/1369118X.2014.957711 |volume = 18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2010–14, women made up 61% of participants of the college courses arranged by the Wiki Education Foundation program that included editing Wikipedia as part of the curriculum. Their contributions were found to shift the Wikipedia content from pop-culture and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] towards social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |title = Wikipedia grows up on college campuses |author = Bruce Maiman |date = 23 September 2014 |website = [[The Sacramento Bee]] |accessdate = 23 September 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140923224639/http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/23/6727564/bruce-maiman-wikipedia-grows-up.html |archivedate = 23 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors also found structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities.

A 2017 study found that women participating in an experiment by editing a Wikipedia-like site tended to view other editors as male, and to view their responses as more critical than if the other editor was [[gender-neutral]]. The study concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Shane-Simpson |first1=Christina |last2=Gillespie-Lynch |first2=Kristen |title=Examining potential mechanisms underlying the Wikipedia gender gap through a collaborative editing task |journal=[[Computers in Human Behavior]] |date=January 2017 |volume=66 |pages=312–328 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.043|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01612306/document }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote |text = ...visible female editors on Wikipedia and broader encouragement of the use of constructive feedback may begin to alleviate the Wikipedia gender gap. Furthermore, the relatively high proportion of anonymous editors may exacerbate the Wikipedia gender gap, as anonymity may often be perceived as male and more critical.}}

A study by Ford and Wajcman observes that research on the gender bias continues to frame the problem as a deficit in women. In contrast, their central argument states that infrastructure studies in [[feminist technoscience]] allows the gender analysis to be taken to a further level. It looks at three issues within the infrastructure: content policies, software and the legalistic framework of operation. It suggests that progress can be made through altering that culture of [[knowledge production]] through encouraging alternate knowledge, reducing the technical barriers to editing, and addressing the complexity of Wikipedia policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Ford |first1 = Heather |last2 = Wajcman |first2 = Judy |title = 'Anyone can edit', not everyone does: Wikipedia and the gender gap |journal = Social Studies of Science |date = 2017 |url = http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228081909/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/ |archivedate = 28 December 2016 |df = dmy-all | doi = 10.1177/0306312717692172 |volume=47 |pages=511–527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, mathematician [[Marie A. Vitulli]] wrote in ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The percentage of women editors on Wikipedia remains dismally low."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201803/rnoti-p330.pdf|title=Writing Women in Mathematics into Wikipedia 65 (3). pp. 331–332. doi:10.1090/noti1650|last=Vitulli|first=Marie A.|date=March 2018|publisher=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, when [[Donna Strickland]] won a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], numerous write-ups mentioned that she did not previously have a Wikipedia page. A draft had been submitted, but was rejected for not demonstrating "significant coverage (not just passing mentions) about the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nobel prize winning scientist who wasn’t famous enough for Wikipedia |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/the-nobel-prize-winning-scientist-who-wasn-t-famous-enough-for-wikipedia-1.3650212 |website=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=3 October 2018 |date=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2018/oct/02/nobel-prize-in-physics-2018-live&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leyland Cecco|title=Female Nobel prize winner deemed not important enough for Wikipedia entry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/03/donna-strickland-nobel-physics-prize-wikipedia-denied|work=The Guardian|date=2018-10-03|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several causes for this gender disparity have been suggested. A 2010 study revealed a Wikipedia female participation rate of 13 percent, observed to be close to the 15 percent overall female participation rate of other "public thought-leadership forums".&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Signpost-2013-07-31"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2013-07-31/Recent_research |title = Recent research&amp;nbsp;— Napoleon, Michael Jackson and Srebrenica across cultures, 90% of Wikipedia better than Britannica, WikiSym preview |last = Yasseri |first = Taha |last2 = Liao |first2 = Han-Teng |last3 = Konieczny |first3 = Piotr |last4 = Morgan |first4 = Jonathan |last5 = Bayer |first5 = Tilman |date = 31 July 2013 |work = [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost|The Signpost]] |publisher = [[Wikipedia]] |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150617074727/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2013-07-31/Recent_research |archivedate = 17 June 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia research fellow Sarah Stierch acknowledged that it is "fairly common" for Wikipedia contributors to remain gender-anonymous.&lt;ref name="DailyDotStierch"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.dailydot.com/society/wikipedia-gender-gap-sarah-stierch/ |title = The women of Wikipedia: Closing the site's giant gender gap |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150703203120/http://www.dailydot.com/society/wikipedia-gender-gap-sarah-stierch/ |archivedate = 3 July 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A perceived unwelcoming culture and tolerance of violent and abusive language are also reasons put forth for the gender gap.&lt;ref name="CSM-misogyny"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2013/0801/In-UK-rising-chorus-of-outrage-over-online-misogyny |title = In UK, rising chorus of outrage over online misogyny |website = CSMonitor.com |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150704200524/http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Security-Watch/Backchannels/2013/0801/In-UK-rising-chorus-of-outrage-over-online-misogyny |archivedate = 4 July 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2013 study,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/morgan_cscw2013_final.pdf |title = Tea &amp; Sympathy: Crafting Positive New User Experiences on Wikipedia |author = Jonathan T.

As well, Wikipedia "...editors that publicly identify as women face harassment" from other Wikipedia editors.&lt;ref name="Montellaro" /&gt;

Lam ''et al''. suggest that there may be a culture which is non-inclusive of women on Wikipedia, which may be due to a disparity in male-to-female centric topics represented and edited, the tendency for female users to be more active in the [[Community of Wikipedia|social and community aspects of Wikipedia]], an increased likelihood that edits by new female editors are reverted, and/or that articles with high proportions of female editors are more contentious.&lt;ref name=WPClubhouse /&gt;

In July 2014, the [[National Science Foundation]] announced that it would spend $200,000 to study systemic gender bias on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |title=Government-Funded Study: Why Is Wikipedia Sexist? |work=[[Washington Free Beacon]] |date=30 July 2014 |author= Elizabeth Harrington |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801062009/http://freebeacon.com/issues/government-funded-study-why-is-wikipedia-sexist/ |archivedate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Julia Adams and Hannah Brückner that was supported by the funding was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Julia |last1=Adams |first2=Hannah |last2=Brückner |title=Wikipedia, sociology, and the promise and pitfalls of Big Data |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951715614332|journal=Big Data &amp; Society |date=27 December 2015 |issn=2053-9517 |volume=2 |issue=2 |doi=10.1177/2053951715614332}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|reason=Please tell us what the report's findings were.

== Reactions ==

The Wikimedia Foundation has officially held, since at least 2011 when Gardner was executive director, that gender bias exists in the project. It has made some attempts to address it but Gardner has expressed frustration with the degree of success achieved. She has also noted that "in the very limited leisure time women had, they tended to be more involved in social activities instead of editing Wikipedia. 'Women see technology more as a tool they use to accomplish tasks, rather than something fun in itself.{{'"}}&lt;ref name=Huang130811&gt;{{cite news |last = Huang |first = Keira |date = 11 August 2013 |title = Wikipedia fails to bridge gender gap |url = http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |newspaper = South China Morning Post |accessdate =  |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160115195821/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1295872/wikipedia-fails-bridge-gender-gap |archivedate = 15 January 2016 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wikistorm2013&gt;{{cite web |url = http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |title = Wikistorming |date = Fall 2013 |website = FemTechNet |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150717034630/http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/wikistorming/ |archivedate = 17 July 2015 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Foundation set a target of having 25 percent of its contributors identifying as female by 2015.&lt;ref name=Cohen110130 /&gt; In August 2013, Gardner said, "I didn't solve it. We didn't solve it. The Wikimedia Foundation didn't solve it. The solution won't come from the Wikimedia Foundation."&lt;ref name=Huang130811 /&gt;

Writing for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' in 2011, [[Heather Mac Donald]] called Wikipedia's gender imbalance a "non-problem in search of a misguided solution." Mac Donald asserted, "The most straightforward explanation for the differing rates of participation in Wikipedia—and the one that conforms to everyday experience—is  that, on average, males and females have different interests and preferred ways of spending their free time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Mac Donald |first = Heather |url = http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2011/02/wikipedia_is_maledominated_that_doesnt_mean_its_sexist.html |title = Wikipedia Is Male-Dominated.

In August 2014, Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] announced in a BBC interview the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]'s plans for "doubling down" on the gender content gap at Wikipedia. Wales said the Foundation would be open to more outreach and more software changes.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 Wikipedia 'completely failed' to fix gender imbalance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229004148/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28701772 |date=29 December 2016 }}, [[BBC]] interview with [[Jimmy Wales]], 8 August 2014; starting at 45 seconds.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to increase female editorship ==

[[File:Giants in the field of Women in the Arts 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|Attendees at the 2013 Women in the Arts edit-a-thon in Washington, DC]]

Dedicated [[edit-a-thon]]s have been organized to increase the coverage of women's topics in Wikipedia and to encourage more women to edit Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |title = Closing Wikipedia’s Gender Gap — Reluctantly |work = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = 11 February 2014 |accessdate = 27 August 2014 |author = Stoeffel |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140902160836/http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/02/closing-wikipedias-gender-gap-reluctantly.html |archivedate = 2 September 2014 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These events are supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, which sometimes provides mentors and technology to help guide newer editors through the process.

In the summer of 2015, the WikiProject [[Women in Red]] was launched on the English-language version of Wikipedia, focusing on the creation of new articles about notable women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/19/women-in-science-on-wikipedia-will-we-ever-fill-the-information-gap|title=Women in science on Wikipedia: will we ever fill the information gap? |author=Redden, Molly|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=19 March 2016|accessdate=16 August 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly through its monthly virtual editathons, Women in Red encourages editors to participate in extending Wikipedia's coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/news-events/community/2017/aug/wikithon/|title=Improving gender balance on Wikipedia|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|date=21 August 2017|accessdate=16 August 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/article/Adding-women-s-voices-to-Wikipedia-12344424.php|title=Wikipedia editing marathons add women's voices to online resource|author=Gordon, Maggie|publisher=''Houston Chronicle''|date=9 November 2017|accessdate=16 August 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks in part to the efforts of this project, by June 2018 some 17,000 new women's biographies had been added to Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/need-close-wikipedias-gender-page-gap/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw|title=Why we need to close Wikipedia's gender page gap |author=Khan, Sadiq|publisher=''The Telegraph''|date=12 June 2018|accessdate=16 August 2018 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''green economy''' is defined as an [[economy]] that aims at reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities, and that aims for [[sustainable development]] without [[environmental degradation|degrading the environment]]. It is closely related with [[ecological economics]], but has a more politically applied focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/AboutGEI/WhatisGEI/tabid/29784/Default.aspx|title=-- United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - Error page --|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]] Green Economy Report argues "that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient, but also fair. Fairness implies recognising global and country level equity dimensions, particularly in assuring a just transition to an economy that is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive."&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature distinguishing it from prior economic regimes is the direct valuation of [[natural capital]] and [[ecological services]] as having economic value (''see [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] and [[Bank of Natural Capital]]'') and a [[full cost accounting]] regime in which costs externalized onto society via ecosystems are reliably traced back to, and accounted for as liabilities of, the entity that does the harm or neglects an asset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/1150 Runnals, D. (2011) “Environment and economy: joined at the hip or just strange bedfellows?”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''4''' (1) ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Sticker and [[ecolabel]] practices have emerged as consumer facing measurements of friendliness to the environment and sustainable development. Many industries are starting to adopt these standards as a viable way to promote their greening practices in a [[globalizing]] economy.

== "Green" economists and economics ==
"Green economics" is loosely defined as any theory of [[economics]] by which an economy is considered to be component of the ecosystem in which it resides (after [[Lynn Margulis]]).  A holistic approach to the subject is typical, such that economic ideas are commingled with any number of other subjects, depending on the particular theorist.  Proponents of [[feminism]], [[postmodernism]], the [[environmental movement]], [[peace movement]], [[Green politics]], [[green anarchism]] and [[anti-globalization]] movement have used the term to describe very different ideas, all external to [[mainstream economics]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The use of the term is further ambiguated by the political distinction of [[Green parties]] which are formally organized and claim the capital-G "Green" term as a unique and distinguishing mark. It is thus preferable to refer to a loose school of "'green economists"' who generally advocate shifts towards a green economy, [[biomimicry]] and a fuller accounting for [[biodiversity]].  (''see [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]] especially for current authoritative international work towards these goals and [[Bank of Natural Capital]] for a layperson's presentation of these.''){{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Some economists view green economics as a branch or subfield of more established schools.  For instance, it is regarded as [[classical economics]] where the traditional land is generalized to [[natural capital]] and has some attributes in common with labor and physical capital (since natural capital assets like rivers directly substitute for man-made ones such as [[canal]]s). Or, it is viewed as [[Marxist economics]] with nature represented as a form of [[Lumpenproletariat]], an exploited base of non-human workers providing [[surplus value]] to the human economy, or as a branch of [[neoclassical economics]] in which the [[price of life]] for developing vs. developed nations is held steady at a ratio reflecting a balance of power and that of non-human life is very low.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

An increasing commitment by the UNEP (and national governments such as the UK) to the ideas of [[natural capital]] and [[full cost accounting]] under the banner 'green economy' could blur distinctions between the schools and redefine them all as variations of "green economics".  As of 2010 the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions (notably the [[World Bank]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11642538|title=World Bank to lead economic push on nature protection|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[International Monetary Fund]] (via its "Green Fund" initiative) responsible for global [[monetary policy]] have stated a clear intention to move towards [[biodiversity]] valuation and a more official and universal [[biodiversity finance]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
Taking these into account targeting not less but radically zero emission and waste is what is promoted by the [[Zero Emissions Research and Initiatives]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The UNEP 2011 Green Economy Report informs that "based on existing studies, the annual financing demand to green the global economy was estimated to be in the range US$ 1.05 to US$ 2.59 trillion. To place this demand in perspective, it is about one-tenth of total global investment per year, as measured by global Gross Capital Formation." &lt;ref name="unep.org"/&gt;

Karl Burkart defines a green economy as based on six main sectors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/blogs/how-do-you-define-the-green-economy |title=How do you define the 'green' economy? |publisher=MNN - Mother Nature Network |date=2009-01-09 |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

The [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC) representing global business defines green economy as “an economy in which economic growth and environmental responsibility work together in a mutually reinforcing fashion while supporting progress on social development”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/green-economy-roadmap|title=Green Economy Roadmap|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505222844/http://www.iccwbo.org/products-and-services/trade-facilitation/green-economy-roadmap/|archivedate=5 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncsd2012.org/content/documents/528Green%20Economy%20Guidebook_100912_FINAL.pdf UNDESA, (2012). A guidebook to the Green Economy.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127180157/http://uncsd2012.org/content/documents/528Green%20Economy%20Guidebook_100912_FINAL.pdf |date=2013-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the ICC published the Green Economy Roadmap, containing contributions from experts from around the globe brought together in a two-year consultation process. The Roadmap represents a comprehensive and multidisciplinary effort to clarify and frame the concept of “green economy”. It highlights the essential role of business in bringing solutions to common global challenges. It sets out the following 10 conditions which relate to business/intra-industry and collaborative action for a transition towards a green economy:

* Open and competitive markets
* Metrics, accounting, and reporting
* Finance and investment
* Awareness
* Life cycle approach
* Resource efficiency and decoupling
* Employment
* Education and skills
* Governance and partnership
* Integrated policy and decision-making

==Ecological measurements==
Measuring economic output and progress is done through the use of [[Index (economics)|economic index]] indicators. Green indices emerged from the need to measure human ecological impact, efficiency sectors like transport, energy, buildings and tourism, as well as the investment flows targeted to areas like renewable energy and cleantech innovation. 
# 2010 - 2016 Global Green Economy Index™ (GGEI),&lt;ref name="ggei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dualcitizeninc.com/GGEI-2016.pdf |title=2016 Global Green Economy Index |publisher=Dual Citizen LLC |date=19 September 2016 |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by consultancy Dual Citizen LLC is in its 5th edition. It measures the green economic performance and perceptions of it in 80 countries and 50 cities along four main dimensions of leadership &amp; climate change, efficiency sectors, markets &amp; investment and the environment.
# 2009 - 2012 Green City Index &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/en/greencityindex.htm|title=Home - English - Siemens Global Website|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global study commissioned by [[Siemens]]
# 2009 - 2013 [[Circles of Sustainability]] project scored 5 cities in 5 separate countries.

[[Ecological footprint]] measurements are a way to gauge anthropogenic impact and are another standard used by municipal governments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fcm.ca/Documents/reports/Ecological_Footprints_of_Canadian_Municipalities_and_Regions_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Green energy issues ==
Green economies require [[green energy]] generation based on [[renewable energy]] to replace  [[fossil fuels]] as well as [[energy conservation]] and [[efficient energy use]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

There is justification for [[market failure]] to respond to [[environmental protection]] and [[climate protection]] needs with the excuse that high [[external costs]] and high initial costs for research, development, and marketing of [[green energy]] sources and green products prevents firms from voluntarily reducing their ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;(Reinhardt, 1999; King and Lenox, 2002; Wagner, 203; Wagner, et al., 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The green economy may need government subsidies as market incentives to motivate firms to invest and produce green products and services. The [[German Renewable Energy Act]], legislations of many other [[member states of the European Union]] and the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], all provide such market incentives.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} However, other experts&lt;ref&gt;[[Amory Lovins]], [[Hunter Lovins]], and [[Paul Hawken]], authors of ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]'', and [[Jay Conrad Levinson]] and Shel Horowitz, authors of ''Guerrilla Marketing Goes Green''&lt;/ref&gt; argue that green strategies can be highly profitable for corporations that understand the business case for sustainability and can market green products and services beyond the traditional green consumer.

== Criticisms ==

A number of organisations and individuals have criticised aspects of the 'Green Economy', particularly the mainstream conceptions of it based on using [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity|price mechanisms to protect nature]], arguing that this will extend corporate control into new areas from forestry to water. The research organisation ETC Group argues that the corporate emphasis on bio-economy "will spur even greater convergence of [[corporate power]] and unleash the most massive resource grab in more than 500 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5296|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108015332/http://www.etcgroup.org/en/node/5296|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 January 2012|title=New Report: Who Will Control the Green Economy? - ETC Group|author=|date=8 January 2012|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuelan professor Edgardo Lander says that the UNEP's report, ''Towards a Green Economy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/greeneconomy/greeneconomyreport/tabid/29846/default.aspx |title=Green Economy - Green Economy Report |publisher=UNEP |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while well-intentioned "ignores the fact that the capacity of existing political systems to establish regulations and restrictions to the free operation of the markets – even when a large majority of the population call for them – is seriously limited by the political and financial power of the corporations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/report/green-economy-wolf-sheeps-clothing|title=The Green Economy: the Wolf in Sheep’s clothing|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulrich Hoffmann, in a paper for [[UNCTAD]] also says that the focus on Green Economy and "green growth" in particular, "based on an evolutionary (and often reductionist) approach will not be sufficient to cope with the complexities of climate
change" and "may rather give much false hope and excuses to do nothing really fundamental that can
bring about a U-turn of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/osgdp2011d5_en.pdf U.Hoffmann (2011), "Some reflections on climate change, green growth illusions and development space"]&lt;/ref&gt; Clive Spash, an ecological economist, has criticised the use of economic growth to address environmental losses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clivespash.org/fgml.pdf Spash, C.L. 2007.

'''Hormesis''' is any process in a cell or organism that exhibits a [[phase (pharmacology)|biphasic]] response to exposure to increasing amounts of a substance or condition.&lt;ref name="mattson"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc=2248601|year=2007|last1=Mattson|first1=M. P|title=Hormesis Defined|journal=Ageing Research Reviews|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.08.007|pmid=18162444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the '''hormetic zone''', there is generally a favorable biological response to low exposures to [[toxin]]s and other [[stressor]]s. Hormesis comes from Greek ''hórmēsis'' "rapid motion, eagerness", itself from ancient Greek ''hormáein'' "to set in motion, impel, urge on". Hormetics is the term proposed for the study and science of hormesis.

In [[toxicology]], hormesis is a [[dose response]] phenomenon characterized by a low dose stimulation, high dose inhibition, resulting in either a J-shaped or an inverted U-shaped dose response.&lt;ref name=mattson/&gt; Such environmental factors that would seem to produce positive responses have also been termed "[[eustress]]". The hormesis model of dose response is vigorously debated.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt; The notion that hormesis is important for chemical risks regulations is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15473091 |year=2004 |last1=Axelrod |first1=Deborah |last2=Burns |first2=Kathy |last3=Davis |first3=Devra |last4=von Larebeke |first4=Nicolas |title='Hormesis'—An Inappropriate Extrapolation from the Specific to the Universal |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=335–9 |journal=International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health |url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&amp;issn=1077-3525&amp;volume=10&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=335&amp;epage=339 |hdl=1854/LU-867581 |doi=10.1179/oeh.2004.10.3.335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biochemical mechanisms by which hormesis works remain under laboratory research and are not well understood.&lt;ref name=mattson/&gt;

==History==
German [[pharmacologist]] [[Hugo Schulz]] first described such a phenomenon in 1888 following his own observations that the growth of yeast could be stimulated by small doses of poisons. This was coupled with the work of German physician [[Rudolph Arndt]], who studied animals given low doses of drugs, eventually giving rise to the [[Arndt-Schulz rule]].&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.302.5644.376 |title=Sipping from a Poisoned Chalice |year=2003 |last1=Kaiser |first1=Jocelyn |journal=Science |volume=302 |issue=5644 |pages=376–9 |pmid=14563981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arndt's advocacy of [[homeopathy]] contributed to the rule's diminished credibility in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"/&gt; The term "hormesis" was coined and used for the first time in a scientific paper by [[Chester M. Southam]] and J. Ehrlich in 1943 in the journal: Phytopathology, volume 33, pp.&amp;nbsp;517–541.
Recently, [[Edward Calabrese]] has revived the concept of hormesis.&lt;ref name="Calabrese"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400222 |title=Hormesis: A revolution in toxicology, risk assessment and medicine |year=2004 |last1=Calabrese |first1=Edward J. |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=5 |pages=S37–40 |pmid=15459733 |pmc=1299203 |issue=Suppl 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calabrese 2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bethell | first = Tom | title = The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science | publisher = Regnery Publishing | location = USA | pages = 58–61 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xX4m7s7_4L0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA58,M1 | isbn = 978-0-89526-031-4 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Physical exercise===
Individuals with low levels of physical activity are at risk for high levels of [[oxidative stress]], as are individuals engaged in highly intensive exercise programs; however individuals engaged in moderately intensive, regular exercise experience lower levels of oxidative stress. High levels of oxidative stress have been linked by some with the increased incidence of a variety of diseases.&lt;ref name=pmid17869589&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.04.004 |title=Exercise, oxidative stress and hormesis |year=2008 |last1=Radak |first1=Zsolt |last2=Chung |first2=Hae Y. |last3=Koltai |first3=Erika |last4=Taylor |first4=Albert W. |last5=Goto |first5=Sataro |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=7 |pages=34–42 |pmid=17869589 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that this relationship, characterized by positive effects at an intermediate dose of the stressor (exercise), is characteristic of hormesis.&lt;ref name=pmid17869589/&gt; However, it is important to point out that there is evidence that the oxidative stress associated with intensive exercise may have long-term health benefits. This would imply that oxidative stress, itself, provides an example of hormesis (see section on [[Mitochondrial hormesis]]), but physical exercise does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.03.014 |title=How increased oxidative stress promotes longevity and metabolic health: The concept of mitochondrial hormesis (mitohormesis) |year=2010 |last1=Ristow |first1=Michael |last2=Zarse |first2=Kim |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=410–8 |pmid=20350594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
{{Main article|Alcohol consumption and health|Alcohol and cancer|Alcohol and cardiovascular disease}}
[[Ethanol|Alcohol]] is believed to be hormetic in preventing heart disease and stroke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.8606 |title=The Importance of Hormesis to Public Health |year=2006 |last1=Calabrese |first1=Edward J. |last2=Cook |first2=Ralph |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |pmid=17107845 |jstor=4091789 |volume=114 |issue=11 |pages=1631–5 |pmc=1665397}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the benefits of light drinking may have been exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/16066350500497983 |laysource=[[University of California, San Francisco]] |laysummary=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/uoc--isq032706.php |laydate=March 30, 2006 |title=Moderate alcohol use and reduced mortality risk: Systematic error in prospective studies |year=2006 |last1=Fillmore |first1=Kaye Middleton |last2=Kerr |first2=William C. |last3=Stockwell |first3=Tim |last4=Chikritzhs |first4=Tanya |last5=Bostrom |first5=Alan |journal=Addiction Research &amp; Theory |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2007.01.005 |title=Moderate Alcohol Use and Reduced Mortality Risk: Systematic Error in Prospective Studies and New Hypotheses |year=2007 |last1=Fillmore |first1=Kaye Middleton |last2=Stockwell |first2=Tim |last3=Chikritzhs |first3=Tanya |last4=Bostrom |first4=Alan |last5=Kerr |first5=William |journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=S16–23 |pmid=17478320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, researchers at UCLA found that tiny amounts (1 mM, or 0.005%) of ethanol doubled the lifespan of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a round worm frequently used in biological studies, that were starved of other nutrients. Higher doses of 0.4% provided no longevity benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0029984 |title=Caenorhabditis elegans Battling Starvation Stress: Low Levels of Ethanol Prolong Lifespan in L1 Larvae |year=2012 |editor1-last=Singh |editor1-first=Shree Ram |last1=Castro |first1=Paola V. |last2=Khare |first2=Shilpi |last3=Young |first3=Brian D. |last4=Clarke |first4=Steven G. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |pages=e29984 |pmid=22279556 |issue=1 |pmc=3261173 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...7E9984C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, worms exposed to 0.005% did not develop normally (their development was arrested). The authors argue that the worms were using ethanol as an alternative energy source in the absence of other nutrition, or had initiated a stress response.

In 2010, a paper published in the journal ''Environmental Toxicology &amp; Chemistry'' showed that low doses of [[methylmercury]], a potent neurotoxic pollutant, improved the hatching rate of [[mallard]] eggs.&lt;ref name=pmid20821490&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/etc.64 |laysummary=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/56954/title/Fowl_surprise!_Methylmercury_improves_hatching_rate |laysource=Science News |laydate=March 5, 2010 |title=Enhanced reproduction in mallards fed a low level of methylmercury: An apparent case of hormesis |year=2010 |last1=Heinz |first1=Gary H. |last2=Hoffman |first2=David J. |last3=Klimstra |first3=Jon D. |last4=Stebbins |first4=Katherine R. |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=650–3 |pmid=20821490|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1229166 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the study, Gary Heinz, who led the study for the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] at the [[Patuxent Wildlife Research Center]] in [[Beltsville]], Md., stated that other explanations are possible. For instance, it is possible that the flock he studied might have harbored some low, subclinical infection and that mercury, well known to be antimicrobial, might have killed the infection that otherwise hurt reproduction in the untreated birds.&lt;ref name=pmid20821490/&gt;

===Effects in aging===
One of the areas where the concept of hormesis has been explored extensively with respect to its applicability is aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Le Bourg |editor2-first=Suresh |editor2-last=Rattan |editor2-link=Suresh Rattan |title=Mild Stress and Healthy Aging: Applying hormesis in aging research and interventions |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-6868-3}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0960327107083409 |title=Principles and practice of hormetic treatment of aging and age-related diseases |year=2008 |last1=Rattan |first1=S. I. |journal=Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=151–4 |pmid=18480141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the basic survival capacity of any biological system depends on its [[homeostatic]] ability, [[biogerontologist]]s proposed that exposing cells and organisms to mild stress should result in the adaptive or hormetic response with various biological benefits. This idea has now gathered a large body of supportive evidence showing that repetitive mild stress exposure has anti-aging effects.&lt;ref name="Rattan, S.I.S 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.arr.2007.03.002 |title=Hormesis in aging |year=2008 |last1=Rattan |first1=Suresh I.S. |journal=Ageing Research Reviews |volume=7 |pages=63–78 |pmid=17964227 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gems"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2008.01.001 |title=Stress-Response Hormesis and Aging: "That which Does Not Kill Us Makes Us Stronger" |year=2008 |last1=Gems |first1=David |last2=Partridge |first2=Linda |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=200–3 |pmid=18316025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise is a paradigm for hormesis in this respect.&lt;ref name = "Gems"/&gt; Some of the mild stresses used for such studies on the application of hormesis in aging research and interventions are [[heat shock]], irradiation, [[Pro-oxidant|prooxidants]], [[hypergravity]] and food restriction.&lt;ref name="Rattan, S.I.S 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gems"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Le Bourg |editor2-last=Rattan |title=Mild Stress and Healthy Aging: Applying hormesis in aging research and interventions |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4020-6868-3}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other natural and synthetic molecules, such as [[celastrol]]s from medicinal herbs and [[curcumin]] from the spice [[turmeric]] have also been found to have hormetic beneficial effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1196/annals.1354.056 |title=Curcumin's Biphasic Hormetic Response on Proteasome Activity and Heat-Shock Protein Synthesis in Human Keratinocytes |year=2006 |last1=Ali |first1=R.

===Mitochondria{{anchor|Mitohormesis}}===
[[Mitochondria]] are sometimes described as "cellular power plants" because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a source of chemical energy. [[Reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) have been regarded as unwanted by-products of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in mitochondria by the proponents of the free-radical theory of aging promoted by [[Denham Harman]]. The [[free-radical theory]] suggests that the use of compounds which inactivate ROS, such as [[antioxidant]]s, would lead to a reduction of oxidative stress and thereby produce an increase in lifespan.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

ROS may perform an essential and potentially lifespan-promoting role as [[redox signaling]] molecules which transduce signals from the mitochondrial compartment to other compartments of the cell.&lt;ref name="pmid 20350594"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20350594 |year=2010 |last1=Ristow |first1=M |last2=Zarse |first2=K |title=How increased oxidative stress promotes longevity and metabolic health: The concept of mitochondrial hormesis (mitohormesis) |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=410–8 |doi=10.1016/j.exger.2010.03.014 |journal=Experimental Gerontology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased formation of ROS within the mitochondria may cause an adaptive reaction which produces increased stress resistance and a long-term reduction of oxidative stress. This kind of reverse effect of the response to ROS stress has been named mitochondrial hormesis or mitohormesis and is hypothesized to be responsible for the respective lifespan-extending and health-promoting capabilities of glucose restriction and physical exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid 20350594"/&gt;

Hormesis may also be induced by [[endogenous]]ly produced, potentially toxic agents. For example, [[mitochondria]] consume [[oxygen]] which generates [[free radical]]s ([[reactive oxygen species]]) as a by-product. It was previously proposed on a hypothetical basis that such free radicals may induce an endogenous response culminating in increased defense capacity against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2005.09.009 |title=Sublethal mitochondrial stress with an attendant stoichiometric augmentation of reactive oxygen species may precipitate many of the beneficial alterations in cellular physiology produced by caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, exercise and dietary phytonutrients: "Mitohormesis" for health and vitality |year=2006 |last1=Tapia |first1=Patrick C. |journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=832–43 |pmid=16242247}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Recent experimental evidence strongly suggests that this is indeed the case, and that such induction of endogenous free radical production extends [[life expectancy|life span]] of a model organism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pinto |first1=Silas |last2=Sato |first2=Vitor N. |last3=De-Souza |first3=Evandro A. |last4=Ferraz |first4=Rafael C. |last5=Camara |first5=Henrique |last6=Pinca |first6=Ana Paula F. |last7=Mazzotti |first7=Diego R. |last8=Lovci |first8=Michael T. |last9=Tonon |first9=Guilherme |last10=Lopes-Ramos |first10=Camila M. |last11=Parmigiani |first11=Raphael B. |last12=Wurtele |first12=Martin |last13=Massirer |first13=Katlin B. |last14=Mori |first14=Marcelo A. |title=Enoxacin extends lifespan of  C. elegans  by inhibiting  miR-34-5p  and promoting mitohormesis |journal=Redox Biology |date=September 2018 |volume=18 |pages=84–92 |doi=10.1016/j.redox.2018.06.006|pmid=29986212 |pmc=6037660 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Most importantly, this extension of life span is prevented by [[antioxidant]]s, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may mitohormetically exert life extending and health promoting effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2007.08.011 |title=Glucose Restriction Extends Caenorhabditis elegans Life Span by Inducing Mitochondrial Respiration and Increasing Oxidative Stress |year=2007 |last1=Schulz |first1=Tim J. |last2=Zarse |first2=Kim |last3=Voigt |first3=Anja |last4=Urban |first4=Nadine |last5=Birringer |first5=Marc |last6=Ristow |first6=Michael |journal=Cell Metabolism |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=280–93 |pmid=17908557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mitochondrial activity was found to be increased in the previously mentioned studies, this effect cannot be explained by an excess of free radicals that might mark mitochondria for destruction by [[lysosome]]s, with the free radicals acting as a signal within the cell to indicate which mitochondria are ready for destruction, as proposed by [[Nick Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lane | first = Nick | authorlink = Nick Lane | title = Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | date = November 17, 2006 | isbn = 978-0-19-920564-6 }}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether this concept applies to humans remains to be shown, although recent [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] findings support the process of mitohormesis, and even suggest that some [[antioxidant]] supplements may increase disease [[prevalence]] in humans.&lt;ref name=Bjelakovic&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.297.8.842 |title=Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis |year=2007 |last1=Bjelakovic |first1=Goran |journal=JAMA |volume=297 |issue=8 |pages=842–57 |pmid=17327526 |last2=Nikolova |first2=D |last3=Gluud |first3=LL |last4=Simonetti |first4=RG |last5=Gluud |first5=C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ionizing radiation{{anchor|Ionizing Radiation}}===
{{see also|Radiation hormesis}}
Hormesis has been observed in a number of cases in humans and animals exposed to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation. In Taiwan recycled [[Radiation contamination|radiocontaminated]] steel was inadvertently used in the construction of over 100 apartment buildings causing the long-term (10 years) exposure of 10,000 people. The average dose rate was 50 mSv/year and a subset of the population (1,000 people) received a total dose of over 4,000 mSv over ten years. In the widely used [[Linear no-threshold model|Linear No Threshold]] (LNT) theory used by regulatory bodies, the expected cancer deaths in this population would have been 302 with 70 caused by the extra ionizing radiation with the remainder caused by natural background radiation. However the observed cancer rate was quite low at 7 cancer deaths when 232 would be predicted by the LNT theory. Ionizing radiation hormesis appears to be at work. Described by Professor Charles L. Sanders, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sanders |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles L. Sanders |title=Radiation Hormesis and the Linear-No-Threshold Assumption |journal=Radiation Hormesis and the Linear-No-Threshold Assumption by Charles L Sanders |date=2010 |isbn=978-3-642-03719-1 |page=47|bibcode=2010rhln.book.....S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taiwan's National Cancer Registry (first study) ====
Cancer risks in a population with prolonged low dose-rate gamma-radiation exposure in radiocontaminated buildings, 1983–2002. The results suggest that prolonged low dose-rate radiation exposure appeared to increase risks of developing certain cancers in specific subgroups of this population in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hwang SL, Guo HR, Hsieh WA, Hwang JS, Lee SD, Tang JL, Chen CC, Chang TC, Wang JD, Chang WP |title=Cancer risks in a population with prolonged low dose-rate gamma-radiation exposure in radiocontaminated buildings, 1983-2002 |journal=International Journal of Radiation Biology |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=849–58 |year=2006 |pmid=17178625 |doi=10.1080/09553000601085980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taiwan's National Cancer Registry (second study, two years later) ====
A significant radiation risk was observed for leukemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR(100mGy) 1.19, 90% CI 1.01-1.31). Breast cancer exhibited a marginally significant dose response (HR(100mGy) 1.12, 90% CI 0.99-1.21). The results further strengthen the association between protracted low-dose radiation and cancer risks, especially for breast cancers and leukemia, in this unique cohort population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hwang SL, Hwang JS, Yang YT, Hsieh WA, Chang TC, Guo HR, Tsai MH, Tang JL, Lin IF, Chang WP |title=Estimates of relative risks for cancers in a population after prolonged low-dose-rate radiation exposure: a follow-up assessment from 1983 to 2005 |journal=Radiation Research |volume=170 |issue=2 |pages=143–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18666807 |doi=10.1667/RR0732.1 |bibcode=2008RadR..170..143H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical and ionizing radiation combined{{anchor|Combined effects}}===
No experiment can be performed in perfect isolation. Thick lead shielding around a chemical dose experiment to rule out the effects of ionizing radiation is built and rigorously controlled for in the laboratory, and certainly not the field. Likewise the same applies for ionizing radiation studies. Ionizing radiation is released when an unstable particle releases radiation, creating two new substances and energy in the form of an [[electromagnetic wave]]. The resulting materials are then free to interact with any environmental elements, and the energy released can also be used as a catalyst in further ionizing radiation interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs371/en/|title=Ionizing radiation, health effects and protective measures|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting confusion in the low dose exposure field (radiation and chemical) arise from lack of consideration of this concept as described by Mothersill and Seymory.&lt;ref name=Mothersill&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mothersill C, Seymour C |title=Implications for environmental health of multiple stressors |journal=Journal of Radiological Protection |volume=29 |issue=2A |pages=A21–8 |year=2009 |pmid=19454807 |doi=10.1088/0952-4746/29/2A/S02 |bibcode = 2009JRP....29...21M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothersill and Seymory state "Most of the arguments about whether radiation is 'good for you' or 'bad for you' fail due to lack of consideration of the hierarchical level at which the effect occurs and because most of the arguments are [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]]. For example cell death is seen as a 'bad' effect but if it removes a potentially carcinogenic cell from the population of cells in a tissue it could prevent cancer starting and could be seen as 'good'."{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Controversy==
Whether hormesis is common or important is controversial. At least one peer-reviewed article accepts the idea, claiming that over 600 substances show a U-shaped [[dose-response]] relationship. Calaberese and Baldwin wrote: "One percent (195 out of 20,285) of the published articles contained 668 dose-response relationships that met the entry criteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calabrese EJ, Baldwin LA |title=The frequency of U-shaped dose responses in the toxicological literature |journal=Toxicological Sciences |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=330–8 |year=2001 |pmid=11452146 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/62.2.330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that low dose effects may be (sometimes strikingly) different is accepted, but that the low dose effect is positive is questionable.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The hypothesis of hormesis has generated the most controversy when applied to [[ionizing radiation]]. This theory is called [[radiation hormesis]]. For policy making purposes, the commonly accepted model of dose response in radiobiology is the [[linear no-threshold]] model (LNT), which assumes a strictly linear dependence between the risk of radiation-induced adverse health effects and radiation dose.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The [[United States National Research Council]] (part of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Committee to Assess Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, National Research Council |url=http://books.nap.edu/catalog/11340.html |title=Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR VII Phase 2 |year=2005 |publisher=National Academies Press |isbn=978-0-309-09156-5}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] (a body commissioned by the [[United States Congress]])&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-929600-69-7"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ncrppublications.org/index.cfm?fm=Product.AddToCart&amp;pid=6714063164 |title=Evaluation of the Linear-Nonthreshold Dose-Response Model for Ionizing Radiation |publisher=National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-929600-69-7}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Ionizing Radiation (UNSCEAR) all agree that radiation hormesis is not clearly shown, nor clearly the rule for radiation doses.

A report commissioned by the French National Academy concluded that there is sufficient evidence for hormesis occurring at low doses and that LNT should be reconsidered as the methodology used to estimate risks from low level sources of radiation, like [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]] for [[nuclear waste]].&lt;ref name="french"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.06.013 |title=Dose–effect relationship and estimation of the carcinogenic effects of low doses of ionizing radiation: The joint report of the Académie des Sciences (Paris) and of the Académie Nationale de Médecine |year=2005 |last1=Tubiana |first1=Maurice |journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=317–9 |pmid=16168825}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the United States-based [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] states that there is insufficient evidence for radiation hormesis and that radiation protection authorities should continue to apply the LNT model for purposes of risk estimation.&lt;ref name="ISBN 978-0-929600-69-7"/&gt;

This should be moved to Radiation hormesis; however it would be good to find another source, since the NRCP report is not freely available and I can't verify what exactly it says about RH.

They conclude that the [[linear no threshold model]] that is effective at high doses, and which predicts that the chance of causing cancer is always linearly proportional to the amount of radiation an individual receives, should be used at low doses too. The report squarely rejects almost all research showing radiation induced hormesis as being flawed in some way (e.g. the cancer a study focuses on does not exist in humans, a clear threshold could not be established in humans, the assumptions are seriously flawed, the hormetic effect is too short to be useful).

Radiation hormesis is not generally accepted by The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), its U.S. counterpart, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP), the National Research Council Committees on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (the BEIR Committees), or the U.S. regulatory agencies.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.hps.org/publicinformation/ate/q299.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{dead link}} "Information on hormesis"]. Health Physics Society.  Retrieved 26-Feb-2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|note: that ref is dead, and this: http://hps.org/documents/risk_ps010-1.pdf indicates that HPS does not accept LNT for estimation of risk for low doses; the document says that )

Reasons include:
*No well-documented long-term positive effects of hormetic concentrations of toxins.
*Hormesis is counterintuitive.
*Concern about [[publication bias]]; studies that show positive effects might be more likely to be published.
*While some toxins might indeed have different effects at low doses, it is not clear if the effects tend to be positive.}}
--&gt;

==Policy consequences==
Regulatory agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) traditionally use a [[linear no-threshold model]] for carcinogens (including radiation). In the linear model, the assumption is that there is no dosage that has no risk of causing cancer. While this linear approach remains the default {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}, with sufficient [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanistic evidence]] suggesting a non-linear dose-response, EPA allows for the derivation of a threshold dose (also known as reference dose) below which it is assumed that there is no risk for cancer.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

While proponents of hormesis argue that changing to a hormesis model would likely change exposure standards for these toxicants in [[air]], [[water]], [[food]] and [[soil]], making the standards less strict, other scientists point out that low dose stimulation can have extremely adverse effects. Similarly, low doses of the [[phthalate]] [[DEHP]] cause increased allergic responses to [[allergen]]s, while higher doses have no effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Wider use of the hormesis model would affect how scientists design and conduct studies and the selection of models that estimate risk. In all likelihood, recognizing that low dose effects can't be predicted from high dose experiments would force a strengthening of public health standards, not their weakening, as hormesis proponents would argue.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Hormesis remains largely unknown to the public. Any policy change ought to consider hormesis first as a public health issue (versus an industrial regulatory issue). This would include the assessment of the public concern regarding exposure to small toxic doses. In addition, impact of hormesis policy change upon the management of industrial risks should be studied.&lt;ref&gt;Poumadere, M. (2003).

'''Ideasthesia''' (alternative spelling '''ideaesthesia''') is defined as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes [[Modern Greek]] ''ἰδέα'' (idéa) and ''αἴσθησις'' (aísthēsis), meaning "sensing concepts" or "sensing ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for introducing the notion of ideasthesia was the problems with [[synesthesia]]. While "synesthesia" means "union of senses", [[empirical evidence]] indicated that this was an incorrect explanation of a set of phenomena traditionally covered by this heading. ''Syn-aesthesis'' denoting also "co-perceiving", implies the association of two sensory elements with little connection to the cognitive level. However, according to others,&lt;ref name = "Dixon et al 2006"&gt;Dixon, M.J., Smilek, D., Duffy, P.L., Zanna, P. M., Merikle, P. M.

Consciousness and Cognition, 61, 94-106.&lt;/ref&gt; most phenomena that have inadvertently been linked to synesthesia in fact are induced by the [[Semantics|semantic]] representations. That is, the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the stimulus is what is important rather than its sensory properties, as would be implied by the term synesthesia. In other words, while synesthesia presumes that both the trigger (inducer) and the resulting experience (concurrent) are of sensory nature, ideasthesia presumes that only the resulting experience is of sensory nature while the trigger is semantic. Meanwhile, the concept of ideasthesia developed into a theory of how we perceive and the research has extended to topics other than synesthesia &amp;mdash; as the concept of ideasthesia turned out applicable to our everyday [[perception]]. Ideasthesia has been even applied to the theory of art. Research on ideasthesia bears important implications for solving the mystery of human conscious [[qualia|experience]], which according to ideasthesia, is grounded in how we activate [[concepts]].&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and evidence==
[[File:Synesthesia 5.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration drawn by a synesthete showing her [[Number form|time unit - space synesthesia]]/ideasthesia: the months in a year are organized into a circle surrounding her body, each month having a fixed location in space and a unique color.]] A common example of synesthesia is the association between [[grapheme]]s and colors, usually referred to as [[grapheme-color synesthesia]]. Here, letters of the alphabet are associated with vivid experiences of color. Studies have indicated that the perceived color is context-dependent and is determined by the extracted meaning of a stimulus. For example, an ambiguous stimulus '5' that can be interpreted either as 'S' or '5' will have the color associated with 'S' or with '5', depending on the context in which it is presented. If presented among numbers, it will be interpreted as '5' and will associate the respective color. If presented among letters, it will be interpreted as 'S' and will associate the respective synesthetic color.&lt;ref name = "Dixon et al 2006"/&gt;

Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes also from the finding that colors can be flexibly associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited the colors of the corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.&lt;ref name = "Mroczko et al 2009"/&gt;

In another study, synesthetes were prompted to form novel synesthetic associations to graphemes never seen before. Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time too short to account for creation of new physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;Jürgens U.M., Nikolić D. (2012) Ideaesthesia: Conceptual processes assign similar colours to similar shapes. ''Translational Neuroscience'', 3(1): 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; pointing again towards ideasthesia.

For [[lexical-gustatory synesthesia]] evidence also points towards ideasthesia: In lexical-gustatory synesthesia, verbalisation of the stimulus is not necessary for the experience of concurrents. Instead, it is sufficient to activate the concept.&lt;ref name = "Simner Ward 2006"/&gt;

Another case of synesthesia is swimming-style synesthesia in which each swimming style is associated with a vivid experience of a color.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic et al 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, Aleksandra, and Markus Werning. Synesthesia, sensory-motor contingency, and semantic emulation: how swimming style-color synesthesia challenges the traditional view of synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Psychology'' 3 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, C. (2014). Great myths of the brain. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that grapheme-color synesthesia for [[Gemination|geminate consonants]] provides also evidence for ideasthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, D.F., Hawco C.L.A. (2015) Geminate consonant grapheme-colour synaesthesia (ideaesthesia). ''BMC Neurology'', 15:112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In pitch-color synesthesia, the same tone will be associated with different colors depending on how it has been named; do-sharp will have colors similar to do (e.g., a reddish  color) and re-flat will have color similar to that of re (e.g., yellowish), although the two classes refer to one the same tone.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, K., Sakata, H., Kwee, I. L., &amp; Nakada, T. (2017). Musical pitch classes have rainbow hues in pitch class-color synesthesia. Scientific reports, 7(1), 17781.&lt;/ref&gt;

''One-shot synesthesia'': There are synesthetic experiences that can occur just once in lifetime, and are dubbed one-shot synesthesia. Investigation of such cases has indicated that such unique experiences typically occur when a synesthete is involved in an intensive mental and emotional activity such as making important plans for future or reflecting on their life. It has been thus concluded that this is also a form of ideasthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschner, A., &amp; Nikolić, D. (2017). One-shot synesthesia. Translational Neuroscience, 8(1), 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In normal perception==
[[Image:Booba-Kiki.svg|thumb|right|Which one would be called Bouba and which Kiki? Responses are highly consistent among people. This is an example of ideasthesia as the conceptualization of the stimulus plays an important role.]]Recently, it has been suggested that the [[Bouba/kiki effect|Bouba/Kiki]] phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.''  20(1-2): pp. 84-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shukla, A. (2016). The Kiki-Bouba paradigm: Where senses meet and greet. Indian Journal of Mental Health, 3(3), 240-252.&lt;/ref&gt; Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba.&lt;ref name = Kohler1929&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1929 | title = Gestalt Psychology. | location = New York | publisher = Liveright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rama2001"&gt;Ramachandran, VS &amp; Hubbard, EM (2001) Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 8(12): 3–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001" /&gt; For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milán, Emilio Gómez, Oscar Iborra Martínez, and María José de Córdoba Serrano. El Universo Kiki-Bouba: Ideaestesia, Empatía y Neuromárketing. Fundación Internacional artecittà, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Charles, and Ophelia Deroy. On the shapes of flavours: A review of four hypotheses. ''Theoria et Historia Scientiarum'' 10 (2014): 207-238.&lt;/ref&gt; These semantic-like relations play a role in successful marketing; the name of a product should match its other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Bridger, D. (2015). Decoding the irrational consumer: How to commission, run and generate insights from neuromarketing research. Kogan Page Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for development of synesthesia==
The concept of ideasthesia bears implications for understanding [[Developmental psychology|how synesthesia develops]] in children. Synesthetic children may associate concrete sensory-like experiences primarily to the abstract concepts that they have otherwise difficulties dealing with.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"/&gt; Synesthesia may thus be used as a cognitive tool to cope with the abstractness of the learning materials imposed by the educational system &amp;mdash; referred to also as a "semantic vacuum hypothesis". This hypothesis explains why the most common inducers in synesthesia are graphemes and time units &amp;mdash; both relating to the first truly abstract ideas that a child needs to master.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, B., &amp; Caramazza, A. (1997). From graphemes to abstract letter shapes: levels of representation in written spelling. Journal of experimental psychology: human perception and performance, 23(4), 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for art theory==
The concept of ideasthesia has been often discussed in relation to art,&lt;ref&gt;Gsöllpointner, Katharina. "DIE KUNST DER SINNE–DIE SINNE DER KUNST." Exploring Cybernetics: Kybernetik im interdisziplinären Diskurs (2015): 137-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albertazzi, Liliana, et al. "The hue of angles—was Kandinsky right?." Art &amp; Perception 3.1 (2015): 81-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mărginaş, Raluca. "The Spurious Case of Synesthesia in the Popular Arts." Ekphrasis 1 (2012): 144-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A. (2017). Hendrick ter Brugghen's Musicians and the Engagement of the Viewer. Temple University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prendergast, J. (2018). Grinding the moor–ideasthesia and narrative. New Writing, 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and also used to formulate a psychological theory of art.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic Art"&gt;Nikolić D. (2016) Ideasthesia and art. In: Gsöllpointner, Katharina, et al. (eds.). 2016. Digital Synesthesia. A Model for the Aesthetics of Digital Art. Berlin/Boston: De Gruyter (http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/print/11666)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, we consider something to be a piece of art when experiences induced by the piece are accurately balanced with semantics induced by the same piece. Thus, a piece of art makes us both strongly think and strongly experience. Moreover, the two must be perfectly balanced such that the most salient stimulus or event is both the one that evokes strongest experiences (fear, joy, ... ) and strongest cognition (recall, memory, ...) &amp;mdash; in other words, ''idea'' is well balanced with ''aesthesia''.

Ideasthesia theory of art may be used for psychological studies of [[aesthetics]]. It may also help explain [[classificatory disputes about art]] as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic Art"/&gt; There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.

==Neurophysiology of ideasthesia==
Ideasthesia is congruent with the theory of brain functioning known as [[practopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;van Leeuwen, T. M., Singer, W., &amp; Nikolić, D. (2015). The merit of synesthesia for consciousness research. Frontiers in psychology, 6, 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;. According to that theory, concepts are not an emergent property of highly developed, specialized neuronal networks in the brain, as is usually assumed; rather, concepts are proposed to be fundamental to the very adaptive principles by which living systems and the brain operate.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2015). Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 373, 40-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Marcello Benedetto.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Benedetto Marcello]]

'''''Il teatro alla moda''''' (The Fashionable Theater) is a satirical pamphlet in which its author, the Venetian composer [[Benedetto Marcello]] (1686–1739), vents his critical opinions on the ''milieu'' of the Italian ''[[opera seria]]'' in the first decades of the eighteenth century. It was first published anonymously in [[Venice]], by the end of 1720. Virtually every aspect of ''opera seria'' and its social environment is mercilessly criticized by Marcello: the [[artificiality]] of plots, the stereotyped format of music, the extravagant scenography and machinery, the inability and venality of composers and poets, the vanity and vulgarity of singers, the avidity of impresarios, the ineptitude of musicians.

The full title reads "THE FASHIONABLE THEATER – OR – safe and easy METHOD for correctly composing and performing Italian OPERAS in the modern style, – In which – useful and necessary Advice is given to Librettists, Composers, Musicians of both sexes, Impresarios, Performers, Engineers, and Scene Painters, comic Characters, Tailors, Pages, Dancers, Prompters, Copyists, Protectors, and MOTHERS of female Virtuoso singers, &amp; other People belonging to Theater." In fact, ''Il teatro alla moda'' is written as a series of chapters where advice is ironically given to the various people involved in operatic productions, in order to meet "the modern customs" and bizarre requirements of such theatrical events.

Besides the title, the frontispiece contains several allusions to well-known protagonists of the Venetian theater of the time. For instance, the publisher's name "Aldiviva Licante" refers, by means of anagrams, both to [[Antonio Vivaldi]], then very famous as an opera composer, and to the singer [[Caterina Canteli]].

The text of ''Il teatro alla moda'' displays several striking features. To begin with, it shows a degree of vacillation in attitude toward its subject — perhaps resulting from Marcello's personal ambivalence regarding operatic music, as both a critic and a composer. For example, the dedicatory is by "the author of the book to its composer." In addition, it exhibits a number of surrealistic elements, which reach a climax in the last chapter, "The Raffle" (presumably organized by the mother of a young female singer), where the prizes include "a full dress of modern poet in fever-colored tree bark, wrapped with metaphors, translations, hyperboles" as well as "the pen that wrote ''Il teatro alla moda''." The printing accompanies these peculiarities with a chaotic use of italic and normal typography and of capital fonts.

==Translated excerpts (typography preserved)==

"To the Poets – In the first place, the ''modern'' Poet should not have read and should never read the ancient Authors, ''Latin'' or ''Greek''. And this is because the ancient ''Greeks'' or ''Latins'' have never read the ''moderns''."

"To the Music Composers – The ''modern'' Music Composer should possess no knowledge about the ''Rules'' of good composition, except for some principle of universal practice... He should not understand the ''numeric Musical Proportions'', nor the optimal effect  of ''contrary Motions'', or the ''bad Relation'' of ''Tritones'' and ''augmented Intervals''."
 
"To the Singers – It is not necessary that the VIRTUOSO can ''read'', or ''write'', or have a ''good pronunciation of vowels, and of single and double Consonants, or understand the sense of Words'', etc., but it is better if he mistakes ''Senses, Letters, Syllables'', etc., in order to perform ''Ornaments, Trills, Appoggiature, very long Cadences'', etc. etc. etc."

"To the Mothers of Female Singers – When the ''Girls'' have an audition with the Impresario, ''they'' (the mothers) ''will move the mouth with them'', will ''prompt'' them the usual ''Ornaments'' and ''Trills'' and, asked about the age of the ''Virtuosa'', will cut down at least ''ten years''."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''India State Hunger Index''' ('''ISHI''') is a tool to calculate [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]] at the regional level in [[India]]. It is constructed in the same fashion as the [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) 2008 and was calculated for 17 states in India, covering more than 95 percent of the population. 

The ISHI was developed by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) and presented for the first time 2008 in conjunction with the [[Non-Governmental Organization]] [[Welthungerhilfe]] and the Department of Economics, [[University of California]].

== Background ==

Despite the good economic performance, with over 200 million people who are [[food security|food insecure]], India is home to the largest number of hungry people in the world. In the ranking of the [[Global Hunger Index]] 2017 it covers position 100 out of 119 ranked countries and has an “serious“ (31.4) [[food security]] situation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ishi08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The major problem in the country is the high prevalence of [[underweight]] children under five, which is a result of low nutrition and educational status of women. 

While there has been attention to hunger and [[undernourishment]] at the central level, within India's political system, states are important political units with regard to the planning and execution of development programs. Thus unpacking the hunger index at the level of the  federal states is an important tool to build awareness of the disparities in hunger among them. In addition, the variability of the relative contribution of the underlying components of the hunger index across the different Indian states can help to stimulate the discussion about the drivers of hunger in different state contexts.

==Indicators and underlying data==

The ISHI is constructed in the same fashion as the [[Global Hunger Index]] which follows a multidimensional approach to measuring hunger and [[malnutrition]]. It combines three equally weighted indicators:

# the proportion of undernourished as a percentage of the population (reflecting the share of the population with insufficient dietary intake);
# the prevalence of [[underweight]] children under the age of five (indicating the proportion of children suffering from weight loss and / or reduced growth); and 
# the [[child mortality|mortality rate of children]] under the age of five (partially reflecting the fatal synergy between dietary intake and unhealthy environments).

The ISHI uses two data sources for the estimation of the Indian state level: These are the first rounds of the National Family Health Survey (2005–2006) for India and the National Sample Survey data from 2004 to 2005. It is calculated and presented for 17 major states, covering 95 percent of the country's population. While the National Family Health Survey has a large enough sample size to yield representative estimates of the child [[underweight]] and mortality rates even for the smaller states and union territories in the country, the sample size of the National Sample Survey is insufficient for estimating undernourishment rates in these places. Therefore, the ISHI restricts the sample to those states for which it yields precise states level estimates.

== Key findings ==

*ISHI 2008 scores for Indian states range from 13.6 (“serious”) for [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to 30.9 (“extremely alarming”) for [[Madhya Pradesh]], indicating substantial variability among states in India. Punjab is ranked 34th when compared to the GHI 2008 worldwide country ranking, while Madhya Pradesh is ranked 82nd. In this state more people suffer from hunger than in Ethiopia or Sudan. 60 percent of the children are undernourished.
*All 17 states have ISHI scores that are well above the “low” and “moderate” hunger categories. Twelve of the 17 states fall into the “alarming” category, and one into the “extremely alarming” category.
*ISHI scores are closely aligned with poverty, but there is little association with state level economic growth. High levels of hunger are seen in states that are performing well from an economic perspective.
*Inclusive economic growth and targeted strategies to ensure food sufficiency reduce child mortality and improve child nutrition are urgent priorities for all states in India.

[[Image:Restoration.jpg|350px|thumb|right|Original and restored image.]]

'''Inpainting''' is the process of [[image reconstruction|reconstructing]] lost or deteriorated parts of [[Digital image|images]] and [[Digital video|videos]]. In the museum world, in the case of a valuable painting, this task would be carried out by a skilled art [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] or art restorer. In the digital world, inpainting (also known as ''image interpolation'' or ''video interpolation'') refers to the application of sophisticated [[algorithm]]s to replace lost or corrupted parts of the image data (mainly small regions or to remove small defects).

== Applications ==
There are many objectives and applications of this technique.

In [[photography]] and [[Film|cinema]], is used for [[film restoration]]; to reverse the deterioration (e.g., cracks in photographs or scratches and dust spots in film; see [[infrared cleaning]]). It is also used for removing [[red eye effect|red-eye]], the stamped date from photographs and removing objects to creative effect.

This technique can be used to replace the lost blocks in the coding and transmission of images, for example, in a [[streaming video]]. It can also be used to remove logos in videos.

[[Deep learning]] [[neural network]] based inpainting can be used for decensoring images.&lt;ref name="urlThis Researcher Created ‘DeepCreamPy,’ a Machine Learning Algorithm That Uncensors Hentai - Motherboard"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/43ekxg/machine-learning-algorithm-that-uncensors-hentai-porn-deepcreampy |title=This Researcher Created ‘DeepCreamPy,’ a Machine Learning Algorithm That Uncensors Hentai - Motherboard |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
=== In painting ===
Inpainting is rooted in the restoration of images. Traditionally, inpainting has been done by professional restorers. The underlying methodology of their work is as follows:
* The global picture determines how to fill in the gap. The purpose of inpainting is to restore the unity of the work.
* The structure of the gap surroundings is supposed to be continued into the gap. Contour lines that arrive at the gap boundary are prolonged into the gap.
* The different regions inside a gap, as defined by the contour lines, are filled with colors matching for those of its boundary.
* The small details are painted, i.e. “texture” is added.

=== Computerized ===
Since the wide applications of digital camera and the digitalization of old photos, inpainting has become an automatic process that is performed on digital images. More than scratch removing, the inpainting techniques are also applied to object removal, text removal and other automatic modifications of images and videos. Furthermore, they can also be observed in applications like [[image compression]] and [[super resolution]].

Three main groups of 2D image inpainting algorithms can be found in literature. The first one to be noted is structural inpainting, the second one is texture inpainting and the last one is a combination of these two techniques. All these inpainting methods have one thing in common - they use the information of the known or undestroyed image areas in order to fill the gap.

==== Structural inpainting ====
Structural inpainting uses geometric approaches{{clarify|post-text=(What is does "geometric approaches" mean in this context?)|date=November 2018}} for filling in the missing information in the region which should be inpainted. These algorithms focus on the consistency of the geometric structure.{{clarify|post-text=(What is "the geometric structure" referred to?)|date=November 2018}}

==== Textural inpainting ====
Like everything else the structural inpainting methods have both advantages and disadvantages. The main problem is that all the structural inpainting methods are not able to restore texture. Texture has a repetitive pattern which means that a missing portion cannot be restored by continuing the level lines into the gap.{{clarify|post-text=(What are "level lines"?)|date=November 2018}}

==== Combined structural and textural inpainting ====
Combined structural and textural inpainting approaches simultaneously try to perform texture and structure filling in regions of missing image information.
Most parts of an image consist of texture and structure. The boundaries between image regions accumulate structural information which is a complex phenomenon.{{clarify|post-text=(What does it mean that boundaries "accumulate information"?)|date=November 2018}} This is the result when blending different textures together. That is why, the state of the art inpainting method attempts to combine structural and textural inpainting.

A more traditional method is to use [[differential equation]]s (such as the [[Laplace's equation]]) with Dirichlet boundary conditions for continuity (a seamless fit).{{clarify|post-text=(What is a Dirichlet boundary and how does it make something a seamless fit, and what is a seamless fit in this context?)|date=November 2018}} This works well if missing information lies within the homogeneous portion of an object area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Other methods follow [[Contour line|isophote]] directions (in an image, a contour of equal luminance), to do the inpainting.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bertalmío, G. Sapiro, V. Caselles and C. Ballester., "Image Inpainting", Proceedings of SIGGRAPH 2000, New Orleans, USA, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Model based inpainting follows the Bayesian approach for which missing information is best fitted or estimated from the combination of the models of the underlying images as well as the image data actually being observed. In deterministic language, this has led to various variational inpainting models.{{clarify|post-text=(Please rewrite this sentence in plain English.)|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Chan and J. Shen, "Mathematical Models for Local Nontexture Inpainting", SIAM J. Applied Math., 62(3), 2001, 1019-1043.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manual computer methods include using a [[clone tool]] or healing tool,{{clarify|post-text=(What is a healing tool?)|date=November 2018}} to copy existing parts of the image to restore a damaged texture. [[Texture synthesis]] may also be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture_replace/ Image Replacement through Texture Synthesis], Homan Igehy and Lucas Pereira, Stanford University, Appears in the Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing&lt;/ref&gt;

Exemplar-based image inpainting attempts to automate the clone tool process.  It fills "holes" in the image by searching for similar patches in a nearby source region of the image, and copying the pixels from the most similar patch into the hole.  By performing the fill at the patch level as opposed to the pixel level, the algorithm reduces blurring artifacts caused by prior techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/CVPR.2003.1211538 Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Inpainting], Criminisi, A, Perez, P., &amp; Toyama, K., Appears in the Proceedings of the 2003 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5766709&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;searchField%3DSearch_All%26queryText%3Dlorenzi+melgani Inpainting Strategies for Reconstruction of Missing Data in VHR Images], L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="61268">'''Library science''' (often termed '''library studies''', '''bibliothecography''', '''library economy''')&lt;ref name=note/&gt; is an [[interdisciplinary]] or [[Multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of [[management]], [[information technology]], [[education]], and other areas to [[library|libraries]]; the collection, organization, [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]], and [[dissemination]] of information resources; and the [[political economy]] of information. [[Martin Schrettinger]], a Bavarian librarian, coined the discipline within his work (1808–1828) ''Versuch eines vollständigen Lehrbuchs der Bibliothek-Wissenschaft oder Anleitung zur vollkommenen Geschäftsführung eines Bibliothekars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz79181.html|title=Deutsche Biographie –  Schrettinger, Martin|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than classifying information based on nature-oriented elements, as was previously done in his Bavarian library, Schrettinger organized books in alphabetical order.&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, M (2005, June 12). Information schools: a monk, library science, and the information age. Retrieved from http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/huminfo.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The first American school for library science was founded by [[Melvil Dewey]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1887.&lt;ref name=oclc/&gt;&lt;ref name=deutsche/&gt;

Historically, library science has also included [[archival science]].&lt;ref name=harris/&gt; This includes how information resources are organized to serve the needs of select user groups, how people interact with classification systems and technology, how information is acquired, evaluated and applied by people in and outside libraries as well as cross-culturally, how people are trained and educated for careers in libraries, the [[ethics]] that guide library service and organization, the legal status of libraries and information resources, and the applied science of computer technology used in documentation and [[records management]].

There is no generally agreed-upon distinction between the terms ''library science'',and ''librarianship'', and to a certain extent they are interchangeable, perhaps differing most significantly in connotation. The term ''[[library science or library studies]]'' (LIS) is most often used;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/faq|title= Accreditation Frequently Asked Questions:What is the difference between the MLS, the MILS, the MLIS, etc.?|date=2017 |website=American Library Association |publisher=American Library Association|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; most librarians consider it as only a terminological variation, intended to emphasize the scientific and technical foundations of the subject and its relationship with information science. LIS should not be confused with [[information theory]], the mathematical study of the concept of information. ''Library philosophy'' has been contrasted with ''library science'' as the study of the aims and justifications of librarianship as opposed to the development and refinement of techniques.&lt;ref name=cossette/&gt;

==History==
{{globalize/US|date=November 2016}}

===17th century===
[[File:Gabriel Naude.jpg|thumbnail|Portrait of [[Gabriel Naudé]], author of ''Advis pour dresser une bibliothèque'' (1627), later translated into English in 1661]]

The earliest text on library operations, ''Advice on Establishing a Library'' was published in 1627 by French librarian and scholar [[Gabriel Naudé]].
Naudé wrote prolifically, producing works on many subjects including politics, religion, history, and the supernatural. He put into practice all the ideas put forth in ''Advice'' when given the opportunity to build and maintain the library of [[Cardinal Mazarin|Cardinal Jules Mazarin]].

===19th century===
[[File:Dewey relatv index.png|thumbnail]]
[[Martin Schrettinger]] wrote the second textbook (the first in Germany) on the subject from 1808 to 1829.

[[Thomas Jefferson]], whose library at [[Monticello]] consisted of thousands of books, devised a classification system inspired by the [[Baconian method]], which grouped books more or less by subject rather than alphabetically, as it was previously done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emblidge|first=D.|date=2014|title='Bibliomany has possessed me': Thomas Jefferson, the booksellers' customer extraordinaire|url=|journal=The International Journal of the Book |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=17–41 |doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jefferson collection provided the start of what became the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

The first American school of librarianship opened at [[Columbia University]] under the leadership of [[Melvil Dewey]], noted for his [[Dewey Decimal Classification|1876 decimal classification]], on 5 January 1887 as the School of Library Economy. The term ''library economy'' was common in the U.S. until 1942, with the ''library science'' predominant through much of the 20th century.

===20th century===
Later, the term was used in the title of [[S. R. Ranganathan]]'s ''The Five Laws of Library Science'', published in 1931, and in the title of [[Lee Pierce Butler]]'s 1933 book, ''An introduction to library science'' (University of Chicago Press).

S. R. Ranganathan conceived the [[five laws of library science]] and the development of the first major analytico-synthetic classification system, the [[colon classification]].&lt;ref name=rangan/&gt; In India, he is considered to be the father of library science, documentation, and information science and is widely known throughout the rest of the world for his fundamental thinking in the field.

In the United States, Lee Pierce Butler's new approach advocated research using [[quantitative research|quantitative methods]] and ideas in the [[social sciences]] with the aim of using librarianship to address society's information needs. He was one of the first faculty at the [[University of Chicago Graduate Library School]], which changed the structure and focus of education for librarianship in the twentieth century. This research agenda went against the more procedure-based approach of "library economy," which was mostly confined to practical problems in the administration of libraries.

[[William Stetson Merrill]]'s ''A Code for Classifiers'', released in several editions from 1914 to 1939,&lt;ref name=codef/&gt; is an example of a more pragmatic approach, where arguments stemming from in-depth knowledge about each field of study are employed to recommend a system of classification. While Ranganathan's approach was philosophical it was also tied more to the day-to-day business of running a library. A reworking of Ranganathan's laws was published in 1995 which removes the constant references to books. [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Michael Gorman]]'s ''Our Enduring Values: Librarianship in the 21st Century'' features his eight principles necessary by library professionals and incorporate knowledge and information in all their forms, allowing for digital information to be considered.

In more recent years, with the growth of digital technology, the field has been greatly influenced by information science concepts. In the English speaking world the term "library science" seems to have been used for the first time in India&lt;ref&gt;Anwar, Mumtaz A. [http://cybra.p.lodz.pl/Content/1175/vol01no2/anwar_v01n2.html The Pioneers: Asa Don Dickinson]. ''World Libraries''. 1990–1991. Retrieved 1 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1916 book ''Punjab Library Primer'', written by Asa Don Dickinson and published by the [[University of the Punjab]], Lahore, Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, Asa D. [https://archive.org/details/punjablibrarypri00dickuoft Punjab Library Primer]. University of Panjab. 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; This university was the first in Asia to begin teaching "library science". The ''Punjab Library Primer'' was the first textbook on library science published in English anywhere in the world. The first textbook in the United States was the ''Manual of Library Economy'', published in 1929. In 1923, [[C. C. Williamson]], who was appointed by the Carnegie Corporation, published an assessment of library science education entitled "The Williamson Report," which designated that universities should provide library science training.&lt;ref name=rubin/&gt; This report had a significant impact on library science training and education. Library research and practical work, the area of information science, has remained largely distinct both in training and in research interests.

===21st century===
The digital age has transformed how information is accessed and retrieved. "The library is now a part of a complex and dynamic educational, recreational, and informational infrastructure."&lt;ref name=rubin2/&gt; Mobile devices and applications with wireless networking, high-speed computers and networks, and the computing cloud have deeply impacted and developed information science and information services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hu|first1=Sharon|title=Technology impacts on curriculum of library science (LIS) – a United States (US) perspective|journal=LIBRES: Library &amp; Information Science Research Electronic Journal|date=2013|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1–9|url=http://libres.curtin.edu.au/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the library sciences maintains its mission of access equity and community space, as well as the new means for information retrieval called information literacy skills. All catalogues, databases, and a growing number of books are all available on the Internet. In addition, the expanding free access to open source journals and sources such as Wikipedia have fundamentally impacted how information is accessed. [[Information literacy]] is the ability to "determine the extent of information needed, access the needed information effectively and efficiently, evaluate information and its sources critically, incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base, use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose, and understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information ethically and legally."&lt;ref name=ala/&gt;

== Education and Training ==
{{main|Education for librarianship}}

Academic courses in library science include [[Librarian#Librarian roles and duties|collection management]], information systems and technology, research methods, [[information literacy]], [[Library catalog|cataloging]] and [[library classification|classification]], [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|preservation]], [[Librarian#Librarian roles and duties|reference]], [[statistics]] and [[management]]. Library science is constantly evolving, incorporating new topics like [[database management system|database management]], [[information architecture]] and [[information management]], among others. With the mounting acceptance of Wikipedia as a valued and reliable reference source, many libraries, museums and archives have introduced the role of [[Wikipedian in residence]]. As a result, some universities are including coursework relating to Wikipedia and Knowledge Management in their MLIS programs.

Most schools in the US only offer a master's degree in library science or an MLIS and do not offer an undergraduate degree in the subject. About fifty schools have this graduate program, and seven are still being ranked. Many have online programs, which makes attending more convenient if the college is not in a student's immediate vicinity. According to ''US News''{{'}} online journal, University of Illinois is at the top of the list of best MLIS programs provided by universities. Second is University of North Carolina and third is University of Washington. All the listings can be found [http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings here.]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. News. (2014). Education. Retrieved From: http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most professional library jobs require a professional post-baccalaureate degree in library science, or one of its equivalent terms. In the United States and [[Canada]] the certification usually comes from a master's degree granted by an [[American Library Association|ALA]]-accredited institution, so even non-scholarly librarians have an originally academic background. In the United Kingdom, however, there have been moves to broaden the entry requirements to professional library posts, such that qualifications in, or experience of, a number of other disciplines have become more acceptable. In Australia, a number of institutions offer degrees accepted by the [[Australian Library and Information Association|ALIA (Australian Library and Information Association)]]. Global standards of accreditation or certification in librarianship have yet to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library Journal]]. (2016). "Librarians need Global Credentials". Retrieved from: http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2016/04/opinion/backtalk/librarians-need-global-credentials-backtalk&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[academic regalia in the United States]], the color for library science is [[lemon (color)|lemon]].

The Master of Library Science (MLIS) is the master's degree that is required for most professional librarian positions in the United States and Canada. The MLIS is a relatively recent degree; an older and still common degree designation for librarians to acquire is the Master of Library Science (MLS), or Master of Science in Library Science (MSLS) degree. According to the American Library Association (ALA), "The master’s degree in library and information studies is frequently referred to as the MLS; however, ALA-accredited degrees have various names such as Master of Arts, Master of Librarianship, Master of Library and Information Studies, or Master of Science. The degree name is determined by the program. The [ALA] Committee for Accreditation evaluates programs based on their adherence to the Standards for Accreditation of Master's Programs in Library and Information Studies, not based on the name of the degree

==Employment Outlook and Opportunities==
According to 'U.S. News &amp; World Report', library and information science ranked as one of the "Best Careers of 2008."&lt;ref name=usnews/&gt; The median annual salary for 2017 was reported by the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] as $58,520 in the United States.&lt;ref name="bls-2017"/&gt; Additional salary breakdowns available by metropolitan area show that the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]-[[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]-[[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] metropolitan area has the highest average salary at $86,380.&lt;ref name="bls-geographical breakdown"/&gt;  In December 2016, the BLS projected growth for the field at "9 percent between 2016 and 2026", which is "as fast as the average for all occupations".&lt;ref name="bls-2017"/&gt; The 2010-2011 Occupational Outlook Handbook states, "Workers in this occupation tend to be older than workers in the rest of the economy. As a result, there may be more workers retiring from this occupation than other occupations. However, relatively large numbers of graduates from MLS programs may cause competition in some areas and for some jobs."&lt;ref name="OOH-2010-11"/&gt;

==Gender and library science in the United States==
{{see also|Timeline of women in library science|Timeline of women in library science in the United States}}
Librarianship manifests a dual career structure for men and women in the United States. While the ratio of female to male librarians remains roughly 4:1,&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt;&lt;ref name=wiebe/&gt; top positions are more often held by men. In large academic libraries, there is less of a discrepancy; however, overall, throughout the profession, men tend to hold higher or leadership positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mestrovic Deyrup|first1=Marta|title=Is the Revolution Over? Gender, Economic and Professional Parity in Academic Library Leadership Positions|journal=College and Research Libraries|date=May 2004|volume=65|pages=242–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, however, have made continuous progress toward equality.&lt;ref name=wiebel/&gt; Women have also been largely left out of standard histories of U.S. librarianship, but Suzanne Hildenbrand's scholarly assessment of the work done by women has expanded the historical record.&lt;ref name=hilden/&gt; See also ''The Role of women in librarianship, 1876–1976: the entry, advancement, and struggle for equalization in one profession'', by Kathleen Weibel, Kathleen de la Peña McCook, and Dianne J. Ellsworth (1979), Phoenix, Ariz: Oryx Press.

=== Gender equality and library leadership ===
There was a "Women's Meeting" at the 1882 14th American Libraries Conference, where issues concerning the salaries of women librarians and what female patrons do in reading rooms were discussed.

During the first 35 years of the [[American Library Association]] its presidency was held by men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALA's Past Presidents|url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history/past}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 [[Theresa Elmendorf]] became the first woman elected president of the ALA.&lt;ref name=thomison/&gt; She was ALA president from May 24, 1911, until July 2, 1912.&lt;ref name=ala2/&gt;

In 1919, an ALA resolution promoting equal pay and opportunities for women in librarianship was defeated by a large margin.

In 1970, Betty Wilson brought forth a resolution that would have had the ALA refrain from using facilities that discriminate against women. That resolution was also defeated by the membership.&lt;ref name="WomenArisen"&gt;Schuman, P., &amp; Weibel, K.(1979).The Women Arisen.American Libraries, 10(6), 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the ALA took a stand for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The organization stated that they would no longer hold conferences in states that did not ratify the amendment, with the boycott measure set to take place in 1981.&lt;ref name="LibERA"&gt;Librarians for ERA. (1982). Wilson Library Bulletin, 57289-312.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WomenAlabama"&gt;ALA women's rights stand: Alabama warns of impact. (1977). Library Journal, 102(18), 2105.&lt;/ref&gt; An ERA Task Force was formed in 1979 towards this goal and a sum of $25,000 was allocated towards task force operations in unratified states. At the time, a number of state library associations passed pro-ERA resolutions and formed committees on women in libraries.&lt;ref name="LibERA" /&gt;

In 2013–2014, 82% of graduates in Master of Library Science (MLS) programs were female.&lt;ref&gt;http://dpeaflcio.org/programs-publications/issue-fact-sheets/library-workers-facts-figures/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2016, [[Carla Hayden]] became the first female [[Librarian of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/9/14/12916522/carla-hayden-librarian-of-congress |title=Carla Hayden is officially sworn in as the first woman and African-American librarian of Congress |publisher=Vox |date=2016|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional association groups dedicated to librarianship and gender ===
There are multiple groups within the American Library Association, dedicated to discussing, critiquing, and furthering gender-related and feminist issues within the profession.

In 1969 the first women's rights task force was founded: the National Women's Liberation Front for Librarians (NWFFL or New-Waffle). It was also in 1969 that children's librarians, after being unable to find children's books that included working mothers, worked to remedy the situation and succeeded in their efforts.

The American Library Association's Social Responsibilities Round Table Feminist Task Force (FTF) was founded in 1970 by women who wished to address sexism in libraries and librarianship.&lt;ref name="libr.org"/&gt; FTF was the first ALA group to focus on women's issues.&lt;ref name="libr.org"/&gt; In recent years during Women's History Month (March), the FTF has dedicated their efforts to expanding women’s library history online, using the website Women of Library History.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womenoflibraryhistory.tumblr.com/ Women of Library History]&lt;/ref&gt; The FTF also publishes the annual Amelia Bloomer Project list,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ameliabloomer.wordpress.com/ Amelia Bloomer Project list]&lt;/ref&gt; which includes some of the best feminist young adult literature of the year.

The Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship (COSWL) of the American Library Association,&lt;ref name=ala3/&gt; founded in 1976, represents the diversity of women's interest within ALA and ensures that the Association considers the rights of the majority (women) in the library field, and promotes and initiates the collection, analysis, dissemination, and coordination of information on the status of women in librarianship. The bibliographic history of women in U.S. librarianship and women librarians developing services for women has been well-documented in the series of publications initially issued by the Social Responsibilities Round Table Task Force on Women and later continued by COSWL.&lt;ref name=mess/&gt;

The ALA also has the Women &amp; Gender Studies Section (WGSS) of its Division "Association of College &amp; Research Libraries"; this section was formed to discuss, promote, and support women's studies collections and services in academic and research libraries.&lt;ref name=libr/&gt;

Finally, the ALA has the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Roundtable (GLBTRT). While the GLBTRT deals with sexuality, different than gender identity, much of the roundtable’s work is arguably feminist in nature, and concerned with issues of gender. The GLBTRT is committed to serving the information needs of the GLBT professional library community, and the GLBT information and access needs of individuals at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALA GLBT Roundtable|url=http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/glbtrt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Library science scholarship relating to issues of gender ===

Many scholars within the profession have taken up gender and its relationship to the discipline of library and information science. Scholars like [[Hope A. Olson]] and [[Sanford Berman]] have directed efforts at the problematic nature of [[cataloging]] and classification standards and schemes that are obscuring or exclusionary to marginalized groups. Others have written about the implications of gendered stereotypes in librarianship, particularly as they relate to [[library instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pagowski|first1=Nicole|last2=DeFrain|first2=Erica|title=Ice Ice Baby: Are Librarian Stereotypes Freezing Us out of Instruction|url=http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2014/ice-ice-baby-2/|website=In the Library with the Lead Pipe|publisher=In the Library with the Lead Pipe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Library instruction]] also intersects with [[feminist pedagogy]], and scholars such as Maria Accardi have written about feminist pedagogical practices in libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Accardi|first1=Maria|title=Feminist Pedagogy for Library Instruction|date=July 2013|publisher=Library Juice Press|isbn=978-1-936117-55-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Library scholars have also dealt with issues of gender and leadership, having equitable gender representation in library collection development, and issues of gender and young adult and children’s librarianship.

=== Library policies relating to issues of gender ===
The ALA Policy Manual states under ''B.2.1.15 Access to Library Resources and Services Regardless of Sex, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, or Sexual Orientation (Old Number 53.1.15):'' "The American Library Association stringently and unequivocally maintains that libraries and librarians have an obligation to resist efforts that systematically exclude materials dealing with any subject matter, including sex, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation. The Association also encourages librarians to proactively support the First Amendment rights of all library users, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. Adopted 1993, amended 2000, 2004, 2008, 2010." &lt;ref name=ala5/&gt; It also states under ''B.2.12 Threats to Library Materials Related to Sex, Gender Identity, or Sexual Orientation (Old Number 53.12)'', "The American Library Association supports the inclusion in library collections of materials that reflect the diversity of our society, including those related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression. ALA encourages all American Library Association chapters to take active stands against all legislative or other government attempts to proscribe materials related to sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression; and encourages all libraries to acquire and make available materials representative of all the people in our society. Adopted 2005, Amended 2009, 2010." &lt;ref name=ala6/&gt;

==Diversity in librarianship==
{{see also|Libraries and the LGBTQ community}}
The field of library science seeks to provide a diverse working environment in libraries across the United States. Ways to change the status quo include diversifying the job field with regards to age, class, disabilities, ethnicity, gender identity, race, sex, and sexual orientation. The demographics of America are changing; those who were once minorities will become the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Qallaf, C. L. &amp; Mika, J. J. (2013). The Role of Multiculturalism and Diversity in Library and Information science: LIS Education and the Job Market. Libri: International Journal of Libraries &amp; Information Services. 63 (1), p. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Library facilities can best represent their communities by hiring diverse staffs.&lt;ref name="Andrade, R. 2011"&gt;Andrade, R. &amp; Rivera, A. (2011). Developing a Diversity-Competent Workforce: The UA Libraries’ Experience. Journal of Library Administration. 51:7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Library Association and many libraries around the country realize the issue of diversity in the workplace and are addressing this problem.

===Statistics===
The majority of librarians working in the U.S. are female, between the ages of 55–64, and Caucasian.&lt;ref name="ala.org"&gt;American Library Association. (2014) Diversity Counts. Web. Retrieved From: http://www.ala.org/offices/diversity/diversitycounts/divcounts&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study by the American Library Association of research done from 2009 to 2010 shows that 98,273 of credentialed librarians were female while 20,393 were male. 15,335 of the total 111,666 were 35 and younger and only 6,222 were 65 or older. 104,393 were white; 6,160 African American, 3,260 American Pacific Islander; 185 Native American including Alaskan; 1,008 of two or more races, and 3,661 Latino. (ALA).&lt;ref name="ala.org"/&gt;

===Strategies===

====Scholarships/grants====
To help change the lack of diversity in library jobs in the U.S., more scholarships and grants are emerging. Most library and information science students do not belong to an [[underrepresented group]] and as a reaction to these research statistics, the field is creating ways to encourage more diversity in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Kumasi, K 2011 p.251-264"&gt;Kumasi, K &amp; Hill, R. F. (2011). Are We There Yet? Results of a Gap Analysis to Measure LIS Students’ Prior Knowledge and Actual Learning of Cultural Competence Concepts. Journal of Education for Library &amp; Information Science. 42(4), p.251-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program=====
The ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program is a way to encourage innovation in scholars and professionals to provide insight into how to diversify the field. The ALA Grant is directed toward those who have valuable and original research ideas that can add to the knowledge of diversity in the field of Librarianship. The program awards up to three individuals once a year with a grant of $2,500 each.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association. (2014). ALA Annual Research Diversity Grant Program. Web. Retrieved From: http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/diversityresearchstatistics/diversityresearch&lt;/ref&gt;  The applicants have submission guidelines, are given a timeline, and are shown the evaluation process online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/diversityresearchstatistics/diversityresearch&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural competencies====
One way to nurture cultural diversity in the library field is with cultural competencies. Scholars recommend defining skills needed to serve and work with others who belong to different cultures. It is suggested that these definitions be posted in job listings and be referred to when promoting and giving raises.&lt;ref name="Andrade, R. 2011"/&gt; In library and information science graduate programs, it is also suggested by scholars that there is a lack of classes teaching students cultural competences. It is important for more classes to teach about diversity and measure the outcomes.&lt;ref name="Kumasi, K 2011 p.251-264"/&gt;

====Recruitment====
Another strategy is to create interest in the field of library and information science from a young age. If minorities do not desire to become librarians, they will not seek to obtain an MLS or MLIS and therefore will not fill high job roles in libraries. A recommended solutions are to create a great experience for all racial group's early on in life.&lt;ref&gt;Hanken, T. (2010). Workforce Challenges with the Public Library Sector: Recruitment, Retention and Diversity. PA Times.&lt;/ref&gt; This may inspire more young children to become interested in this field.

===The Deaf Community and Library Science in the United States===
{{unbalanced|date=November 2016}}
Deaf people have the same needs as any other library visitors, and often have more difficulty accessing materials and services. Over the last few decades, libraries in the United States have begun to implement services and collections for D/deaf and HoH patrons and are working to make more of their collections, services, their communities, and even the world more accessible to this group of underserved people.

The history of the role of libraries in the Deaf community in the United States is a sordid one. The [[American Library Association]] readily admits that disabled people belong to a minority that is often overlooked and underrepresented by people in the library, and the Deaf community belongs in this minority group.&lt;ref name=ala7/&gt; However, in the last few decades, libraries across the United States have made great strides in the mission of making libraries more accessible to disabled people in general and to the Deaf community specifically. The Library Bill of Rights preamble states that "all libraries are forums for information and ideas" and as such libraries need to remove the physical and technological barriers which in turn would allow persons with disabilities full access to the resources available.&lt;ref name=ala8/&gt;

One notable American activist in the library community working toward accessibility for the deaf was [[Alice Lougee Hagemeyer]].&lt;ref name="Hagemeyer"&gt;{{cite https://www.gallaudet.edu/about/history-and-traditions/alice-hagemeyer/w/page/18570477/Alice%20Hagemeyer |title=historytrendsanddeafeducation / Alice Hagemeyer| |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2017-4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deafpeople1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gallaudet.edu/about/history-and-traditions/alice-hagemeyer |title=Deaf Person of the Month |publisher=Deafpeople.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian librarian Karen McQuigg stated in 2003 that "even ten years ago, when I was involved in a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, it seemed as if the gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able to serve them effectively."&lt;ref name=mcquigg/&gt; Clearly, not even so long ago, there was quite a dearth of information for or about the deaf community available in libraries across the nation and around the globe.

New guidelines from library organizations such as [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) and the ALA were written in order to help libraries make their information more accessible to people with disabilities, and in some cases, specifically the deaf community. IFLA's ''Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People'' is one such set of guidelines, was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the deaf community.&lt;ref name=day/&gt;

Over the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local deaf communities. There is now a [http://www.ala.org/ascla/asclaourassoc/asclasections/lssps/lspdhhf/lspdhhf Library Service to People Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Forum] for libraries to look at to find out what they can do to better serve their Deaf/HoH users.  At the Queen Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler, to train the library staff about deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.&lt;ref name=hollander/&gt;

==== Deaf libraries ====
The library at [[Gallaudet University]], the only deaf liberal arts university in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library's collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world's largest collection of deaf-related materials, with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The collection is so large that the library had to create a hybrid classification system based on the Dewey Decimal Classification System in order to make cataloging and location within the library easier for both library staff and users. The library also houses the university's archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.&lt;ref name=harringt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gallaudet.edu/library&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nashville, Tennessee, Sandy Cohen manages the Library Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (LSDHH). The program was created in 1979 in response to information accessibility issues for the deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a teletypewriter or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving the entire state of Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, deaf culture, and information for family members of deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;

==Theory and practice of library science==
Many practicing librarians do not contribute to LIS scholarship, but focus on daily operations within their own libraries or library systems. Other practicing librarians, particularly in academic libraries, do perform original scholarly LIS research and contribute to the academic end of the field.

Whether or not individual professional librarians contribute to scholarly research and publication, many are involved with and contribute to the advancement of the profession and of library science through local, state, regional, national and international library or information organizations.

Library science is very closely related to issues of [[knowledge organization]]; however, the latter is a broader term which covers how knowledge is represented and stored (computer science/linguistics), how it might be automatically processed (artificial intelligence), and how it is organized outside the library in global systems such as the internet. In addition, library science typically refers to a specific community engaged in managing holdings as they are found in university and government libraries, while knowledge organization in general refers to this and also to other communities (such as publishers) and other systems (such as the Internet). The library system is thus one socio-technical structure for knowledge organization.&lt;ref name=hoetz/&gt;

The terms information organization and knowledge organization are often used synonymously.&lt;ref name = "Bawden and Robinson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bawden|first1=David|last2=Robinson|first2=Lyn|title=Introduction to information science|date=2013|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Incorporated|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1555708610}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{rp|106}}  The fundamentals of their study (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) and many of the main tools used by the disciplines in modern times to provide access to digital resources (abstracting, [[metadata]], resource description, systematic and alphabetic subject description, and terminology) originated in the 19th century and were developed, in part, to assist in making humanity's intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge.&lt;ref Name = "Bawden and Robinson" /&gt; {{rp|105}}

==Types of libraries==

===Public library===
The study of librarianship for [[Public library|public libraries]] covers issues such as cataloging; [[Library collection development|collection development]] for a diverse community; [[information literacy]]; [[readers' advisory]]; community standards; public services-focused librarianship; serving a diverse community of adults, children, and teens; [[intellectual freedom]]; [[censorship]]; and legal and budgeting issues. The public library as a commons or public sphere based on the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]] has become a central metaphor in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=mccook2/&gt;

Most people are familiar with municipal public libraries, but there are many different types of public libraries that exist. There are four different types of public libraries: association libraries, municipal public libraries, school district libraries and special district public libraries. It is very important to be able to distinguish between the four. Each receives its funding through different sources. Each is established by a different set of voters. And, not all are subject to municipal civil service governance. Listed below is a chart from the New York State Library's library development website. This chart lists all of the information about the different public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lis510-libraries.wikispaces.com/Different+types+of+libraries|title=LIS510-Libraries – Different types of libraries|work=wikispaces.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School library/media center===
The study of school librarianship covers library services for children in schools through secondary school. In some regions, the local government may have stricter standards for the education and certification of school librarians (who are often considered a special case of teacher), than for other librarians, and the educational program will include those local criteria. School librarianship may also include issues of [[intellectual freedom]], [[pedagogy]], [[information literacy]], and how to build a cooperative [[curriculum]] with the teaching staff.

The study of academic librarianship covers library services for colleges and universities. Issues of special importance to the field may include [[copyright]]; technology, [[digital libraries]], and digital repositories; [[academic freedom]]; [[open access]] to scholarly works; as well as specialized knowledge of subject areas important to the institution and the relevant [[reference work]]s. Librarians often divide focus individually as liaisons on particular schools within a college or university.

Some academic librarians are considered [[Faculty (division)|faculty]], and hold similar academic ranks to those of professors, while others are not. In either case, the minimal qualification is a Master of Arts in Library Studies or Masters of Arts in Library Science. Some academic libraries may only require a master's degree in a specific academic field or a related field, such as educational technology.

===Archives===
The study of archives includes the training of [[archivist]]s, librarians specially trained to maintain and build [[archive]]s of [[document|records]] intended for [[historic preservation|historical preservation]]. Special issues include physical preservation, conservation and restoration of materials and [[mass deacidification]]; specialist catalogs; solo work; access; and appraisal. Many archivists are also trained historians specializing in the period covered by the archive.

The archival mission includes three major goals: To identify papers and records that have enduring value, to preserve the identified papers, and to make the papers available to others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52540188|title=Developing and maintaining practical archives : a how-to-do-it manual|last=S.|first=Hunter, Gregory|date=2003|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers|year=|isbn=1555704670|edition= 2nd|location=New York|pages=219–223|oclc=52540188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant differences between libraries and archives, including differences in collections, records creation, item acquisition, and preferred behavior in the institution. The major difference in collections is that library collections typically comprise published items (books, magazines, etc.), while archival collections are usually unpublished works (letters, diaries, etc.) In managing their collections, libraries will categorize items individually, but archival items never stand alone. An archival record gains its meaning and importance from its relationship to the entire collection; therefore archival items are usually received by the archive in a group or batch. Library collections are created by many individuals, as each author and illustrator creates their own publication; in contrast, an archive usually collects the records of one person, family, institution, or organization, and so the archival items will have fewer source authors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another difference between a library and an archive, is that library materials are created explicitly by authors or others who are working intentionally. They choose to write and publish a book, for example, and that occurs. Archival materials are not created intentionally. Instead, the items in an archive are what remain after a business, institution, or person conducts their normal business practices.The collection of letters, documents, receipts, ledger books, etc. were created with intention to perform daily tasks, they were not created in order to populate a future archive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As for item acquisition, libraries receive items individually, but archival items will usually become part of the archive's collection as a cohesive group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Behavior in an archive differs from behavior in a library, as well. In most libraries, patrons are allowed and encouraged to browse the stacks, because the books are openly available to the public. Archival items almost never circulate, and someone interested in viewing documents must request them of the archivist and may only view them in a closed reading room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Those who wish to visit an archive will usually begin with an entrance interview. This is an opportunity for the archivist to register the researcher, confirm their identity, and determine their research needs. This is also the opportune time for the archivist to review reading room rules, which vary but typically include policies on privacy, photocopying, the use of finding aids, and restrictions on food, drinks, and other activities or items that could damage the archival materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Special library===
[[Special library|Special libraries]] and special librarians include almost any other form of librarianship, including those who serve in medical libraries (and hospitals or medical schools), corporations, [[New agency|news agencies]], [[government organizations]], or other [[Research library|special collections]]. The issues at these libraries are specific to the industries they inhabit, but may include solo work, corporate financing, specialized collection development, and extensive self-promotion to potential patrons. Special librarians have their own professional organization, the [[Special Libraries Association|Special Library Association]].

National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.ucar.edu/# National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)]&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a special library. Its mission is to support, preserve, make accessible, and collaborate in the scholarly research and educational outreach activities of UCAR/NCAR.

Another is the Federal Bureau of Investigations Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fbilibrary.fbiacademy.edu/ The FBI Library]&lt;/ref&gt; According to its website, "The FBI Library supports the FBI in its statutory mission to uphold the law through investigation of violations of federal criminal law; to protect the United States from foreign intelligence and terrorist activities; and to provide leadership and law enforcement assistance to federal, state, local, and international agencies.

===Preservation===
{{main|Preservation (library and archival science)}}
Preservation librarians most often work in academic libraries. Their focus is on the management of preservation activities that seek to maintain access to content within books, manuscripts, archival materials, and other library resources. Examples of activities managed by preservation librarians include binding, conservation, digital and analog reformatting, [[digital preservation]], and environmental monitoring.

'''Light-on-dark color scheme''' is a [[color scheme]] that uses light-colored text on a dark background and is often discussed in terms of computer [[user interface]] design. 

Originally, computer user interface images were formed on [[cathode ray tube|CRT]]s. The [[phosphor]] was normally a very dark color, and lit up brightly when the [[electron beam]] hit it, appearing to be green or amber on black, depending on phosphors applied on a [[monochrome]] screen. [[RGB]] screens continued along a similar vein, using all the beams set to "on" to form white.

With the advent of [[teletext]], research was done into which primary and secondary light colors and combinations worked best for this new medium. {{Fact|date=September 2008}}  Cyan or yellow on black was typically found to be optimal from a palette of black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white.

The opposite color scheme, '''dark-on-light color scheme''', was originally introduced in [[WYSIWYG]] [[word processor]]s, to simulate ink on paper. 

Whether it is easier or healthier to read text on a dark background is disputed by vision and perception researchers; there is similar dispute between users.{{cn|date=April 2015}}

==Energy usage==
Light on dark color schemes require less energy to display on some display technologies, such as [[OLED]], [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] and [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] displays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleID=2649 Blackle vs. Google Monitor Power Consumption Tested]&lt;/ref&gt; This can impact battery life and overall energy conservation.

Special on [[OLED]] display panels, while an OLED will consume around 40% of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black, for the majority of images it will consume 60–80% of the power of an LCD. However, an OLED can use more than three times as much power to display an image with a white background, such as a document or web site.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Jon. (2009-08-11) [https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2009/08/this-september-oled-no-longer-three-to-five-years-away.ars This September, OLED no longer "three to five years away"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125223142/http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2009/08/this-september-oled-no-longer-three-to-five-years-away.ars |date=2012-01-25 }}. Arstechnica.com. Retrieved 2011-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to reduced battery life in mobile devices, when white backgrounds are used.

The caveat is that most pages on the [[World Wide Web|web]] are designed for white backgrounds; [[GIF]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] images with a transparency bit instead of [[alpha channels]] tend to show up with choppy outlines, as well as causing problems with other graphical elements.

It is not necessary that a web design work well with only one color scheme.  There are many mechanisms of web architecture that allow designs to work well with any color scheme a user might prefer.  This technical flexibility is a product of the web architect's concern for accessibility and user preference empowerment, though designers rarely utilize this technical flexibility.  Users who prefer certain color schemes frequently apply their preference to web pages using tools such as [[Stylish]] or its privacy-preserving brother, [https://github.com/openstyles/stylus Stylus].

=="Blazing white"==
'''Blazing white''' is black text on a bright background found in some software packages, often without the option to set colors (e.g. Skype, or Wikipedia). Another common problem is, when using [[spatial anti-aliasing]], the software assumes the background color is white.

Unlike paper, which reflects ambient light, both [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] and [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] displays emit light of sufficient brightness to overcome ambient light.  As ambient light varies, the relative brightness of the display can vary widely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3904">The '''membership function''' of a [[fuzzy set]] is a generalization of the [[indicator function]] in classical [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  In [[fuzzy logic]], it represents the [[degree of truth]] as an extension of [[Valuation (logic)|valuation]]. Degrees of truth are often confused with [[probability|probabilities]], although they are conceptually distinct, because [[fuzzy truth]] represents membership in vaguely defined sets, not likelihood of some event or condition. Membership functions were introduced by [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh|Zadeh]] in the first paper on fuzzy sets (1965). Zadeh, in his theory of fuzzy sets, proposed using a membership function (with a range covering the interval (0,1)) operating on the domain of all possible values.

== Definition ==

For any set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a membership function on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is any function from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the real unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Membership functions represent [[fuzzy set|fuzzy subsets]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. The membership function which represents a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;\tilde A&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mu_A.&lt;/math&gt; For an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the value &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''membership degree'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;\tilde A.&lt;/math&gt; The membership degree &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)&lt;/math&gt; quantifies the grade of membership of the element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;\tilde A.&lt;/math&gt; The value 0 means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is not a member of the fuzzy set; the value 1 means that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is fully a member of the fuzzy set. The values between 0 and 1 characterize fuzzy members, which belong to the fuzzy set only partially.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Fuzzy crisp.svg]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Membership function of a fuzzy set&lt;/center&gt;

Sometimes,&lt;ref&gt;First in Goguen (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; a more general definition is used, where membership functions take values in an arbitrary fixed algebra or structure &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; {{Explain|date=September 2017}}; usually it is required that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be at least a [[poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. The usual membership functions with values in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] are then called [0,&amp;nbsp;1]-valued membership functions.
&lt;!-- this is only true for so-called normal fuzzy sets:
The following holds for the functional values of the membership function &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mu_{A}(x)\ge0\quad\forall\quad x\in\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\sup_{x\in X}[\mu_{A}(x)]=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;--&gt;

== Capacity ==

''See the article on [[Capacity of a set]] for a closely related definition in mathematics.''

One application of membership functions is as capacities in [[decision theory]].

In [[decision theory]], a capacity is defined as a function, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; from '''S''', the set of subsets of some set, into &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is set-wise monotone and is normalized (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\nu(\empty) = 0, \nu(\Omega)=1).&lt;/math&gt;  This is a generalization of the notion of a [[probability measure]], where the [[probability axiom]] of countable additivity is weakened.  A capacity is used as a subjective measure of the likelihood of an event, and the "[[expected value]]" of an outcome given a certain capacity can be found by taking the [[Choquet integral]] over the capacity.

The '''National Wetlands Research Center''' (NWRC) was founded in 1975 as part of the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]'s (USFWS) Office of Biological Services.  Its headquarters are located in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].

The NWRC is one of 16 science centers of the [[Biological Resources Division]] of the [[U.S. Geological Survey]]. The mission of the National Wetlands Research Center is to develop and disseminate scientific information needed for understanding the ecology and values of U.S. wetlands and for managing and restoring wetland habitats and associated plant and animal communities. Its mission's primary goal is to bridge the gap between researchers and decision makers, mostly by using geographic information systems and producing reports such as coastal characterizations, community and estuarine profiles, and species profiles.

==History==
*1975 - Began as the National Coastal Ecosystems Team; headquartered at [[National Aeronautic and Space Administration]]'s rocket-testing site in Stennis, [[Mississippi]].
*1979 - Moved its headquarters to [[Slidell, Louisiana]].
*1986 - Gained a new research mission and renamed to the National Wetlands Research Center; opened field stations in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], and [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].
*1992 - Moved its headquarters to the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] research park in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[Louisiana]], through the recruitment of president [[Ray Authement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theind.com/cover-story/253|title=Newsmaker of the Year|publisher=theind.com|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1993 - Secretary [[Bruce Babbitt]] consolidated research in several bureaus of the [[Department of the Interior]] to form the National Biological Survey, an agency designed to foster scientific understanding and technologies.
*1994 - The National Wetlands Research Center added a field station in College Station, Texas, and project offices in [[Gulf Breeze, Florida]], [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], and [[Nacogdoches, Texas]].
*1995 - The National Biological Survey became the National Biological Service.
*1996 - The National Biological Service became the Biological Resources Division of the U. S. Geological Survey.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Non-lexical [[vocable]]s''', which may be mixed with meaningful text, are a form of [[nonsense syllable]] used in a wide variety of music. A common English example would be "la la la", "na na na" or "da da da".

==Traditional music==
Non-lexical vocables are used in [[yodeling]], [[Blackfoot music]] and other [[Native American music]], [[Pygmy music]], the [[music of the Maldives]], [[Irish Music|Irish music]], and [[Music of Scotland|Highland Scots music]]. Vocables frequently act as formal markers, indicating the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Heth, cited in {{cite book
|editor    = Ellen Koskoff (Ed.)
|publisher = Garland Publishing
|pages     = 368–369
|year      = 2001
|location  = New York and London
|isbn        = 0-8240-4944-6
|title     = The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: Volume 3, The United States and Canada
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also as onomatopoeic references, cueing devices, and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002542 "Native North Americans in Canada"], ''The Canadian Encyclopedia Historica: Encyclopedia of Music in Canada''. Accessed 01/23/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Blackfeet|Blackfoot]], like other [[Plains Indians]], use the [[consonant]]s ''h'', ''y'', ''w'', and [[vowel]]s. They avoid ''n'', ''c'' (''ts'') and other consonants. ''i'' and ''e'' tend slightly to be higher [[pitch (music)|pitches]], ''a'', ''o'', and ''u'' lower ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nettl, Bruno]] (1989). ''Blackfoot Musical Thought: Comparative Perspectives'', p.71. Ohio: The Kent State University Press. {{ISBN|0-87338-370-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AIM Song]] has its origins in the Plains; as such, it holds similar characteristics to Blackfoot song. It is intended as an intertribal song, so the use of non-lexical vocables prevents bias to one particular [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language]].

Other traditional musical forms employing non-lexical vocables include:
* [[Puirt à beul]] (traditional Scottish and Irish song form that sometimes employs nonsense syllables)
* [[Nigun]] in Jewish religious music
* [[Joik]] or luohti (improvised [[Sami people|Sami]] chant employing nonsense syllables and few or no lyrics)

==Jazz music==
{{main|Scat singing}}
[[Scat singing]] is a type of voice instrumental music. A scat is vocalized using wordless vocables and syllables (e.g. "bippity-bippity-doo-wop-razzamatazz-skoobie-doobie-shoobity-bee-bop-a-lula-shabazz") as employed by jazz singers. Scat singing gives singers the ability to sing improvised melodies and rhythms, to create the equivalent of an instrumental solo using their voice. [[Scatman John]] (John Paul Larkin) renewed interest in the genre briefly during the mid-90s.

Vocal improviser [[Bobby McFerrin]]’s performances at major concert halls worldwide show that “wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Gladys Bentley]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Anita O’Day]], and [[Leo Watson]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crowther|Pinfold|1997|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of scat singing is practiced by guitarists who scat along with their solos note for note.  Notable practitioners include [[George Benson]], [[Sheldon Reynolds (guitarist)|Sheldon Reynolds]], and [[Rik Emmett]].

==Vocal percussion==
Non-lexical vocables that take on percussive roles:
* [[Bol (music) | Tabla Bols]]
* [[Beatboxing]]
* [[Konnakol]]

==Musical training==
* [[Solfège]], or solfa, is a technique for teaching [[sight-singing]], in which each note is sung to a special syllable (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti). 
* [[Canntaireachd]] is an ancient Scottish practice of noting music with a combination of definite syllables for ease of recollection and transmission.
* In India, the origin of [[solmization]] was to be found in [[Vedic]] texts like the [[Upanishads]], which discuss a musical system of seven notes, realized ultimately in what is known as [[Swara|sargam]]. In [[Indian classical music]], the notes in order are: sa, re, ga, ma, pa, dha, and ni.
* [[Byzantine music]] also uses syllables derived from a hymn to name notes: starting with A, the notes are pa, vu, ga, di, ke, zo, ni.
* In Japan, the [[Iroha]], an ancient poem, is sometimes used as solfège (i, chi, yo, ra, ya, a, we).

==Popular music of the WWII era==
The song "[[Swinging the Alphabet]]" is sung by The Three Stooges in their short film ''[[Violent Is the Word for Curly]]'' (1938).  It is the only full-length song performed by the Stooges in their short films, and the only time they mimed to their own pre-recorded soundtrack.  The lyrics use each letter of the alphabet to make a nonsense verse of the song:
  B-A-bay, B-E-bee, B-I-bicky-bi, B-O bo, bicky-bi bo, B-U bu, bicky bi bo bu.
  C-A-cay, C-E-cee, C-I-cicky-ci, C-O co, cicky-ci co, C-U cu, cicky ci co cu.
  D-A-day, D-E-dee, D-I-dicky-di, D-O do, dicky-di do, D-U du, dicky di do du.
  F-A-fay, F-E-fee, F-I-ficky-fi, F-O fo, Ficky-fi fo, F-U fu, ficky fi fo fu.
  ...

The song "[[Mairzy Doats]]" (1943) used blurred lyrics that sound non-lexical:
  Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey
  A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?
However, the lyrics of the bridge provide a clue:
  If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey,
  Sing "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little lambs eat ivy."

==Popular music==
Examples of popular music employing non-lexical vocables include:
* [[A cappella]] (singing without instrumental accompaniment, sometimes accompanied by a chorus of nonsense syllables)
* [[Doo-wop]] (style of rhythm and blues music that often employs nonsense syllables)
* [[Kobaïan]] (language used by French progressive rock band [[Magma (band)|Magma]])
* [[Sigur Rós#Vonlenska|Vonlenska]], also called ''Hopelandic'', (gibberish language employed by the Icelandic post-rock band [[Sigur Rós]])

Jack Black uses non-lexical vocables whilst singing as Tenacious D

[[Van Morrison]] employed scat in his performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Jim Morrison|title=Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll|editor-last=Pareles|editor-first=Jon|editor-link=Jon Pareles|editor2-last=Romanowski|editor2-first=Patricia|editor3-last=George-Warren|editor3-first=Holly|year=2001|publisher=Fireside|place=|isbn=978-0-7432-0120-9|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/van-morrison/biography|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Scat singing]] influenced the development of [[doo-wop]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. It was popular enough in doo-wop that [[Barry Mann]] and [[Gerry Goffin]] made it the subject of a 1961 song, [[Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)]]". It has also appeared in various genres of [[rock music]]. [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]] sings a chorus of slow scat on the song "Cars Hiss By My Window", trying to replicate a harmonica solo he had heard, as well as on the song "[[Roadhouse Blues]]"; scat singing also notably opens the [[B-side]] of [[Joe Walsh]]'s 1973 album ''[[The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get]]'' with the song "Meadow".  The technique was employed in the song "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]" by [[Pink Floyd]], as well as the R&amp;B song "[[Rubber Biscuit]]" by [[The Chips]] (also as by [[The Blues Brothers]]).  The [[list of scat singers]] includes such greats as [[Jelly Roll Morton]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Scatman Crothers]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Mel Tormé]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Cleo Laine]], [[Roger Miller]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Van Morrison]], and the [[Pointer Sisters]].

Scatting also makes appearances in newer genres, including [[industrial music]], in the chorus of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]'s 1991 song "[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs|Jesus Built My Hotrod]]"; [[nu metal]] music, in the band [[Korn (band)|Korn]] (whose lead singer [[Jonathan Davis]] has incorporated scat singing into songs such as "Twist", "[[Ball Tongue]]", "[[Freak on a Leash]]", "[[B.B.K. (song)|B.B.K.]]", "Beat it Upright", "Liar", and "[[Rotting in Vain]]"); and the heavy metal subgenre of [[death metal]], where scat singing is used by [[John Tardy]] of the band [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]]. [[Jack Black]] incorporates scat into several [[Tenacious D]] songs, most notably: "[[Tribute (song)|Tribute]]", "Cosmic Shame", "Classico," "Jesus Ranch," Low Hangin' Fruit," and "Bowie". Singer [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]] performs ad-libbed scats on the track "Yes or No". Other modern examples include "Under Pressure" by [[Queen (band)]], "Rag Doll" by [[Aerosmith]], "Under My Voodoo" by [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], "No! Don't Shoot" by [[Foxy Shazam]], "Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz" by [[Mr. Bungle]], "In My Bed" by [[Amy Winehouse]], and "Stuck in the Middle" by [[Mika (singer)|Mika]]. [[Scatman John]] combined scat and early-1990s [[electronic dance music]].

Examples by popular non-[[English-speaking|anglophone]] singers using such techniques include "[[Bla Bla Bla]]" by [[Gigi D'Agostino]], "Eena Mina Dika" in the Bollywood film ''[[Aasha (1957 film)|Aasha]]'', [[Eduard Khil]]'s "I Am Glad, Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home" (known as "[[Trololo]]") sung entirely without lyrics, "[[Fuzao]]" by [[Faye Wong]], "[[Alive (Sa Dingding album)|Lagu Lagu]]" by [[Sa Dingding]] and "[[Din Daa Daa]]" by [[George Kranz]].

Due to the wide-ranging vocal styles used in popular music, occasionally songs have been mistakenly categorized as having non-lexical vocables, when in fact the singers are performing actual lyrics rendered partially (or completely) unintelligible to the ear of some (but not all) listeners. Two famous 1960s examples are "[[Louie Louie]]" as recorded by [[The Kingsmen]] and "[[Wooly Bully]]" by [[Sam the Sham|Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs]].

==Disney songs==
A signature of some [[Disney]] [[musical film]]s is their songs' use of [[nonsense word]]s, the longest and most famous of which is from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', entitled  "[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]".  A close second is "[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" from ''[[Song of the South]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]. Nonsense word song titles include:
*"[[Heigh-Ho]]" from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''  (1937)
*"[[Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah]]" from ''[[Song of the South]]''  (1946)
*"[[Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo]]" from ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''  (1950)
*"[[Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious]]" and "[[Chim Chim Cher-ee]]" from ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''  (1964)
*"[[Substitutiary Locomotion]]" from ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' (1971), which includes the incantation "Treguna Mekoides and Tracorum Satis Dee"
*"Whistle-Stop" from [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]] (1973)
*"[[Whoop-de-Dooper Bounce]]" from ''[[The Tigger Movie]]'' (2000)

Nonsense lyrics also feature in the following Disney songs:
*"[[I Wanna Be Like You]]" from ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' features a segment of improvisational nonsense words.
*"Trashing the Camp" from ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'' also contains a segment of improvisational nonsense words.
*"[[Everybody Wants to Be a Cat]]" from ''[[The Aristocats]]'', sung by [[Scatman Crothers]] as "Scat Cat", contains lengthy scat sequences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4265">'''Out-of-school learning''' is an educational concept first proposed by [[Lauren Resnick]] in her 1987 AERA presidential address,&lt;ref&gt;L. Resnick (1987), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1175725 The 1987 Presidential Address: Learning in School and out]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Resnick (1987), ''Education and Learning to Think''. National Academy Press. {{ISBN|0-309-03785-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of curricular and non-curricular learning experiences for pupils and students outside the school environment.

==Goals==
The point of out-of-school learning is to overcome learning disabilities, development of talents, strengthen communities and increase interest in education by creating extra learning opportunities in the real world. In a study&lt;ref&gt;UCLA CRESST, [http://www.lasbest.org/resourcecenter/LASBEST_DOJ_Final%20Report.pdf The Long-Term Effects of After-School Programming on Educational Adjustment and Juvenile Crime:A Study of the LA’s BEST After-School Program]&lt;/ref&gt; performed by the UCLA [[National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing (CRESST)]] it was proven that out-of-school learning increases the interest in education and school itself.

==Implementation==
Out-of-school learning is typically not coordinated by the school itself. Out-of-school experiences are organized with community partners such as museums, sport facilities, charity initiatives, and more. Out-of-school experiences can range from [[service learning]] to summer school and expeditions or more commonly occur in day to day experiences at after-school with creative ventures such as arts courses and even sports. Some other examples of out-of-school learning are:

* homework and homework clubs
* study clubs – extending curriculum
* mentoring – by other pupils and by adults, including parents
* learning about learning
* community service and citizenship
* residential activities – study weeks or weekends

==Results==
It has been found in research&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallacefoundation.org/KnowledgeCenter/KnowledgeTopics/CurrentAreasofFocus/Out-Of-SchoolLearning/Pages/default.aspx The Wallace Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; by the Wallace Foundation that out-of-school learning can be a great opportunity to discover and develop talents. Especially if a professional organization develops a learning environment that guides groups of pupils/students in their co-operation in creating a professional and publicly visible product, presentation or performance. Companies, cultural institutions and non governmental organizations can offer valuable out-of-school learning experiences.

Organizations will see results accordingly to the quality of the experience, whether they aim to promote active and healthy lifestyles, increase community involvement and visitors/members, to an interest in a company's corporate responsibility projects and employment opportunities.

==Projects==

In the United Kingdom alone several local and state bodies run out-of-school learning projects, with additional funding&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/566481.stm Cash boost for out-of-school learning]&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] (£9.1m in 2000). Some major examples of out-of-school learning projects are:
* [http://www.parentzonescotland.gov.uk/ Parentzone], an out of school learning initiative from the Scottish government
* [http://www.lasbest.org/ LA's Best], an out of school learning initiative from [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] mayor of  Los Angeles, California from 1973 to 1993
* [http://www.sarahswereld.nl/ Sarahs'wereld] and [https://www.duurzaamdoor.nl/projecten/de-wenswijk De Wenswijk], out of school learning initiatives from the Wensenwerk Foundation sponsored by the [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] in the Netherlands.

[[Image:london-park-system.jpg|thumb|right|The County of London Park System, planned by [[Patrick Abercrombie]] in 1943-4|300px]]  A '''park system''', also known as an open space system, is a network of green spaces that are connected by public walkways, bridleways or cycleways. The concept first emerged with the need to minimize fragmentation of natural environments and was referred to as "[[Wildlife corridor|patch and corridor]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahern|first1=Jack|title=Greenways as a Planning Strategy|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|date=1995|volume=33|pages=131–155|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/016920469502039V/1-s2.0-016920469502039V-main.pdf?_tid=40541390-2eb5-11e7-81ea-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1493674346_9ae3299e8869afa5e4604041c0ca6552|doi=10.1016/0169-2046(95)02039-v}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern [[landscape architecture]], the park system is collaborating with the idea of planning [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]], which run through urban and rural areas. These systems can serve the landscape through ecological, recreational, social, cultural, and healthful measures, and are designed with intentions of [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the earliest park systems, in London, came into existence by chance. As London expanded around former royal parks in the nineteenth century, [[St. James's Park]], [[Green Park]] and [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] became part of the urban area. This arrangement was admired in France and adopted for the nineteenth century re-planning of Paris by [[Baron Haussmann]]. It was also admired by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and used to create the famous [[Emerald Necklace]] in Boston. Another example is [[Ebenezer Howard]]'s Adirondack Park concept. These green networks were part of the nineteenth century [[Garden city movement|Garden City Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zube|first=Ervin H.|date=1995|title=Greenways and the U.S. National Park System|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0169204694020114/1-s2.0-0169204694020114-main.pdf?_tid=b9cbffaa-2eb8-11e7-9307-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1493675838_474529eabbfc6b0dd0ddea0aa781e5a6|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=33|pages=17–25|doi=10.1016/0169-2046(94)02011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1927, the [[Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission]] was formed to plan and acquire parklands along stream valley corridors in the then-rural northern and eastern suburbs of Washington, D.C.  Over 33,000 acres (130&amp;nbsp;km²) are now protected in the [[Montgomery County, Maryland]] portion and provide welcome green space in this urbanized region.  A major proposal for a park system was included in [[Patrick Abercrombie]]'s 1943-4 [[County of London Plan]].

The largest continuous urban parks system in [[North America]] is the [[North Saskatchewan River valley parks system]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada, which is {{convert|7400|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in size and {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length, and also includes 22 ravines, which have a combined total length of {{convert|103|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Ribbon&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edmonton.ca/environmental/documents/Ribbon_of_GreenMaster_Plan.pdf#xml=http://search1.edmonton.ca/texis/ThunderstoneSearchService/pdfhi.txt?query=north+saskatchewan+river+valley&amp;pr=www.edmonton.ca&amp;prox=page&amp;rorder=750&amp;rprox=250&amp;rdfreq=0&amp;rwfreq=0&amp;rlead=750&amp;rdepth=0&amp;sufs=1&amp;order=r&amp;cq=&amp;id=4d9aed517 | title=Ribbon of Green: North Saskatchewan River Valley and Ravine System Master Plan | publisher=City of Edmonton | accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest urban parks system in [[Australia]] is the [[Western Sydney Parklands]], which is {{convert|5280|ha|acre|abbr=on}} in size and {{convert|27|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/planmanagement/draft/WesternSydneyRPPOMFinalDraft.pdf |title=Western Sydney Regional Park Draft Plan of Management |publisher=NSW Government |accessdate=16 May 2013 |quote=It is approximately 5,280 hectares in size and is the largest urban park in Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2415">{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

The term '''psychic apparatus''' (also '''psychical apparatus''', '''mental apparatus''') denotes a central, theoretic construct of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[metapsychology]], wherein:

{{quote|We assume that mental life is the function of an apparatus to which we ascribe the characteristics of being extended in space and of being made up of several portions &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Id, ego and super-ego]].|Freud, ''An Outline of Psychoanalysis'' (1940)}}

As a [[Ego psychology|psychologist]], [[Sigmund Freud]] used the German terms '''''psychischer Apparat''''' and '''''seelischer Apparat''''', about the functioning of which he elaborates:

{{quote|We picture the unknown apparatus, which serves the activities of the mind, as being really like an instrument constructed of several parts (which we speak of as 'agencies'), each of which performs a particular function, and which have a fixed, spatial relation to one another: it being understood that by 'spatial relation'—'in front of' and 'behind', 'superficial' and 'deep'—we merely mean, in the first instance, a representation of the regular succession of the functions.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Freud proposed the psychic apparatus as solely a theoretic construct explaining the functioning of the [[mind]], and not a [[Neurology|neurologic]] structure of the [[brain]]:

{{quote|It is a [[hypothesis]], like so many others in the sciences: the very earliest ones have always been rather rough. 'Open to revision', we can say in such cases ... the value of a 'fiction' of this kind ... depends on how much one can achieve with its help.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Moreover, in emphasizing the immateriality of the psychic apparatus, Freud dismissed the matter of its physical substance:

{{quote|That is not a subject of psychological interest. [[Ego psychology|Psychology]] can be as indifferent to it as, for instance, optics can be to the question of whether the walls of a telescope are made of metal or cardboard. We shall leave entirely to one side the '''material''' line of approach.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

'''Sandwatch''' is a [[wikt:program|program]] in which children, youth and adults work together to scientifically monitor and critically evaluate the problems facing their beach [[environment (systems)|environment]]s. They then design and implement practical activities and projects to address particular issues, enhance their beach environment and build resilience to [[climate change]]. The Sandwatch approach is called MAST: Monitoring, Analysing, Sharing information, and Taking action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambers|first=Diamond|title=Sandwatch: Adapting to climate change and educating for sustainable development|date=2010|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sandwatch has mainly focused on beach environments, the program can be used on other [[ecosystem]]s, such as [[river]]s and [[stream]]s.

Sandwatch has received support for activities over the years from organisations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the University of Puerto Rico Sea Grant College Program, among others.

==History==
In 1999, participants at an Environmental Education workshop in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] recognized the potential of using the beach environment as an outdoor classroom. The students at the [[workshop]] came up with the name Sandwatch. Since then, the program has grown to include more than 30 member countries with over 300 [[schools]] and community groups actively monitoring change in their beach environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verkooy|first=Michelle|title=Sandwatch Database Launch Plan|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, during the first formal Sandwatch training for [[teacher]]s, the action-based design was trialed and since then Sandwatch and the MAST approach have been successfully used by teachers around the world and are often portrayed as a working example of [[education]] for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cambers, Gillian |author2=Chapman, Grace |author3=Diamond, Paul |author4=Down, Lorna |author5=Griffith, Anthony D. |author6=Wiltshire, Winthrop |title=Teacher's guide for education for sustainable development in Caribbean|date=2008|publisher=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the Sandwatch Manual was [[publish]]ed. In October 2010 the manual was revised to include climate change adaptation. The manual: Sandwatch: Adapting to Climate Change and Educating for Sustainable Development is available in four [[languages]] ([[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), and can be downloaded for free on the Sandwatch website, [http://www.Sandwatch.org www.Sandwatch.org].

As the program continued to grow, in 2006 a Sandwatch website and newsletter were launched. In 2008 the Sandwatch Foundation was established as an independent organization to oversee and coordinate  the program and is operated by two volunteer directors, Paul Diamond and Gillian Cambers. 
In 2013 the long-awaited Sandwatch International Database was launched in Mauritius. The database provides participating Sandwatch groups the opportunity to upload their monitoring data to a secure site. Not only does this allow for proper archiving of environmental data, but it also allow users to analyse their results, create their own charts and graphs, and communicate their findings visually with the wider community. Non-Sandwatch groups can also visit the database and view the data.

==Activities==
Each Sandwatch school or group adopts a local [[beach]] and regularly takes a series of measurements and tests of their beach using simple and readily available equipment. By measuring how the beach's [[width]], [[current (fluid)|current]]s, [[Water waves|waves]], [[water quality]] and other factors change over months and years, the teams can determine whether their beach is stable and healthy or stressed and deteriorating, and the nature of the stressors.

When a group identifies a problem it can, with the [[community]], develop a project to address and mitigate the problem or problems. Project activities include alerting [[authorities]] to potential problems such as [[water contamination]] (from [[sewage]] or [[agricultural runoff]] for example), conducting beach clean-ups, replanting [[mangroves]] or dune stabilization [[vegetation]], creating [[signage]] for proper beach use, monitoring and protecting marine [[turtle]] nesting sites, or monitoring the effects of [[coral bleaching]]. By keeping the beach and related ecosystems healthy they are made more resilient and better able to adapt to climate change.

All Sandwatch groups are encouraged to regularly post their [[data]], [[photograph]]s and other project details on the Sandwatch [[website]], as well as to contribute [[article (publishing)|article]]s and photographs to the twice-yearly [[newsletter]], The Sandwatcher.

Sandwatch representatives  are often  invited to participate in regional and international workshops and [[Academic conference|conference]]s, where they share their experiences and data and forge [[partnership]]s with similar environmental groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13276">'''Saponification''' is a process that involves conversion of fat or oil into [[soap]] and alcohol by the action of heat in the presence of aqueous alkali (e.g. [[Sodium_hydroxide|NaOH]]). Soaps are salts of fatty acids whereas fatty acids are saturated monocarboxylic acids that have long carbon chains (at least 10) e.g. [[Palmitic_acid|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;COOH]].

== Saponification of fats ==
[[Vegetable oil]]s and [[animal fat]]s are the traditional materials that are saponified.  These greasy materials, triesters called [[triglyceride]]s,  are mixtures derived from diverse fatty acids. Triglycerides can be converted to soap in either a one- or a two-step process.  In the traditional one-step process, the triglyceride is treated with a strong base (e.g. [[lye]]), which cleaves to the ester bond, releasing [[fatty acid]] salts (soaps) and [[glycerol]].  This process is also the main industrial method for producing glycerol.  In some soap-making, the glycerol is left in the soap.  If necessary, soaps may be [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] by [[salting out|salting it out]] with [[sodium chloride]]. 
[[Image:stearin.png|thumb|250px|Skeletal formula of stearin, a triglyceride that is converted by saponification with sodium hydroxide into glycerol and soap.]]

Fat in a [[Dead body|corpse]] converts into [[adipocere]], often called "grave wax". This process is more common where the amount of [[adipose tissue|fatty tissue]] is high and the agents of [[decomposition]] are absent or only minutely present.

===Saponification value===
The [[saponification value]] is the amount of base required to saponify a fat sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality Laboratory Oil Examination Procedures and Practices|url=http://www.aocs.org/index.cfm|publisher=American Oil Chemists' Society|accessdate=17 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225133305/http://www.aocs.org/index.cfm|archivedate=25 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soap makers formulate their recipes with a small deficit of lye to account for the unknown deviation of saponification value between their oil batch and laboratory averages.

=== Mechanism of base hydrolysis ===
{{Main|ester}}
The hydroxide anion adds to (or "attacks") the carbonyl group of the ester.  The immediate product is called an [[orthoester]].

:[[File:Verseifungsreaktion 1.svg|280px|Saponification part I]]
Expulsion of the alkoxide generates a carboxylic acid:
:[[File:Verseifungsreaktion 2.svg|320px|Saponification part II]]
The alkoxide ion is a [[acid strength#Strong acids|strong base]] so that the proton is transferred from the carboxylic acid to the alkoxide ion creating an alcohol:
:[[File:Verseifungsreaktion 3.svg|360px|saponification part III]]

In a classic laboratory procedure, the triglyceride [[trimyristin]] is obtained by extracting it from [[nutmeg]] with [[diethyl ether]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=G. D. Beal|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.006.0100|url=http://www.orgsyn.org/demo.aspx?prep=CV1P0538|title=Trimyristin|journal=Organic Syntheses|volume=6|pages=100|year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saponification to the sodium soap of [[myristic acid]] takes place using NaOH in water. The acid itself can be obtained by adding dilute [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G. D. Beal|url=http://www.orgsyn.org/demo.aspx?prep=CV1P0379|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.006.0066|title=Myristic Acid|journal=Organic Syntheses|volume=6|pages=66|year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saponification of fatty acids==
The reaction of fatty acids with base is the other main method of saponification.  In this case, the reaction involves neutralization of the [[carboxylic acid]].  The neutralization method is used to produce industrial soaps such as those derived from magnesium, the transition metals, and aluminium.  This method is ideal for producing soaps that are derived from a single fatty acid, which leads to soaps with predictable physical properties, as required by many engineering applications.

== Applications ==
=== Soft versus hard soap ===
Depending on the nature of the alkali used in their production, soaps have distinct properties. [[Sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) gives "hard soap"; hard soaps can also be used in water containing Mg, Cl, and Ca salts.  By contrast, [[potassium]] soaps, (derived using [[Potassium_hydroxide|KOH]]) are soft soap. The fatty acid source also affects the soap's melting point. Most early hard soaps were manufactured using animal fats and KOH extracted from wood ash; these were broadly solid.  However, the majority of modern soaps are manufactured from polyunsaturated triglycerides such as vegetable oils. As in the triglycerides they are formed from&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/aqa/plantoilsanduses/vegoilsrev4.shtml|publisher=BBC |work=GCSE Bitesize|title= Double bonds and hydrogenation}}&lt;/ref&gt; the salts of these acids have weaker inter-molecular forces and thus lower melting points.

=== Lithium soaps ===
Lithium derivatives of [[Lithium_12-hydroxystearate|12-hydroxystearate]] and other fatty acids are important constituents of lubricating greases. In [[lithium-based grease]]s, lithium [[carboxylate]]s are thickeners.  "Complex soaps" are also common, these being combinations of metallic soaps, such as lithium and calcium soaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/14356007.a15_423|chapter=Lubricants and Lubrication|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2003|last1=Bartels|first1 =Thorsten|last2=Bock|first2=Wolfgang|last3=Braun|first3=Jürgen|last4= Busch|first4=Christian|last5=Buss|first5= Wolfgang|last6= Dresel|first6= Wilfried|last7=Freiler|first7= Carmen|last8=Harperscheid|first8=Manfred|last9=Heckler|first9=Rolf-Peter|last10=Hörner|first10=Dietrich|last11=Kubicki|first11=Franz|last12= Lingg|first12=Georg|last13=Losch|first13 =Achim|last14= Luther|first14=Rolf|last15=Mang|first15=Theo|last16=Noll|first16=Siegfried|last17=Omeis|first17=Jürgen|isbn=3-527-30673-0|publisher= Wiley-VCH|location= Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire extinguishers ===
Fires involving [[cooking fat]]s and oils (classified as [[Fire classes#Cooking oil|class K (US) or F (Australia/Europe/Asia)]]) burn hotter than most flammable liquids, rendering a standard [[Fire classes#Flammable liquid and gas|class B]] extinguisher ineffective. Flammable liquids have [[flash point]]s under 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit).  Cooking oil is a combustible liquid, since it has a flash point over 37 degrees Celsius.  Such fires should be extinguished with a [[fire extinguisher#Wet chemical and water additives|wet chemical extinguisher]]. Extinguishers of this type are designed to extinguish cooking fats and oils through saponification. The extinguishing agent rapidly converts the burning substance to a non-combustible soap. This process is [[endothermic]], meaning that it absorbs [[thermal energy]] from its surroundings, which decreases the temperature of the surroundings, further inhibiting the fire.

== Oil paints ==
[[File:Detail of Madame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau), John Singer Sargent, 1884.jpg|thumb|Detail of Madame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau), John Singer Sargent, 1884, showing saponification in the black dress.]]
Saponification can occur in [[oil painting]]s over time, causing visible damage and deformation.  Oil paints are composed of pigment molecules suspended in an oil binding [[Drying oil|medium]]. Heavy metal salts are often used as pigment molecules, such as in [[lead white]], [[red lead]], and [[zinc white]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000067586|title=Pigment {{!}} Grove Art|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000067586|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If those heavy metal salts react with [[free fatty acid]]s in the oil medium, metal  soaps may form in a paint layer that can then migrate outward to the painting's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See pages: 12–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saponification in oil paintings was described as early as 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleury|first1=Paul|title=The Preparation and Uses of White Zinc Paints|date=1912|location=London|edition=1st|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/paul-fleury/the-preparation-and-uses-of-white-zinc-paints-hci/page-11-the-preparation-and-uses-of-white-zinc-paints-hci.shtml|chapter=MANUFACTURE AND TREATMENTS OF WHITE ZINC |publisher=London, Scott, Greenwood &amp; son|quote="and although Petit declares this theory false, it is none the less on it and on its data that he bases his system of manufacture of hydrated white zinc, of which he is the inventor that is to say, the saponification of the oil, or the formation of metallic salts, dissolved therein"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed to be widespread, having been observed in many works dating from the fifteenth through the twentieth centuries; works of different geographic origin; and works painted on various supports, such as canvas, paper, wood, and copper.  Chemical analysis may reveal saponification occurring in a painting’s deeper layers before any signs are visible on the surface, even in paintings centuries old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The saponified regions may deform the painting's surface through the formation of visible lumps or protrusions that can scatter light.  These soap lumps may be prominent only on certain regions of the painting rather than throughout.  In [[John Singer Sargent]]'s famous ''[[Portrait of Madame X]]'', for example, the lumps only appear on the blackest areas, which may be because of the artist’s use of more medium in those areas to compensate for the tendency of black pigments to soak it up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See pages  12–13, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The process can also form chalky white deposits on a painting's surface, a deformation often described as "blooming" or "efflorescence", and may also contribute to the increased transparency of certain paint layers within an oil painting over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See pages 16, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saponification does not occur in all oil paintings and many details are unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  At present, retouching is the only known restoration method.

A '''seat filler''' is a person who fills in an empty seat during an event. There are two types of seat fillers:

# a person who subscribes to a seat-filling theatre club. Members of these clubs help fill in unsold seats for theatre, music, film, sporting events, dance performances and other live events. The producers of the event give complimentary tickets to the seat-filling organization, who pass them on to their members. The producers get a fuller [[audience]] and therefore a better experience for the paying patrons (and talent), while the seat-filler is able to see an event for a small service charge. Within the industry, this is also referred to as "papering the house". &lt;br /&gt;Some seat-filling companies charge no surcharge per ticket and only a membership based fee. This model is popular in cities with a larger number of shows and therefore a higher number of tickets to go around.
# a person who takes up spare seats when the person allocated the seat is elsewhere. An example of this is the [[Academy Awards]] in which many of the audience are either gaining awards, once they win the award the recipient needs to wait for an appropriate time to return to their seat, or because the member of the audience is involved in producing the show. Seat fillers are primarily employed so that when TV cameras show audience shots there are no empty seats.

==Benefits to the Shows==
* Increased awareness of their show (especially helpful if new)
* Higher concession sales 
* Fuller audience for a better show experience
* Marketing to a vocal audience
* Private and no cost. Most seat filler services offer their service for free to the shows with an attached promise that their members will not publicly state where they received the tickets from as to not impact future sales

==In popular culture==
*In the ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' episode "My Doctor Has a Cow Puppet", Charlie tries to set up Alan with one of his friends who works as a seat filler at award ceremonies.
*In the ''[[Seinfeld]]'' episode "[[The Summer of George]]", [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]] works as a seat filler at the [[Tony Awards]].
*The plot of the 2004 movie ''[[The Seat Filler]]'' revolves around a seat-filler who meets a burgeoning pop star during an event.
*In the movie ''[[Now You See Me (film)|Now You See Me]]'', they mention that the audience are a bunch of seat fillers.
*In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Call Girl (Family Guy)|Call Girl]]", [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] works as a seat filler for fetuses during [[ultrasounds]].
*In the [[87th Academy Awards]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]] mentions the seat fillers explaining its meaning and jokes with [[Steve Carell]] as if he were a seat filler.

The '''''shi''''' ({{zh|c=尸|p=''shī''|w=''sh'ih''|l=corpse}}) was a ceremonial "personator" who represented a dead relative during ancient [[Ancestor Veneration in China|Chinese ancestral sacrifices]]. In a ''shi'' ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the descendant "corpse" personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey messages from the spirit. [[James Legge]] (1895 IV:135), an early translator of the Chinese classics, described ''shi'' personation ceremonies as "grand family reunions where the dead and the living met, eating and drinking together, where the living worshipped the dead, and the dead blessed the living." In modern terms, this ancient Chinese ''shi'' practice would be described as [[necromancy]], [[mediumship]], or [[spirit possession]].

==Word==
[[File:尸-oracle.svg|thumb|150px|[[Oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-bronze.svg|thumb|150px|[[Bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]
[[File:尸-seal.svg|thumb|150px|[[Seal script]] for ''shi'' 尸]]

The word ''shi'' 尸 "corpse; personator; inactive; lay out; manage; spirit tablet" can be discussed in terms of [[Chinese character]] evolution, [[Historical Chinese phonology|historical phonology]], [[semantics]], and English translations.

===Characters===
The modern character [[Wikt:尸|尸]] for ''shi'' "corpse; personator" is a graphic simplification of ancient [[pictograph]]s showing a person with a bent back and dangling legs. The first records of ''shi'' are on [[oracle bones]] dating from the late [[Shang Dynasty]] (ca. 1600–ca. 1046 BCE). The [[oracle bone script]] for ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" was used interchangeably for ''yi'' [[Wikt:夷|夷]] "barbarian; non-Chinese people (esp. eastern, see ''[[Dongyi]]''); at ease; level". The [[bronze script]] for ''shi'' 尸, found in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions]] dating from the Shang and [[Zhou Dynasty]] (ca. 1045 BCE-ca. 256 BCE), had a more curved back and legs. The graphically reduced [[seal script]] for ''shi'', standardized during the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221-207 BCE), resembles the [[regular script]] 尸.

Today, ''shi'' 尸 is more commonly used as the [[Radical 44|"corpse/body radical"]] in [[Chinese characters]] (number 44 in the [[List of Kangxi radicals]]) than to write the original word "corpse". Many characters written with this radical involve the body (e.g., ''niao'' [[Wikt:尿|尿]] "urine" with 水 "water"), but not all (e.g., ''wu'' [[Wikt:屋|屋]] "house; room" with 至 "go to"). 

''Shi'' 尸 "corpse; cadaver" has a [[variant Chinese character]] [[Wikt:屍|屍]] that combines the "corpse radical" 尸 with ''si'' [[Wikt:死|死]] "dead" (e.g., ''[[jiang shi]]'' 僵屍 "stiff corpse") Michael Carr (2007:358) explains, "This semantically redundant ''shi'' 屍 'dead-corpse' graphically distinguishes the original 'corpse' meaning of ''shi'' 尸from its various other meanings such as 'personator'."

===Meanings===
[[Chinese classics]] used the word ''shi'' 尸 in six meanings: 
*(1) "corpse; body of a dead person"
*(2) "personator of a dead ancestor"
*(3) "motionless; inactive"
*(4) "lay out; arrange; expose"
*(5) "manage; direct; spirit tablet"
*(6) "proper names (of a place, family, and bird)"
Carr (2007:362) outlines the semantic connections among these ''shi'' meanings. The basic meaning (1) "corpse" was semantically extended into both (2) "act on behalf of a corpse" or "personator of a dead ancestor" and (3) "act like a corpse" or "motionless; inactive; doing nothing". Meaning (4) "lay out, arrange; display" generalizes "lay out a corpse." Meaning (5) "manage; direct; ancestral tablet" links the representative ''shi'' (2) "personator" with the metaphorical replacement "ancestral tablet". Meaning (6) uses ''shi'' to transcribe proper names.

Meaning (1) is the core sense of "corpse; dead body; cadaver; carcass". Early ritual texts, notably the ''[[Liji]]'' "Classic of Rites", ''[[Zhouli]]'' "Rites of Zhou", and ''[[Etiquette and Rites|Yili]]'' "Etiquette and Rites", frequently use ''shi'' "corpse" in [[mortuary]] and [[funeral]] contexts. Here is an example ''Liji'' passage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as death took place, the corpse was transferred to the couch, and covered with a large sheet. The clothes in which the deceased had died were removed. A servant plugged the mouth open with the spoon of horn; and to keep the feet from contracting, an easy stool was employed. These observances were the same for a ruler, a great officer, and an ordinary officer. (22, tr. Legge 1885 28:181)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' meaning (2) "personator; sacrificial representative of a dead person's spirit" is discussed below.

Meaning (3) figuratively expands ''shi'' to "corpse-like", which can contextually mean either "motionless; calm; quiescent" or "inactive; negligent; remiss". A ''Shijing'' ode (245, tr. Karlgren 1950:214) laments that, "the good men sit motionless and silent". Karlgren explains, "'The good men act the corpse,' play the part of a representative of the dead at a sacrifice, who sits still and silent during the whole ceremony; here then, remain inactive, do nothing to help." The ''[[Lunyu]]'' ("Confucian Analects") uses ''shi'' to praise [[Confucius]] (tr. Legge 1895 I:235), "In bed, he did not lie like a corpse." Commentators disagree whether this means "sleep with the arms and legs sprawled out" or "sleep facing the north (the land of the dead)".

Meaning (4) is defined as Chinese ''chen'' [[Wikt:陳|陳]] "lay out; set forth, array; arrange; display". Examples in classic texts range from specifically "lay out (a corpse)" to generally "lay out; set out; arrange". The ''Liji'' distinguishes between ''shi'' 尸 "uncoffined corpse" and ''jiu'' [[Wikt:柩|柩]] (with the "wood radical" and a ''jiu'' 匛 "long; enduring" phonetic) "coffined corpse" (tr. Legge 1885 27:117): "(The corpse) on the couch is called [''shi''] (the laid out); when it is put into the coffin, that is called [''jiu''] (being in the long home)." A ''[[Shijing]]'' poem (185, tr. Karlgren 1950) refers to men called off to war, "There are mothers who set forth the (sacrificial) dishes."

Meaning (5) of ''shi'' is defined as ''zhu'' [[Wikt:主|主]] "master; manage, preside; spirit tablet, ancestral tablet". The ''[[Chuci]]'' (tr. Hawkes 1959:55) uses ''shi'' asking about [[King Wu of Zhou]], whose father [[King Wen of Zhou]] did not live to see the conquering of the previous dynasty, Shang-Yin: "When Wu set out to kill Yin, why was he so grieved? He went into the battle carrying the 'corpse.' Why was he in such haste?" Commentators disagree whether this ''shi'' means ''zhu'', specifically ''muzhu'' 木主 "wooden spirit/ancestral tablet" or ''jiu'' "corpse in a coffin". Hawkes justifies translating "corpse": "According to some accounts it was the 'spirit tablet' of his dead father [King Wen] which King Wu carried in his chariot to battle. But I think the poet understood him to have taken the actual corpse, and was surprised that he had not waited to bury it."

The sinologists Eduard Erkes and Bernhard Karlgren debated this ''Chuci'' usage of ''shi'' "corpse; spirit tablet". Erkes (1928) proposed that the ''zhu'' was a wooden ancestral tablet shaped in the image of the deceased. Karlgren (1930) disagreed and argued that the ''zhu'' was phallic shaped:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He seems to think that the substitution of [muzhu] 'wooden tablet' for the corpse (if really a corpse is intended; the word shi is ambiguous) proves the [muzhu] to have been an image of the corpse, and therefore he translates [muzhu] by 'wooden statue.' Nothing could be more arbitrary. The [muzhu], wooden ancestral tablet, was the resting place of the ancestor's spirit, once his body was dead and decomposed. In this sense it was a substitute for his body, his spiritual force had entered it, and therefore it was carried into battle, bringing this mental force of his into play on the side of his descendant. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erkes (1931) countered Karlgren by citing other texts describing a human-shaped ''muzhu'' "wooden lord". For instance, the ''[[Shiji]]'' ("Record of History", tr. Erkes) records this King Wu story with ''muzhu'' instead of ''shi'': "He (viz. Wu-Wang) made a wooden image of Wen-Wang and took it with [him] on his carriage into the battle." Erkes further suggested, "very probably the custom of carrying a [muzhu] into battle had developed from an earlier one of taking the body itself, and that therefore the [muzhu] was something representing the corpse, i.e., an image of the deceased."

Meaning (6) includes some semantically unrelated usages of ''shi''. ''Shi'' 尸 is an ancient place name (in [[Henan]]); a surname (e.g., the [[Syncretism (Chinese philosophy)|Syncretist]] philosopher [[Shizi (book)|Shizi]] 尸子, ca. 390–330 BCE); and a variant of ''shi'' [[Wikt:鳲|鳲]] (which is used in bird names like ''shijiu'' 鳲鳩 "cuckoo; turtledove").

===Pronunciations and etymologies===
The [[Standard Chinese]] ''shī'' pronunciation of 尸 phonologically descends from (ca. 6th century CE) [[Middle Chinese]] and (ca. 6th century BCE) [[Old Chinese]]. Compare these Middle and Old Chinese reconstructions of ''shi'' 尸 "corpse" and ''yi'' 夷 "barbarian" (which anciently had interchangeable characters): ''śi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸and ''i'' &lt; *''djər'' 夷 ([[Bernhard Karlgren]] 1957), ''syij'' &lt; *''hljij'' 尸and ''yij'' &lt; *''ljɨj'' 夷 (William Baxter 1992), and ''śi'' &lt; *''lhi'' 尸 and ''ji'' &lt; *''ləi'' 夷 (Axel Schuessler 2009).

There are several hypothetical [[etymologies]] for ''shi'' "corpse". Karlgren proposed that ''si'' &lt; *''sjər'' 死 "die, dead" and ''shi'' &lt; *''śjər'' 尸 "the dead, corpse" were etymologically [[cognate]]. Paul K. Benedict (1972) suggested possible [[Proto-Sino-Tibetan]] roots for ''shi'': either *''(s-)raw'' "corpse; carcass" or *''siy'' "die". Schuessler (2007) hypothesizes a semantic development from *''li'' 夷 "extend; expose; display; set out; spread out" to *''lhi'' 尸 "to spread out; lie down flat (in order to sleep); motionless; to set forth (sacrificial dishes)", to "personator of a dead ancestor", to "corpse". He rejects Karlgren's assumption that ''shi'' "corpse" is cognate to ''si'' "to die", "because the MC [Middle Chinese] initial ''ś-'' (&lt; *''lh-'', *''nh-'', *''hj-'') never derives from an *''s-'', except when they share an initial *''l'' or *''n''."

===Translations===
English translations of the ceremonial ''shi'' 尸 include ''[[personator]]'', ''[[impersonator]]'', ''[[:wikt:representative|representative]]'', ''[[Mediumship|medium]]'', and ''[[shaman]]''. Carr reviews the choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Obviously, rendering this into English is problematic because there is no Western analogy for the ceremonial ''shi'' 'corpse.' ''Personator'' is chosen as the nearest English translation. ''Impersonator'' would be possible, but this word implies falsehood, which was not originally associated with the ''shi''. ''Representative'' is too general in meaning, and does not usually have a sense of spirituality, unless modified by ''of the dead/ancestor''. Paper [1995] suggests ''Incorporator of the Dead'', which has a parallel 'one who embodies' etymology, but the derivate words ''incorporate'' and ''incorporation'' commonly have other meanings. ''Medium'' and ''shaman'' are similar with ''shi'' in meaning and are part of Chinese traditions; however, the descriptions of a dignified personator are unlike the spirit-possession of either. Another translational tactic would be to coin a [[nonce word]], such as Waley's [1937] "the Dead One," Eberhard's [1968] "death boy," or Wilhelm's [1967] "corpse boy," but the sense of such a coinage is not always clear. Therefore, in the absence of a better English word, ''personator'' will translate this meaning of ''shi''. (2007:364-365) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early descriptions==
Zhou Dynasty classic texts (c. 11th-3rd centuries BCE) use the word ''shi'' 尸 hundreds of times. Lothar von Falkenhausen contrasts the frequently recorded ''shi'' "personator" with the rarely noted [[Wu (shaman)|''wu'']] [[Wikt:巫|巫]] "shaman; spirit medium". 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At ancestral sacrifices, the ancestral spirits descend into individuals designated from among their descendants, the "Impersonators" (''shi'' 尸). Occupying their ritual rôle by virtue of their kinship position vis-à-vis the ancestor that is sacrificed to, the Impersonators are not trained religious specialists like the Spirit Mediums. Although it has been speculated that the actions of the ''shi'' may have originally involved trance and possession, the surviving source materials — none earlier than the Western Zhou period — show them as staid and passive, acting with the utmost demeanor and dignity. (1995) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some early ''shi'' meanings are contextually ambiguous. For instance, the ''[[Yijing]]'' ("Book of Changes") uses ''yu shi'' [[Wikt:輿|輿]]尸 "carry corpses; corpse carrier" twice for [[I Ching hexagrams#Hexagram 7|Hexagram 7]] (tr. Wilhelm 1967:34-35): "Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon. Misfortune … Let the eldest lead the army. The younger transports corpses. Then perseverance brings misfortune." [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] summarizes the ''Yijing'' commentaries.
&lt;blockquote&gt; Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been usurped by others. (1967:34) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Marshall (2002:77) concludes this hexagram refers to carrying a corpse, and compares the "Israelites carrying the Ark of the Covenant into battle against the Philistines".

===Shijing===
The ''[[Shijing]]'' ("Classic of Poetry", ca. 11th-6th centuries BCE) contains early and detailed descriptions of personation ceremonies, in the following themes.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an abundance of sacrificial wine and food (odes 166, 209, 210, and 248) shared by both the ancestral spirits (through the personator) and their descendants. Drunkenness is frequently mentioned: 209/5 "The spirits [note: 'souls' not 'liquor'] are all drunk," 209/6 "all are happy; they are drunk," 247/1, 2 "We are drunk with wine," and 248/5 "the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry." Most significantly, the ancestral spirits speak directly through the intoxicated personators (166, 210, and 247), approve of the sacrificial offerings, and bless their descendants (166, 209, 210, 247, and 248). (Carr 2007:369) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Shi'' "personator" occurs fourteen times in two pairs of consecutive ''Shijing'' odes (209–210 and 247–248, tr. Karlgren 1950:203-204). Ode 209 says "we make (the representative of the dead) sit at ease, we (assist him =) encourage him to eat" and "The august representative of the dead then rises, the drums and bells (by their sound) escort away the representative." The following ode 210 describes sacrificial wine and food, "he presents them  to our representative of the dead and to our guests."

''Shijing'' odes 247 and 248, which portray ancestral feasts to the Zhou royal house, exclusively use the term ''gongshi'' 公尸 with the modifier ''gong'' [[Wikt:公|公]] "prince; duke; public; palace; effort". Compare these ''gongshi'' translations: "representative of the (dead) princes" (Karlgren), "personators of your ancestors" (Legge, admitting 1895 IV:447, "The expression 公尸, 'ducal personators,' is somewhat difficult to account for"), "impersonator of the Ancient", "ducal Dead", or "Dead One" (Waley, noting 1937:215, "Impersonator of a former Duke or ruler"). Ode 247 (''Jizui'' 既醉 "Already Drunk") describes a sacrificial feast for ancestral spirits, and says "the representative of the (dead) princes makes a happy announcement".

Ode 248 (''Fuyi'' 鳧鷖 "Wild Ducks") describes another feast, which commentators say was held on the following day to reward the personator, and details sacrificial offerings and ancestral blessings.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The wild ducks are on the [Jing] (river); the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is at peace; your wine is clear, your viands are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (achieve, complete you =) make you perfect. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the sands; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and (approves =) finds it good; your wine is plentiful, your viands are fine; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and (act for =) favor you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are on the island; the representative of the (dead) prices comes and feasts and reposes; your wine is strained, your viands are sliced; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and descend on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are at the junction of the river; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is (treated in temple-fashion =) revered; the feast is in the temple, that is where felicity and blessings descend; the representative feasts and drinks; felicity and blessings come and are piled up (heavily =) amply on you. &lt;br&gt;
The wild ducks are in the gorge; the representative of the (dead) princes comes and feasts and is befumed (by the spirits); the good wine makes you merry; the roast and broiled things are fragrant; the representative feasts and drinks; there will be no after trouble. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the ''Shijing'', other texts refer to ''shi'' frequently drinking sacrificial [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|''jiu'']] 酒 "alcoholic beverage; liquor", which Paper (1995:113) interprets as a ritual means to induce hallucinations of ancestral spirits. Based upon a ''Liji'' ceremony (tr. Legge 1885 28:246) describing a ''shi'' personator drinking nine cups of ''jiu'', with an estimated alcohol content from 5% to 8%, and volume measurements of Zhou bronze sacrificial cups, Paper (1995:114) calculates a "conservative estimate is that the ''shi'' consumed between 2.4 and 3.9 ounces of pure alcohol (equivalent to between 5 and 8 bar shots of eighty-proof liquor)."

===Child personators===
Several texts refer to a Chinese custom that a personator should be a child of the same sex as the dead ancestor, preferably either a legitimate grandson or his wife. However, personation by younger relatives, who were of lower [[social status]] than their elders, created an exception to traditional Chinese culture. The earliest textual reference comes from the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]]'' ("Book of Mencius") questioning the status shown to a younger brother during the personation ceremony.
&lt;blockquote&gt;You should ask him, "Which do you respect most, — your uncle, or your younger brother?" He will answer, "My uncle." Ask him again, "If your younger brother be personating a dead ancestor, to which do you show the greater respect, — to him or to your uncle?" He will say, "To my younger brother." You can go on, "But where is the respect due, as you said, to your uncle?" He will reply to this, "I show the respect to my younger brother because of the position which he occupies." (6, tr. Legge 1895 IV:400). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Liji'' reiterates that personation contradicted the established social hierarchy (18, tr. Legge 1895 28:88): "Thus it is that there are two among his subjects whom the ruler does not treat as subjects. When one is personating (his ancestor) he does not treat him as such, nor does he treat his master as such." Another ''Liji'' passage (7, tr. Legge 1895 27:337-338) explains: "A rule of propriety says, 'A superior man may carry his grandson in his arms, but not his son.' This tells us that a grandson may be the personator of his deceased grandfather (at sacrifices), but a son cannot be so of his father." When a grandson personated his grandfather's spirit, it reversed the normal family hierarchy and a father would have to worship his own son. 

Scholars have differing hypotheses explaining why a grandchild would make the most suitable personator. [[Marcel Granet]] (1930:337–338) said the basic reason was a predominance of uterine over agnatic [[primogeniture]]; the grandfather is the closest of the uterine relatives, and thus closer to his grandson than the father is. [[Wolfram Eberhard]] (1968:338) explained that a child makes the best personator owing to the ancient Chinese believed that a soul is small. [[Julian Jaynes]] (1976:344–345) mentions a Greek parallel; the philosopher [[Iamblichus]] wrote that "young and simple persons" make the most suitable mediums. Stephen Bokenkamp mentions examples besides ''shi'' rituals.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In China, possessions by spirits that occurred outside of this ritual scenario often involved younger members of the family as well. As in instances of mediumism around the world, the youthful and illiterate were regarded as more reliable conduits to the dead, since they could hardly be suspected of having fabricated their utterances and writings themselves. This fact brings to the fore questions of power. Women and junior male members of a family frequently found that mediumism was a way to bring attention to their own, otherwise easily ignored, concerns. (2007:40) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Female personators===
Two ritual texts mention female personators. The ''Liji'' (15, tr. Legge 1885 28:75) describes a wife personating her husband's dead grandmother: "A wife, on festive occasions, even though it were on receiving a gift from the ruler, (only) made a curtsy. When seated as a personatrix (of the deceased grandmother of her husband), she did not bow with her head to her hands, but made the curtsy." The ''Yili'' (14, tr. Steele 1917:119.) euphemistically says a female personator should preferably not be the wife of a concubine's grandson; "A man personates a dead man, and a woman a woman. In the latter case a woman of a different surname is chosen, and as such not one of inferior standing."

===Historical changes in personation===
Several early texts and commentaries reiterate a traditional history of personation beginning in the second millennium BCE as a sacred communion with ancestral spirits, but ending as a drinking party in the late 1st millennium BCE. When the personation ceremony supposedly originated during the [[Xia Dynasty]] (ca. 2100-ca. 1600 BCE), a personator would make contact with the dead ancestral spirit before sitting down to eat and drink. During the Yin or Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), a personator would sometimes sit down without having contacted the spirit, and by the late Zhou Dynasty (1045-256 BCE), a personation ceremony became a revelry with several personators repeatedly making toasts and drinking sacrificial wines.

Two ''Liji'' chapters describe how personation rituals changed during the Zhou period.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the [Zhou] dynasty the representatives of the dead sat. Their monitors and cup-suppliers observed no regular rules. The usages were the same (as those of Yin [Shang]), and the underlying principle was one. Under the [Xia] dynasty, the personators had stood till the sacrifice was ended (whereas) under the Yin [Shang] they sat. Under [Zhou], when the cup went round among all, there were six personators. [Zengzi] said, "The usages of [Zhou] might be compared to a subscription club." (10, tr. Legge 1885 27:405-406) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;(When the representative of the departed) had made the libation with the [jia] cup, or the horn, (the sacrificer) was told (to bow to him) to put him at ease. Anciently, the representative stood when nothing was being done; when anything was being done, he sat. He personated the spirit. The officer of prayer was the medium of communication between him and the sacrificer. (11, tr. Legge 1885 27:446) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later sources repeat this legendary history of personation. For example, He Xiu 何休's 2nd-century commentary to the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals|Chunqiu]]'' ("Spring and Autumn Annals") ''[[Gongyang Zhuan]]'' says (tr. Carr 2007:371), "The Xia had standing personators, the Shang [Yin] had sitting personators, and the Zhou had six personators who would make serial toasts." Granet (1930:337) mentions the Zhou personation parties: "It was not long before this archaic custom was criticized by the ritualists. When the sacrifices were offered simultaneously to several ancestors each of whom was represented, the ceremony was found indeed to assume a displeasing likeness to a picnic."

===Doubts about personation===
The above ''Liji'' description of Zhou "subscription club" personation ceremonies quotes [[Confucius]]'s student and compiler [[Zengzi]] (505-436 BCE). The ''Liji'' contains three passages where Zengzi questions his teacher about whether personators were needed for ancestral rituals. For instance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Zengzi] asked, "Is it necessary that there should be a representative of the dead in sacrifices? Or may he be dispensed with as when the satisfying offerings are made to the dead?" Confucius said, "In sacrificing to a full-grown man for whom there have been the funeral rites, there must be such a representative, who should be a grandson; and if the grandson is too young, someone must be employed to carry him in his arms. If there be no grandson, some one of the same surname should be selected for the occasion. In sacrificing to the one who had died prematurely, there are (only) the satisfying offerings, for he was not full-grown. To sacrifice to a full-grown man, for whom there have been the funeral rites without a representative, would be to treat him as if he had died prematurely." (7, tr. Legge 1885 27:337-338) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hypothetical origins ==
Chinese scholars have long disagreed about when and how ''shi'' personation originated. Henri Doré (1914 1:99-102) summarizes the four principal opinions, which are worth quoting in full.

The first opinion is that personation was a bygone superstition. The [[Tang Dynasty]] historian [[Du You]] criticizes the ''shi'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients employed a personator. This rite deserves censure, and has been abolished by our great Worthies. One vied with the other in practicing it. Now that an era of progress has set in, and these silly customs have disappeared, it is important not to revive them; common sense bids to refrain from them. Some half-baked literati of our days would fain re-establish this ceremony of the personator. This is quite absurd. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second opinion is that the personator was not the agent of the departed, but merely its metaphorical representative or ''shenxiang'' 神象 "image of the spirit". The [[Han Dynasty]] historian [[Ban Gu]] explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The personator is found in the ceremony wherein sacrifice is offered to ancestors, because the soul emitting no perceptible sounds and having no visible form, the loving sentiment of filial piety finds no means of displaying itself, hence a personator has been chosen to whom meats are offered, after which he breaks the bowls, quite rejoiced, as if his own father had eaten plenty. The personator, drinking abundantly, imparts the illusion that it is the soul which is satiated. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Carr (2007:386) notes, "This passage sounds as though Ban had personally observed a personation ceremony."    
   
Some [[Qing Dynasty]] scholars held a third opinion, namely, that the personator was bearer of the ancestral tablet. The ''Jishuo quanzhen'' 集說詮真 "Collected Sayings Explaining Truth" says, "The filial son chooses a personator to carry the tablet, but not to be the resting place of the soul of the dead person. His intention is therefore manifest." The ''Yuzhou dayiyi'' 宇宙大疑議 "Discussion of Universal Great Doubts" says: "The personator is employed during sacrifices to the dead, in order to carry the ancestral tablet … hence there is no need of having such a one immediately after death, as the tablet is not yet erected."

The fourth opinion refutes the first three condemnations of personators as mere representatives or tablet-holders for the dead, and contends that a personator was temporarily the seat of a dead ancestor's soul. Two leading [[Neo-Confucianist]] philosophers held this judgment.
[[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] writes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ancients, when sacrificing to the dead, employed the personator, because the soul and the vital force of the dead person after being separated from the body, seek an agent of the same nature. Now, men being all of the same kind, the father and the children being all of one family and of the same stock, the soul of the departed person is requested to come and establish its seat in one of them as in an agent. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
His follower [[Zhu Xi]] concurs:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times all employed a personator when sacrificing to the dead. Since the descendants continue the life of their ancestors, the personator shares, therefore, in the life of the departed person, and the ancestor's soul descends undoubtedly upon his descendants, and reposes therein to enjoy the sacrifice offered. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Carr (2007:387-388) offers a contemporary explanation for ''shi'' "corpse" personation: [[Julian Jaynes]]'s psychological [[Bicameralism (psychology)|bicameralism]] hypothesis. Jaynes proposed that human "[[consciousness]]", meaning [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]], began evolving around 1000 BCE. Prior to that, ancient people had "bicameral mentality" in which one part of the brain "spoke" (often in an [[authority figure]]'s voice) while another part listened and obeyed. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the theory of the bicameral mind, hallucinations of a person in some authority could continue after death as an everyday matter. And hence the almost universal custom of feeding the corpses after death, and burying them with the appurtenances of life. (Jaynes 1976:290) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
If the original personators were bicameral, they could have directly hallucinated voices from a ''shi'' "corpse". Carr notes the historical correspondence between Jaynes's first millennium BCE timeline for the breakdown of the bicameral mind in other parts of the world and the 11th-3rd centuries BCE personation practices in China.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Several early sources give variations of the same chronicle about the personation ceremony. It began during the Xia Dynasty, when personators would communicate on behalf of the dead; continued during the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties; but was criticized and discontinued after the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when personators were no longer able to speak for the dead. (2007:387) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:SanXingDui ZongMuMianJu.jpg|thumb|[[Sanxingdui]] bronze mask]]
Wearing [[Ritual mask#Ritual masks|ritual masks]] is a recent hypothesis about ''shi''. Paper (1995:82) suggested the possibility that Shang and Zhou ''shi'' wore bronze masks "symbolizing the spirit of the dead to whom the sacrifices were offered". Liu believes the phantasmagoric bronze masks discovered at [[Sanxingdui]], dating from c. 12th-11th centuries BCE, might have been ritually worn by ''shi'' 尸.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''shi'' was generally a close, young relative who wore a costume (possibly including a mask) reproducing the features of the dead person. The ''shi'' was an impersonator, that is, a person serving as a reminder of the ancestor to whom sacrifice was being offered. During such a ceremony, the impersonator was much more than an actor in a drama. Although the exact meaning may have been different, the group of Sanxingdui masked figures in bronze all have the character of an impersonator. It is likely the masks were used to impersonate and identify with certain supernatural beings in order to effect some communal good. (2000:37) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">The '''social genome''' is the collection of data about members of a society that is captured in ever-larger and ever-more complex databases (e.g., government administrative data, operational data, social media data etc.).  Some have used the term [[digital footprint]] to refer to individual traces.

== History ==
There have been two distinct uses of the term.  First, the word Social Genome was used in a letter to the editor submission to Science in response to a seminal article about using big data for social science by King.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ensuring the Data-Rich Future of the Social Sciences|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/331/6018/719|journal = Science|date = 2011-02-11|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 21311013|pages = 719–721|volume = 331|issue = 6018|doi = 10.1126/science.1197872|first = Gary|last = King}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Dealing with data: governments records|last = Kum|first = Hye-Chung|date = June 10, 2011|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.332.6035.1263-a|pmid = 21659589|last2 = Ahalt|first2 = Stanley|last3 = Carsey|first3 = Thomas M.|authorlink3=Thomas M. Carsey|volume = 332|issue = 6035|page = 1263}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published, but the word social genome was edited out of the letter.  The original submission states, “A well-integrated federated data system of administrative databases updated on an ongoing basis could hold a collective representation of our society, our social genome.” Kum and others continue to use the word since 2011, with it being defined in a peer reviewed article in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Privacy-by-Design: Understanding Data Access Models for Secondary Data|journal = AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings AMIA Summit on Translational Science|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 2153-4063|pmc = 3845756|pmid = 24303251|pages = 126–130|volume = 2013|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = Stanley|last2 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It states “Today there is a constant flow of data into, out of, and between ever-larger and ever-more complex databases about people. Together, these digital traces collectively capture our social genome, the footprints of our society.”  In 2014, a vision paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Genome: Putting Big Data to Work for Population Informatics|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6678338&amp;url=http%253A%252F%252Fieeexplore.ieee.org%252Fiel7%252F2%252F5306045%252F06678338.pdf%253Farnumber%253D6678338|journal = Computer|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 0018-9162|pages = 56–63|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/MC.2013.405|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = A.|last2 = Krishnamurthy|first3 = A.|last3 = Machanavajjhala|first4 = S.C.|last4 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[population informatics]] was published which further elaborated on the term.

Second, separately at about the same time, a group of researchers led by the Brookings Institution started the [http://www.brookings.edu/about/centers/ccf/social-genome-project Social Genome Project] which built a data-rich model to map the pathway to the Middle class by tracing the life course from birth until middle age.  The first paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pathways to the Middle Class: Balancing Personal and Public Responsibilities|url = http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/09/20-pathways-middle-class-sawhill-winship|website = The Brookings Institution|date = 2012-09-20|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2012.

[[File:Genomics GTL Program Payoffs.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ecological analysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an [[ecosystem]]]]
'''Systems ecology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[ecology]], a subset of [[Earth system science]], that takes a [[holism|holistic]] approach to the study of ecological systems, especially [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shugart, Herman H., and Robert V. O'Neill. "Systems ecology". Dowden, Hutchingon &amp; Ross, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyne, George M. "Ecosystems, Systems Ecology, and Systems Ecologists". ORNL- 3975.

Central to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a [[complex system]] exhibiting [[emergent properties]].  Systems ecology focuses on interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems, and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions.  It uses and extends concepts from [[thermodynamics]] and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems.

==Overview==
Systems ecology seeks a [[Holism|holistic]] view of the interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems. Systems ecologists realise that the function of any ecosystem can be influenced by human economics in fundamental ways.  They have therefore taken an additional transdisciplinary step by including economics in the consideration of [[ecological economics|ecological-economic]] systems. In the words of [[R.L. Kitching]]:&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Kitching 1983, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Systems ecology can be defined as the approach to the study of ecology of organisms using the techniques and philosophy of systems analysis: that is, the methods and tools developed, largely in engineering, for studying, characteriszing and making predictions about complex entities, that is, systems..
* ''In any study of an ecological system, an essential early procedure is to draw a diagram of the system of interest ... diagrams indicate the system's '''boundaries''' by a solid line. Within these boundaries, series of components are isolated which have been chosen to represent that portion of the world in which the systems analyst is interested ... If there are no connections across the systems' boundaries with the surrounding '''systems environments''', the systems are described as ''closed''. Ecological work, however, deals almost exclusively with ''open'' systems.''&lt;ref&gt;(Kitching 1983, p.11)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mode of scientific enquiry, a central feature of Systems Ecology is the general application of the [[principles of energetics]] to all systems at any scale. Perhaps the most notable proponent of this view was [[Howard T. Odum]] - sometimes considered the father of ecosystems ecology. In this approach the principles of energetics constitute [[ecosystem principles]]. Reasoning by [[formal analogy]] from one system to another enables the Systems Ecologist to see principles functioning in an analogous manner across system-scale boundaries. H.T. Odum commonly used the [[Energy Systems Language]] as a tool for making systems diagrams and flow charts.

The fourth of these principles, the [[Maximum power principle|principle of maximum power efficiency]], takes central place in the analysis and synthesis of ecological systems. The fourth principle suggests that the most evolutionarily advantageous system function occurs when the environmental load matches the internal resistance of the system. The further the environmental load is from matching the internal resistance, the further the system is away from its sustainable steady state. Therefore, the systems ecologist engages in a task of resistance and impedance matching in [[ecological engineering]], just as the [[electronic engineer]] would do.

===Deep ecology===
{{Main article|Deep ecology}}

Deep ecology is an ideology whose metaphysical underpinnings are deeply concerned with the science of ecology. The term was coined by [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]], a Norwegian philosopher, [[Gandhi]]an scholar, and [[environmental activist]]. He argues that the prevailing approach to [[environmental management]] is [[anthropocentric]], and that the natural environment is not only "more complex than we imagine, it is more complex than we can imagine."&lt;ref&gt;A statement attributed to British biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]]&lt;/ref&gt; Naess formulated deep ecology in 1973 at an environmental conference in Budapest.

[[Joanna Macy]], [[John Seed]], and others developed Naess' thesis into a branch they called ''experiential deep ecology''. Their efforts were motivated by a need they perceived for the development of an "[[ecological self]]", which views the human ego as an integrated part of a living system that encompasses the individual. They sought to transcend [[altruism]] with a deeper self-interest based on [[biospherical equality]] beyond human chauvinism.

===Earth systems engineering and management===
{{Main article|Earth systems engineering and management}}
Earth systems engineering and management (ESEM) is a discipline used to analyze, design, engineer and manage [[Complexity|complex]] [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[system]]s.  It entails a wide range of subject areas including anthropology, engineering, [[environmental science]], ethics and philosophy. At its core, ESEM looks to "rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion"

===Ecological economics===
{{Main article|Ecological economics}}
Ecological economics is a transdisciplinary field of academic research that addresses the dynamic and spatial interdependence between human economies and natural [[ecosystem]]s. Ecological economics brings together and connects different disciplines, within the natural and social sciences but especially between these broad areas. As the name suggests, the field is made up of researchers with a background in [[economics]] and [[ecology]]. An important motivation for the emergence of ecological economics has been criticism on the assumptions and approaches of traditional (mainstream) [[Environmental economics|environmental and resource economics]].

===Ecological energetics===
{{Main article|Ecological energetics}}
Ecological energetics is the quantitative study of the flow of energy through ecological systems. It aims to uncover the [[Scientific law|principles]] which describe the propensity of such energy flows through the trophic, or 'energy availing' levels of ecological networks. In systems ecology the principles of ecosystem energy flows or "ecosystem laws" (i.e. principles of ecological energetics) are considered formally analogous to the [[principles of energetics]].

===Ecological humanities===
{{Main article|Ecological humanities}}
Ecological humanities aims to bridge the divides between the sciences and the humanities, and between [[Western culture|Western]], [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] ways of knowing nature. Like ecocentric political theory, the ecological humanities are characterised by a connectivity ontology and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to [[Ecology|ecological]] laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system.

===Ecosystem ecology===

[[File:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA)]]
{{Main article|Ecosystem ecology}}
Ecosystem ecology is the integrated study of [[Life|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s. Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structure and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact.

The relationship between systems ecology and ecosystem ecology is complex.  Much of systems ecology can be considered a subset of ecosystem ecology.  Ecosystem ecology also utilizes methods that have little to do with the holistic approach of systems ecology.  However, systems ecology more actively considers external influences such as economics that usually fall outside the bounds of ecosystem ecology.  Whereas ecosystem ecology can be defined as the scientific study of ecosystems, systems ecology is more of a particular approach to the study of ecological systems and phenomena that interact with these systems.

===Industrial ecology===
{{Main article|Industrial ecology}}
Industrial ecology is the study of [[industrial process]]es as linear (open loop) systems, in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste, to a closed loop system where wastes become inputs for new processes.

The '''''Guide To Getting It On!''''' is a [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] guide by research psychoanalyst [[Paul Joannides (psychoanalyst)|Paul Joannides]], illustrated by the comic book artist [[Dærick Gröss, Sr.]]  A 9th edition was released in 2017.

[[File:Cover of the 7th edition, Guide To Getting It On.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 7th edition]]

==Style==

The book uses informal language and quotations extensively to illustrate the points the author makes. These quotations are from males and females, of a broad age range, that the author has interviewed during his research or who sent letters to him after publication of previous editions of the book.

It is illustrated throughout with realistic body drawings. It also uses comic-like drawings to maintain a light-hearted approach, such as a drawing of a vagina and a penis, both with eyes, mouth, nose, hands and feet, having a dialogue.

'''[[Timeline]] of [[neutron star]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova]]e, and [[white dwarf]]s'''

Note that this list is mainly about the development of knowledge, but also about some supernovae taking place. For a separate list of the latter, see the article [[List of supernovae]]. All dates refer to when the supernova was observed on Earth or would have been observed on Earth had powerful enough telescopes existed at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4149">In astronomy, a '''transit instrument''' is a small [[telescope]] with extremely precisely graduated [[telescope mount|mount]] used for the precise observation of [[star position]]s.  They were previously widely used in [[astronomical observatory|astronomical observatories]] and [[naval observatory|naval observatories]] to measure star positions in order to compile [[nautical almanac]]s for use by mariners for [[celestial navigation]], and observe [[star transit]]s to set extremely accurate clocks ([[regulator clock|astronomical regulator]]s) which were used to set [[marine chronometer]]s carried on ships to determine [[longitude]], and as primary time standards before atomic clocks.  The instruments can be divided into three groups:
[[Image:Meridian Circle - Kuffner Observatory.jpg|thumb|right|Meridian circle at the [[Kuffner observatory]] in Vienna, Austria]]

== Meridian instruments ==
for observation of [[star transit]]s in the exact direction of South or North:
* [[Meridian circle]]s, [[Mural quadrant]]s etc.
* [[Passage instrument]]s (transportable, also for [[prime vertical]] transits)

== Universal instruments ==
which allow transit measurements in ''any'' direction
* [[Theodolite]] (Describing a theodolite as a ''transit'' may refer to the ability to turn the telescope a full rotation on the horizontal axis, which provides a convenient way to reverse the direction of view, or to sight the same object with the yoke in opposite directions, which causes some instrumental errors to cancel.) (Wolf and Brinker 183&amp;ndash;6)
* [[Altaz]] telescopes with graduated eyepieces (also for satellite transits)
* [[Cinetheodolite]]s

== Zenith instruments and Astrolabes ==
* [[Zenith telescope]]
* [[Photozenith tube]] (PZT)
* [[zenith camera]]s
* Danjon [[astrolabe]], Zeiss [[Ni2]] astrolabe, [[Circumzenital]]

== Observation techniques and accuracy ==
Depending on the type of instrument, the measurements are carried out
* visually and manual time registration ([[stopwatch]], Auge-Ohr-Methode, [[chronograph]])
* visually by [[impersonal micrometer]] (moving thread with automatic registration)
* photographic registration
* [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] or other [[electro optic]] sensors.

The accuracy reaches from 0.2" (theodolites, small astrolabes) to 0.01" (modern meridian circles, Danjon). Early instruments (like the mural quadrants of [[Tycho Brahe]]) had ''no telescope'' and were limited to about 0.01°.

== History ==
===Origins===
The University of Agriculture, Faisalabad ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|جامعہ زرعيه فيصل آباد}}}}), (formally: ''Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute''), is a [[university]] in the city of [[Faisalabad]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It was established in 1906&lt;ref name=uaf&gt;http://uaf.edu.pk/faculties/agri/agri_history.html, History and Faculties of the University of Agriculture, [[Faisalabad]], Retrieved 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as the first major institution of higher agricultural education in the [[Punjab (British India)|undivided Punjab]].

At independence in 1947, Pakistan was a predominantly agricultural country. In spite of subsequent [[industrialization]] and development, [[agriculture]] remains central to its [[economy]]. After independence, the [[Government of Pakistan]] appointed the National Commissions on Food and Education to reform the existing [[agrarian system]] and to formulate measures for developing better agricultural potential. The commissions made a plea for the establishment of an agricultural university for research and education. It was established by upgrading the former Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute in 1961. It was the first university built by the British Empire in 1906 with the foundation stone laying ceremony by Sir Louis Dane, the then Lieutenant and Governor of the Punjab.

The 1,950-acre campus represents both history and the present era. The new campus is lush green with a conglomeration of monolithic blocks built in modern style. The old campus is reminiscent of traditional Muslim architecture. The main campus is situated in the centre of the city (12&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the [[Faisalabad International Airport]]), about 2&amp;nbsp;km away from city centre/ clock tower.

UAF owns and operates major cultural assets such as the [[Zoology Museum]], [[UAF Art Gallery]], [[University Library]] 

The university's [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] employs more than 800 teachers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The university has boys and girls hostels. It accommodates over 5,000 students and approximately 3,000 day scholars. Premier hostels are Jinnah Hostel (named after the founder of Pakistan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]), [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] Hall, [[Fatima Jinnah]] Hostel and [[Haley Hall]].

==Organisation and administration==
===Faculties and departments===
UAF is organised into faculties of Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Food Nutrition and Home Economics, Social sciences, Animal Husbandry, Food Sciences, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Plant and Animal Breeding, Veterinary Science, Doctor of Pharmacy, Mathematics, Statistics and Sciences. A community college is on the main [[campus]] in [[Faisalabad]]. The College of Veterinary Sciences at [[Lahore]] was affiliated and is now a distinct entity known as the [[University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences|University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore]] (UVAS).

These units offer programmes leading to bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in agriculture and allied fields. [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan|HEC]] ranks the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad as the best in the agriculture/veterinary field in Pakistan. The University of Agriculture [[Faisalabad]] ranked number 4 among the top 10 universities in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hec.gov.pk/english/universities/Documents/Ranking_Doc%20(2015).pdf, Ranking 2015- Overall Top 10 Higher Education Institutions, ranking table listings by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (HEC), a [[Government of Pakistan]] governing body, Retrieved 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faculty of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, established in 1963, with its constituent departments of Agricultural Economics, Farm Management, Agricultural Marketing, Cooperation and Credit and Rural Sociology, has now been functioning for over 51 years in the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. It has endeavored to keep abreast with requirements in terms of academic programmes/activities over these years. However, looking at the likely shape of agricultural development, the direction and quality of research and the make-up of trained manpower output in the discipline of agricultural social sciences, the future trends need to be looked into seriously so as to be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

A perusal of the functioning of the constituent departments of the faculty showed that over the years the programmes of some of the departments had become less demanding in academic and research output in line with the present day requirements. Especially under WTO set up, where there has been a shift from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture putting further pressure to shift the emphasis to resource management strategy. Therefore, there was a strong need for a meaningful restructuring and fine tuning of the faculty to meet the challenges of the emerging requirements of the economy in the coming years.

Keeping in view this need of time, the Faculty was restructured in 2012. The name of faculty was changed to Faculty of Social Sciences. The departments of Agricultural Economics, Development Economics, and Environmental &amp; Resource Economics were merged into a new institute, Institute of Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics (IARE). Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq is the first director of IARE, having served from June 2012.

Institute of Agricultural and Resource Economics now offers degree programs serving the needs of society:
* BSc (Hons) Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics (4 years)
* MSc (Hons) Agricultural Economics (2 years)

'''Urban sociology''' is the [[sociology|sociological]] study of life and human interaction in [[metropolitan area]]s. It is a [[normative]] discipline of sociology seeking to study the structures, environmental processes, changes and problems of an [[urban area]] and by doing so provide inputs for [[urban planning]] and policy making. In other words, it is the sociological study of cities and their role in the development of society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/urban+sociology Dictionary reference]&lt;/ref&gt;
Like most areas of sociology, urban sociologists use statistical analysis, observation, social theory, interviews, and other methods to study a range of topics, including migration and demographic trends, economics, poverty, race relations and economic trends&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gans, H.J., 2017. Urban Sociology in Trump's America and Beyond. City &amp; Community, 16(2), pp.127-130.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The philosophical foundations of modern urban sociology originate from the work of sociologists such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Émile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]] who studied and theorized the economic, social and cultural processes of [[urbanization]] and its effects on [[social alienation]], class formation, and the production or destruction of collective and individual identities.

These theoretical foundations were further expanded upon and analyzed by a group of sociologists and researchers who worked at the University of Chicago in the early twentieth century. In what became known as the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School of sociology]] the work of [[Robert E. Park|Robert Park]], [[Louis Wirth]] and [[Ernest Burgess]] on the inner city of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] revolutionized the purpose of urban research in sociology but also the development of [[human geography]] through its use of quantitative and ethnographic research methods. The importance of the theories developed by the Chicago School within urban sociology have been critically sustained and critiqued but still remain one of the most significant historical advancements in understanding [[urbanization]] and the city within the social sciences.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;Martin, D.G., "Chicago School" in D. Gregory, R. Johnston, G. Pratt, M. Watts and S. Whatmore, eds., ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', London: Blackwell, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and rise of urban sociology==
{{further|Chicago school (sociology)}}

Urban sociology rose to prominence within the academy in North America through a group of sociologists and theorists at the University of Chicago from 1915 to 1940 in what became known as the Chicago School of Sociology. The Chicago School of Sociology combined sociological and anthropological theory with ethnographic fieldwork in order to understand how individuals interact within urban social systems.&lt;ref name=Flanagan&gt;Flanagan, W., ''Contemporary Urban Sociology'' Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wirth&gt;Wirth, L., ''Urbanism as a Way of Life'' The American Journal of Sociology: Volume 44, Number 1, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the primarily macro-based sociology that had marked earlier subfields, members of the Chicago School placed greater emphasis on micro-scale social interactions that sought to provide subjective meaning to how humans interact under structural, cultural and social conditions. The theory of symbolic interaction, the basis through which many methodologically-groundbreaking ethnographies were framed in this period, took primitive shape alongside urban sociology and shaped its early methodological leanings. Symbolic interaction was forged out of the writings of early micro-sociologists [[George Herbert Mead|George Mead]] and [[Max Weber]], and sought to frame how individuals interpret symbols in everyday interactions. With early urban sociologists framing the city as a 'superorganism', the concept of [[symbolic interaction]] aided in parsing out how individual communities contribute to the seamless functioning of the city itself.&lt;ref name=Trepl&gt;Trepl, L., ''City and Ecology'' Capitalism Nature Socialism: Volume 7, Number 2, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of the Chicago School originally sought to answer a single question: how did an increase in urbanism during the time of the Industrial Revolution contribute to the magnification of contemporary social problems? Sociologists centered on [[Chicago]] due to its '[[tabula rasa]]' state, having expanded from a small town of 10,000 in 1860 to an urban metropolis of over two million in the next half-century. Along with this expansion came many of the era's emerging social problems - ranging from issues with concentrated homelessness and harsh living conditions to the low wages and long hours that characterized the work of the many newly arrived European immigrants. Furthermore, unlike many other metropolitan areas, Chicago did not expand outward at the edges as predicted by early expansionist theorists, but instead 'reformatted' the space available in a concentric ring pattern.&lt;ref name= Burgess&gt;Burgess, E., "The growth of the city: an introduction to a research project," in Park, R.E. (ed) ''The City'', Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 47-62, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many modern cities the business district occupied the city center and was surrounded by slum and blighted neighborhoods, which were further surrounded by workingmens' homes and the early forms of the modern suburbs. Urban theorists suggested that these spatially distinct regions helped to solidify and isolate class relations within the modern city, moving the middle class away from the urban core and into the privatized environment of the outer suburbs.&lt;ref name=Sassen&gt;Sassen, S., ''New frontiers facing urban sociology at the millennium'' The British Journal of Sociology: Volume 51, Number 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the high concentration of first-generation immigrant families in the inner city of Chicago during the early 20th century, many prominent early studies in urban sociology focused upon the transmission of immigrants' native culture [[roles]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] into new and developing environments. Political participation and the rise in inter-community organizations were also frequently covered in this period, with many metropolitan areas adopting census techniques that allowed for information to be stored and easily accessed by participating institutions such as the University of Chicago. Park, Burgess and McKenzie, professors at the University of Chicago and three of the earliest proponents of urban sociology, developed the [[Subculture Theories]], which helped to explain the often-positive role of local institutions on the formation of community acceptance and social ties.&lt;ref name=Park&gt;Park, R., ''The City: Suggestions for Investigation of Human Behavior in the Urban Environment'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; When race relations break down and expansion renders one's community members anonymous, as was proposed to be occurring in this period, the inner city becomes marked by high levels of social disorganization that prevent local ties from being established and maintained in local political arenas.

The rise of urban sociology coincided with the expansion of [[statistical inference]] in the [[behavioural sciences]], which helped ease its transition and acceptance in educational institutions along with other burgeoning social sciences. [[Microsociology|Micro-sociology]] courses at the University of Chicago were among the earliest and most prominent courses on urban sociological research in the United States.

==Evolution of urban sociology==
{{further|Social network}}

The evolution and transition of sociological theory from the Chicago School began to emerge in the 1970s with the publication of [[Claude Fischer]]'s (1975) "Toward a Theory of Subculture Urbanism" which incorporated [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu's]] theories on [[social capital]] and [[symbolic capital]] within the invasion and succession framework of the Chicago School in explaining how cultural groups form, expand and solidify a neighbourhood. The theme of transition by subcultures and groups within the city was further expanded by [[Barry Wellman]]'s (1979) "The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers" which determined the function and position of the individual, institution and community in the urban landscape in relation to their community. Wellman's categorization and incorporation of community focused theories as "Community Lost", "Community Saved", and "Community Liberated" which center around the structure of the urban community in shaping interactions between individuals and facilitating active participation in the local community are explained in detail below:

'''Community lost:''' The earliest of the three theories, this concept was developed in the late 19th century to account for the rapid development of industrial patterns that seemingly caused rifts between the individual and their local community. Urbanites were claimed to hold networks that were “impersonal, transitory and segmental”, maintaining ties in multiple social networks while at the same time lacking the strong ties that bound them to any specific group. This disorganization in turn caused members of urban communities to subsist almost solely on secondary affiliations with others, and rarely allowed them to rely on other members of the community for assistance with their needs.

'''Community saved:''' A critical response to the community lost theory that developed during the 1960s, the community saved argument suggests that multistranded ties often emerge in sparsely-knit communities as time goes on, and that urban communities often possess these strong ties, albeit in different forms. Especially among low-income communities, individuals have a tendency to adapt to their environment and pool resources in order to protect themselves collectively against structural changes. Over time urban communities have tendencies to become “urban villages”, where individuals possess strong ties with only a few individuals that connect them to an intricate web of other urbanities within the same local environment.

'''Community liberated:''' A cross-section of the community lost and community saved arguments, the community liberated theory suggests that the separation of workplace, residence and familial kinship groups has caused urbanites to maintain weak ties in multiple community groups that are further weakened by high rates of residential mobility. However, the concentrated number of environments present in the city for interaction increase the likelihood of individuals developing secondary ties, even if they simultaneously maintain distance from tightly-knit communities. Primary ties that offer the individual assistance in everyday life form out of sparsely-knit and spatially dispersed interactions, with the individual's access to resources dependent on the quality of the ties they maintain within their community.&lt;ref name=Wellman&gt;Wellman, B., ''The Community Question: The Intimate Networks of East Yorkers'' American Journal of Sociology: Volume 84, Number 4, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the development of these theories, urban sociologists have increasingly begun to study the differences between the urban, rural and suburban environment within the last half-century. Consistent with the community liberated argument, researchers have in large part found that urban residents tend to maintain more spatially-dispersed networks of ties than rural or suburban residents. Among lower-income urban residents, the lack of mobility and communal space within the city often disrupts the formation of social ties and lends itself to creating an unintegrated and distant community space. While the high density of networks within the city weakens relations between individuals, it increases the likelihood that at least one individual within a network can provide the primary support found among smaller and more tightly-knit networks.
Since the 1970s, research into social networks has focused primarily on the types of ties developed within residential environments. Bonding ties, common of tightly-knit neighborhoods, consist of connections that provide an individual with primary support, such as access to income or upward mobility among a neighborhood organization. Bridging ties, in contrast, are the ties that weakly connect strong networks of individuals together. A group of communities concerned about the placement of a nearby highway may only be connected through a few individuals that represent their views at a community board meeting, for instance.&lt;ref name=Granovetter&gt;Granovetter, M., "The Strength of Weak Ties", ''American Journal of Sociology'',78(6), 1360-1380, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as theory surrounding social networks has developed, sociologists such as [[Alejandro Portes]] and the [[Wisconsin model| Wisconsin model of sociological research]] began placing increased leverage on the importance of these weak ties.&lt;ref name="Portes and Sensenbrenner" &gt;Portes, A., and Sensenbrenner, J.,"Embeddedness and immigration: notes on the social determinants of economic action," ''American Journal of Sociology'', 98, pp. 1320-1350, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; While strong ties are necessary for providing residents with primary services and a sense of community, weak ties bring together elements of different cultural and economic landscapes in solving problems affecting a great number of individuals. As theorist Eric Oliver notes, neighborhoods with vast social networks are also those that most commonly rely on heterogeneous support in problem solving, and are also the most politically active.&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;Oliver, E., ''Democracy in Suburbia'' Connecticut: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the suburban landscape developed during the 20th century and the outer city became a refuge for the wealthy and, later, the burgeoning middle class, sociologists and [[urban geography|urban geographers]] such as [[Harvey Molotov]], [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] began to study the structure and revitalization of the most impoverished areas of the inner city. In their research, impoverished neighborhoods, which often rely on tightly-knit local ties for economic and social support, were found to be targeted by developers for [[gentrification]] which displaced residents living within these communities.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, N., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EMM2xowSlEgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The New Urban Frontier: Gentrification and the Revanchist City]'', London: Routledge, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Political experimentation in providing these residents with semi-permanent housing and structural support - ranging from Section 8 housing to [[Community Development Block Grant]] programs- have in many cases eased the transition of low-income residents into stable housing and employment. Yet research covering the social impact of forced movement among these residents has noted the difficulties individuals often have with maintaining a level of economic comfort, which is spurred by rising land values and inter-urban competition between cities in as a means to attract capital investment.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, D., ""From Managerialism to Entrepreneurialism: The Transformation in Urban Governance in Late Capitalism". ''Geografiska Annaler. Series B, Human Geography'', 71, pp. 3-17, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;	&lt;ref name=Molotch&gt;Molotch, H., "The City as a Growth Machine: Toward a Political Economy of Place". ''American Journal of Sociology'', 82(2), pp. 309–332, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between inner-city dwellers and middle class passersby in such settings has also been a topic of study for urban sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duneier |first=Mitchell |title=Sidewalk|year=2001|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|location=New York|isbn=978-0374527259|edition=1st paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dromi|first=Shai M.|title=Penny for your Thoughts: Beggars and the Exercise of Morality in Daily Life|journal=Sociological Forum|date=December 2012|volume=27|issue=4|pages=847–871|doi=10.1111/j.1573-7861.2012.01359.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many theories in urban sociology have been criticized, most prominently directed toward the ethnocentric approaches taken by many early theorists that lay groundwork for [[urban studies]] throughout the 20th century. Early theories that sought to frame the city as an adaptable “superorganism” often disregarded the intricate roles of social ties within local communities, suggesting that the urban environment itself rather than the individuals living within it controlled the spread and shape of the city. For impoverished inner-city residents, the role of highway planning policies and other government-spurred initiatives instituted by the planner [[Robert Moses]] and others have been criticized as unsightly and unresponsive to residential needs. The slow development of empirically-based urban research reflects the failure of local urban governments to adapt and ease the transition of local residents to the short-lived industrialization of the city.&lt;ref name=Caro&gt;[[Robert Caro|Caro, R.]], ''[[The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]]'' Vintage: New York, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern social theorists have also been critical toward the apparent shortsightedness that urban sociologists have shown toward the role of culture in the inner city. [[William Julius Wilson]] has criticized theory developed throughout the middle of the twentieth century as relying primarily on structural roles of institutions, and not how culture itself affects common aspects of inner-city life such as poverty. The distance shown toward this topic, he argues, presents an incomplete picture of inner-city life.The urban sociological theory is viewed as one important aspect of sociology.

{{about|variegation in botany|histology|Variegation (histology)}}
[[Image:Ficus carica Panascè.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Variegation of fruits and wood in ''[[Ficus carica]] Panascè'', a bicolor (yellow-green) common fig cultivar. This Italian cultivar is a ''[[Chimera (plant)|chimera]]'']]
'''Variegation''' is the appearance of differently coloured zones in the leaves, and sometimes the [[Plant stem|stems]], of plants. Variegated leaves occur rarely in nature. Species with variegated individuals are sometimes found in the [[understory]] of [[tropical rainforest]]s, and this habitat is the source of a number of variegated house plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Variegated Leaves|url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/generalbotany/shootfeatures/generalstructure/leafcolor/variegation.html|website=UCLA College|accessdate=9 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615002817/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/generalbotany/shootfeatures/generalstructure/leafcolor/variegation.html|archive-date=2016-06-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also sometimes used to refer to colour zonation in [[flower]]s, [[mineral]]s, and the skin, fur, feathers or scales of animals.

== Causes ==
=== Chimeral ===
Because the variegation is due to the presence of two kinds of plant tissue, propagating the plant must be by a vegetative method of propagation that preserves both types of tissue in relation to each other. Typically, stem [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]], bud and stem [[grafting]], and other propagation methods that results in growth from leaf axil buds will preserve variegation. Cuttings with complete variegation may be difficult if not impossible to propagate. Root cuttings will not usually preserve variegation, since the new stem tissue is derived from a particular tissue type within the root.

[[Image:VariegatedHollyBush.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Variegation in [[holly]] leaves]]
[[Image:PileaCadierei.jpg|thumb|left|Reflective variegation in ''[[Pilea cadierei]]''.]]
Some variegation is due to visual effects caused by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light from the leaf surface. This can happen when an air layer is located just under the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] resulting in a white or silvery reflection. It is sometimes called blister variegation.

''[[Pilea]]'' (aluminum plant) is an example of a house plant that shows this effect. Leaves of most ''[[Cyclamen]]'' species show such patterned variegation, varying between plants, but consistent within each plant.

Another type of reflective variegation is caused by hairs on parts of the leaf, which may be coloured differently from the leaf. This is found in various ''[[Begonia]]'' species and garden hybrids.

Sometimes venal variegation occurs – the veins of the leaf are picked out in white or yellow. This is due to lack of green tissue above the veins. It can be seen in some aroids.

The [[Silybum marianum|blessed milk thistle]], ''Silybum marianum'', is a plant in which another type of venal variegation occurs, but in this case it is due to a blister variegation occurring along the veins.

=== Pigmentary ===
[[Image:TrifoliumPratense2.jpg|thumb|right|Leaves of [[Red Clover]] (''Trifolium pratense'') have a typical v-shaped variegation.]]
A common cause of variegation is the masking of green [[pigment]] by other pigments, such as [[anthocyanin]]s. This often extends to the whole leaf, causing it to be reddish or purplish. On some plants however, consistent zonal markings occur; such as on some [[clover]]s, [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]], certain ''[[Pelargonium]]'' and ''[[Oxalis]]'' species. On others, such as the commonly grown forms of [[Coleus]], the variegation can vary widely within a population.

In ''[[Nymphaea lotus]]'', the tiger lotus, leaf variegations appear under intense illumination.

=== Pathological ===

[[Virus]] infections may cause patterning to appear on the leaf surface. The patterning is often characteristic of the infection. Examples are the ''mosaic viruses'', which produce a mosaic-type effect on the leaf surface or the [[citrus variegation virus]] (CVV). Recently{{when?|date=January 2017}} a virus disease, hosta virus X (HVX) has been identified that causes mottled leaf coloring in [[hostas]]. At first, diseased plants were propagated and grown for their mottled foliage, at the risk of infecting other healthy hostas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hosta Virus X|url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/viruses/hosta-virus-x.aspx|website=Missouri Botanical Garden|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these diseases are usually serious enough that the gardener would not grow affected plants, there are a few affected plants that can survive indefinitely, and are attractive enough to be grown for ornament; e.g. some variegated [[Abutilon]] varieties.

[[Nutrient]] deficiency symptoms may cause a temporary or variable yellowing in specific zones on the leaf. [[Iron]] and [[magnesium]] deficiencies are common causes of this.

[[Transposable element]]s can cause colour variegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbara McClintock and the Discovery of Jumping Genes (Transposons)|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/barbara-mcclintock-and-the-discovery-of-jumping-34083#|website=Nature|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defensive masquerade ==
It has been suggested that some patterns of leaf variegation may be part of a defensive "masquerade strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lev-Yadun |first=S. |date=2014 |title=Defensive masquerade by plants |url= |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |publisher= |volume=113 |issue= |pages=1162–1166 |doi=10.1111/bij.12399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, leaf variegation may appear to an insect [[leaf miner]] that the leaf is already infested, and this may reduce parasitization of the leaf by leaf miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8108000/8108940.stm |title=The plant that pretends to be ill |last1=Walker |first1=Matt |date=19 June 2009 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date=13 April 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==

By convention, the italicised term ''variegata'' as the second part of the Latin [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name, indicates a [[species]] found in the wild with variegation (''[[Aloe variegata]]''). The much more common, non-italicised, inclusion of 'Variegata' as the third element of a name indicates a variegated [[cultivar]] of an unvariegated parent (''[[Aucuba japonica]]'' 'Variegata'). However, not all variegated plants have this Latin tag, for instance many cultivars of ''[[Pelargonium]]'' have some zonal variegation in their leaves. Other types of variegation may be indicated, e.g. ''[[Daphne odora]]'' 'Aureomarginata' has yellow edging on its leaves.

Variegated plants have long been valued by gardeners, as the usually lighter-coloured variegation can 'lift' what would otherwise be blocks of solid green foliage. Many gardening societies have specialist variegated plants groups, such as the [[Hardy Plant Society]]'s Variegated Plant Special Interest Group in the UK. Several gardening books which deal exclusively with variegated plants are available.

'''Wallball''' is a type of school yard game similar to [[butts up]], aces-kings-queens, [[Chinese handball]], [[Welsh handball|Pêl-Law (Welsh handball)]] and [[American handball]] (American handball is sometimes actually referred to as wallball). Kenny Mott is the founding father of wallball. The sport was played by a few schools in the Brandon Manitoba, then began gaining much popularity, resulting in a popular worldwide sport. Wallball is now played globally with the international federation, Wall Ball International, promoting the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wall Ball International Webpage|url=http://wallball.co/|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game requires the ball to be hit to the floor before hitting the wall, but in other respects is similar to squash. It can be played as a singles, doubles or elimination game.

Wallball is derived from many New York City street games played by young people, often involving the [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] hi-bounce balls created in 1949.

==Objective==
The objective of wallball is to eliminate all other players in order to be the last player standing, or to be the starter of the game continuously (if the game is endless).

== Wallball ==
The aim of the game is to hit the ball against a wall. If the person hits the wall and the ball bounces out of play the person next in line loses a life. People first decide who serves. This procedure varies, but is usually the winner of the previous game or the person who got the ball (if that would be the first game), or the new person coming in. The server first hits the ball forward and down so that it hits the ground and bounces up to hit the wall. (If the server is a good sport, an easy ball is started with to get the game going.) If it bounces on the ground more than once or if it doesn't bounce on the ground before it hits the wall, it is considered out. Then, after hitting the ball, the ball would bounce back, and the next person would do the same thing. If the ball bounces more than once before the second player hits it the second person is out, but hitting the ball before it bounces is allowed after the first person hits the ball. If the ball bounces out of bounds (the boundaries are usually determined by the orange lines surrounding the field) at any time, it is considered out, and if it hits the orange line, it is sometimes considered in, sometimes considered out, and sometimes considered a "liney" or "liner" in which the game stops and the person who made the liney serves again. The goal is to get the person behind you out by hitting it with the right force and in the right direction. There are sometimes rules called "first serves", in which the server doesn't get out until the third time the server gets out.

There are many variations to the rules, but the rules above are the classic ones. Babies, in which the ball on the second bounce is smaller than the closest interior orange line to the wall (there are two orange lines; one is about three-four feet from the wall, and the other one is about two-thirds of the court away from the wall) and sliceys (or skimmers), where the ball goes at an extremely high speed and extremely low height, are very common varying things (in or out).

There are four main types of wallball: regular, teams, line-up, and random.

* Regular is where the players line up outside of the court on a bench (which is usually present) or standing if there is no bench, and two players enter the court. They play, and the losing player goes to the end of the line, and the next person comes up.
* Teams is the same as regular, except that there are four (or more, but even) players that come up (grouped in equal teams).
* Line-up is where all the players line up in a line that is either determined by the winning person or in "random order", where the players pick the order, and they play in order (the server goes after the last person).
* Random is where all the players are scattered around the court, the server serves, and a random person (whoever wants to hit the ball) comes up and hits the ball. In random, when nobody hits the ball, players determine who is out by either considering it a re-do (the server or another person serves again), "flinching" (the person who reacts to the ball in a fashion that looks like the player is going to hit the ball), nearest person (the closest person to the ball is out), or a combination of nearest person and flinching (if somebody flinches, the flinching person is out; if nobody flinches, the nearest person is out).

In line-up or random, the winner of each game usually decides the rules and game style of the next game (usually with the classic rules, but the winner usually has the right to change them, though if enough people disagree, the idea is usually not used), and in regular or teams, the first person to beat the whole line gets to determine the rules and game style of the next game. If playing with a soccer ball/football, they have to hit it wherever it lies, if against.Players stand a few feet away from the wall. They may only get three outs (no outs if you want the game to be endless). A player serves the ball by throwing directly at the wall. The ball then should return to another player. It is not an out if you get the ball again but is considered unfair if you intended to get the ball back (however, if the ball returns to you three times, it is formally known as a "tea party", and you are out). If the ball bounces first, it is an out. If you drop the ball or the ball hits you, you will have to get to the wall before someone else throws the ball and hits the wall or you will get an out. If you get the ball that is out-of-bounds, players are permitted to shout "challenge!" During challenges, you have to throw the ball from the same place where you picked up the ball. You may only take tiny steps then throw or move backwards. If you move anywhere else, you will get an out. These alternative rules are more common in the Midwest and [[Canada]]. In Australia however the rules are slightly different where there are rules for spiking. Spiking is when the ball hits another player on the full without bouncing and the player which is hit goes on the wall. Some versions are played using two walls adjacent to each other, called "cube ball" where the same rules apply except two walls are used instead of one. Another, called "Aceball", is similar to wallball except that the ball is hit on the wall without a bounce, then allowed to bounce once before a returning hit is required from the other player. Aceball can be played by kicking it as well, though it is no where near as prominent.

==Wallball Rules==

*'''Chicken pox''':this is an an out because it is too overpowerd this happens when you make a fist with both hands.
*'''Angle''': Someone hits the ball in such a way that leads the ball out of the playing area. This is especially applied in an outdoor location.
*'''Baby''': A small, hard to get shot (ball must clear two feet from the bottom of the wall).
*'''Bad Serve''': An incorrect serve which leads to the re-serving of the ball.
*'''Black Magic''': Placing one's hands in front of the ball and maybe pretending to hit it,  once (faking the other person out or to get a reaction out of them) but not hitting it, when it is the opponent's turn
*'''Bus stop''': When the ball is returned to a player, the player yells "Bus stop!" and they bounce the ball once and then hit it.
*'''Challenge''': When a player without the ball shouts challenge, the player with the ball must throw the ball to the wall from where he/she is standing.
*'''Crossy''': Similar to an angle, a crossy is a shot played across the wall to make the opposition run for the ball (sometimes called cross country).
*'''Double Bounce''': Ball bounces more than once before hitting the wall, leading to elimination.
*'''Drop Shot''': Hitting the ball with an angle that makes the ball skim the wall (sometimes called waterfall). (Though "Waterfall" may also refer to a ball that hits so high/straight/parallel to the wall that it skims the wall twice before coming down.)
*'''High Wire''': Also known as a slam, a big hit.
*'''Holdy''': Sometimes simply referred to as a "hold", when someone holds on to the ball rather than slapping/hitting it.
*'''(Hyper) Skimmer''': a low, fast-moving ball, a hyper, or super, skimmer goes exceedingly fast and low, and can only be performed by talented players (may be known as something else, like slicey, or snake) Sometimes, "Grounder", or "Roller" may be call to force a redo.
*'''Interference''': When the ball hits an outside object or hits a player directly after being hit by another player (before hitting the wall). Usually, the judge (first person in the waiting line) serves on an interference, and calls which player to hit it. Sometimes, if the judge is hit, the judge can get you out. This term may be shortened simply as an ''inter''.
*'''Ogden''': When the ball hits the palm of the hand, and does not have enough power to reach the wall.
*'''Out of Bounds''': When the ball goes out of the intended, pre-determined playing surface.
*'''Overdog''': Jumping over the ball instead of hitting it.
*'''Pop''': "Pop" or "Poppy" (as in "no poppies"): shot where the ball hits the wall where it meets the ground, and sort of "pops" out of the corner, usually loudly if using a large red rubber ball (i.e. 4 square ball)—depends on rules agreed before the game but usually illegal (similar to babies) and thus results in the committing player being out.
*'''Rainbow''': Player can call "Rainbow" and must go under the ball without touching the ball successfully, and another player has to hit the ball (sometimes called underdogs or watermelons).
*'''Review''': In some games, players can challenge, or ask for a review that they are not out for whatever reason. If they lose the challenge, they cannot challenge anymore.
*'''Shotgun''': A hard hit that directly hits the wall, rather than bouncing once; typically followed by the elimination of the player who shot that ball (may be known as something else, such as ''bullet'', ''jet'', and ''direct'').
*'''Skid''': The ball returns in a faster pace due to wet contact or the ball's particular rotation.
*'''Slicey''': A player swipes their hand under the ball, without touching the ball, and say "Slicey!" The opponent now has to hit the ball.
*'''Steph Curry''': When the player makes a hoop with their arms and lets the ball pass through without hitting their arms. Player must call out "Steph Curry!"  {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
*'''Time Out''': Stopping the game right in the middle of it (player must call Time in to play again).
*'''Top Hat''': Player hits the ball on top and says Top Hat, making the ball bounce straight down. The other player must hit the ball before it bounces twice and the ball must hit the ground before it hits the wall.
*'''Trap bounce''': Where the ball traps after bouncing once. It typically leads to an elimination or judging.
*'''Traps''': Where the ball hits directly on the join between the wall and ground. This can be played on or replayed and is also known as ''Ace'', "Pops", "Pocket", "Gutter", "Gutter-ball", or "Poppy's".
*'''Troll time''': In the alternate rules when an opposing player throws the ball to the wall a long way away, a player deflects the ball down to the ground touches the wall, then re-throws the ball to the wall all before the opponent has the opportunity to get back to the wall.
*'''Type Writer''': Hitting the ball at the wall, then continually hitting the ball without it touching the floor until the hitter sees fit to let the ball rotate to the next player by hitting the ball against the wall one last time with force. Type Writer should not exceed 5 seconds.
