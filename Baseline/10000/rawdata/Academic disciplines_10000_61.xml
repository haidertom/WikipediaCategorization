[[Image:ARC Centre for Complex Systems (logo).jpg|thumb|ACCS Logo]]

The '''ARC Centre for Complex Systems (ACCS''') was established in 2004 from a consortium of Australian universities, led by the [[University of Queensland]]. The objective of ACCS was to conduct basic and applied research in the field of [[complex systems]]. It conducted research into both the science and engineering of complex systems. Funding was provided by the [[Australian Research Council]] (ARC) and the universities involved. The ACCS was funded under the ARC's [[Center of excellence|Centre of Excellence]] Scheme &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/ce/2003_coe_funding.htm ARC Centres of Excellence Scheme 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625030916/http://www.arc.gov.au/ncgp/ce/2003_coe_funding.htm |date=25 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until mid-2009, after which industry collaborations and further funding was established to continue to apply the Centre's research.

== Overview ==
[[Complex systems]] science is an emerging discipline developing new ways of investigating large, highly intricate, dynamically changing systems across diverse areas such as biology, social networks and socio-technological systems, economics and the environment. The ACCS was established to conduct world-class research on questions fundamental to understanding, designing and managing complex systems.

While complex systems research is considered basic research, with commercialisation still some time off, complex computing holds answers to real-life systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/making-the-pace-in-a-hot-new-year/2006/01/30/1138469633668.html Making the pace in a hot new year], Beverley Head, theAge.com.au, Technology, 1 January 2006
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACCS provided a focus for complex systems science research in Australia, and developed strong infrastructure for modelling and analysing network-based systems, enabling the science to be applied to real-world problems.

The Centre had its headquarters at [[The University of Queensland]] in Brisbane, with nodes at [[Griffith University]] in Brisbane, [[Monash University]] in Melbourne, and [[The University of New South Wales]] campus at the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] in Canberra.

The ACCS's research programs emphasised cross-disciplinary research, involving leading researchers from a range of disciplines including: systems and software engineering, economics, visualisation, human factors, computational mathematics and statistics, and relevant application domains including aerospace, economics, energy and biology.

== Research program ==
The goal of the ACCS's research was to develop deeper understanding of fundamental phenomena in complex systems, such as how macro-level system properties and behaviours emerge from relatively simple micro-level interactions, what mechanisms enable complex systems to self-organise, and how complex systems can be managed and controlled.

The [http://www.accs.uq.edu.au/research.html Centre's core research program] was based around a number of application areas.

=== Genetic regulatory networks=== 
Research in this program tackled fundamental questions about growth and form in cellular biology. Computational modelling was used to study how the control of development results from an interaction between each cell's genetic regulatory network and its inputs from neighbouring cells and its environment, and how the process proceeds reliably, while coping with unreliable components, perturbation, injury, and changing environments.

=== Air traffic control ===
This program applied complex systems science to the problem of improving the efficiency of air travel without compromising safety. To do this, researchers developed and used air traffic simulators to study new concepts and tools for air traffic management, and developed new approaches to assurance of system-level properties including safety and efficiency&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/next/its-life-but-not-as-we-know-it/2005/11/28/1133026374254.html It's life, but not as we know it], Beverley Head, theAge.com.au, Technology, 29 November 2005
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
=== Evolutionary economic systems=== 
In this program, complex systems and network theory was applied to economics and business to understand how evolutionary change occurs. Multi-agent modelling and associated simulation and calibration techniques were core components of the methodology used. We investigated new ways of testing for complex patterns in high frequency data, by studying trade-by trade data in stock markets and in electricity markets and seeking 'pattern matches' in artificially generated agent-based modelling data. We investigated new ways of dealing with spatial complexity in several contexts. Also visualisation techniques, rarely used in economics, were applied in a range of data-rich contexts to better understand the architecture and complex dynamics of systems. 

=== Electricity networks and energy markets=== 
This program investigated ways of integrating technical and market aspects of power systems with price dynamics to provide key insights into planning expansion of Australia's power transmission network. It also aimed to apply modern computational modelling techniques to the interface between the physical properties of the electricity system and its economic considerations. A particular focus was placed on the impacts of the transmission network and power station operation on electricity price behaviour and its influence on infrastructure investment decisions. It also looked into the importance of customer-load impact on system and market operations.

=== Dependable computer-based systems=== 
This program was concerned with the development of modelling and analysis tools to ensure that dependability is designed into complex computer-based systems, particularly in areas such as transport, health and finance. There is a constant need for new methods and tools to enable engineers to ensure that such systems meet society's demands for dependability, safety and reliability.
One of the tools, Behavior Trees, was successfully trialled by Raytheon Australia to analyse six large defence projects.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=501 Raytheon Australia supports pioneering systems research] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915050723/http://www.raytheon.com.au/Default.aspx?x=501 |date=15 September 2009 }}, Raytheon News Release, 3 September 2008 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finding a simple solution to complex systems, David Binning, [http://www.afr.com/home/The Australian Financial Review], 9 October 2008, p7 Project Management Special Report &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex systems theory and applications === 
In addition to the research programs described above, the ACCS included a number of projects addressing key problems for complex systems. The projects were concerned with the application of theory to solve issues in the design and operation of complex socio-technological systems, and with the development of new analysis techniques for complex systems.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.calit2.net/newsroom/article.php?id=1483 Cyberinfrastructure expert spells out cooperation Between US and Australia], Tiffany Fox, Calit2 Newsroom Web article, 5 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aldo Rossi''' (3 May 1931 – 4 September 1997) was an Italian [[architect]] and [[designer]] who achieved international recognition in four distinct areas: architectural theory, drawing and design and also product design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Germano |last=Celant |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Diane |last2=Ghirardo |title=Aldo Rossi: Drawings |publisher=Skira |location=Milan |year=2008 |isbn=978-88-6130-143-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first Italian to receive the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]]&lt;ref&gt;Pritzker Prize for Architecture - [http://www.pritzkerprize.com/about/purpose chriteria]&lt;/ref&gt; for architecture.

==Early life==

He was born in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].  After early education by the [[Somaschi Fathers|Somascan Religious Order]] and then at [[:it:Collegio arcivescovile Alessandro Volta|Alessandro Volta College]] in [[Lecco]], in 1949 he went to the school of architecture at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]].  His thesis advisor was [[:it:Piero Portaluppi|Piero Portaluppi]] and he  graduated in 1959.

In 1955 he had started writing for, and from 1959 was one of the editors of, the architectural magazine [[Casabella|Casabella-Continuità]], with editor in chief [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]]. Rossi left in 1964, when the chief editorship went to Gian Antonio Bernasconi. Rossi went on to work for [[:it:Società (rivista)|Società magazine]] and Il_contemporaneo, making him one of the most active participants in the fervent cultural debate of the time.

His early articles cover architects such as [[Alessandro Antonelli]],  [[:it:Mario Ridolfi|Mario Ridolfi]], [[Auguste Perret]] and [[Emil Kaufmann]] and much of this material became part of his second book, ''Scritti scelti sull'architettura e la città 1956-1972'' (''Selected writings on architecture and the city from 1956 to 1972''). He married the Swiss actress Sonia Gessner, who introduced him to the world of film and theater. Culture and his family became central to his life. His son Fausto was active in movie-making both in front of and behind the camera and his daughter Vera was involved with theatre.

==Career==

He began his professional career at the studio of [[Ignazio Gardella]] in 1956, moving on to the studio of [[Marco Zanuso]]. In 1963 also he began teaching, firstly as an assistant to [[:it:Ludovico Quaroni|Ludovico Quaroni]] (1963) at the school of urban planning in [[Arezzo]], then to [[Carlo Aymonino]] at the [[Università Iuav di Venezia|Institute of Architecture in Venice]]. In 1965 he was appointed lecturer at the [[Polytechnic University of Milan]] and the following year he published ''The architecture of the city'' which soon became a classic of architectural literature.

His professional career, initially dedicated to architectural theory and small building work took a huge leap forward when [[Carlo Aymonino|Aymonino]] allowed Rossi to design part of the [[Monte Amiata Housing|Monte Amiata complex]] in the [[Gallaratese|Gallaratese quarter]] of Milan. In 1971 he won the design competition for the extension of the San Cataldo Cemetery in [[Modena]], which made him internationally famous.

After suspension from teaching in Italy in those politically troubled times, he moved to [[ETH Zurich]], occupying the chair in architectural design from 1971 to 1975.

In 1973 he was director of the International Architecture Section at the [[:it:XV Triennale di Milano|XV Milan Triennial Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture]], where he presented, among others, his student [[Arduino Cantafora]].  Rossi's design ideas for the exhibition are explained in the International Architecture Catalogue and in a 16mm documentary ''Ornament and crime'' directed by Luigi Durissi and produced along with Gianni Braghieri and Franco Raggi.  In 1975, Rossi returned to the teaching profession in Italy, teaching architectural composition in Venice.

In 1979 he was made a member of the prestigious [[Accademia di San Luca|Academy of Saint Luke]]. Meanwhile, there was international interest in his skills.  He taught at several universities in the United States, including [[Cooper Union]] in New York City and [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca (New York State).  At Cornell he participated in the ''Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies'' joint venture with New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], travelling to China and Hong Kong and attending conferences in South America.

In 1981 he published his autobiography, ''A scientific autobiography''. In this work the author, "in discrete disorder", brings back memories, objects, places, forms, literature notes, quotes, and insights and tries to "... go over things or impressions, describe, or look for ways to describe."  In the same year he won first prize at the international competition for the design of an apartment block on the corner of Kochstraße and Wilhelmstraße in central [[Berlin]].

In 1984 together with [[Ignazio Gardella]] and [[Fabio Reinhart]], he won the competition for the renovation of the [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] in [[Genoa]], which was not fully completed until 1991. In 1985 and 1986 Rossi was director of the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture|3rd (respectively 4th) International Architecture Exhibition]] at the [[Venice Biennale]] including further away display spaces such as Villa Farsetti in [[Santa Maria di Sala]].

In 1987 he won two international competitions: one for a site at the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, the other for the [[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] in Berlin, which was never brought to fruition. In 1989 he continued product design work for Unifor (now part of [[:it:Molteni&amp;C|Molteni Furniture]]) and [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]]. His espresso maker ''La Cupola'', designed for Alessi came out in 1988.

In 1990 he was awarded the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name=Goldberger1990&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldberger|first1=Paul|title=Aldo Rossi: Sentiment For The Unsentimental|work=New York Times|date=22 April 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of [[Fukuoka]] in Japan honoured him for his work on the hotel complex ''The Palace'' and he won the 1991 Thomas Jefferson Medal in Public Architecture from the [[American Institute of Architects]]. These prestigious awards were followed by exhibitions at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in Paris, the [[Beurs van Berlage]] in Amsterdam, the [[Berlinische Galerie]] in Berlin and the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Ghent, Belgium.

In 1996 he became an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and the following year he received their special cultural award in architecture and design.  He died in Milan on 4 September 1997, following a car accident. Posthumously he received the ''[[Torre Guinigi]]'' prize for his contribution to urban studies and the ''Seaside Prize'' of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150509102932/http://seasideinstitute.org/what-we-do/ Seaside Institute], Florida, where he had built a detached family home in 1995.

On appeal his proposals won the 1999 competition for the restoration of the [[Teatro La Fenice]], Venice and it reopened in 2004.  In 1999 the Faculty of Architecture of the [[University of Bologna]], based in [[Cesena]], was named after him.

==Work==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stainless steel kettle "Il Conico" (designed by Aldo Rossi).png|thumb|200px|left|Stainless steel kettle ''Il Conico'', 1986]] --&gt;
[[File:Aldo Rossi La Cupola Alessi Coffee Maker Austin Calhoon Photograph.jpg|thumb|200px|Aldo Rossi La Cupola Espresso Maker 1988, produced by Alessi]]
His earliest works of the 1960s were mostly theoretical and displayed a simultaneous influence of 1920s [[Italian modernism]] (''see [[Giuseppe Terragni]]''), classicist influences of Viennese architect [[Adolf Loos]], and the reflections of the painter [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. A trip to the [[Soviet Union]] to study [[Stalinist architecture]] also left a marked impression.

In his writings Rossi criticized the lack of understanding of the city in current architectural practice. He argued that a city must be studied and valued as something constructed over time; of particular interest are urban artifacts that withstand the passage of time. Rossi held that the city remembers its past (our "collective memory"), and that we use that memory through monuments; that is, monuments give structure to the city. Inspired by the persistence of Europe's ancient cities, Rossi strove to create similar structures immune to obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Aldo Rossi, Modena Cemetery, Model, c.1983.jpg.png|thumb|right|200px|Model of San Cataldo Cemetery, [[Modena]], Italy, 1971-]]  --&gt;
He became extremely influential in the late 1970s and 1980s as his body of built work expanded and for his theories promoted in his books ''[[The Architecture of the City]]'' (''L'architettura della città'', 1966) and ''A Scientific Autobiography'' (''Autobiografia scientifica'', 1981).The largest of Rossi's projects in terms of scale was the San Cataldo Cemetery, in [[Modena]], Italy, which began in 1971 but is yet to be completed. Rossi referred to it as a "city of the dead".

The distinctive independence of his buildings is reflected in the micro-architectures of the products designed by Rossi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buerdek |first=Bernhard E. |year=2005 |title=Design: History, theory and practice of product design |url= |location=Basel, Switzerland |publisher=Birkhauser-Publishers for Architecture |isbn=978-3-764-37029-9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s Rossi designed stainless steel [[French press|cafetières]] and other products for [[Alessi (company)|Alessi]], [[Pirelli]], and others.

[[File:Bonnefanten2013-04.jpg|thumb|200px|Central staircase [[Bonnefanten Museum]], [[Maastricht]]]]

==Exhibits==

For the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1979 Rossi designed a floating ''Teatro del Mondo''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archidose.blogspot.com/1999/02/teatro-del-mondo.html |title=Teatro del Mondo |date=8 February 1999 |access-date=29 October 2018 |work=A Daily Dose of Architecture |first=John |last=Hill |publisher=[[Blogspot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seated 250 people. For the Venice Biennale in 1984, he designed a triumphal arch at the entrance to the exhibition site. In 2006 two [[pylon (architecture)|pylons]] based on an original 1989 design by Aldo Rossi were erected in front of the Bonnefanten Museum in Maastricht by the Delft architectural firm Ufo Architecten.

==Awards==

Aldo Rossi won the prestigious [[Pritzker Prize]] for architecture in 1990. [[Ada Louise Huxtable]], architectural critic and Pritzker juror, has described Rossi as "a poet who happens to be an architect."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10477">[[Image:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]] ([[Turkey]]), anastylosis carried out 1970–1978]]
'''Anastylosis''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|αναστήλωσις, -εως}}; {{lang|grc|ανα}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}} = "again", and {{lang|grc|στηλόω}}&lt;!-- or styloo--&gt; = "to erect [a stela &lt;!-- or stylos--&gt; or building]") is an [[archaeological]] term for a reconstruction technique whereby a ruined building or monument is restored using the original architectural elements to the greatest degree possible. It is also sometimes used to refer to a similar technique for restoring broken pottery and other small objects.

== Methodology ==
The intent of anastylosis is to rebuild, from as much of the original materials that is left after usually thousands of years of abuse, historical architectural monuments which have fallen into ruin. This is done by placing components back into their original positions. Where standing buildings are at risk of collapse, the method may entail the preparation of drawings and measurements, piece-by-piece disassembly, and careful reassembly, with new materials as required for structural integrity; occasionally this may include new foundations. When elements or parts are missing, modern materials (of restoration grade) may be substituted, such as [[plaster]], [[cement]], and synthetic [[resin]]s.

The international [[Venice Charter]] of 1964 details criteria for anastylosis. First, the original condition of the structure must be confirmed scientifically. Second, the proper placement of each recovered component must be determined. Third, supplemental components must be limited to those necessary for stability (that is, substitute components may never lie at the top), and must be recognizable as replacement materials. New construction for the sake of filling in apparent lacunae is not allowed.

== Criticism ==
Anastylosis has its detractors in the scientific community. In effect, the method poses several problems:
* No matter how rigorous preparatory studies are, any errors of interpretation will result in errors, often undetectable or incorrigible, in reconstruction.
* Damage to the original components is practically inevitable.
* An element may be, or may have been reused in, or may have originated in, different buildings or monuments from different periods. To use it in one reconstruction obviates its use in others.

== Examples ==
===Greece===
[[File:Anastylose Evans Cnossos 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Anastylosis in [[Knossos]] palace, Crete, Greece, by [[Arthur Evans]]]]
A primitive anastylosis was carried out in 1836 at the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] in [[Athens]], where the [[Temple of Athena Nike]] was re-erected from remaining parts. Starting in 1902, the Greek architect Nikolas Balanos used anastylosis in order to restore a collapsed portion of the [[Parthenon]], restore the [[Erechtheion]], and rebuild the Nike Temple a second time. Iron clamps and plugs which had been used earlier had started to rust and had caused heavy damage to the original structure. These were removed and replaced with precious metal clamps. When the temple was once again rebuilt additional newly identified original fragments were added. Currently, anastylosis is being applied to the Parthenon.

===India===
Several monuments protected by [[Archeological Survey of India]] have been restored, including [[Shekhavati]] [[haveli]]s, [[Humayun's Tomb]], etc.

===Indonesia===
[[File:The Borobudur in Java, Indonesia.jpg|200px|thumb|One of the earlier examples of anastylosis: the [[Borobudur]] in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Indonesia]]]]
Early in the 20th century, Dutch archaeologists carried out anastylosis of the [[stupa]] at the [[Buddhist]] temple complex at [[Borobudur]] in Java, [[Indonesia]] between 1907 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=zCQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA319&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=anastylosis+Borobudur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R8cfiLo3gr&amp;sig=QolFH5HIJqWT7cqoPooQ_NlfusM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0ibq46efZAhUMnpQKHYEyAr8Q6AEIWjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=anastylosis%20Borobudur&amp;f=false|title=Architectural Conservation in Asia: National Experiences and Practice|last=Stubbs|first=John H.|last2=Thomson|first2=Robert G.|date=2016-11-10|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317406198|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prambanan]] Hindu temple complex was excavated and was partially reconstructed between 1911 and 1953, also reconstructed using anastylosis method. The recent practice of anastylosis in Indonesia is the reconstruction of [[Kedulan]] temple, built in 869, the temple was buried under volcanic layers for centuries, until was discovered in 1993. The restoration of the entire Kedulan Temple complex is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2018/02/15/kedulan-temple-restoration-enters-anastylosis-phase.html|title=Kedulan Temple restoration enters anastylosis phase|last=Ajie|first=Stefanus|date=17 February 2018|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
The [[École Française d'Extrême-Orient]] (EFEO) began restoration work at [[Angkor Wat]] in 1908. Between 1986 and 1992, the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) carried out restoration work on the temple. [[Bayon]] was restored by EFCO followed by Japanese Government Team for the Safeguarding of Angkor (JSA). [[Ta Prohm]] is being restored by [[Archaeological Survey of India]].

==Proposals==
The [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] in [[Afghanistan]] which were destroyed by the [[Taliban]] in 2001 is under consideration for anastylosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petzet|first1=Michael|title=Anastylosis or reconstruction – the conservation concept for the remains of the Buddhas of Bamiyan|url=http://www.icomos.org/madrid2002/actas/189.pdf|website=International Council on Monuments and Sites|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327142510/http://www.icomos.org/madrid2002/actas/189.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have estimated that as much as 50% of the statues' material is recoverable.

It would be possible to reconstruct the [[Gourgion Tower]] in [[Gozo]], [[Malta]] using anastylosis, since many of its decorated stones and inscriptions were retrieved following its demolition in 1943, and are now in storage at [[Heritage Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azzopardi |first1=Joe |title=The Gourgion Tower - Gone but not Forgotten (Part 2) |journal=Vigilo |date=May 2014 |issue=45 |page=47 |url=http://dinlarthelwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Vigilo-45.pdf |publisher=[[Din l-Art Ħelwa]] |issn=1026-132X |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151115112639/http://dinlarthelwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Vigilo-45.pdf |archivedate=November 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Palmyra offensive (March 2016)|recapture of Palmyra]] by the Syrian Army in March 2016, director of antiquities Maamoun Abdelkarim stated that the [[Temple of Bel]], the [[Temple of Baalshamin]] and the [[Monumental Arch of Palmyra|Monumental Arch]], which had been destroyed by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] in 2015, will be rebuilt using anastylosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaheen|first1=Kareem|last2=Graham-Harrison|first2=Emma|title=Syrian regime forces retake 'all of Palmyra' from Isis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/27/syrian-regime-forces-retake-all-of-palmyra-from-isis|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327092726/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/27/syrian-regime-forces-retake-all-of-palmyra-from-isis|archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beloit College''' is a private [[liberal arts]] [[college]] in [[Beloit, Wisconsin]]. Founded in 1846, while the state of [[Wisconsin]] was still a territory,&lt;ref name="hist1"&gt;http://www.beloit.edu/about/history&lt;/ref&gt; it is the oldest continuously operated college in the state. It is a member of the [[Associated Colleges of the Midwest]] and has an enrollment of roughly 1,300 [[undergraduate]] students. It is more selective, with an acceptance rate of 54 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/beloit-college-3835|title=US News|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beloit College was founded by the group Friends for Education, which was started by seven pioneers from [[New England]] who, soon after their arrival in the [[Wisconsin Territory]], agreed that a college needed to be established. The group raised funds for a college in their new town and convinced the territorial [[legislature]] to enact the charter for Beloit College on February 2, 1846. The first building (then called Middle College) was built in 1847, and it remains in operation today. Classes began in the fall of 1847, with the first degrees awarded in 1851.

The first president of Beloit was a [[Yale University]] graduate, [[Aaron Lucius Chapin]], who served as president from December 1849 until 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beloit.edu/archives/history/presidents/aaron_chapin |title=Archives: Aaron Lucius Chapin |publisher=Beloit College |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college become coeducational in fall 1895, when it opened its doors to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beloit.edu/archives/documents/archival_documents/coed/parttwo/|title=Archives: Part Two {{!}} Beloit College|website=www.beloit.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although independent today, Beloit College was historically, though unofficially, associated with the [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/education/school/college.htm |title=UCC related Colleges and Universities  |accessdate=2006-08-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109214558/http://www.ucc.org/education/school/college.htm |archivedate=2007-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college remained very small for almost its entire first century with enrollment topping 1,000 students only with the influx of [[World War II]] veterans in 1945–1946. The "Beloit Plan" was a year-round curriculum introduced in 1964 that comprised three full terms and a "field term" of off-campus study.&lt;ref name="hist1"/&gt; The trustees decided to return to the two-semester program in 1978.

==Campus==
Beloit's campus is located within the [[Near East Side Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beloithistoricdistricts.org/wordpress/east-side-historic-district/ |title=Near East Side Historic District |publisher=BeloitHistoricDistricts.org |accessdate=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is host to "20 conical, linear, and animal effigy mounds built between about AD 400 and 1200", created by Native Americans identified by archaeologists as Late Woodland people.&lt;ref name="beloit.edu"&gt;https://www.beloit.edu/logan/mounds/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beloit.edu/belmag/03fall/03fall_features/03fall_mounds.html |title=Beloit College Magazine |publisher=Beloit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the mounds, in the shape of a [[turtle]], inspired Beloit's symbol&lt;ref&gt;[https://magazine.beloit.edu/?story_id=240926&amp;issue_id=240616]&lt;/ref&gt; and unofficial mascot. The mounds on Beloit's campus are "catalogued" burial sites, and therefore may not be disturbed without an official permit from the Wisconsin Historical Society. Several of the Beloit College sites have been partially excavated and restored, and material found within them—including pottery and tool fragments—is now held in the college's Logan Museum of Anthropology.&lt;ref name="beloit.edu" /&gt;

Beloit College completed a {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} Center for the Sciences in the fall of 2008, which was named the Sanger Science Center in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.beloit.edu/campus/news/?story_id=520846|title=Naming the Science Center|work=the Terrarium|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was awarded LEED ([[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]]) green building certification.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.beloit.edu/news/?story_id=269293|title=Beloit College's Science Center gets LEED Platinum Nod|newspaper=News &amp;amp; Events|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won a Design Excellence Honor Award in Interior Architecture from the Chicago chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) on October 30, 2009.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In the fall of 2010, Beloit College opened the Hendricks Center for the Arts, a {{convert|58,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} structure that holds dance, music, and theater facilities. The building previously held the Beloit Post Office and later the Beloit Public Library. The renovation and expansion of the facility is the largest single gift in the college's history. The building is named after [[Diane Hendricks]], chair of [[ABC Supply]] of Beloit, and her late husband and former college trustee [[Ken Hendricks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beloit.edu/giving/news/?story_id=267648 |title=Giving: Giving News: Hendricks Center to Give New Life to Former Beloit Public Library |publisher=Beloit.edu |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Beloit campus museums open to the public are run by college staff and students. The [[Logan Museum of Anthropology]] and the [[Wright Museum of Art]] were both founded in the late 19th century. The Logan Museum, accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]], curates over 300,000 ethnographic and archaeological objects from 125 countries and over 600 cultural groups. The Wright Museum's holdings of over 8,000 objects include a large collection of original prints and Asian art.  Both museums feature temporary special exhibitions year round.

The Beloit College campus also houses two sculptures by artist [[Siah Armajani]], his ''Gazebo for One Anarchist: [[Emma Goldman]] 1991'' and ''The Beloit College Poetry Garden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beloit.edu/museums/publicart/publicsculpt.htm |title=Beloit College Public Sculpture |publisher=Beloit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Beloit College's curriculum retains many aspects of the Beloit Plan from the 1960s, emphasizing experiential learning, learner agency, and reflective connection-making between out-of-classroom and in-classroom learning experiences, or "the liberal arts in practice." Academic strengths include field-oriented disciplines such as anthropology and geology. More Beloit graduates have earned Ph.D.s in anthropology than graduates of any other undergraduate liberal arts college not affiliated with a university,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beloit.edu/~logan/pdf/newsletters/Logan%20Letter%20v4%20n2.pdf |title= Measuring Beloit’s Strength in Anthropology|accessdate=2008-06-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625012236/http://www.beloit.edu/~logan/pdf/newsletters/Logan%20Letter%20v4%20n2.pdf |archivedate=2008-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the school ranks among the top 20 American liberal arts colleges whose graduates go on to earn a Ph.D. in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Best Colleges 2012 | publisher = U.S. News &amp; World Report | year = 2012 | url = http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/beloit-college-3835 | accessdate = 20 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geology department continues a tradition that began with [[Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin|T. C. Chamberlin]] more than a century ago. Today the department combines a course load with mandatory field methods and research. The department is a member of the [[Keck Geology Consortium]], a research collaboration of several similar colleges across the United States, including [[Amherst College]], [[Pomona College]], and [[Washington and Lee University]]. The Consortium sends undergraduate students worldwide to research and publish their findings.

Jerry Gustafson (Beloit '63) created the Center for Entrepreneurship in Liberal Education at Beloit (CELEB) to provide opportunities for students to learn entrepreneurial skills in both business and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Gustafson, Jerry. 2011. Teaching Entrepreneurship by Conservatory Methods. In Disciplining the Arts: Teaching Entrepreneurship in Context, ed. by Gary D. Beckman, 69-82 Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pTy_AAAAQBAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, the Beloit College Philosophy Department has hosted visiting philosophers through the Selzer Visiting Philosopher Series. In 2010, [[Martha Nussbaum]] visited, and in 2011, [[Daniel Dennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beloit.edu/philo/selzer/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130012043/http://www.beloit.edu/philo/selzer/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-30 |title=Philosophy: Selzer Visiting Philosopher |publisher=Beloit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beloit College's average class size is 15 students, with one-third of courses having 10 or fewer students.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beloit.edu/prospective/fastfacts/|title=Admissions: Fast Facts {{!}} Beloit College|website=www.beloit.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
Beloit students' housing options range from substance-free dormitories to special interest houses, such as the Art, Spanish, Outdoor Environmental Club (OEC), and interfaith options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beloit.edu/reslife/housingoptions/specialinterest/ |title=Residential Life: Special Interest Houses |publisher=Beloit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beloit College has these fraternities and sororities: [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Sigma Chi]], and [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], national fraternities; [[Kappa Delta]] and [[Alpha Sigma Tau]], national sororities; and Theta Pi Gamma, a local sorority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beloit.edu/reslife/housingoptions/greek/|title=Residential Life: Fraternities and Sororities {{!}} Beloit College|website=www.beloit.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beloit has a student congress (BSC), and in the 2008 elections 275 students (approximately 20% of the student body) voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://belcon.beloit.edu/news.php?parent=10 | title=News Archive | date=November 13, 2008 | accessdate=October 27, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school also has over 60 student organizations and clubs,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; which bring visitors (musicians, artists, poets) to campus frequently. While Beloit adheres to Wisconsin state law, which states that the legal drinking age is 21, strict no-alcohol policies found on many other college campuses are not present at Beloit. Resident assistants, employed by the Residential Life office, help to maintain campus safety and encourage responsible behavior.

The student newspaper, ''The Round Table'', was founded in 1853 as the ''Beloit Monthly''. Printed weekly, it provides news coverage, feature stories, and an art section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beloit.edu/archives/documents/archival_collections/publications/student/round_table/|title=Archives: The Round Table {{!}} Beloit College|website=www.beloit.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student radio station, WBCR-FM, operates at 88.3&amp;nbsp;MHz and streams online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beloit.edu/wbcr/|title=WBCR website | accessdate=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eaton Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|Eaton Chapel]]
Beloit College has a [[Flying disk|frisbee]] golf course contained almost entirely within the grounds of the college. In April 2006, Beloit College students broke the world record for the longest game of Ultimate Frisbee by playing for over 72 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/sioncampus/05/18/beloit.ultimate/index.html | work=CNN | title=Beloit students break record with 72-hour game | date=May 19, 2006 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Beloit College received the Senator Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Campus Internationalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nafsa.org/PressRoom/PressRelease.aspx?id=25550 |title=Press Room &amp;#124; Eight U.S. Colleges Receive Awards for Campus Internationalization Efforts(2) |publisher=NAFSA |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48 states are represented at the college and approximately 11% of the student body is from countries outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beloit.edu/prospective/fastfacts/ |title=Prospective Students: Fast Facts |publisher=Beloit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about half of all Beloit College students study abroad in places such as China, Russia, Brazil, Germany, India, Spain and other countries. Each year, students can share their experiences abroad on International Symposium Day, which is a day when all classes are cancelled so that everyone can attend the presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beloit.edu/oie/international_education/symposium/ |title=Office of International Education: International Symposium |publisher=Beloit.edu |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three former and current Beloit College staff produce the annual "[[Beloit College Mindset List|Mindset List]]", summarizing pop culture references that are allegedly meaningless to incoming college [[Freshman|freshmen]].

In recent years, a number of Beloit College students have been the victims of explicit hate crimes. In 2006, civil rights posters on the door of a student of color were defaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Racism at Beloit|last=Miller|first=Emily|date=October 13, 2006|newspaper=The Beloit College Round Table|access-date=|work=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, racist slurs were spraypainted on the wall of a dormitory building,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wifr.com/home/headlines/Dean-Condemns-Racist-Graffiti-On-Beloit-College-Campus-295331851.html|title=Dean Condemns Racist Graffiti On Beloit College Campus|last=WIFR|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017, a student was threatened and targeted with anti-Semitic slurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/breaking-news/362071/wisconsin-college-student-receives-anti-semitic-note-in-dorm/|title=Wisconsin College Student Receives Anti-Semitic Note in Dorm|newspaper=The Forward|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beloitcollegeroundtable.com/2017/02/07/peet-bushnell-receive-increased-surveillance-in-wake-of-crimes/|title=Peet, Bushnell receive increased surveillance in wake of crimes|date=2017-02-07|website=The Round Table|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately afterward, the door and wall of a dorm room occupied by a Muslim student was spray-painted with a swastika;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazettextra.com/20170130/beloit_college_addressing_hate_crimes_against_two_students|title=Beloit College addressing hate crimes against two students|last=Ward|first=Xavier|access-date=2017-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216132639/http://www.gazettextra.com/20170130/beloit_college_addressing_hate_crimes_against_two_students|archive-date=2017-02-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; police later stated that the targeted student confessed to fabricating the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2017/02/01/beloit-college-student-admits-fabricating-hate-crime/97377390/|title=Beloit College student admits fabricating hate crime|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these incidents, the administration has imposed digital video monitoring in the Peet and Bushnell dorm buildings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Athletics==
Beloit College is a member of the [[Midwest Conference]] NCAA in Division III and fields varsity teams in football, baseball, softball, volleyball, men's and women's swimming, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, women's tennis, men's and women's track and field, men's and women's lacrosse, and men's and women's soccer. The school also had a competitive rowing team sponsored by club funds and alumni support.

The current head coach of the Beloit Buccaneer football team is Seth Duerr.

==Recognition==
In 2017, Beloit was ranked #62 among national liberal arts colleges by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''. It tied for #10 among the publication's list of "Most Innovative Schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/beloit-college-3835|title=Beloit College|year=2017|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, it was ranked #152 in ''Washington Monthly''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s liberal arts college rankings and #146 in Forbes' top colleges rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/colleges/beloit-college/|title=Beloit College|year=2016|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide?ranking=2016-rankings-national-universities-liberal-arts|title=2016 Rankings - National Universities - Liberal Arts|year=2016|newspaper=Washington Monthly|access-date=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beloit was included in Loren Pope's book, ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]'', which distinguishes schools having two essential elements: "A familial sense of communal enterprise that gets students heavily involved in cooperative rather than competitive learning, and a faculty of scholars devoted to helping young people develop their powers, mentors who often become their valued friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctcl.org/ |title=Colleges That Change Lives &amp;#124; Changing Lives, One Student at a Time |publisher=Ctcl.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope also added that, "What Beloit turns out is a better, more effective person, and one who tends to go on getting better … [Beloit] outproduces very selective schools in graduates who make significant contributions and achievements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctcl.org/beloit-college/ |title=Colleges That Change Lives - Beloit College |accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''College of William &amp; Mary''' (also known as '''William &amp; Mary''', '''W&amp;M''', and officially '''The College of William and Mary in Virginia''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]]. Founded in 1693 by [[Letter patent|letters patent]] issued by [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Queen Mary II]], it is the [[Colonial Colleges|second-oldest]] institution of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]], after [[Harvard University]].

William &amp; Mary educated American Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]] (third), [[James Monroe]] (fifth), and [[John Tyler]] (tenth) as well as other key figures important to the development of the nation, including the fourth U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] of Virginia, [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] [[Henry Clay]] of Kentucky, sixteen members of the [[Continental Congress]], and four signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], earning it the nickname "the Alma Mater of the Nation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = William &amp; Mary – History of the College |url = https://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/history_of_the_college/index.php |website = www.wm.edu |accessdate = October 31, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151209211035/http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/history_of_the_college/index.php |archive-date = December 9, 2015 |dead-url = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A young [[George Washington]] (1732–1799) also received his surveyor's license through the college. W&amp;M students founded the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] academic [[honor society]] in 1776 and W&amp;M was the first school of higher education in the United States to install an [[honor code]] of conduct for students. The establishment of graduate programs in law and medicine in 1779 makes it one of the [[first university in the United States|earliest higher level universities in the United States]].

In addition to its undergraduate program, W&amp;M is home to several graduate programs (including computer science, public policy, physics, and colonial history) and four professional schools (law, business, education, and marine science). In his 1985 book ''Public Ivies: A Guide to America's Best Public Undergraduate Colleges and Universities'', Richard Moll categorized William &amp; Mary as one of eight "[[Public Ivies]]".

{{Main|History of the College of William &amp; Mary}}

===Colonial era: 1693–1776===
[[File:James Blair.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[James Blair (Virginia)|James Blair]], founder of William &amp; Mary]]
A school of higher education for both [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the [[Colony of Virginia]]. The college was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter (legally, letters patent) to "''make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and other good arts and sciences...to be supported and maintained, in all time coming.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/charter/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named in honor of the reigning monarchs [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], the college is the second oldest college in the United States. The original plans for the college date back to 1618 but were thwarted by the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]], a change in government (in 1624, the Virginia Company's charter was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority as a [[crown colony]]), events related to the [[English Civil War]], and [[Bacon's Rebellion]]. In 1695 before the town of Williamsburg existed, construction began on the College Building, now known as the Sir Christopher [[Wren Building]], in what was then called [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)]].  It is the oldest college building in America. The college is one of the country's nine [[Colonial Colleges]] founded before the [[American Revolution]]. The Charter named James Blair as the college's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743). William &amp; Mary was founded as an [[Anglican]] institution; students were required to be members of the [[Church of England]], and professors were required to declare adherence to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]].&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Homer J. (1902) "Schools and Colleges in Colonial Times", ''The New England Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly'', v. XXVII, p. 374, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01644447&amp;pg=PA373 Google Books entry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506182259/https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC01644447&amp;pg=PA373 |date=May 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1693, the college was [[university constituency|given a seat]] in the [[House of Burgesses]] and it was determined the college would be supported by [[tobacco]] taxes and export duties on [[fur]]s and animal skins. The college acquired a {{convert|330|acre|km2}} parcel for the new school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=GmbH |first=Sedo |url=http://williamsburgpostcards.com/other/other14a.htm |title=williamsburgpostcards.com |work=williamsburgpostcards.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120043818/http://williamsburgpostcards.com/other/other14a.htm |archivedate=January 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|8|mi|km}} from Jamestown. In 1694, the new school opened in temporary buildings.

[[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] was granted a royal charter as a city in 1722 by [[The Crown]] and served as the capital of Colonial Virginia from 1699 to 1780. During this time, the college served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Monroe]], and [[John Tyler]]. The college has been called "the Alma Mater of a Nation" because of its close ties to America's founding fathers. A 17-year-old [[George Washington]] received his surveyor's license through the college and would return as its first American chancellor. William &amp; Mary is famous for its firsts: the first U.S. institution with a royal charter, the first Greek-letter society ([[Phi Beta Kappa]], founded in 1776), the first collegiate society in the country ([[Flat Hat Club|F.H.C. Society]], founded in 1750), the first student honor code and the first [[William &amp; Mary Law School|law school]] in America. The college became a state-supported school in 1906 and became coeducational in 1918. In 1928, [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] chose the College Building as the first building to be returned to its 18th-century appearance as part of the iconic [[Colonial Williamsburg]] restoration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wm.edu/about/history/index.php William &amp; Mary – History &amp; Traditions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415030041/http://www.wm.edu/about/history/index.php |date=April 15, 2016 }}.

During the period of the American Revolution, [[freedom of religion]] was established in Virginia notably with the 1786 passage of the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]]. Future U.S. President [[James Madison]] was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and [[James Madison (bishop)|Right Reverend James Madison]], his cousin and [[Thomas Jefferson]], who was on the [[Board of Visitors]], helped the College of William &amp; Mary to make the transition as well. In 1779 the college became the first American university with the establishment of the graduate schools in law and medicine.{{clarify|date=March 2016}} As its president, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the college which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School and the establishment of the first elective system of study and honor system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virginiavignettes.org/?p=21 |title=Virginia Vignettes » What Was the Brafferton School? |publisher=Virginiavignettes.org |date=August 2007 |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111135556/http://www.virginiavignettes.org/?p=21 |archivedate=November 11, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College of William and Mary is home to the nation's first [[collegiate secret societies in North America|collegiate secret society]], the [[Flat Hat Club|F.H.C. Society]], popularly known as the [[Flat Hat Club]], founded November 11, 1750. On December 5, 1776, students [[John Heath (politician)|John Heath]] and [[William Short (American ambassador)|William Short]] (Class of 1779) founded [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as a secret literary and philosophical society. Other [[Secret societies at the College of William &amp; Mary|secret societies]] known to currently exist at the college include: The [[Seven Society (College of William &amp; Mary)|7 Society]], 13 Club, Alpha Club, [[Bishop James Madison Society]], The Society, The Spades, W Society, and [[Wren Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogstreetjournal.com/story/2049 Shhh!

[[Thomas R. Dew]], professor of history, metaphysics, and political economy, and then President of William &amp; Mary from 1836 until his death in 1846, was an influential academic defender of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1842, alumni of the college formed the Society of the Alumni&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=F. James |last=Barnes, II |url=http://alumni.wm.edu/history/index.shtml |title=William &amp; Mary Alumni &gt; History |publisher=Alumni.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now the sixth oldest alumni organization in the United States. In 1859, a great fire caused destruction to the College Building. The [[Alumni House (College of William &amp; Mary)|Alumni House]] is one of the few original antebellum structures remaining on campus; notable others include the Wren Building, the President's House, the Brafferton, and Prince George House.

===Civil War, Reconstruction, and the early 20th century===
[[File:Wren 1859 william and mary.jpg|thumb|left|College Building, 1859–1862]]
At the outset of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), enlistments in the [[Confederate States Army]] depleted the student body; and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the college for the duration of the conflict. The [[Wren Building|College Building]] was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces. The [[Battle of Williamsburg]] was fought nearby during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] on May 5, 1862, and the city was captured by the Union army the next day. The [[Brafferton (building)|Brafferton building of the college]] was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town. On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the [[5th Pennsylvania Cavalry]] set fire to the College Building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/nineteenth2.php |title=1850–1899 &amp;#124; Historical Facts |work=Historical Chronology of William and Mary |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704205939/http://www.wm.edu/vitalfacts/nineteenth2.php |archivedate=July 4, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover. Much damage was done to the community during the Union occupation, which lasted until September 1865.

Following restoration of the Union, Virginia was destitute from the War. The college's 16th president, [[Benjamin Stoddert Ewell]], finally reopened the school in 1869 using his personal funds but the college closed in 1882 due to lack of funds. In 1888, William &amp; Mary resumed operations under a substitute charter when the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] passed an act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swem.wm.edu/departments/special-collections/exhibits/exhibits/charter/normal/ |title=Earl Gregg Swem Library Special Collections |publisher=Swem.wm.edu |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; appropriating $10,000 to support the college as a state teacher-training institution. [[Lyon Gardiner Tyler]] (son of US President and alumnus [[John Tyler]]) became the 17th president of the college following President Ewell's retirement. Tyler, along with 18th president [[J. A. C. Chandler]], expanded the college into a modern institution. In March 1906, the General Assembly passed an act taking over the grounds of the colonial institution, and it has remained publicly supported ever since. In 1918, William &amp; Mary became one of the first universities in Virginia to admit women and become [[coeducational]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/women/grad_prof1.html Women at UVa: Graduate and Professional Schools] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216222951/http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/women/grad_prof1.html |date=February 16, 2015 }}. .lib.virginia.edu. Retrieved on August 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, enrollment increased from 104 students in 1889 to 1269 students by 1932.

Largely thanks to the vision of a William and Mary instructor, [[W. A. R. Goodwin|Reverend Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin]], the College Building, the President's House and [[the Brafferton]] (originally the Indian School) were restored to their 18th century appearance between 1928 and 1932 with substantial financial support from [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] and his wife, [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]]. Together, they led the establishment and beginnings of [[Colonial Williamsburg]].

===1930–present===

In 1930, William &amp; Mary expanded its territorial range by establishing a branch in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] – The Norfolk Division of the College of William &amp; Mary. This extension would eventually become the independent state-supported institution known as [[Old Dominion University]].

Significant campus construction continued under the college's nineteenth president, [[John Stewart Bryan]]. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] received an honorary degree from the college on October 20, 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1934/10/21/archives/roosevelts-address-at-william-and-mary.html Roosevelt's Address at William and Mary – Article – NYTimes.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608171651/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10917FF3B5D167A93C3AB178BD95F408385F9 |date=June 8, 2013 }}.

The sunken design is taken from a similar landscape feature at [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]] in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren.

The college has a history of supporting freedom of the press dating back at least to the 1940s. In 1945, for example, the college administration sanctioned the student Marilyn Kaemmerle for an article she had written in ''[[The Flat Hat]]'' supporting the end of [[racist]] policies of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], [[anti-miscegenation laws]] and [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,792051,00.html Education: Jefferson's Heirs]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826034248/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C792051%2C00.html |date=August 26, 2013 }}, ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', February 26, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in response, over one-thousand William &amp; Mary students held "a spirited mass meeting protesting infringement of the sacred principles of freedom of the press bequeathed by Alumnus Thomas Jefferson." She was pardoned by the college Board of Visitors decades later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scrc.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php/Marilyn_Kaemmerle|title=Marilyn Kaemmerle|work=wm.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309172041/http://scrc.swem.wm.edu/wiki/index.php/Marilyn_Kaemmerle|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college admitted Hulon Willis into a graduate program in 1951 because the program was unavailable at Virginia State. However, the college did not open all programs to African-American students until around 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Desegregation_in_Higher_Education#start_entry|title=Desegregation in Higher Education in Virginia|first=Peter|last=Wallenstein|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[The Colleges of William &amp; Mary]], a short-lived five campus university system, was founded. It included the College of William &amp; Mary, the [[Richmond Professional Institute]], the [[Norfolk Division of the College of William &amp; Mary]], [[Christopher Newport College]], and [[Richard Bland College]].&lt;ref name="CoWMAH"&gt;{{cite book|last=Godson|title=The College of William and Mary: A History|year=1993|publisher=King and Queen Press|isbn=0-9615670-4-X|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dissolved in 1962.

In 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed [[Highland (James Monroe house)|Highland]], the {{convert|535|acre|km2|adj=on}} historic [[Albemarle County, Virginia]] estate of alumnus and U.S. President [[James Monroe]], to the college.

On July 25, 2012, [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]] (EVMS), in nearby [[Norfolk, Virginia]] made a joint announcement with William &amp; Mary that the two schools were considering merging so that EVMS would become the William &amp; Mary School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2012/wm-and-evms-to-explore-school-of-medicine.php | title= W&amp;M and EVMS to explore School of Medicine | last=Whitson | first=Brian | publisher=The College of William &amp; Mary | date=July 25, 2012 | accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wm.edu/news/announcements/archive/2012/presidents-message-on-wm-and-evms.php | title=President's message on W&amp;M and EVMS | last=Reveley | first=Taylor | publisher=The College of William &amp; Mary | date=July 25, 2012 | accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any such merger would have to be confirmed by the two schools and then confirmed by the Virginia General Assembly and Governor. A pilot relationship, supported by a $200,000 grant in the Virginia budget, was subsequently agreed upon by both universities to examine this possible union in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2013/wm-report-recommends-pilot-partnership-with-evms123.php | title=W&amp;M report recommends pilot partnership with EVMS | last=Whitson | first=Brian | publisher=The College of William &amp; Mary | date=January 16, 2013 | accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The college is located on a {{convert|1200|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. In 2011, [[Travel+Leisure]] named William &amp; Mary one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/24|title="America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)|work=Travel + Leisure|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wren Building|Sir Christopher Wren Building]] is the oldest college building in the United States and a National Historic Landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=707&amp;ResourceType=Building |title=Wren Building, College of William and Mary |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=December 21, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213002246/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=707&amp;ResourceType=Building |archivedate=February 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, colloquially referred to as the "Wren Building", was named upon its renovation in 1931 to honor the English architect [[Sir Christopher Wren]]. The basis for the 1930s name is a 1724 history in which Hugh Jones stated the 1699 design was "first modelled by Sir Christopher Wren" and then was adapted "by the Gentlemen there" in Virginia; little is known about how it looked, since it burned within a few years of its completion. Today's Wren Building is based on the design of its 1716 replacement. The college's alumni association has suggested that Wren's connection to the 1931 building is a viable subject of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Did Wren Design the Building and William and Mary Bearing His Name? |first=Chiles T.A. |last=Larson |journal=William &amp; Mary |page=59 |date=Fall 2005 |volume=71 |issue=1|publisher=W&amp;M Alumni Association|url=http://wmalumnimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vol_71_no_1_WMAlumMag_fall20052.pdf|accessdate=April 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other buildings around the Wren Building complete a triangle known unofficially as "Ancient Campus": the [[Brafferton (building)|Brafferton]] (built in 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost's offices) and the President's House (built in 1732). In addition to the "Ancient Campus", which dates to the 18th century, the college also consists of "Old Campus" and "New Campus."

"Old Campus" consists of academic buildings and dormitories built in close proximity to the Wren Building and match the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and Anglo-Dutch architecture of the colonial buildings of "Ancient Campus" and [[Colonial Williamsburg]]. Located directly to the west of the Wren Building, the majority of "Old Campus" was constructed during the 1920s and 1930s and is dominated by the [[Sunken Garden (Virginia)|Sunken Gardens]] and the college's football stadium, [[Zable Stadium]]. Also located within "Old Campus" are Sorority Court, the majority of upperclassmen dormitories, and the offices and classrooms of the History, Economics, Government, Philosophy, Religion, Music, Modern Language, and English Departments.

Adjoining "Old Campus" to the north and west is "New Campus." It was constructed primarily between 1950 and 1980, and it consists of academic buildings and dormitories that, while of the same brick construction as "Old Campus", fit into the vernacular of modern architecture. Beginning with the college's [[tercentenary]] in 1993, the college has embarked on a building and renovation program that favors the traditional architectural style of "Old Campus", while incorporating energy-efficient technologies. Several buildings constructed since the 1990s have been [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED certified]]. Additionally, as the buildings of "New Campus" are renovated after decades of use, several have been remodeled to incorporate more traditional architectural elements in an effort to unify the appearance of the entire college campus. "New Campus" is dominated by [[William and Mary Hall]], [[Earl Gregg Swem Library]], and [[Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall]]. It also includes the offices and classrooms of the Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Biology, and Chemistry Departments, the majority of freshman dormitories, the fraternity complex, and the majority of the college's athletic fields. The newest addition to "New Campus" is [[Alan B. Miller Hall]], the headquarters of the college's [[Mason School of Business]].

The recent wave of construction at William and Mary has resulted in a new building for the School of Education, located not far from William and Mary Hall. Additionally, new facilities have freed up space in existing structures. The offices and classrooms of the Government, Economics, and Classical Language Departments, which share a building on "New Campus" (Morton Hall), could potentially be separated and some relocated to vacant buildings recently renovated within the "Old Campus".

The vast majority of William and Mary's {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} consists of woodlands and [[Lake Matoaka]], an artificial lake created by colonists in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/as/kecklab/lakematoaka/facts/index.php |title=Facts about Lake Matoaka |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513054133/https://www.wm.edu/as/kecklab/lakematoaka/facts/index.php |archive-date=May 13, 2011 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The college has shown a dedication to the stewardship and preservation of these natural elements, which are accessible via the trails running throughout the campus.

The college also has property and buildings not contiguous to campus, including the [[The College of William &amp; Mary Law School|William and Mary School of Law]] and the [[McCormack-Nagelsen Tennis Center]], both located on a piece of property approximately four blocks southeast of the Wren Building. Additionally, approximately a mile northwest of "New Campus" is the Dillard Complex (located across from the modern campus of Virginia's [[Eastern State Hospital (Virginia)|Eastern State Hospital]]), which is home to several offices, two former dormitories, and [[Plumeri Park]], the college's baseball stadium.

The Board elects a Rector, Vice Rector, and Secretary and the Board meets four times annually.&lt;ref name="FH"/&gt; The Board is responsible for appointing a president, related administrative officers, and an honorary chancellor, approving degrees, admission policies, departments, and schools, and executing the fiduciary duties of supervising the college's property and finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/bov/members/index.php |title=Members of the Board |publisher=Board of Visitors, The College of William &amp; Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chancellor of the College of William and Mary]] is largely a ceremonial role. Until 1776, the position was held by an English subject, usually the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] or the [[Bishop of London]], who served as the college's advocate to the crown, while a colonial President oversaw the day-to-day activities of the Williamsburg campus. Following the Revolutionary War, General [[George Washington]] was appointed as the first American chancellor; later United States President [[John Tyler]] held the post. The college has recently had a number of distinguished chancellors: former [[Chief Justice of the United States]] [[Warren E. Burger]] (1986–1993), former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] (1993–2000), former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] (2000–2005), and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] (2005–2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/about/administration/chancellor/duties/index.php |title=Duties and History, Chancellor |publisher=The College of William and Mary |accessdate=December 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert M.

===Honor system===
[[File:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|upright|thumb|Thomas Jefferson]]
William &amp; Mary's [[Honor code|honor system]] was first established by alumnus [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1779 and is widely believed to be the nation's first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Olsen |first=Patricia R. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/education/edlife/notebook.html |title=And Out of the Corner of My Eye... – New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=January 6, 2008 |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the orientation week, every entering student recites the Honor Pledge in the Great Hall of the [[Wren Building]] pledging:
{{quote|As a Member of the William &amp; Mary community I pledge, on my Honor, not to lie, cheat, or steal in either my academic or personal life. I understand that such acts violate the Honor Code and undermine the community of trust of which we are all stewards.}}

The basis of W&amp;M's Honor Pledge was written over 150 years ago by alumnus and law professor [[Henry St. George Tucker Sr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000398 |title=Tucker, Henry St. George, (1780–1848) |publisher=Biographical Dictionary of the United States Congress |accessdate=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching law at the [[University of Virginia]], Tucker proposed students attach a pledge to all exams confirming on their honor they did not receive any assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barefoot |first=Coy |authorlink= |title=The Evolution of Honor: Enduring Principle, Changing Times |journal=The University of Virginia Magazine |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=22–27 |publisher=University of Virginia Alumni Assn. |location=Charlottesville, Virginia |date=Spring 2008 |url=http://www.uvamagazine.org/site/c.esJNK1PIJrH/b.3888025/ |doi= |id= |accessdate=March 4, 2008 |format=– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=author%3ABarefoot+intitle%3AThe+Evolution+of+Honor%3A+Enduring+Principle%2C+Changing+Times&amp;as_publication=The+University+of+Virginia+Magazine&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329101500/http://www.uvamagazine.org/site/c.esJNK1PIJrH/b.3888025/ |archivedate=March 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last= Smith | first= C.

The college's Honor System is codified such that students found guilty of cheating, stealing or lying are subject to sanctions ranging anywhere from a verbal warning up to expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wm.edu/deanofstudents/judicial/Honor_System.php |title=Judicial Affairs &amp;#124; |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609221216/http://www.wm.edu/deanofstudents/judicial/Honor_System.php |archivedate=June 9, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Code of Conduct===

William and Mary considers the observance of public laws of equal importance to the observance of its own regulations. William and Mary's Board of Visitors delegates authority for discipline to its president. The President oversees a hierarchy of disciplinary authorities to enforce local laws as it pertains to William and Mary's interest as well as its internal regulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/deanofstudents/services/studentconduct/studenthandbook/student_code_of_conduct/index.php |title=Student Code of Conduct |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions===
[[File:Crimdell.jpg|thumb|left|Crim Dell bridge in the heart of W&amp;M's wooded campus]]
William &amp; Mary has a number of traditions, including the Yule Log Ceremony, at which the president dresses as [[Santa Claus]] and reads a rendition of "[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]", the Vice-President of Student Affairs reads "Twas the Night Before Finals", and [[The Gentlemen of the College]] sing the song "[[The Twelve Days of Christmas (song)|The Twelve Days of Christmas]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_59339.asp |title=12/1/2004 – Holiday Traditions Fill The Season In Williamsburg – Travel – Chattanoogan.com |publisher=Chattanoogan.com |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214114143/http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_59339.asp |archivedate=February 14, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christmas is a grand celebration at the college; decorated Christmas trees abound on campus. This popular tradition in fact started when German immigrant Charles Minnegerode, a humanities professor at the college in 1842 who taught Latin and Greek, brought one of the first Christmas trees to America. Entering into the social life of post-colonial Virginia, Minnigerode introduced the German custom of decorating an evergreen tree at Christmas at the home of law professor [[St. George Tucker]], thereby becoming another of many influences that prompted Americans to adopt the practice at about that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Minnigerode_Charles_1814-1894 Minnigerode, Charles (1814–1894)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801022323/http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Minnigerode_Charles_1814-1894 |date=August 1, 2016 }}. Encyclopedia Virginia. Retrieved on August 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incoming freshmen participate in Opening Convocation, at which they pass through the entrance of the Wren Building and are officially welcomed as the newest members of the college. Freshmen also have the opportunity, during orientation week, to serenade the president of the college at his home with the [[Our Alma Mater|Alma Mater song]]. The Senior Walk is similar, in that graduating seniors walk through the Wren Building in their "departure" from the college. On the last day of classes, Seniors are invited to ring the bell in the cupola of the Wren Building.

One unofficial tradition is the Triathlon, a set of three tasks completed by many students prior to graduation. These include jumping the wall of the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's Palace]] in [[Colonial Williamsburg]] after hours (and if so inclined, running through the Boxwood Maze to the Palace itself), streaking through the [[Sunken Garden (Virginia)|Sunken Garden]], and swimming in the [[Crim Dell bridge|Crim Dell]] pond.{{Citation needed|reason=primary source information, uncited claim |date=September 2016}}

William and Mary also takes pride in their connections to their colonial past during Charter Day festivities. Charter Day is technically February 8, based on the date (from the [[Julian Calendar]]) that the Reverend James Blair, first president of the college received the charter from the Court of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] at Kensington Palace in 1693. Past Charter Day speakers have included former US President [[John Tyler]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[Robert Gates]].

A unique tradition at William and Mary is the annual Raft Debate. Described by the college as "...a 'delicate balance of comedy and lecture,' the annual Raft Debate features four W&amp;M faculty members from diverse disciplines, stranded on a desolate island with only a one-person life raft for escape to civilization. Based on the volume of applause, the audience chooses the sole survivor as the professors cajole, plead, pontificate, and resort shamelessly to props and costumes. The quirky event originated in the mid-1900s and was revived during the 2000s by the Graduate Center, the A&amp;S Office of Graduate Studies and Research, and the A&amp;S Graduate Student Association. Faculty participants represent the Humanities, the Social Sciences, or the Natural and Computational Sciences. The Devil's Advocate, who argues sarcastically that none of the academic disciplines are worth saving, has on rare occasion emerged victoriously."

Commencement exercises each year begin with the senior class walking through the Wren Building and across the campus, crossing the Crim Dell bridge, and arriving at William &amp; Mary Hall for the commencement ceremony. The graduating class processes into the arena as the Choir of the College of William &amp; Mary sings the [[William &amp; Mary Hymn]].

===Fraternities and sororities===
{{Main|College of William &amp; Mary fraternity and sorority system}}
William &amp; Mary has a long history of [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities and sororities]] dating back to [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the first "Greek-letter" organization, which was founded there in 1776. Today, Greek organizations play an important role in the college community, along with other social organizations (e.g. theatre and club sports organizations). Overall, about one-third of its undergraduates are active members of 16 national fraternities and 13 sororities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/offices/greeks/who-we-are/chapters/index.php |title=Chapters |publisher=Wm.edu |date=February 4, 2013 |accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; William &amp; Mary is also home to several unique non-Greek social fraternities, notably the [[Nu Kappa Epsilon]] music sorority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/so/nukappaepsilon/aboutnke.html|title=What Exactly is Nu Kappa Epsilon?|accessdate=February 12, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010 |bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] co-ed service fraternity, the gender-inclusive [[Phi Sigma Pi]] honor fraternity, and the [[Queens' Guard (College of William and Mary)|Queens' Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/so/queensguard/|title=The Queens' Guard Homepage and Pershing Rifles Co.

William and Mary's radio station, [[WCWM]], has been on the air since 1959. Student and faculty DJs broadcast a variety of original programming and organize music performances such as the annual WCWM Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WCWM Fest|url=https://wcwm.wm.edu/index.php/fest/|website=WCWM Fest|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy groups===
William and Mary has multiple campus comedy groups. I.T. (short for Improvisational Theatre) has been around since 1986,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.wm.edu/so/improv http://web.wm.edu/so/improv] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915222714/http://web.wm.edu/so/improv |date=September 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sketch comedy]] ensemble 7th Grade Sketch Comedy has been in existence since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.wm.edu/so/7thgrade|title=7th Grade Sketch Comedy|accessdate=November 26, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719122104/http://web.wm.edu/so/7thgrade/|archivedate=July 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 a new improvisational group, Sandbox Improv, was formed. While I.T. performs short form improv, Sandbox Improv is the only long-form improvisational team on William and Mary's Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flathatnews.com/2013/01/17/sandbox-improv-new-group-on-campus-adds-to-comedy-community/ |title=Sandbox Improv: New group on campus adds to comedy community |publisher=Flat Hat News |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dad Jeans Improv, around since 2016, is an improv troupe that specializes in long-form improvisation with a technical element of some sort in each show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flathatnews.com/2017/11/13/comedy-at-the-col/ |title=Comedy at the College: Various college cmedy groups hold the VCCIs|publisher=Flat Hat News |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==

{{Main|William &amp; Mary Tribe}}
Formerly known as the "Indians", William &amp; Mary's athletic teams are now known as the "Tribe". The college fields [[NCAA Division I]] teams for men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track and field. In addition, there are women's field hockey, lacrosse and volleyball squads as well as men's baseball and football. In the 2004–05 season, the Tribe garnered five [[Colonial Athletic Association]] titles, and it leads the conference with over 80 titles. In that same year, several teams competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Championships, with the football team appearing in the [[Division I-AA]] national semifinals. The men's cross country team finished 8th and 5th at the Division I [[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship]] in 2006 and 2009, respectively. The William &amp; Mary men's basketball team is one of four original Division I schools that has never been to the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament.

There have been many recent notable athletes who competed for the Tribe. On the men's soccer team, goalkeeper [[Adin Brown]] was a back-to-back [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|NCAA First Team All-American]] in 1998 and 1999. The track program has produced several [[All-America]]ns, including Brian Hyde, an [[Olympic Games|Olympian]] and collegiate record holder in the [[1500 metres|1500-meter run]], and Ed Moran, a gold medalist in the [[5000 metres|5000-meter run]] at the [[2007 Pan American Games]]. The baseball program boasts a handful of current [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] players, including relief pitcher [[Bill Bray]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]] organization, 11 year MLB career Curtis Pride [[Montreal Expos]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Atlanta Braves]], [[Detroit Tigers]], and [[Colorado Rockies]] utility infielder [[Brendan Harris]]. The [[William &amp; Mary Tribe football|football program]] has also produced numerous [[National Football League|NFL]] players and coaches: All-Pro safety [[Darren Sharper]], current [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] head coach [[Mike Tomlin]], cornerback [[Derek Cox]], kicker [[Steve Christie]], long snapper [[Mike Leach (long snapper)|Mike Leach]], [[Walter Payton Award]]-winning quarterback [[Lang Campbell]], wide receiver [[Dominique Thompson]], [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coaches [[Marv Levy]] and [[Lou Holtz]], and [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] linebackers coach [[Mark Duffner]].

In May 2006, the NCAA ruled that the athletic logo, which includes two green and gold feathers, could create an environment that is offensive to the American Indian community, even though the Florida State Seminoles logo and Utah Utes logo were considered unoffensive. The college's appeal regarding the use of the institution's athletic logo to the NCAA Executive Committee was rejected. The "Tribe" nickname, by itself, was found to be neither hostile nor abusive, but rather communicates ennobling sentiments of commitment, shared idealism, community and common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/?id=5338 |title='Tribe' refers to community Nichol states in a report sent to the NCAA &amp;#124; University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college stated it would phase out the use of the two feathers by the fall of 2007, although they can still be seen prominently painted on streets throughout the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/news/index.php?id=6870 |title=William and Mary to change athletic logo before Fall 2007 &amp;#124; University Relations |publisher=Wm.edu |date= |accessdate=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40281">The '''commodification of nature''' is an area of research within critical environmental studies that is concerned with the ways in which natural entities and processes are made exchangeable through the [[Market economy|market]], and the implications thereof.

Drawing upon the work of [[Karl Marx]], [[Karl Polanyi]], [[James O'Connor (academic)|James O’Connor]]  and [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], this area of work is [[normative]] and critical,&lt;ref&gt;Prudham, William Scott (2009) ‘Commodification’, in Castree, Noel, et al. (eds) ''A Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 123-142. (p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Marxist geography]] and [[political ecology]]. Theorists use a [[commodification]] [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] in order to contest the perspectives of "[[Free-market environmentalism|market environmentalism]]," which sees marketization as a solution to [[environmental degradation]]. The [[Natural environment|environment]]  has been a key site of conflict between proponents of the expansion of market norms, relations and modes of [[governance]] and those who oppose such expansion.  Critics emphasize the contradictions and undesirable physical and ethical consequences brought about by the commodification of [[Resource#Natural resources|natural resources]] (as inputs to production and products) and processes ([[Ecosystem services|environmental services]]  or conditions).

Most researchers who employ a commodification of nature framing invoke a [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] conceptualization of commodities as "objects [[Production (economics)|produced]]  for sale on the market"&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, Karl (2001) ''The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time'', Boston: Beacon Press. (p. 75)&lt;/ref&gt; that embody both [[Use value|use]] and [[exchange value]]. Commodification itself is a process by which goods and services not produced for sale are converted into an exchangeable form.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy, Nicolás and Corbera, Esteve (2010) ‘Payments for Ecosystem Services as Commodity Fetishism’, ''Ecological Economics'', 69(1): pp. 1228-1236. (p. 1229); Prudham 2009 (p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt;  It involves multiple elements, including [[privatization]], [[Alienation (property law)|alienation]], individuation, abstraction, [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] and displacement.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, Noel (2003) ‘Commodifying What Nature?’, ''Progress in Human Geography'', 27(3): pp. 273-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

As capitalism expands in breadth and depth, more and more things previously external to the system become “internalized,” including entities and processes that are usually considered "natural." [[Nature]], as a concept, however, is very difficult to define, with many layers of meaning, including external environments as well as humans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Bruce (2009) ‘Nature’, in Castree, Noel, et al. (eds) ''A Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 19-36. (p. 20); Castree, Noel (2005) ''Nature'', London: Routledge.; Smith, Neil (2008) U''neven Development: Nature, Capital, and the Production of Space, Third Edition'', Athens: University of Georgia Press. (p. 11)&lt;/ref&gt; Political ecology and other critical conceptions draw upon strands within Marxist geography that see nature as "[[Social nature|socially produced]]," with no neat boundary separating the "social" from the "natural."&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, Karen and Bridge, Gavin (2006) ‘Material Worlds? Resource Geographies and the "Matter of Nature"’, ''Progress in Human Geography'', 30(10): pp. 5-27. (p. 8); Braun 2009 (p. 24); Castree 2005 (p. 24); Castree, Noel (2010a) ‘Neoliberalism and the Biophysical Environment 1: What ‘Neoliberalism’ is, and What Difference Nature Makes to it’, ''Geography Compass'', 4(12): pp. 1725-1733. (p. 1725); Smith 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the commodification of entities and processes that are considered natural is viewed as a "special case" based on nature’s biophysical [[Materialism|materiality]], which "shape[es] and condition[s] trajectories of commodification."&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2009 (p. 128)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and development ==

=== Classical liberalism and enclosure ===
The commodification of nature has its origins in the rise of [[capitalism]]. In [[England]] and later elsewhere, "[[enclosure]]" involved attacks upon and eventual near-elimination of [[the commons]]—a long, contested and frequently violent process Marx referred to as "[[Primitive accumulation of capital|primitive accumulation]]."&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010a (p. 1730); McCarthy, James (2009) ‘Commons’, in Castree, N., et al. (eds) ''A Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 498-514. (p. 500)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical liberalism]], the ideological aspect of this process, was closely bound to questions of the environment. Privatization was presented as "more conducive to the careful stewardship of natural resources than the commons"&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy 2009 (p. 501)&lt;/ref&gt; by thinkers like [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]], [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Malthus]].  The [[Malthusianism|neo-Malthusian]] discourse of [[Garrett Hardin|Garrett Hardin’s]] "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" (1968) parallels this perspective, reconceptualizing public goods as "scarce commodities" requiring either privatization or strong state control.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy 2009 (p. 503)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecology Against Capitalism'''

As Foster points out in ''Ecology Against Capitalism'', the environment is not a commodity (such as most things are treated in capitalism) but it is rather the biosphere that sustains all life that we know of. However, it is important to note that in our society, it is treated as a capitalistic value. For example, a price is put on lumber in a certain forest or the quality of water in a river or stream, or the minerals that are available under ground. These ways of putting a price on the ecosystem tend to forget to put a price on exploiting it. This can cause more damage to an ecosystem if the externalities for business are not taken into consideration. One way to fix this problem is taxes that will increase the cost of environmental damage. For example, a carbon tax would help society get off of fossil fuels and go towards renewables much faster. This is one step that many scientists and experts agree needs to happen in order to transition away from fossil fuels and delay or even prevent man made climate change. Deregulation of governmental programs such as the EPA, and other environmental organizations may be good for business, but it doesn't serve the people who must live on a more polluted earth.

=== Capitalist expansion ===
[[Marxism|Marxists]] define capitalism as a socio-economic system whose central goal is the [[Capital accumulation|accumulation]] of more wealth through the production and exchange of commodities. While the commodity form is not unique to capitalism, in it economic production is motivated increasingly by exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2009 (p. 125, 127)&lt;/ref&gt; Competition provides constant pressure for innovation and growth in a "restless and unstable process,"  making the system expansionary and "tendentially all-encompassing."&lt;ref&gt;Castree, Noel (2010b) ‘Neoliberalism and the Biophysical Environment 2: Theorising the Neoliberalisation of Nature’, ''Geography Compass'', 4(12): pp. 1734-1746. (pp. 1736-1737, 1738)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through market [[globalization]], the tendency Marx described in the [[The Communist Manifesto|''Communist Manifesto'']] in which "[t]he need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe,"&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, and Engels, Friedrich (1967) [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm ''The Communist Manifesto''], New York: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; capitalism converts nature into "an appendage of the production process."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Neil (2008) ''Uneven Development: Nature, Capital, and the Production of Space, Third Edition'', Athens: University of Georgia Press. (p. 71)&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] argues, "[n]o part of the earth’s surface, the atmosphere, the oceans, the geological substratum, or the biological superstratum are immune from transformation by capital."&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2008 (p. 79)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neoliberal nature ===
Since the late 1980s, an ideology of “market environmentalism” has gained prominence within environmental policy.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1230); Liverman, Diana (2004) ‘Who Governs, at What Scale and at What Price? Geography, Environmental Governance, and the Commodification of Nature’, ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 94(4): pp. 734-738.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a perspective is based in [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]], which sees [[Environmental degradation|degradation]] as a result of the absence of prices in environmental goods.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill, John (2001) ‘Markets and the Environment: The Solution is the Problem’, ''Economic and Political Weekly'', 36(21): pp. 1865-1873. (p. 1865)&lt;/ref&gt; Market environmentalism gained widespread acceptance through the rise of neoliberalism, an approach to human affairs in which the "[[free market]]" is given priority and money-mediated relations are seen as the best way to deliver services.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, Noel 2010a (p. 1726)&lt;/ref&gt;

A neoliberal approach constructs nature as a "world currency," valued in international markets and given "the opportunity to earn its own right to survive."&lt;ref&gt;McAfee, Kathleen (1999) ‘Selling Nature to Save It? Biodiversity and Green Developmentalism’, ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space'', 17(2): pp. 133-154. (p. 133, 134)&lt;/ref&gt; This "selling nature to save it" approach&lt;ref&gt;McAfee 1999&lt;/ref&gt; requires economic valuation — either indirectly, as with [[cost-benefit analysis]] and [[contingent valuation]],  or through direct commodification.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 285); O’Neill 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

While commodification efforts are propelled in large part by [[Private sector|private firms]] seeking new areas of investment and avenues for the circulation of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], there are also explicit policy prescriptions for privatization and market exchange of resources, production [[By-product|byproducts]] and processes as the best means to rationally manage and conserve the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (2007) ''A Brief History of Neoliberalism'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.; Prudham 2009 (p. 123)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stretching and deepening ===
The commodification of nature occurs through two distinct "moments" as capitalization "stretches" its reach to include greater distances of space and time, and "deepens" to penetrate into more types of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Castree, Noel (2010b) ‘Neoliberalism and the Biophysical Environment 2: Theorising the Neoliberalisation of Nature’, ''Geography Compass'', 4(12): pp. 1734-1746. (p. 1739); Prudham 2009 (p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt; External nature becomes an "accumulation strategy" for capital, through traditional examples like [[mining]] and [[agriculture]] as well as new "[[commodity frontiers]]" in [[Commercialization of traditional medicines|bioprospecting]] and [[ecotourism]].

David Harvey sees this as "the wholesale commodification of nature in all its forms," a "new wave of ‘enclosing the commons’"&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (2003) ''The New Imperialism'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. (p. 148)&lt;/ref&gt; that employs environmentalism in the service of the rapid expansion of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010b (p. 1744); McAfee 1999 (p. 134)&lt;/ref&gt;  This "[[accumulation by dispossession]]" releases [[asset]]s at very low or zero cost,  providing immediate profitability and counteracting [[overaccumulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 2007; McCarthy 2009 (p. 511)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prudham 2009, p126.jpg|thumb|'''Commodification as an integrated process of "stretching" and "deepening"'''&lt;ref name="Prudham 2009 p. 126"&gt;Prudham 2009 (p. 126)&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Aspects of commodification ==
At the most abstract level, commodification is a process through which qualitatively different things are made equivalent and exchangeable through the medium of [[money]]. By taking on a general quality of exchange value, they become [[Unit commensurability|commensurable]].&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 278, 279)&lt;/ref&gt; Commodification turns on this apparent dissolution of qualitative difference and its “renegotiation,” as commodities are standardized in order to maintain a constant identity across space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1228); Prudham 2009 (pp. 129-131)&lt;/ref&gt;

Commodity status is not something intrinsic to a natural entity, but is rather an assigned quality,&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 277); Prudham 2009 (p. 124, 129, 137)&lt;/ref&gt; brought about through an active process. The conversion of a whole class of goods or services&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 278); Prudham 2005 (p.8)&lt;/ref&gt; necessitates changes in the way nature is [[concept]]ualized and [[discourse|discursively]] represented.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, Gaven and Perreault, Thomas (2009) ‘Environmental Governance’, in Castree, Noel, et al. (eds) ''A Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 475-497. (p. 487); Prudham 2009 (p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no "single path" to commodification.&lt;ref name="Prudham 2009 p. 126"/&gt; [[Noel Castree]] stresses that commodification in fact involves several interrelated aspects, or "relational moments," that should not be confused or conflated as they can be employed independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003; Prudham 2009 (p. 132)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Privatization''''' is the assigning of [[Title (property)|legal title]] to an entity or process. A commodity needs to be owned, either by an individual or a group, in order to be traded.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 279)&lt;/ref&gt; Privatization of natural entities can entail enclosure or the representation thereof (as with [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]]), and represents a shift in social relations, changing rights of access, use and disposal as things move from communally-, state- or unowned modes into private hands.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2011 (p. 35, 36)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Alienability''''' is the capacity of a given commodity to be separated, physically and morally, from its seller. If a commodity is not alienable, it cannot be exchanged and is thus shielded from the market.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 279, 280); O’Neill 2001 (p. 1867)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, human organs might be privatized (owned by their bearer) but very rarely would they be considered alienable.

'''''Individuation''''' is the representational and physical act of separating a commodity from its supporting context through legal and/or material boundaries. This could involve "splitting" an ecosystem into legally-defined and tradable property rights to specific services or resources.&lt;ref&gt;The construction of something as a resource is a matter of convention, and "involves a discursive and practical ‘cut’ into the seamless complexity of the world in order to name discrete ‘noun-chunks’ of reality that are deemed to be socially useful" (Castree 2003, p. 280)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Abstraction''''' is the assimilation of a given thing into a broader type or process, the transformation of particular things into classes.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 281); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1231)&lt;/ref&gt; Through ''functional abstraction'', "wetlands" are constructed as a generic category despite the uniqueness of physical sites&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 281); Robertson, Morgan McEuen (2000) ‘No Net Loss’, ''Antipode'', 32(4): pp. 463-493.&lt;/ref&gt; and different gasses and activities are equated through [[Emissions trading|carbon markets]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, Larry (2010) ‘"Strange Markets" and the Climate Crisis’, in Bonilla, O. and Galvez, E. ''Crisis Financier o Crisis Civilizatoria'', Quito: Instituto de Estudios Ecologistas del Tercer Mundo. (p. 5); MacKenzie, Donald (2009) ‘Making Things the Same: Gases, Emissions Rights and the Politics of Carbon Markets’, ''Accounting, Organizations and Society'', 34(1): pp. 440-455. (p. 440)&lt;/ref&gt; Through ''spatial abstraction'' things in one place are treated as the same as things located elsewhere so that both can form part of the same market.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 281); MacKenzie 2009 (p. 440, 444)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Valuation''''' is the manifestation of all expressions of worth ([[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], practical, [[Ethics|ethical]], ''et cetera'') through a single exchange value. Monetization is thus foundational to capitalism, rendering things commensurable and exchangeable, allowing for the separation of production, circulation and consumption over great gulfs of time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 281); Prudham 2009 (p. 124)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Displacement''''' involves something appearing as "something other than itself." Commodities might be better thought of as "socio-natural relations" than [[Reification (Marxism)|reified]] as things "in and of themselves," but through spatio-temporal separation of producers and consumers, the histories and relations of commodities become obscured.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 282); Prudham 2009 (p. 132)&lt;/ref&gt; This is Marx’s [[commodity fetishism]], the "making invisible" of the social relationships and embeddedness of production.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1228, 1229)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with commodification ==
[[Commodification of nature#Further reading|Critics]] see environmental degradation as stemming from these processes of commodification, and generally include at least implicit criticism of one or more aspect. There appear to be three broad "problem areas" from which the commodification of nature is critiqued: ''practical'', in terms of whether or not nature can be properly made into a commodity; ''moral'', in terms of the ethical implications of commodification; and ''consequential'', in terms of the effects of commodification on nature itself.

=== Practical problems ===
Much of the literature relates commodification of nature to the issue of materiality—the significance of biophysical properties and context. The qualitative differences of a heterogeneous biophysical world are seen to be analytically and practically significant, sources of unpredictability and resistance to human intention that also shape and provide opportunities for capital circulation and accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker &amp; Bridge 2006; Braun 2009; Castree 2003; Castree 2005; Kloppenburg, Jr., Jack Ralph (2004) ''First the Seed: The Political Economy of Plant Biotechnology, 1492-2000, Second Edition'', Madison: University of Wisconsin Press.; Mansfield, Becky (2004) ‘Rules of Privatization: Contradictions in Neoliberal Regulation of North Pacific Fisheries’, ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 94(3): pp. 565-584.; Prudham, William Scott (2005) ''Knock on Wood: Nature as Commodity in Douglas-Fir Country'', London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tangible non-human world thus affects the construction of social and economic relations and practice, inscribing ecology in the dynamics of capital. While some "natures" are readily subsumed by capitalism, others "resist" complete commodification, displaying a form of "[[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]."&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 289)&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological characteristics of [[Fishery|marine fish]], for example, affect the forms that privatization, industry structure and [[Regulation (socio-legal concept)|regulation]] can take.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield 2004 (p. 565)&lt;/ref&gt; Water, also, does not commodify easily due to its physical properties, which leads to differentiation in its governing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker &amp; Bridge 2006 (p. 18)&lt;/ref&gt;

The demarcation and pricing of nature-based commodities is thus problematic. Divisibility and exclusion are difficult, as it is often not possible to draw clean property rights around environmental services or resources.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1231); Mansfield 2004 (p. 578); O’Neill 2001 (pp. 1867-1868); O’Neill, John (2007) ''Markets, Deliberation and Environment'', London: Routledge.(p. 42)&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, pricing is a problem as many species, landscapes and services are unique or otherwise irreplaceable and [[Unit commensurability|incommensurable]].&lt;ref&gt;Castree, N. (2011) ‘Neoliberalism and the Biophysical Environment 3: Putting Theory into Practice’, ''Geography Compass'', 5(1): pp. 35-49. (p. 37, 43);Liverman 2004 (p. 735)&lt;/ref&gt; Their monetary values are thus in many ways arbitrary, as they do not follow changes in quality or quantity but rather social preference, failing to convey "real" ecological value or reasons for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 286); Henderson, George (2009) ‘Marxist Political Economy and the Environment’, in Castree, Noel, et al. (eds) A'' Companion to Environmental Geography'', Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 266-293. (p. 277); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1234); O’Neill 2007 (p. 28)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral difficulties ===
A single monetary value also denies the multiplicity of values which could be attributed to nature — non-monetary systems of cultural and social importance.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1228, 1232)&lt;/ref&gt;  The environment can express relations between generations as a sort of [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. [[Livelihood]], territorial rights and "[[sacred]]ness" poorly translate into prices, and dividing a communal-social value — a forest, for instance — into private property rights can undermine the relations and identity of a community.&lt;ref&gt;Liverman 2004 (p. 735); O’Neill 2007 (p. 50)&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoliberal policies have been implicated in greatly altered patterns of access and use. Markets generally deal poorly with issues of [[procedural fairness]] and [[Distribution of wealth|equitable distribution]], and critics see commodification as producing greater levels of [[Social inequality|inequality]] in power and participation while reinforcing existing vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2011 (p. 36); Corbera, Esteve, Brown, Katrina, and Adger, W. Neil (2007) ‘The Equity and Legitimacy of Markets for Ecosystem Services’, ''Development and Change'', 38(4): pp. 587-613. (p. 587, 608); Harvey 2003 (p. 144); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1232); Liverman 2004 (p. 735)&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem benefits might be considered "normative [[Public economics#Public goods|public goods]]"&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill 2007 (pp. 51-52)&lt;/ref&gt; — even when commodified, there is a sense that individuals ''ought'' to not be excluded from access. When [[water privatization]] prices people out, for instance, a sense of use [[Rights#Natural rights versus legal rights|rights]] inspires [[protest]].&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2009 (pp. 128-129)&lt;/ref&gt; While neoliberal approaches are often presented as neutral or [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], they disguise highly political approaches to resources and the interests and power of certain actors.&lt;ref&gt;McAfee 1999 (p. 133, 135, 151)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problematic consequences ===
Through commodification, natural entities and services become vehicles for the realization of profit,&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2005 (p. 159, 282)&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the pressures of the market where [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] overrides other concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann 2010 (p. 4); Henderson 2009 (p. 274)&lt;/ref&gt; With climate commodities, the profit motive incentivizes buyers and sellers to ignore the [[Cap and trade#Criticism|steady erosion of the climate mitigation goal]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann 2010 (pp. 7-8)&lt;/ref&gt; Market exchange is "reason-blind,"&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill 2001 (p. 1866); O’Neill 2007 (p. 28)&lt;/ref&gt; but without rational assessment of different strategies and the ecological importance of particular natural entities, commodification cannot effectively deliver on conservation.&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann 2010 (p. 5); O’Neill 2001 (p. 1869)&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvey thus declares that there is something "inherently anti-ecological" about capitalist commodification.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996 (p. 155)&lt;/ref&gt; It ignores and simplifies complex relations, obscuring origins and narrowing things to a single service or standard unit.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1228, 1231)&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of things as the same for a particular end — either profit or a single utility — leads to a homogenization and simplification of the biophysical. As governments and private firms seek to maximize carbon content for emissions markets, they invest preferably in [[Tree farm#Tree farming and climate change|tree plantations]] over complex forest ecosystems, eliminating species diversity, density and resulting in [[domino effect]]s on processes such as water flow.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1231); Prudham 2005; Prudham 2009 (p. 131)&lt;/ref&gt;

The neglect of relational aspects also ignores the [[Emergence|emergent]] and embedded character of ecosystem functions. Components are frequently dependent on each other and the result of interactions between [[Biotic component|biotic]] and non-biotic factors across space and at multiple levels. Alienation and individuation may thus be counterproductive to the provision of ecosystem services, and veils human perception of what an ecosystem is and how it functions—and consequently how to best conserve and repair it.&lt;ref&gt;Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (pp. 1231-1232)&lt;/ref&gt;  John Bellamy Foster argues that neglect of such relational aspects is a result of economic reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, John Bellamy (2002) "Ecology Against Capitalism", New York: Monthly Review Press. (p. 32-34)&lt;/ref&gt;  This reductionism leads to an inefficiency in promoting biodiversity since as ecosystems are simplified into more basic commodities they can no longer support as diverse a set of organisms as they could precommodification.  This creates a concern that the commodification of nature lends itself toward undermining biodiversity through its pursuit of attaching a value to nature.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, John Bellamy 2002 (p.33-34)&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Polanyi voiced this concern when addressing the concept of treating nature as a commodity. If nature were treated as a commodity it would be concentrated down to its base parts and destroyed. Polanyi highlighted many of the concerns that contemporary environmentalists have by noting that nature's commodification would lead to its pollution, overuse, and eventually imperil human life &lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, Karl (2001) "The Great Transformation: The Political and Economic Origins of Our Time" 2nd ed. Boston: Beacon Press (p. 75-76)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crisis and resistance ==

=== Incomplete capitalization and the fictitious commodity ===
When confronted with natural "barriers to accumulation," capitalists attempt to overcome them through technical and social innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2005 (p. 161); Mansfield, Becky (2004) ‘Rules of Privatization: Contradictions in Neoliberal Regulation of North Pacific Fisheries’, ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 94(3): pp. 565-584.(p. 577)&lt;/ref&gt; This often involves the modification of nature to fit the needs of production and exchange, allowing for fuller realization of profits. Nature is "subsumed" to capitalist accumulation, losing its "independent" capacity and approaching "the archetype of a ‘pure’ commodity."&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 282, 286); Castree 2005 (p. 161)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as nature becomes "[[Rationalization (economics)|rationalized]]" and internalized, increasing the control of capitalists over exchange, production and distribution,&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2005 (p.15); Smith 2008 (p. 68)&lt;/ref&gt; a new contradiction emerges. Capitalist penetration into natural commodities can never be complete, because a certain amount of production, by definition, takes place prior to human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge &amp; Perreault 2009 (p. 488); Prudham 2005 (p.12, 16, 17)&lt;/ref&gt; Because natural entities and processes do not require capital or labor to be produced, and their social, cultural and/or ecological value ''exceeds'' the market value placed upon them, they are considered [[Commodity (Marxism)#Pseudo-commodities|pseudo-]] or [[The Great Transformation (book)|fictitious commodities]].&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010b (p. 1738); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1230)&lt;/ref&gt; This basic fictitiousness is the origin of the material contradictions that arise when natural commodities are treated ''as if'' they were "true" commodities, as completely privatizable, alienable, separable, ''et cetera''.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 285); Prudham 2009 (p. 128)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible consequences of commodifying nature ===
Many scholars believe that ecology and capitalism are against one another regarding climate change.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology Against Capitalism|last=Foster|first=John Bellamy|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2002|isbn=1583670564|location=New York|pages=2, 26–37|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As environmental economics is a relatively new field of study, and capitalism a significantly older economic system, radical change of current capitalist systems is highly unlikely while internalization of natural resources into the economy is much more feasible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[John Bellamy Foster]] believes that commodification of nature might be more dangerous than the impending danger of climate change and ecologic disaster. Foster fears that commodification of nature might lead to a system that favors economy over ecology (endangering natural resources) and promote a form of [[neocolonialism]] that acknowledges the elements of capitalism, globalization, and cultural imperialism, but disregards the idea of colonialism altogether.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Degradation of resources, underproduction of conditions ===
As fictitious commodities with origins outside of capitalist production, the value of nature, counter to the neoclassical assumption, ''cannot'' be fully accounted for in monetary terms, and there is a resultant tendency toward the [[overexploitation]] and "underproduction" of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010b (p. 1740); Kosoy &amp; Corbera 2010 (p. 1231); O‘Connor, James (1998) ''Natural Causes: Essays in Ecological Marxism'', London: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural entities that are commodified are subjected to the competitive drive for accumulation. Capitalism is "ecologically irrational," with a systematic tendency to overexploit its natural resource base.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2005 (pp. 156-158, 160)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, what O’Connor terms the "[[conditions of production]]" (all the phenomena upon which capitalism depends but is unable to produce itself, including environmental conditions and processes) are subjected to indiscriminate degradation as they ''cannot'' be fully commodified.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2003 (p. 284); Castree 2010b (p. 1740); O’Connor 1998 (p. 31); Prudham 2005 (p.8, 12)&lt;/ref&gt; This is the [[Eco-socialism#The "second contradiction" of capitalism|"second contradiction"]] of capitalism, between the [[Relations of production|relations]] and [[Productive forces|forces of production]] and its conditions.&lt;ref name="O’Connor 1998"&gt;O’Connor 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Capitalism undermines its own production system, "producing its own scarcity."&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 2009 (p. 277)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reclaiming the commons? ===
Recruiting nature into relations of capitalist exchange "incites a good deal of push back," as these entities and services "matter a great deal to ordinary people."&lt;ref name="Henderson 2009 pp. 276-277"&gt;Henderson 2009 (pp. 276-277)&lt;/ref&gt; Social needs compete politically for access and control of an increasingly commodified nature,&lt;ref&gt;Prudham 2005 (p.8)&lt;/ref&gt; and as price is insufficient to resolve these competing claims, [[Social movement|counter-movements]] emerge,&lt;ref name="Henderson 2009 pp. 276-277"/&gt; expressing the "[[Crisis theory|crisis tendencies]]" of capitalist nature&lt;ref name="O’Connor 1998"/&gt; through socio-political struggles over representation and access.&lt;ref&gt;Castree 2010a (p. 1731); Castree 2010b (p. 1741); McCarthy 2009 (p. 507); Prudham 2009 (pp. 128-129)&lt;/ref&gt;

Protest movements, transnational coalitions, instances of alternative practices and counter-discourses all fall within a broad tent of resistance struggles to "reclaim the commons."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 2003 (p. 162); McAfee 1999 (p. 133); Also see Klein, Naomi (2001) [http://newleftreview.org/A2323 ‘Reclaiming the Commons’], ''New Left Review'', (9): pp. 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen as Polanyi’s "[[Double movement (social sciences)|double movement]]," in which tendencies toward and against market coordination interact,&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi 2001 ''in'' Castree 2010b (p. 1739)&lt;/ref&gt; based in a rejection of the treatment of the environment as alienable market goods.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neill 2001 (p. 1867)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific Examples in Modern Society ==
While there are numerous natural resources that are being capitalized upon all across the world, there are several more notable examples of commodification of nature. The following examples are some that are either more prevalent or larger in scale and scope.

=== Emissions Trading ===
[[Emissions trading]], commonly referred to as cap and trade, embodies commodification of nature in that it allows for the trade of pollution and emissions within a given limit for a specific environment. Rather than simply outright prohibiting or allowing pollution and other various negative externalities, cap and trade essentially permits members of an industry to buy and sell units of emission with a maximum set for the industry as a whole.

While there are various outlooks on whether emissions trading is effective in cutting emissions or pollution, it is pertinent to understand that this concept takes a company or individual's emissions and presents them as something that can be bought or sold on a specialized market.

=== Drinking Water ===
As [[capitalism]] has spread in leaps and bounds, so too has its reach on previously universal resources; one such resource is [[drinking water]].&lt;ref name="investopedia.com"&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/water.asp&lt;/ref&gt; As more and more people struggle to find access to clean water, a major economic industry has formed in response, striving to provide this resource to consumers.

Water, a fundamental resource to human survival, now is a multibillion dollar industry.&lt;ref name="investopedia.com"/&gt; Essentially what this means is that something that used to be completely free and public has been taken and turned into a privatized service. One modern example of water commodification is the current conflict going on in [[Flint, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/04/us/flint-water-crisis-fast-facts/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petroleum ===
As [[petroleum]] has begun to be used for fuel and other various mechanical and transportation uses, the demand for the natural resource has skyrocketed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=33&amp;t=6&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an economic industry has formed that completely revolves around the extraction and sale of the resource. By extension, many other industries also rely on the resource such as the automotive industry or anyone that relies on transportation for their business.

Oil is just one of many natural resources being taken from the environment to be sold in markets of various size and influence across the globe. What sets this resource apart from others, however, is that so many other industries are reliant upon oil that it has become one of the most sought after resources across the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aapg.org/about/petroleum-geology/petroleum-through-time/what-is-petroleum&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8396">'''Courtship disorder''' is a theoretical construct in [[sexology]] in which a certain set of [[paraphilias]] are seen as specific instances of anomalous [[courtship]] instincts in men.&lt;ref name="aggrawal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anil |last=Aggrawal |title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |location=Boca Raton |year=2009 |isbn=1-4200-4308-0 |url=http://crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420043082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific paraphilias are [[biastophilia]] (paraphilic [[rape]]), [[exhibitionism]], [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatologia]], and [[voyeurism]]. According to the ''courtship disorder hypothesis'', there is a species-typical courtship process in human males consisting of four phases, and anomalies in different phases result in one of these paraphilic sexual interests. That is, instead of being independent paraphilias, this theory sees these sexual interests as individual symptoms of a single underlying disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Freund, K. |author2=Kolářský, A. |date=1965|title=Grundzüge eines einfachen bezugsystems für die analyse sexueller deviationen ['Basic features of a reference system for considering anomalous erotic preferences']|work=Psychiatrie, Neurologie, and Medizinische Psychologie|volume= 17|pages= 221–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Courtship disorder hypothesis ==
According to the ''courtship disorder hypothesis'', there is a species-typical courtship process in humans consisting of four phases.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K. (1976). "Diagnosis and treatment of forensically significant anomalous erotic preferences." ''Canadian Journal of Criminology and Corrections'', 18, 181–189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K., &amp; Blanchard, R. (1986). "The concept of courtship disorder." ''Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy'', 12, 79–92.&lt;/ref&gt; These phases are: "(1) looking for and appraising potential sexual partners; (2) pretactile interaction with those partners, such as by smiling at and talking to them; (3) tactile interaction with them, such as by embracing or petting; (4) and then sexual intercourse."&lt;ref name=Cantor2009&gt;Cantor, J. M., Blanchard, R., &amp; Barbaree, H. E. (2009). Sexual disorders. In P. H. Blaney &amp; T. Millon (Eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 527–548). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The associations between these phases and these paraphilias were first outlined by [[Kurt Freund]],&lt;ref name=Freund1988&gt;Freund, K. (1988). "Courtship disorder: Is the hypothesis valid?" ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 528, 172–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Freund1983&gt;Freund, K., Scher, H., &amp; Hucker, S. (1983). The courtship disorders. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 12, 369–379.&lt;/ref&gt; the originator of the theory: A disturbance of the search phase of courtship manifests as [[voyeurism]], a disturbance of the pretactile interaction phase manifests as [[exhibitionism]] or [[telephone scatologia]], a disturbance of the tactile interaction phase manifests as toucheurism or [[frotteurism]], and the absence of the courtship behavior phases manifests as paraphilic [[rape]] (i.e., [[biastophilia]]). According to Freund, these paraphilias "can be conceptualized as a preference for a pattern of behavior or [[erotic fantasy]] in which one of these four phases of sexual interaction is intensified and distorted to such an extent that it appears to be a caricature of the normal, while the remaining phases are either omitted entirely or are retained only in a vestigial way."&lt;ref name=Freund1990&gt;Freund, K. (1990). "Courtship disorder." In W. L. Marshall, D. R. Laws, &amp; H. E. Barbaree (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexual Assault: Issues, Theories, and Treatment of the Offender'' (pp. 195–207). NY: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freund noted that ''[[troilism]]'' (a paraphilia for observing one’s sexual/romantic partner sexually interacting with a third party, usually unbeknownst to the third party)&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, M. (1938). ''Sexual Anomalies and Perversions: Physical and Psychological Development, Diagnosis and Treatment'' (new and revised ed.). London: Encyclopaedic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; might also be a courtship disorder,&lt;ref name=Freund1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K., &amp; Watson, R. (1990). "Mapping the boundaries of courtship disorder." ''The Journal of Sex Research'', 27, 589–606.&lt;/ref&gt; troilism being a variant of voyeurism.

Appropriate behaviors depend on the social and cultural context, including time and place. Some behaviors that are unacceptable under most circumstances, such as [[public nudity]] or sexual contact between dancers, may be accepted or even encouraged during celebrations like [[Carnival]] or [[New Orleans Mardi Gras#Nudity and Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]]. Where such cultural festivals alter normative courtship behaviors, the signs of courtship disorder may be masked or altered.&lt;ref&gt;Maharajh, H. D., &amp; Konings, M. (2007). [https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083029681 Dancing frotteurism and courtship disorder in Trinidad and Tobago.] ''Journal of Chinese Clinical Medicine'', 7(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence and acceptance of the theory ==
Paraphilias within the Courtship Disorder spectrum co-occur with each other more frequently than with paraphilias outside the courtship disorder spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Abel, G. G., &amp; Osborn, C. (1992). "The paraphilias: The extent and nature of sexually deviant and criminal behavior." ''Psychiatric Clinics of North America'', 15, 675–689.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abel, G. G., Becker, J. V., Cunningham-Rathner, J., Mittelman, M., &amp; Rouleau, J.-L. (1988). "Multiple paraphilic diagnoses among sex offenders." ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law'', 16, 153–168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Templeman, T. L., &amp; Stinnet, R. D. (1991). "Patterns of sexual arousal and history in a "normal' sample of young men." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 20, 137–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fedora, O., Reddon, J. R., Morrison, J. W., Fedora, S. K., Pascoe, H., Yeudall, L. T. (1992). Sadism and other paraphilias in normal controls and nonaggressive sex offenders. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 21, 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The courtship disorder model offers an underlying common cause for these paraphilias in men to explain this co-occurrence.&lt;ref name=Freund1988/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freund1983/&gt;

Courtship disorder is widely cited by [[sexology|sexologists]] and forensic scientists as one of the predominant models of the paraphilias.&lt;ref&gt;Maea, M., &amp; Coccaro, E. F. (1998). ''Neurobiology and clinical views on aggression and impulsivity'' (Clinical &amp; neurobiological advances in psychiatry series). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McConaghy, N. (1993). ''Sexual Behavior: Problems and Management''. New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, E., Dwyer, S. M., &amp; Pallone, N. J. (Eds.) (1996). ''Sex Offender Treatment: Biological Dysfunction, Intrapsychic Conflict, and Interpersonal Violence''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, R. B., Kaplan, M. (2001). "The paraphilic and hypersexual disorders: An overview." ''Journal of Psychiatric Practice'', 7, 391–403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiederman, M. W. (2003). Paraphilia and Fetishism. ''The Family Journal'', 11, 315–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy and Page wrote that "The 'Courtship Disorder Theory' of Freund is one of the only theories specific to exhibitionism."&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, W. D., &amp; Page, I J. (2008). "Exhibitionism: Psychopathology and theory." In D. R. Laws and W. T. O'Donohue (Eds.), ''Sexual deviance: Theory, assessment, and treatment'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lavin (2008), "Freund's theory, more than the others, makes it clear that the ordering of activities ... has clinical significance."&lt;ref&gt;Lavin, M. (2008). "Voyeurism: Psychopathology and theory." In D. R. Laws and W. T. O'Donohue (Eds.), ''Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theoretically based taxonomy of the paraphilias was proposed by [[John Money]], who described the range of paraphilic interests as [[lovemap|love maps]].&lt;ref&gt;Money, John (1986). ''Love Maps: Clinical Concepts of Sexual/Erotic Health and Pathology, Paraphilia, and Gender Transposition in Childhood, Adolescence, and Maturity''. New York: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''emission intensity''' (also '''carbon intensity''', '''C.I.''') is the emission rate of a given [[pollutant]] relative to the intensity of a specific activity, or an industrial production process; for example [[gram]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] released per [[megajoule]] of energy produced, or the ratio of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions produced to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Emission intensities are used to derive estimates of [[air pollutant]] or greenhouse gas emissions based on the amount of fuel [[combustion|combusted]], the number of animals in [[animal husbandry]], on industrial production levels, distances traveled or similar activity data. Emission intensities may also be used to compare the environmental impact of different fuels or activities. In some case the related terms '''emission factor''' and '''carbon intensity''' are used interchangeably. The jargon used can be different, for different fields/industrial sectors; normally the term "carbon" excludes other pollutants, such as particulate emissions. One commonly used figure is '''carbon intensity per kilowatt-hour''' ('''CIPK'''), which is used to compare emissions from different sources of electrical power.

==Methodologies==
Different methodologies can be used to assess the carbon intensity of a process. Among the most used methodologies there are:
* The whole [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA): this includes not only the carbon emissions due to a specific process, but also those due to the production and end-of-life of materials, plants and machineries used for the considered process. This is a quite complex method, requiring a big set of variables.
* The well-to-wheels (WTW), commonly used in the Energy and Transport sectors: this is a simplified LCA considering the emissions of the process itself, the emissions due to the extraction and refining of the material (or fuel) used in the process (also "Upstream emissions", but excluding the emissions due to the production and end-of-life of plants and machineries. This methodology is used, in the U.S.A., by the [[GREET model]] and in Europe in the [http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/about-jec/jec-well-wheels-analyses-wtw JEC WTW].
* WTW-LCA hybrid methods, trying to fill in the gap between the WTW and LCA methods. In example, for an Electric Vehicle, an hybrid method considering also the GHG due to the manufacturing and the end of life of the battery gives GHG emissions 10-13% higher, compared to the WTW  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess |volume=22|pages=4–14|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Methods not considering LCA aspects but only the emissions occurring during a specific process; i.e. just the combustion of a fuel in a power plant, without considering the Upstream emissions.&lt;ref&gt;This method is used by the [[International Energy Agency]] in the annual report: [https://www.iea.org/statistics/relateddatabases/co2emissionsfromfuelcombustion/ CO2 emissions from fuel combustion].&lt;/ref&gt;

Different calculation methods can lead to different results. The results can largely vary also for different geographic regions and timeframes (see, in example, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920916307933 how C.I. of electricity varies, for different European countries, and how varied in a few years]: from 2009 to 2013 the C.I. of electricity in the European Union fell on average by 20%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles|journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment|volume=64|pages=5–14|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while comparing different values of Carbon Intensity it is important to correctly consider all the boundary conditions (or initial hypotheses) considered for the calculations. For example, Chinese oil fields emit between 1.5 to more than 40 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq per MJ with about 90% of all fields emitting 1.5–13.5 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq.&lt;ref name="Masnadi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masnadi|first1=M.|title=Well-to-refinery emissions and net-energy analysis of China's crude-oil supply|journal=Nature Energy|date=2018|volume=3|issue=3|pages=220–226|doi=10.1038/s41560-018-0090-7|bibcode=2018NatEn...3..220M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such highly skewed carbon intensity patterns necessitate disaggregation of seemingly homogenous emission activities and proper consideration of many factors for understanding.&lt;ref name="Höök2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höök|first1=M|title=Mapping Chinese supply|journal=Nature Energy|date=2018|volume=3|issue=3|pages=166–167|doi=10.1038/s41560-018-0103-6|bibcode=2018NatEn...3..166H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimating emissions ==

Emission factors assume a linear relation between the intensity of the activity and the emission resulting from this activity:

''Emission&lt;sub&gt;pollutant&lt;/sub&gt; = Activity * Emission Factor&lt;sub&gt;pollutant&lt;/sub&gt;''

Intensities are also used in projecting possible future scenarios such as those used in the [[International Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] assessments, along with projected future changes in population, economic activity and energy technologies. The interrelations of these variables is treated under the so-called [[Kaya identity]].

The level of uncertainty of the resulting estimates depends significantly on the source category and the pollutant. Some examples: 
*[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions from the combustion of fuel can be estimated with a high degree of certainty regardless of how the fuel is used as these emissions depend almost exclusively on the [[carbon]] content of the fuel, which is generally known with a high degree of precision. The same is true for [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), since sulphur contents of fuels are also generally well known. Both carbon and sulphur are almost completely oxidized during combustion and all carbon and sulphur atoms in the fuel will be present in the [[flue gas]]es as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.
*In contrast, the levels of other air pollutants and non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gas emissions from combustion depend on the precise technology applied when fuel is combusted. These emissions are basically caused by either incomplete combustion of a small fraction of the fuel ([[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], [[non-methane volatile organic compound]]s) or by complicated chemical and physical processes during the combustion and in the smoke stack or tailpipe. Examples of these are [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, a mixture of [[nitric oxide]], NO, and [[nitrogen dioxide]], NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
*[[Nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) emissions from agricultural soils are highly uncertain because they depend very much on both the exact conditions of the soil, the application of [[fertilizers]] and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] conditions.

==Energy sources emission intensity per unit of energy generated==
{{Main|Comparisons of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions}}
A literature review of numerous total life cycle energy sources {{CO2}} emissions per unit of electricity generated, conducted by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] in 2011, found that the {{CO2}} emission value, that fell within the 50th [[percentile]] of all total life cycle emissions studies were as follows.&lt;ref name="IPCC Annex II"&gt;Moomaw, W., P.

In 2009 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity of GDP in the OECD countries reduced by 2.9%  and amounted to 0.33 kCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/$05p in the OECD countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yearbook.enerdata.net/CO2-intensity-data.html|title=CO2 intensity - Map World CO2 Intensity by region - Enerdata|website=yearbook.enerdata.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("$05p" = 2005 US dollars, using purchasing power parities). The USA posted a higher ratio of 0.41 kCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/$05p while Europe showed the largest drop in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity compared to the previous year (−3.7%). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity continued to be roughly higher in non-OECD countries. Despite a slight improvement, China continued to post a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity (0.81 kCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/$05p). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity in Asia rose by 2% during 2009 since energy consumption continued to develop at a strong pace. Important ratios were also observed in countries in CIS and the Middle East.

=== Carbon intensity in Europe ===

Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy use were 5% below their 1990 level in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odyssee-indicators.org/|title=Energy Efficiency Trends &amp; Policies - ODYSSEE-MURE|website=www.odyssee-indicators.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the period 1990–2007, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy use have decreased on average by 0.3%/year although the economic activity (GDP) increased by 2.3%/year. After dropping until 1994 (−1.6%/year), the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have increased steadily (0.4%/year on average) until 2003 and decreased slowly again since (on average by 0.6%/year). Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per capita decreased from 8.7 t in 1990 to 7.8 t in 2007, that is to say a decrease by 10%.
Almost 40% of the reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity is due to increased use of energy carriers with lower emission factors.
Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per unit of GDP, the “CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity”, decreased more rapidly than energy intensity: by 2.3%/year and 1.4%/year, respectively, on average between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;This section deals with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy combustion published in official inventories from the European Environment Agency. The indicators are not expressed under normal climate conditions (i. e. with climate corrections) to comply with the official definition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inventories. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of final consumers include the emissions of auto producers.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important uses of emission factors is for the reporting of national [[Greenhouse gas inventory|greenhouse gas inventories]] under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The so-called [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I Parties]] to the UNFCCC have to annually report their national total emissions of greenhouse gases in a formalized reporting format, defining the source categories and fuels that must be included.

The UNFCCC has accepted the '''Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/invs6.html |title=Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories |publisher=IPCC |author=Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories |year=1996 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed and published by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) as the emission estimation methods that must be used by the parties to the convention to ensure transparency, completeness, consistency, comparability and accuracy of the national greenhouse gas inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2004/sbsta/08.pdf |title=FCCC/SBSTA/2004/8 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These IPCC Guidelines are the primary source for default emission factors. Recently IPCC has published the '''2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories'''. These and many more greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on IPCC's Emission Factor Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php |title=Emission Factor Database – Main Page |publisher=IPCC |year=2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially applicable organisational greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on the search engine, EmissionFactors.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emissionfactors.com/ |title=Emission Factors |work=emissionfactors.com |year=2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly for non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, there is often a high degree of uncertainty associated with these emission factors when applied to individual countries. In general, the use of country-specific emission factors would provide more accurate estimates of emissions than the use of the default emission factors. According to the IPCC, if an activity is a major source of emissions for a country ('key source'), it is 'good practice' to develop a country-specific emission factor for that activity.

== Emission factors for air pollutant inventory reporting ==
The [[UNECE|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] and the EU [[National Emission Ceilings Directive]] (2016) require countries to produce annual National Air Pollution Emission Inventories under the provisions of the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (CLRTAP).

The [[European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme]] (EMEP) Task Force of the [[European Environment Agency]] has developed methods to estimate emissions and the associated emission factors for air pollutants, which have been published in the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/emep-eea-air-pollutant-emission-inventory-guidebook EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook].eea.europa.eu, 2016, retrieved 13.7.2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emep.int/|title=EMEP Home|website=www.emep.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Emission Inventories and Projections TFEIP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080315073635/http://tfeip-secretariat.org/unece.htm TFEIP], 2008-03-15 tfeip-secretariat&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intensity targets ==
[[Image:GHG intensity 2000.svg|thumb|400px|Greenhouse gas intensity in 2000 including land-use change]]

The U.S. plans to cut carbon intensity per dollar of GDP by 18% by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070420-9.html White house fact sheet: Earth day 2007] (see section on ''providing a Realistic growth-orientated approach to climate change''&lt;/ref&gt; This has been criticised by the World Resources Institute as this approach does not ensure absolute reductions if GDP grows faster than intensity declines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wri.org/stories/2007/04/chinas-carbon-intensity-target# |title=China's Carbon Intensity Target |author=Tim Herzog |publisher=World resources Institute |date=2007-04-27 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 2000, the carbon intensity of the U.S. economy declined by 17%, yet total emissions increased by 14%.&lt;ref name=bfr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth-policy.org/index.php?/indicators/C52/carbon_emissions_2002 |title=Carbon Emissions Climbing |publisher=Earth Policy Institute |accessdate=2006-08-12 |year=2001 |last=Fischlowitz-Roberts |first=Bernie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the U.S. National Environmental trust labelled carbon intensity, "a bookkeeping trick which allows the administration to do nothing about global warming while unsafe levels of emissions continue to rise."&lt;ref name=net.org&gt;[http://www.net.org/reports/rollbacks/warming.vtml "National Environmental Trust Special Reports", 2002.

'''Escapism''' is the avoidance of unpleasant, boring, arduous, scary, or banal aspects of [[Everyday life|daily life]].&lt;ref&gt;https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/escapism&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used as a term to define the actions people take to help relieve persistent feelings of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] or general [[sadness]].

==Perceptions==
Entire industries have sprung up to foster a growing tendency of people to remove themselves from the rigors of daily life – especially into the digital world.&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Many activities that are normal parts of a healthy existence (e.g., eating, sleeping, exercise, sexual activity) can also become avenues of escapism when taken to extremes or out of proper context; and as a result the word "escapism" often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that escapists are unhappy, with an inability or unwillingness to connect meaningfully with the world and to take necessary action.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the [[OED]] defined escapism as "The tendency to seek, or the practice of seeking, distraction from what normally has to be endured".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in T. A. Shipley, ''The Road to Middle-Earth'' (1992) p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many challenge the idea that escapism is fundamentally and exclusively negative. [[C. S. Lewis]] was fond of humorously remarking that the usual enemies of escape were jailers;&lt;ref&gt;G. Kainer, ''Grace and the Great Controversy'' (2010) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and considered that used in moderation escapism could serve both to refresh and to expand the imaginative powers.&lt;ref&gt;D. Baggett et al, ''C. S. Lewis as Philosopher'' (2009) p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] argued for escapism in fantasy literature as the creative expression of reality within a secondary (imaginative) world, (but also emphasised that they required an element of horror in them, if they were not to be 'mere escapism').&lt;ref&gt;T. F. Nicolay, ''Tolkien and the Modernists'' (2014) p. 79 and p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Pratchett]] considered that the twentieth century had seen the development over time of a more positive view of escapist literature.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pratchett &amp; Stephen Briggs, ''The Discworld Companion'' (2012) p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from literature, [[music]] has been seen and valued as an artistic medium of escape, too.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Dorschel]], ''Der Welt abhanden kommen. Über musikalischen Eskapismus''. In: ''Merkur'' 66 (2012), no. 2, pp. 135–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological escapes==
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] considered a quota of escapist [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] a necessary element in the life of humans: "[T]hey cannot subsist on the scanty satisfaction they can extort from reality. 'We simply cannot do without auxiliary constructions', [[Theodor Fontane]] once said".&lt;ref&gt;S, Freud, ''Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL1) p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; His followers saw rest and wish fulfilment (in small measures) as useful tools in adjusting to traumatic upset;&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946), p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; while later psychologists have highlighted the role of vicarious distractions in shifting unwanted [[Mood (psychology)|moods]], especially anger and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (1996) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if permanent residence is taken up in some such [[John Steiner (psychoanalyst)#Psychic retreat|psychic retreats]], the results will often be negative and even pathological.&lt;ref&gt;R. Britton, ''Belief and Imagination'' (2003) p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs cause some forms of escapism which can occur when certain mind-altering drugs are taken which make the participant forget the reality of where they are or what they are meant to be doing.

==Escapist societies==
Some social critics warn of attempts by the powers that control society to provide means of escapism instead of actually bettering the condition of the people – what [[Juvenal]] called “bread and the [[Gladiatorial games|games]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal, ''The Sixteen Satires'' (1982) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Escapist societies appear often in literature. ''[[The Time Machine]]'' depicts the Eloi, a lackadaisical, insouciant race of the future, and the horror their happy lifestyle belies. The novel subtly criticizes [[capitalism]], or at least classism, as a means of escape. Escapist societies are common in dystopian novels; for example, in the ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' society, television and "seashell radios" are used to escape a life with strict regulations and the threat of a forthcoming war. In science fiction media escapism is often depicted as an extension of social evolution, as society becomes detached from physical reality and processing into a virtual one, examples include the virtual world of Oz in the 2009 Japanese animated science fiction anime ''[[Summer Wars]]'' and the game "Society" in the 2009 American science fiction film ''[[Gamer (2009 film)|Gamer]]'', a play on the real-life [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] game ''[[Second Life]]''. Other escapist societies in literature include ''The Reality Bug'' by D. J. McHale, where an entire civilization leaves their world in ruin while they 'jump' into their perfect realities. The aim of the anti hero becomes a quest to make their realities seemingly less perfect in order to regain control over their dying planet.

Social philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]] wrote that utopias and images of fulfilment, however regressive they might be, also included an impetus for a radical social change. According to Bloch, social justice could not be realized without seeing things fundamentally differently. Something that is mere "daydreaming" or "escapism" from the viewpoint of a technological-rational society might be a seed for a new and more humane social order, as it can be seen as an "immature, but honest substitute for revolution".

==Escape scale==

The Norwegian psychologist Frode Stenseng has presented a dualistic model of escapism in relation to different types of activity engagements. He discusses the paradox that the flow state ([[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Csikszentmihalyi]]) resembles psychological states obtainable through actions such as drug abuse, sexual masochism, and suicide ideation ([[Roy Baumeister|Baumeister]]). Accordingly, he deduces that the state of escape can have both positive and negative meanings and outcomes. Stenseng argues that there exist two forms of escapism with different affective outcomes dependent on the motivational focus that lies behind the immersion in the activity. Escapism in the form of self-suppression stems from motives to run away from unpleasant thoughts, self-perceptions, and emotions, whereas self-expansion stems from motives to gain positive experiences through the activity and to discover new aspects of self. Stenseng has developed the "escape scale" to measure self-suppression and self-expansion in people´s favorite activities, such as sports, arts, and gaming. Empirical investigations of the model have shown that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stenseng|first1=Frode|last2=Rise|first2=Jostein|last3=Kraft|first3=Pål|title=Activity Engagement as Escape from Self: The Role of Self-Suppression and Self-Expansion|journal=Leisure Sciences: An Interdisciplinary Journal|date=2012|volume=34|issue=1|pages=19–38|doi=10.1080/01490400.2012.633849|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490400.2012.633849}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the two dimensions are distinctively different with regard to affective outcomes 
* some individuals are more prone to engage through one type of escapism 
* situational levels of well-being affect the type of escapism that becomes dominant at a specific time

==During the Great Depression== 
[[Alan Brinkley]], author of ''Culture and Politics in the Great Depression'', presents how escapism became the new trend for dealing with the hardships created by [[Great Depression|the stock market crash in 1929]]: magazines, radio and movies, all were aimed to help people mentally escape from the mass poverty and economic downturn. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, which became hugely popular during the 1930s, was said to have pictures that give "no indication that there was such a thing as depression; most of the pictures are of bathing beauties and ship launchings and building projects and sports heroes – of almost anything but poverty and unemployment”. Famous director [[Preston Sturges]] aimed to validate this notion by creating a film called ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]''. The film ends with a group of poor destitute men in jail watching a comedic [[Mickey Mouse]] [[cartoon]] that ultimately lifts their spirits. Sturges aims to point out how "foolish and vain and self-indulgent" it would be to make a film about suffering. Therefore, movies of the time more often than not focused on comedic plot lines that distanced people emotionally from the horrors that were occurring all around them. These films "consciously, deliberately set out to divert people from their problems", but it also diverted them from the problems of those around them.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, Alan. Culture and Politics in the Great Depression. Waco, Tx: Markham Press Fund, 1999. http://www.uvm.edu/~pblackme/Brinkley.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Family resemblance''' refers to physical similarities shared between close relatives, especially between [[parents]] and children and between [[siblings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abroadintheyard.com/dna-family-resemblance-across-generations/ Who Do You Look Like? DNA and Family Resemblance Across Generations]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], the similarities of [[personality]] are also observed.

==Genetics==
[[Heritability]], defined as a measure of family resemblance, causes traits to be genetically passed from parents to offspring ([[heredity]]), allowing evolutionarily advantageous traits to persist through generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolinska B | title = Resemblance and investment in children | language = fr | journal = International Journal of Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 285–90 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 22385106 | doi = 10.1080/00207594.2011.645482 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremblay BL, Guénard F, Lamarche B, Pérusse L, Vohl MC | title = Familial resemblances in human whole blood transcriptome | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 300 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29703154 | pmc = 5921553 | doi = 10.1186/s12864-018-4698-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bochud M | title = Estimating heritability from nuclear family and pedigree data | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 850 | pages = 171–86 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22307699 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-61779-555-8_10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Princeton Guide to Evolution|last=Brodie|first=Edmond | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2014 |isbn=|location=|pages=221–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite sharing parents, siblings do not inherit identical genes, making [[Twin study|studies on identical twins]] (who have identical DNA) especially effective at analyzing the role genetics play in [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] similarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plomin R, Daniels D | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–82 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21807642 | pmc = 3147063 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyq148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have found that generational resemblance of many [[phenotypic trait]]s results from the inheritance of multiples genes that collectively influence a trait ([[Genetic variance|additive genetic variance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Polderman TJ, Benyamin B, de Leeuw CA, Sullivan PF, van Bochoven A, Visscher PM, Posthuma D | title = Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies | language = En | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 47 | issue = 7 | pages = 702–9 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25985137 | doi = 10.1038/ng.3285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of heritability in personality traits. For example, one study found that approximately half of personality differences in high-school aged fraternal and identical twins were due to [[genetic variation]] - and another study suggests that no one personality trait is more heritable than another.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahern|first=Frank M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Ronald C.|last3=Wilson|first3=James R.|last4=McClearn|first4=Gerald E.|last5=Vandenberg|first5=Steven G. | name-list-format = vanc |date= May 1982 |title=Family resemblances in personality |journal=Behavior Genetics|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=261–280|doi=10.1007/bf01067847|issn=0001-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
Family resemblance is also shaped by environmental factors, [[temperature]], [[light]], [[Human nutrition|nutrition]], exposure to [[drug]]s, the time that different family members spend in shared and non-shared environments, are examples of factors found to influence phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/environmental-influences-on-gene-expression-536|title=Environmental Influences on Gene Expression {{!}} Learn Science at Scitable|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plomin R, Daniels D | title = Why are children in the same family so different from one another? | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 563–82 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21807642 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyq148 | pmc = 3147063 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WhUvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 |title=Evolutionary Theory: Fringe or Central to Psychological Science|last=Sulikowski|first=Danielle | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-08-08|publisher=Frontiers Media SA|isbn=9782889199204}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenotypes found to be largely environmentally determined in humans include [[personality]], [[Human height|height]], and [[Human body weight|weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eysenck|first=H.

'''Flat Eric''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[puppet]] character created by [[Mr. Oizo|Quentin Dupieux]] from [[Levi's]] [[Television advertisement|commercials]] for [[Sta-Prest]] One Crease Denim Clothing, built by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/299803.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Flat Eric's cruise to the top |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-03-20 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His name comes from an idea for a commercial that included having a car run over his head and flattening it. The idea was not used, but the name stuck. In the commercials, Flat Eric would ride with his friend Angel (played by Philippe Petit) around California, evading the police as a wanted criminal.&lt;ref name="guardian1608"&gt;{{cite news|author=Carolyne Ellis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/aug/16/mondaymediasection1 |title=Eric exposed &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2000-08-29|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Flat Eric was based on a puppet called Stéphane that was similar, but with ears and the hands were fixed.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utalkmarketing.com/pages/Article.aspx?ArticleID=15018 |title=Advertising icon Flat Eric to be resurrected - Marketing News |publisher=UTalkMarketing |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stéphane appeared in some short films by Mr. Oizo (including a video for the track [[M-Seq]]), and had a small cult following in the United Kingdom and France.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"/&gt; In 1999, Levi's decided to build a television commercial campaign around the puppet, to be directed by Oizo. The character was renamed Eric, a more "international name", in contrast to the original French name Stéphane.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

He was made by Janet Knechtel for [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips |first=Dom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/mar/07/flateric.advertising |title=No strings attached &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2001-03-31|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United Kingdom, and was performed by [[Drew Massey]] for all the Levi's commercials. The Levi's adverts took three days to shoot.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The original short films made with Stéphane cost around 15,000 [[franc]]s to produce.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The two Levi's ads cost around two or three million francs each.&lt;ref name="Heat"/&gt; The rights to the character were retained by Oizo and production company Partizan.&lt;ref name="utalkmarketing"/&gt;

==Appearances==
He was featured in the [[music video]] for "[[Flat Beat]]" by French musician [[Mr. Oizo]] and he also appeared as a [[Theatrical property|prop]] in Series 1 of the 2001 to 2003 [[BBC]] comedy ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. In August 2004, he co starred with [[David Soul]], in a five million pound television advert for ''[[Auto Trader Group|Auto Trader]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/news/220250/David-Soul-partners-Flat-Eric-5m-Auto-Trader-ad |title=David Soul partners Flat Eric in £5m Auto Trader ad - Brand Republic News |publisher=Brandrepublic.com |date=2004-08-25 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also appeared on ''[[The Big Breakfast]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian2203"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/mar/22/flateric.advertising |title=Is Flat Eric an earner? &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 1999-03-30|accessdate=2011-10-14 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The puppet also featured heavily as a prop for more than ten years on [[SIC Radical]] interactive chat show ''[[Curto Circuito]]'', being usually named as "''Boneco Amarelo''" (Portuguese for "Yellow Puppet").

Flat Eric has also been featured in many magazines, including ''[[Arena (magazine)|Arena]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]'', ''[[Melody Maker]]'', ''Ministry'', ''[[Mixmag]]'', ''[[Muzik]]'', ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian2203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heat"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://reocities.com/Hollywood/heights/5617/articles.html|date=1999-04-03|title=Flat Eric: King of the World|magazine=[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat Eric appears as an unlockable character in the game ''[[Crossy Road]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Cammy Harbison|url=https://www.player.one/crossy-road-dinosaur-update-unlock-new-secret-characters-latest-game-update-555934|title='Crossy Road' Dinosaur Update: Unlock New Secret Characters In The Latest Game Update|publisher=Player.One|date= 2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wind power]] has been growing in the United States since the 1970s.{{weasel inline|date=September 2016}}

==History==
The growth of [[wind power in the United States]] has been enhanced by a [[Tax credit#Renewable Energy/Production Tax Credit (PTC)|production tax credit]] (PTC), which pays 2.3¢/kWh for the first 10 years. Development has been off and on again due to the expiration and late renewal of the PTC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/savings/renewable-electricity-production-tax-credit-ptc Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC)]&lt;/ref&gt; It expired at the end of 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/07/17/dead-air-end-to-tax-credits-takes-big-bite-out-of-wind-power Dead Air: End of Tax Credit Deflates Wind Power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwec.net/index.php?id=121 United States]&lt;/ref&gt; only to be restored in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/1386834/Update-US-Senate-approves-one-year-wind-PTC-extension Update: US Senate approves one-year wind PTC extension]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 it was renewed but is phased out over a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewables-boom-expected-thanks-to-tax-credit/ Renewables Boom Expected Thanks to Tax Credit]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals set by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] is to increase the number of states which have over 1,000 MW of wind power to 15 by 2018. By the end of 2015 there were 17. Another goal was to increase the number of states with at least 100 MW to 30 by 2010. As of 2011, there are 29.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/wind/mission.html Mission, Vision, and Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 vision for wind calls for 10% generation by wind by 2020 (113 GW), 30% by 2030 (224 GW), and 35% by 2050 (404 GW). It calls for 40 states to each have at least 1 GW, and wind power in all 50 states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59326">[[File:P. Oxy. 221.jpg|thumb|Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 221, showing [[scholia]] from Illiad XXI]]
'''Homeric scholarship''' is the study of any [[Homer]]ic topic, especially the two large surviving [[Epic poetry|epic]]s, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. It is currently part of the academic discipline of [[classical studies]]. The subject is one of the oldest in scholarship. For the purpose of the present article, Homeric scholarship is divided into three main phases: antiquity; the 18th and 19th centuries; and the 20th century and later.

==Ancient scholarship==

===Scholia===
[[File:Venice, Libreria Marciana.jpg|thumb|left|Library of St. Mark's, Venice, home of Venetus A.]]
[[Scholia]] are ancient commentaries, initially written in the margins of manuscripts, not necessarily at the bottom, as are their modern equivalents, the notes. The term [[marginalia]] includes them. Some are [[Interlinear gloss|interlinear]], written in very small characters. Over time the scholia were copied along with the work. When the copyist ran out of free text space, he listed them on separate pages or in separate works. Today’s equivalents are the chapter notes or the notes section at the end of the book. Notes are merely a continuation of the practice of creating or copying scholia in printed works, although the [[incunabula]], the first printed works, duplicated some scholia. The works of Homer have been heavily annotated from their written beginnings{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The total number of notes on manuscripts and printed editions of the Iliad and Odyssey are for practical purposes innumerable.

The number of manuscripts of the Iliad is currently (2014) approximately 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=David | last=Limbaugh | title=Jesus on Trial: A Lawyer Affirms the Truth of the Gospel | location=New York | publisher=Regnery Publishing | year=2014 | page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papyri of the Odyssey are less in number but are still in the order of dozens{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The inventory is incomplete, and new finds continue to be made{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}, but not all these texts contain scholia. No [[compendium]] has collated all of the Homeric scholia.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Following the [[Principle of Economy]]: the allocation of scarce publication space to overwhelming numbers of scholia, the [[Anthology|compilers]] have had to make decisions about what is important enough to compile. Certain types, or lines, have been distinguished; scholia have lines of descent of their own. [[Eleanor Dickey]] summarizes the most important three, identified by letter as A, bT, and D.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickey|2007|pp=18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A, "the Venetian scholia",  are most of the scholia of [[Venetus A]], a major manuscript of the Iliad, dated to the 10th century, and located in the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] (Library of St. Mark’s) of [[Venice]]. The sources of the scholia are noted at the end of each book. There are basically four. The hypothetical original text of the scholia, a manuscript of the 4th century CE, is therefore called, in German, the ''Viermännerkommentar'' (VMK), "four-man commentary", where the men are [[Aristonicus of Alexandria|Aristonicus]], [[Didymus Chalcenterus|Didymus]],  [[Aelius Herodianus|Herodian]], and [[Nicanor Stigmatias|Nicanor]]. Their comments, and these scholia, are termed [[Critical thinking|"critical"]]. A-scholia are found in other manuscripts as well. Venetus A contains some bT scholia.

bT scholia came from two sources: the 11th century T, the "Townleian" scholia, so designated because the manuscript, Townleyanus, was once in the collection of [[Charles Townley|Lord Townley]], and a lost manuscript, b, of the 6th century, which has descendants, including Venetus B. The bT manuscripts descend from an earlier c. bT scholia are termed [[Exegesis|exegetical]], as opposed to critical. They are from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Heraclitus (commentator)|Heraclitus]], with some from Didymus.

The D scholia, or scholia Didymi, named erroneously for Didymus, are the earliest and largest group. They occur primarily in the 9th century Z (Rome, [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Roma|Biblioteca Nazionale]]), and the 11th century Q, but also in some others, such as A and T. The D scholia were once thought to be the work of the 1st century BCE scholar Didymus; they are now known to go back to 5th and 4th century BC school manuscripts, pre-dating the Alexandrine tradition, and representing “the oldest surviving stratum of Homeric scholarship.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickey|2007|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are also called the scholia minora and the scholia vulgata, the former name referring to the short length of many. These are glossaries. Among the non-minor scholia are mythological (allegorical) [[Etiology|aetia]], plots, and paraphrases, explaining the meanings of obscure words.

The order of precedence and chronological order of these Iliad scholia is D, A, bT, and other. Material in them probably ranges from the 5th century BCE (the D scholia) to as late as the 7th or 8th century CE (the latest bT scholia). The same scheme applies to the Odyssey, except that A scholia, mainly of the Iliad, are in deficit. There are no printed works publishing all the scholia on the Iliad and Odyssey. Only partial publications according to various principles have been possible.

The first was that of [[Janus Lascaris]] in 1517.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Joannes Andreas |  last=Lascaris | year=1517 | title=Scholia palaia ton pany dokimoneis ten Homerou Iliada  | language=Greek | location=Roma | publisher=in domo [[Angelo Colocci|Angeli Colotii]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqVCDGO4ljwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=Vale&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contained D-scholia of Porphyry. Some subsequent works concentrate on manuscripts or parts of them, others on type of scholia, and still others on books of the Iliad, or source. Larger compendia are relatively recent. One that has already become a standard is the 7-volume compendium of A- and bT-scholia by [[Hartmut Erbse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Hartmut | last=Erbse | authorlink=Hartmut Erbse | title=Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem | series=Scholia Vetera | location=Berlin | publisher=de Gruyter | year=1969{{ndash}}1988 | language=Greek, Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volumes 1{{ndash}}5 are reserved for a number of books of the Iliad each, amounting to some 3000 pages, approximately. The last two volumes are indices. And yet, Dickey says of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickey|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “The seven volumes of Erbse’s edition thus represent only a small fraction of all the preserved scholia …,” from which it can be seen that the opinions, elucidations and emendations to the Iliad and Odyssey in manuscript texts far outweigh those texts in numbers of pages.

===Classical scholarship===
By the [[Classical Greece|Classical Period]] the [[Homeric Question]] had advanced to the point of trying to determine what works were attributable to [[Homer]]. The [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]] were beyond question. They were considered to have been written by [[Homer]]. The D-scholia suggest that they were taught in the schools; however, the language was no longer self-evident. The extensive glossaries of the D-scholia were intended to bridge the gap between the spoken language and [[Homeric Greek]].

The poems themselves contradicted the general belief in the existence and authorship of Homer. There were many variants, which there should not have been according to the single-author conviction. The simplest answer was to decide which of the variants was most likely to represent a presumed authentic original composition and to discount the others as spurious, devised by someone else.

[[Strabo]] reports an account by Hereas accusing [[Peisistratos]], tyrant of Athens, r. 561-527 BCE, or [[Solon]] (638-558 BCE), sometime eponymous archon and lawgiver, starting 594 BCE, of altering the Iliad’s [[Catalogue of Ships]] to place the 12 ships from [[Salamis Island|Salamis]] in the Athenian camp, proving that Athens owned Salamis in the Trojan War.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo IX.394.10 concerning B558, mentioned in {{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=491}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others denied the theory, Strabo said. The story implies that Peisistratos or Solon had some authority over a presumed master text of the Iliad, and yet Athens at the time had little political power over the Aegean region. Strabo was not the only accuser. [[Plutarch]] also accuses him of moving a line from [[Hesiod]] to λ630 (Odyssey Book 11).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diogenes Laertius]] relates that in the time of Solon the Iliad was being “rhapsodized” (''rhapsodeisthai'') in public recitations. One of Solon’s laws mandates that, in such performances, one rhapsode was to pick up where the previous left off.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, Book I, Paragraph 57 (Life of Solon). D.L. gives the source as Dieuchidas. Mentioned in {{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The involvement of a state official in these rhapsodizations can be explained by their being performances at state-sponsored sacred festivals.

[[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;’’De Oratore’’ III.137&lt;/ref&gt; says that previously the books of Homer were “confused” (''confusos''), but that Peisistratos  “disposed” (''disposuisse'') them as they were then. A scholion on Iliad, Book K, in manuscript T, says that they were “arranged” (''tetachthai'') by Peisistratos into one poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p=494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently the impromptu composition of shorter poems on a known theme was forced into a continuous presentation by Solon, and edited by Peisistratos.

A number of other fragments testify to a written edition by Peisistratos, some credible, some not. A few mention the establishment of a Peisistratean school. In others, [[Hipparchus (son of Peisistratos)]] published the edition and passed a law that it must be read at the [[Panathenaic Games]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newhall|1908|p-505}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began in 566 BCE, before the tyranny of his father, from 561 BCE. Peisistratos was succeeded by his sons in 527 BCE.

====Ionicization of the text====
The linguist, [[August Fick]], hypothesized a “metamorphosis of the originally Achaean Iliad into its present Ionic form.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jevons|1886|p=295}} He refers to Fick, ‘’Homerische Ilias’’, Göttingen, 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; By Achaean he meant [[Aeolic Greek]], and by Ionic form, [[Ionic Greek]]. He based his theory on the partial substitution of Ionic words for Aeolic ones; i.e., where the Ionic forms fit the meter, which was [[Dactylic hexameter]], they replaced the Aeolic, but where they did not, the Aeolic was left intact. For example, Atreidēs, “sons of Atreus,” the [[nominative case]], is Ionic, but the [[Genitive case|genitive plural]] is Atreidaōn, an Aeolic form, instead of the Ionic Atreideōn, which does not fit the meter.

Fick uses the device to date the transformation.  Old Ionic lēos, “people,”  is used in post-Homeric lyric poetry, but the Iliad uses lāos,  an Aeolic form. Lēos was displaced by Ionic leōs after [[Hipponax]], c. 540 BCE. Lēos and lāos have the same meter, long and short (or two longs before a word beginning with a consonant), but leōs is short, long. In Fick’s view, lāos was left to prevent change to leōs. The opposition, therefore, dates to after 540 BCE, corresponding to the period of the Peisistratean edition. This coincidence suggests that the modern Iliad, which descends from a text the Alexandrian scholars called “the Vulgate,” is linked to the Peisistratean edition. Proving it, however, is another issue.

====Search for the classical vulgate====
Between the hypothetical Peisistratean edition and the Vulgate [[recension]] of the Alexandrines is a historical gap. Fick’s work indicates a connection, which also is suggested by the peripatetic associations of the Library of Alexandria (below). Moreover, some of the D-scholia redated to the 5th century BCE indicate that some sort of standard Iliad existed then, to be taught in the schools. These broad events are circumstantial evidence only. Nagy says,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|1997|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; “As of this writing, Homeric scholarship has not yet succeeded in achieving a definitive edition of either the Iliad or the Odyssey.”

He quotes the view given by [[Jean-Baptiste-Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison|Villoison]], first publisher (1788) of the scholia on [[Venetus A]], that Peisistratus, in the absence of a written copy, had given a reward for verses of Homer, inviting spurious verses. There had been, in other words, a master copy, but  it had been lost. Not having a theory of oral transmission, Villoison regarded the poems as “extinct.” The problem then became to distinguish which of the purchased verses were spurious.

The opposite view, expressed by [[Friedrich August Wolf]] in ‘’Prolegomena ad Homerum’’, 1795, is that Homer never wrote the Iliad. The variant manuscripts seen by the Alexandrines were not corruptions, but rhapsodic variants, as is attested by [[Flavius Josephus]] in ''[[Against Apion]]''. He said that the poetry of Homer was “preserved by memory … and assembled … later from the songs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|1997|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link missing from the evidence, apart from the circumstantial, is the connection between the texts produced by Peisistratus and the Alexandrine Vulgate. What is lacking is either an “Athenian prototype,”,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nagy|1997|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a conjectural “Wolfian vulgate,” or multi-text assembled from oral variants wrongly marked as spurious by the Alexandrines.

The Homeric classicists of the 19th century believed they had inferred a ''Voralexandrinsche Vulgata'', “Pre-Alexandrine Vulgate,” to use the expression of Arthur Ludwich. This was a hypothetical 4th- and 5th-century BCE version of the Alexandrine Vulgate. The latter had to have had precedents. The problem was to prove it.

Ludwich assembled a list of all the lines put forward as quotations from Homer in pre-Alexandrine authors: some 29 authors plus some unknown fragments, amounting to about 480 ''verse'', or “lines.”&lt;ref name=ludwich138-140&gt;{{cite book | title=Die Homervulgata als voralexandrinisch erwiesen | first=Arthur | last=Ludwich | location=Leipzig | publisher=B.G. Teubner | year=1898 | pages=138–140 | language=German | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAkLAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Homervulgata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZpyDVL_vMuK0sATp9YHIDA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=209&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.B. Monro used this database to compare the percentage of non-Vulgate lines in the quotes with a control group, the  non-Vulgate lines in the fragments of the papyri known to him then.&lt;ref name=monro426-430&gt;{{cite book | title=Homer's Odyssey, Books 13-24 | first=David Binning | last=Monro | location=Oxford | publisher=Clarendon Press | year=1901 | pages=426–430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging from the fragments, 60 of the 480 lines ought to be missing from the Vulgate. The number is only 12, from which Monro concludes: “The quotations, in short, prove that there was a pre-Alexandrian vulgate agreeing much more closely with the modern vulgate than with any text of which the papyrus fragments can be specimens.”

====Academic connection====
[[File:Athens Plato Academy Archaeological Site 5.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the Academy in Athens.]]
According to Monro,&lt;ref name=monro426-430/&gt; based on Ludwich,&lt;ref name=ludwich138-140/&gt; [[Plato]] is the most prolific quoter of Homer, with 209 lines. Next most is Aristotle, with 93 lines. Of the 209, only two differ from the Vulgate, in Iliad Book IV, which Ludwich termed ''Kontaminiert'', “corrupted.” Several were marked as spurious (Ludwich’s ''aufser'') by the Alexandrians. There was only one instance of four lines not in the Vulgate (Ludwich’s ''Zusatzversen''), From Iliad IV. Monro asserts “… whatever interpolated texts of Homer were then current, the copy from which Plato quoted was not one of them.” Aristotle’s quotations do not have the same purity, which is surprising. For about 20 years they were at the same school, the [[Platonic Academy]].

The Platonic view of Homer is exceptional for the times. Homer and Hesiod were considered to have written myths as allegory. According to J.A. Stewart, "… Homer is an [[Inspired Teacher]], and must not be banished from the curriculum. If we get beneath the literal meaning, we find him teaching the highest truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=J.A. | last=Stewart | authorlink=John Alexander Stewart (philosopher) | title=The Myths of Plato | year=1905 | location=London; New York | publisher=Macmillan | page=231 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4e89AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA231&amp;dq=Homer+Plato&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zKGFVILpJYmVNsrDg4AH&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Homer%20Plato&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', however, Plato denies that children can distinguish literal and allegorical truth and advocates censoring the myth-makers, including Homer. The ''Republic'' expresses a concept of a society established according to the Platonic ideal, in which every aspect is monitored and controlled under the guidance of a philosopher-king drafted from ascetic poverty for the purpose. It was not a popular view.

====Peripatetic connection====
[[File:Athens Lyceum Archaeological Site 2.jpg|thumb|left|Site of the Lyceum in Athens.]]
The archetype of Hellenistic libraries was that of the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]] in classical Athens. Its founder, [[Aristotle]], had been a student, and then an associate, at [[Plato]]’s [[Platonic Academy|Academy]]. He was Plato’s star student, but as a [[metic]], or resident foreigner (he was still Greek), he could not own property or sponsor the other metics. Consequently, after the death of Plato, not having been appointed director, he departed Athens for an educational opportunity in [[Mysia]], which fell through when Mysia was captured by the Persians. He was subsequently hired by his boyhood companion, now [[Philip II of Macedon]], to tutor the latter’s teen-age son, the future [[Alexander the Great]], on whose behalf he built a school, the Nymphaeum, at [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]].

Alexander became an enthusiastic member of Aristotle’s inner circle. Immediate association was terminated within a few years when Alexander assumed the duties of monarch after the assassination of his father in 336/335. His main duty was to lead a planned invasion of the east to settle the rivalry with Persia. During it he kept by his bedside a manuscript of Homer personally emended by Aristotle, a gift of the latter. He later placed it in an expensive casket captured from the Persian king, Darius, from which it was called "the Casket Homer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=E. Cobham | last=Brewer | title=Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | year=1898 | website=Bartleby.com | url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/3118.html}}. The story comes from Plutarch’s ''Life of Alexander''.&lt;/ref&gt; The anecdote, if true, reveals a belief by Aristotle’s circle in an authentic text, as well as editorial activity to recapture it. Alexander was a Homer enthusiast.

Aristotle’s approach to Homer and statesmanship was different from Plato's. Politics and Poetry were two of his research topics. His theoretical treatise, ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' is not a presentation, like Plato’s, of an ideal state according to some philosophy, but is a presentation and classification of real states as they were then, discovered by research. Similarly, Homer does not play a role in any censorial evaluation of Aristotle as a critic, but appears in a professional study of poetry, the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Paragraphs 461a, b, Chapter 25.&lt;/ref&gt; with regard to the difficulty with some of his language. Aristotle’s main study of Homer did not survive. It is listed in [[Diogenes Laertius]]' ''Life of Aristotle'' as "Six books of Homeric problems".

Of the 93 quotations, Mitchell Carroll says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mitchell | last=Carroll | title= Aristotle's Poetics, C. XXV: In the Light of the Homeric Scholia | year=1896 | publisher=John Murphy and Company | location=Baltimore | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Aristotle’s hearty veneration for Homer is shown by the numerous citations of the Iliad and the Odyssey in his works, and by the frequent expressions of admiration occurring in the ''Poetics''; ….” , Despite this enthusiasm, Monro notes that the “poetical quotations are especially incorrect,”&lt;ref name=monro426-430/&gt; with regard to the errors and additional lines. This is not the expected result if Aristotle had received the pure edition from which Plato had quoted. Monro’s solution is to adopt the view of Adolph Römer, that the errors can be attributed to Aristotle personally, and not to variant manuscripts. This was obviously not history’s final verdict.

===Hellenistic scholars and their aims===
Many ancient Greek writers discussed topics and problems in the Homeric epics, but the development of scholarship ''per se'' revolved around three goals:

# Analyzing internal inconsistencies within the epics;
# Producing editions of the epics' authentic text, free of interpolations and errors;
# Interpretation: both explaining archaic words, and exegetical interpretation of the epics as literature.

The first philosopher to focus intensively on the intellectual problems surrounding the Homeric epics was [[Zoilus]] of Amphipolis in the early 4th century BCE. His work ''Homeric Questions'' does not survive, but it seems that Zoilus enumerated and discussed inconsistencies of plot in Homer. Examples of this are numerous: for example, in ''Iliad'' 5.576-9 [[Menelaus]] kills a minor character, Pylaemenes, in combat; but later, at 13.758-9, he is still alive to witness the death of his son Harpalion. These have been humorously described as points where Homer "nodded off," from which comes the [[proverbial phrase]] "[[Continuity (fiction)#Homeric Nod|Homeric Nod]]." [[Aristotle]]'s ''Homeric Problems'', which does not survive, was probably a response to Zoilus.

Critical editions of Homer discuss three special steps in this process. First is the hypothetical "Peisistratean recension". There is a long-standing, but somewhat old-fashioned, tradition in modern scholarship which holds that in the mid-6th century BCE the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[tyrant]] [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Peisistratus]] had the Homeric epics compiled in a definitive edition. It is known that under Peisistratus, and later, [[rhapsode]]s competed in performing Homer at the [[Panathenaia|Panathenaic festival]]; and a scholion on ''Iliad'' 10.1 accuses Peisistratus of inserting book 10 into the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;Schol. T on ''Il''. 10.1: "They say that this episode was composed by Homer privately, and not to be part of the ''Iliad''; but that it was inserted into the poem by Peisistratus." Book 10, often known as the ''Doloneia'', is still the most widely rejected part of the Homeric epics.&lt;/ref&gt; But there is little evidence for a Peisistratean recension, and most present-day scholars doubt its existence; at the very least it is disputed what is to be understood by the term "recension".&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. G. Nagy (1996), ''Poetry as Performance'' (Cambridge), pp. 115-27 on the meaning of the Greek words for "edition", {{lang|grc|ἔκδοσις}} and διόρθωσις.&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third key moments are the critical editions made by the 3rd and 2nd century BCE [[Alexandria]]n scholars [[Zenodotus of Ephesus]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace|Aristarchus]] respectively; both of these scholars also published numerous other works on Homer and other poets, none of which survive. Zenodotus' edition may well have been the first to divide the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' into 24 books.

Aristarchus' edition is probably the single most important moment in the whole history of Homeric scholarship. His text was more conservative than Zenodotus', but it became the standard edition of Homer for the ancient world, and almost everything in modern editions of Homer passed through Aristarchus' hands. Like Zenodotus, Aristarchus did not delete passages that he rejected, but (fortunately for us) preserved them with an annotation indicating his rejection. He developed Zenodotus' already sophisticated system of critical symbols to indicate specific kinds of issues with particular lines, and a significant proportion of the terminology is still in use today ([[obelus]], [[wikt:athetize|athetising]], etc.). From the scholia a great deal is known about his guiding principles, and those of other editors and commentators such as Zenodotus and [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]]. The chief preoccupations of the Alexandrian scholars may be summarised as follows:

# Consistency of content: the reasoning is that internal inconsistencies imply that the text has been ineptly changed. This principle apparently pursues the work of Zoilus.
# Consistency of style: anything that appears only once in Homer &amp;mdash; an unusual poetic image, an unusual word (a ''[[hapax legomenon]]''), or an unusual epithet (e.g. the epithet "Kyllenian Hermes" in ''Odyssey'' 24.1) &amp;mdash; tends to be rejected.
# No repetitions: if a line or passage is repeated word-for-word, one of the exemplars is often rejected. Zenodotus is known to have applied this principle rigidly, Aristarchus less so; it is in tension with the principle of "consistency of style" above.
# Quality: Homer was regarded as the greatest of poets, so anything perceived to be poor poetry was rejected.
# Logic: something that makes no sense (such as [[Achilleus]] nodding at his comrades as he goes running after Hektor) was not regarded as the product of the original artist.
# Morality: [[Plato]]'s insistence that a poet should be moral was taken to heart by Alexandrian scholars, and scholia accuse many passages and phrases of being "unsuitable" ({{lang|grc|οὐ πρέπον}} ''ou prepon''); the real Homer, goes the reasoning, being a paragon of perfection, would never have written anything immoral himself.
# Explaining Homer from Homer ({{lang|grc|Ὅμηρον ἐξ Ὁμήρου σαφηνίζειν}}): this motto is Aristarchus', and means simply that it is better to solve a problem in Homer using evidence from within Homer, rather than external evidence.

To a modern eye it is evident that these principles should be applied at most on an ''ad hoc'' basis. When they are applied across the board the results are frequently bizarre, especially as no account whatsoever is taken of [[poetic licence]]. However, it should be remembered that the reasoning seems persuasive when built up gradually, and then it is a very difficult mindset to escape: 19th century Analyst scholars (see below) adopted most of these criteria, and applied them even more stringently than the Alexandrians did.

It is also sometimes difficult to know what exactly the Alexandrians meant when they rejected a passage. The scholia on ''Odyssey'' 23.296 tell us that Aristarchus and Aristophanes regarded that line as the end of the epic (even though that is grammatically impossible); but we are also told that Aristarchus separately rejected several passages after that point.

===Allegorical readings===
Exegesis is also represented in the scholia. When the scholiasts turn to interpretation they tend to be most interested in explaining background material, e.g., reporting an obscure myth to which Homer alludes; but there was also a fashion for allegory, especially among the [[Stoics]]. The most notable passage is a scholion on ''Iliad'' 20.67, which gives an extended allegorical interpretation of the battle of the gods, explaining each god as symbolic of various elements and principles in conflict with one another, e.g., [[Apollo]] is opposed to [[Poseidon]] because fire is opposed to water.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Allegory is also represented in some surviving ancient monographs: the ''Homeric Allegories'' by an otherwise unknown 1st century BCE writer [[Heraclitus (commentator)|Heraclitus]], the 2nd century CE [[Plutarch]]'s ''On the Life and Poetry of Homer'', and the works of the 3rd century CE [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], particularly his ''On the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey'' and ''Homeric Questions''. Many extracts from Porphyry are preserved in the scholia, especially the D scholia (although the current standard edition, that of [[Hartmut Erbse|Erbse]], omits them).

Allegorical interpretation continued to be influential on [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] scholars such as [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]] and [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]]. But allegorising non-allegorical literature has not been a fashionable activity since the [[Middle Ages]]; it is common to see modern scholars refer to such allegorising in the scholia as "inferior" or even "contemptible".&lt;ref&gt;E.g. W. McLeod 1971, review of Erbse, ''Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem'' vol. 1, in ''Phoenix'' 25.4: 373.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, these texts are now rarely read.

==18th and 19th centuries==
{{main article|Homeric question}}

The 18th century saw major developments in Homeric scholarship, and also saw the opening phase of the discussion which was to dominate the 19th century (and, for some scholars, the 20th): the so-called "[[Homeric question]]". Homer was first seen as the product of his primitive time by the Scottish scholar [[Thomas Blackwell (scholar)|Thomas Blackwell]], in ''An Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer'' (1735).

Another major development was the enormous growth of linguistic study on Homer and the [[Homeric dialect]]. In 1732, [[Richard Bentley|Bentley]] published his discovery of the traces left in the text of Homer by the [[digamma]], an archaic Greek consonant that was omitted in later, classical, Greek [[orthography]]. Bentley showed conclusively that the vast majority of metrical anomalies in Homeric verse could be attributed to the presence of digamma (though the idea was not well received at the time: [[Alexander Pope]], for one, satirised Bentley). Important linguistic studies continued throughout the next two centuries alongside the endless arguments over the Homeric question, and the work by figures such as [[Philipp Karl Buttmann|Buttmann]] and [[David Binning Monro|Monro]] is still worth reading today; and it was the linguistic work of [[Milman Parry|Parry]] that set in motion a major paradigm shift in the mid-20th century. Another major 18th century development was [[Jean-Baptiste-Gaspard d'Ansse de Villoison|Villoison]]'s 1788 publication of the A and B scholia on the ''Iliad''.

The Homeric question is essentially the question of the identity of the poet(s) of the Homeric epics, and the nature of the relationship between "Homer" and the epics. In the 19th century it came to be the fulcrum between two opposed schools of thought, the ''Analysts'' and the ''Unitarians''. The issue came about in the context of 18th-century interest in popular lays and folktale, and the growing recognition that the Homeric epics must have been transmitted orally before being written down, possibly much later than "Homer" himself. The Italian philosopher [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] argued that the epics were the products not of an individual genius poet but rather the cultural products of an entire people; and [[Robert Wood (engraver)|Wood]]’s 1769 ''Essay on the Original Genius and Writings of Homer'' argued emphatically that Homer had been illiterate and the epics had been transmitted orally. (Less fortunately, Wood drew parallels between Homer and the poetry of the supposed [[Scotland|Scottish]] oral poet [[Ossian]], published by [[James Macpherson]] in 1765; Ossian turned out later to have been wholly invented by Macpherson.)

The scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] brought matters to a head. His review of Villoison's edition of the scholia acknowledged that they proved conclusively the oral transmission of the poems. In 1795, he published his ''[[Prolegomena ad Homerum]],'' in which he argued that the poems were composed in the mid-10th century BCE; that they were transmitted orally; that they changed considerably after that time in the hands of bards performing them orally and editors adapting written versions to contemporary tastes; and that the poems' apparent artistic unity came about after their transcription. Wolf posed the perplexing question of what it would mean to restore the poems to their original, pristine, form.

In the wake of Wolf, two schools of thought coalesced to oppose one another: Analysts and Unitarians.

===Analysts===
19th-century Analysts argued that the epics were composed by many hands, a hodge-podge of interpolations and incompetent editing that concealed the original genius of Homer, or at the very least that the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' were composed by different poets. In this they followed in the steps of ancient scholars like Zoilos and the so-called "separatists" (χωρίζοντες ''chōrizontes'', the best known of whom, Xenon and Hellanicus, are nonetheless very obscure figures).

Among Analysts, [[Gottfried Hermann|Hermann]]'s 1832 ''De interpolationibus Homeri'' ("On interpolations in Homer") and 1840 ''De iteratis apud Homerum'' ("On repetitions in Homer") argued that the epics, as they now stood, were encrustations of second-rate later material around a pristine kernel: a hypothetical "Ur-''Iliad''". Conversely, [[Karl Lachmann|Lachmann]]'s 1847 ''Betrachtungen über Homers Ilias'' ("Studies on Homer's Iliad") argued that the ''Iliad'' was a compilation of 18 independent folk-lays, rather as the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'' actually was, compiled in the 1820s and 1830s by [[Elias Lönnrot|Lönnrot]]: so, he argued, ''Iliad'' book 1 consists of a lay on Achilleus' anger (lines 1-347), and two continuations, the return of Chryseis (430–492) and the scenes in Olympus (348-429, 493-611); book 2 is a separate lay, but containing several interpolations such as Odysseus' speech (278–332); and so on. (Lachmann also tried to apply Analyst principles to the mediaeval German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''.) [[Johann Wilhelm Adolf Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]]'s 1859 edition of the ''Odyssey'' argued that the Ur-''Odyssey'' had comprised just books 1, 5-9, and parts of 10-12, that a later phase had added most of books 13-23, and a third phase had added the bits about Telemachos, and book 24.

The climax of Analysis came with [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|Wilamowitz]], who published ''Homerische Untersuchungen'' ("Homeric studies") in 1884 and ''Die Heimkehr des Odysseus'' ("The homecoming of Odysseus") in 1927. The ''Odyssey'', he argued, was compiled about 650 BCE or later from three separate poems by a ''Bearbeiter'' (editor). Subsequent Analysts often referred to the hypothesised ''Bearbeiter'' as the "B-poet" (and the original genius, Homer himself, was sometimes the "A-poet"). Wilamowitz' examination of the relationship between these three layers of the ''Odyssey'', further complicated by later, minor, interpolations, is enormously detailed and complex. One of the three poems, the "old ''Odyssey''" (most of books 5-14 and 17-19) had in turn been compiled by a ''Redaktor'' from three even earlier poems, two of which had originally been parts of longer poems. Like most other scholars caught up in the opposition between Analysis and Unitarianism, Wilamowitz equated poetry that he thought poor with late interpolations. But Wilamowitz set such a high standard in the sophistication of his analysis that 20th century Analysts seem to have found difficulty in moving forward from where Wilamowitz left off; and over the course of the following decades attention drifted away, particularly in the English-speaking world.

===Unitarians===
[[Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch|Nitzsch]] was the earliest scholar to oppose Wolf and argue that the two Homeric epics showed an artistic unity and intention that was the work of a single mind. Nitzsch's writings cover the years 1828 to 1862. In his ''Meletemata'' (1830) he took up the question of written versus unwritten literature, on which Wolf's whole argument had turned; and in his 1852 ''Die Sagenpoesie der Griechen'' ("The oral poetry of the Greeks") he investigated the structure of the Homeric poems and their relation to other, non-extant, epics which narrated the story of the [[Trojan War]], the so-called ''[[Epic Cycle]].''

However, most Unitarian scholarship tended to be driven by literary interpretation and was therefore often more ephemeral. Even so, many scholars who examined the archaeology and social history of Homeric Greece did so from a Unitarian perspective, perhaps out of a wish to avoid the complexities of Analysis and Analysts' tendency to re-write each other's work indefinitely. [[Benedictus Niese|Niese]]'s 1873 ''Der homerische Schiffskatalog als historische Quelle betrachtet'' ("The Homeric catalogue of ships studied as a historical source") stands out. [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]], who began excavating [[Hisarlik]] in the 1870s, treated Homer as a historical source from an essentially Unitarian viewpoint.

===Common ground between Analysts and Unitarians===
Broadly speaking, Analysts tended to study the epics philologically, bringing to bear criteria, linguistic and otherwise, that were little different from those of the ancient Alexandrians. Unitarians tended to be literary critics who were more interested in appreciating the artistry of the poems than in analysing them.

But artistic merit was the unspoken motivation behind both schools of thought. Homer must at all costs be hallowed as the great, original, genius; everything good in the epics is to be attributed to him. So Analysts hunted for errors (as Zoilus had done), and blamed them on incompetent editors; Unitarians tried to explain errors away, sometimes even claiming they were really the best bits.

In both cases, therefore, there came to be a very strong tendency to equate good with authentic, and shoddy with interpolated. This, too, was a mindset inherited from the Alexandrians.

==20th century==
20th century Homeric scholarship had the shadow of Analysis and Unitarianism hanging over it, and much important work was done by old-style Analysts and Unitarians even up to the end of the century. Perhaps the most important Unitarian in the first half of the century was [[Samuel E. Bassett]]; and, as in the 19th century, some interpretive work argued for Unitarianism (e.g. [[George E. Dimock]]'s 1989 ''The Unity of the Odyssey''), while other literary criticism merely took a Unitarian perspective for granted. Some of the most important work on textual criticism and [[papyrology]] was done by Analyst scholars such as [[Reinhold Merkelbach]] and [[Denys L. Page]] (whose 1955 ''The Homeric Odyssey'' is a merciless but sometimes hilariously witty polemic against Unitarians). The biggest commentary on the ''Odyssey'', published in the 1980s under the general editorship of [[Alfred Heubeck]], is largely Analyst in tone, especially the commentary on books 21-22 by [[Manuel Fernández-Galiano]]. Some monographs from a strongly Analyst perspective continue to come out, primarily from the German-speaking world.

However, the most important new work on Homer done in the 20th century was dominated by two new schools of thought, most frequently referred to as "Oral Theory" (the term is resisted by some Oralists, especially [[Gregory Nagy]]); and "Neoanalysis". Unlike in the 19th century, however, these schools of thought are not opposed to one another; and in the last few decades they have been drawing on each other more and more in very constructive ways.

===Oral Theory===
Oral Theory, or Oralism, is a loosely used term for the study of the mechanisms of how the Homeric epics were orally transmitted, in terms of linguistics, cultural conditions, and literary genre. It therefore embraces philological analysis and literary criticism simultaneously. It has its origins in linguistics, but it was foreshadowed in some respects by [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]] in the 18th century, and more immediately by [[Gilbert Murray]]. Murray was an Analyst, but his 1907 book ''The Rise of the Greek Epic'' contained some of the core ideas of Oralism: particularly the idea that the epics were the end result of a protracted process of evolution, and the idea that an individual poet named Homer had relatively little importance in their history.

The two figures at the head of Oralism are [[Milman Parry]] and his student [[Albert Lord]], who continued his work after Parry's premature death. Parry was a [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] linguist (he studied under [[Antoine Meillet]], who in turn studied under [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]]) who set out to compare Homeric epic with a living oral tradition of epic poetry. In the 1930s and 1950s he and Lord recorded thousands of hours of oral performance of epic poetry in the former [[Yugoslavia]], primarily in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. Lord's later work (his 1960 book ''The Singer of Tales'' is the most pertinent to Homer) kick-started oral poetics as an entire new sub-discipline in anthropology. For Homeric scholarship the most important results of their work, and that of later Oralists, have been to demonstrate that:

# Homeric epic shares many stylistic characteristics with known oral traditions;
# thanks to the sophistication and mnemonic power of the [[Oral-Formulaic Composition|formulaic system in Homeric poetry]], it is entirely possible for epics as large as the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' to have been created in an oral tradition;&lt;ref&gt;Parry aimed to prove this by asking [[Avdo Međedović]], an illiterate singer who worked in the oral tradition, to create a poem of Iliadic length; the result was Avdo's three-day performance, recorded by phonograph, of a version of the well-known theme ''The Wedding of Smailagić Meho''.&lt;/ref&gt;
# many curious features that offended the ancient Alexandrians and the Analysts are most probably symptomatic of the poems' evolution through oral transmission and, within limits, poets re-inventing them in performance (some have compared this to improvisation, rather as jazz musicians improvise upon a theme).

The biggest complete commentary on the ''Iliad'', 1993's six volume ''The Iliad: A Commentary'' as edited by [[G.S. Kirk]], is Oralist in its approach and emphasizes issues related to live performance such as rhythm; and the pedagogical commentaries by [[Peter Jones (classicist)|Peter Jones]] are heavily Oralist.

Some Oralists do not go so far as to claim that the Homeric epics actually are products of an oral epic tradition: many limit themselves to claiming that the Homeric epics merely draw on earlier oral epic. For much of the mid-20th century much of the resistance to Oral Theory came from scholars who could not see how to preserve Homer as the great original poet: they could not see how there was any room for artistry and creativity in a formulaic system where set-piece episodes ([[Walter Arend]]'s "[[type scene]]s") were as formulaic as Parry's metrical epithet-noun combinations. Some scholars divided Oralists into "hard Parryists", who believed that all aspects of Homeric epic were predetermined by formulaic systems, and "soft Parryists", who believed that Homer had the system at his command rather than the other way round. More recently, books such as Nagy's influential 1979 book about epic heroes, ''The Best of the Achaeans'', and [[Egbert Bakker]]'s 1997 linguistic study ''Poetry as Speech'', work on the principle that the radical cross-fertilisation and resonances between different traditions, genres, plot lines, episodes, and type scenes, are actually the driving force behind much of the artistic innovation in Homeric epic.

Where the joke about 19th century Analysts had it that the epics "were not composed by Homer but by someone else of the same name", now the joke is that Oral Theorists claim the epics are poems without an author. Many Oralists would happily agree with this.

===Neoanalysis===
Neoanalysis is quite separate from 19th century Analysis. It is the study of the relationship between the two Homeric epics and the ''[[Epic Cycle]]'': the extent to which Homer made use of earlier poetic material about the Trojan War, and the extent to which other epic poets made use of Homer. The main obstacle to this line of research &amp;ndash; and, simultaneously, the main impetus for it &amp;ndash; is the fact that the Cyclic epics do not survive except in summaries and isolated fragments. [[Ioannis Kakridis]] is usually regarded as the founding figure of this school of thought, with his 1949 book ''Homeric Researches'', but [[Wolfgang Kullmann]]'s 1960 ''Die Quellen der Ilias'' ("The sources of the ''Iliad''") is even more influential. Neoanalytic topics have become much more prominent in English-language scholarship since 1990, notably in a series of articles by [[M. L. West]] in ''Classical Quarterly'' and in [[Jonathan Burgess]]' 2001 book ''The Tradition of the Trojan War in Homer and the Epic Cycle''. The recent upsurge is due in no small part to the publication of three new editions of the fragmentary Greek epics, including a translation by West for the [[Loeb Classical Library]] series.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bernabé 1987, ''Poeticae Epici Graeci Testimonia et Fragmenta'' (vol. 1) (Leipzig); M. Davies 1988, ''Epicorum Graecorum Fragmenta'' (Göttingen); M.L. West 2003, ''Greek Epic Fragments'' (Cambridge, MA).&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most frequently cited and characteristic topic raised in Neoanalysis is the so-called "Memnon theory" outlined by [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]] in a 1951 paper. This is the hypothesis that one major plot-line in the ''Iliad'' is based on a similar one in one of the Cyclic epics, the [[Aithiopis]] of [[Arctinus]]. The parallels run as follows:

{| style="margin:auto;"  border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|-
! ''Aithiopis''
! ''Iliad''
|-
| [[Achilleus]]' comrade [[Antilochus]] excels in battle
| Achilleus' comrade [[Patroclus]] excels in battle
|-
| Antilochus is killed by [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]]
| Patroclus is killed by [[Hector]]
|-
| An enraged Achilleus pursues Memnon to the gates of Troy, where he kills him
| An enraged Achilleus pursues Hector to the gates of Troy, chases Hector around the city walls, and kills him
|-
| Achilleus is in turn killed there by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]
| (It has previously been foretold to Achilleus that his own death will follow upon Hector's)
|}

What is debated in the Memnon theory is the implications of these similarities. The most immediate implication is that the poet of the ''Iliad'' borrowed material from the ''Aethiopis''. The debatable points are the poet's reasons for doing so; the status and condition of the ''Aethiopis'' story when this borrowing took place, that is to say whether it was Arctinus' epic that Homer borrowed from, or something less concrete, like a traditional legend; and the extent to which the ''Aethiopis'' and ''Iliad'' played off one another in their subsequent development.

==Recent developments==
The dating of the Homeric epics continues to be a controversial topic. The most influential work in this area in the last few decades is that of [[Richard Janko]], whose 1982 study ''Homer, Hesiod and the Hymns'' uses statistics based on a range of dialectal pointers to argue that the text of both epics became fixed in the latter half of the 8th century, though he has since argued for an even earlier date.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [http://www.didaskalia.net/issues/vol3no3/janko.html R. Janko 1996, "The performance of Homeric epic", ''Didaskalia'' 3.3].&lt;/ref&gt; There is no shortage of alternative datings, however, based on other kinds of evidence (literary, philological, archaeological, and artistic), ranging from the 9th century to as late as 550 BCE (Nagy suggests in a 1992 paper that the text's "formative" period lasted until 550). At present most Homeric scholars opt for the late 8th or early 7th century, and a date of 730 BCE is often quoted for the ''Iliad''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin L. West in his 2010 commentary on the ''Iliad'' (and in earlier scholarly writings) argues for a dating of the poem in the period 680-650 BC, based in part on apparent references to works of other poems, e.g. [[Hesiod]] and [[Tyrtaeus]], and in part on artistic and other comparative evidence.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s, Homeric interpretation has been increasingly influenced by [[literary theory]], especially in literary readings of the ''Odyssey''. [[Post-structuralism|Post-structuralist]] [[Semiotics|semiotic]] approaches have been represented in the work of [[Pietro Pucci]] (''Odysseus Polytropos'', 1987) and [[Marylin Katz]] (''Penelope's Renown'', 1991), for example.

Perhaps the most significant developments have been in [[narratology]], the study of how storytelling works, since this combines empirical linguistic study with literary criticism. [[Irene de Jong]]'s 1987 ''Narrators and Focalizers: The Presentation of the Story in the Iliad'' draws on the work of the theorist [[Mieke Bal]], and de Jong followed this up in 2001 with her ''Narratological Commentary on the Odyssey''; Bakker has published several linguistic-narratological studies, especially his 1997 ''Poetry as Speech''; and [[Elizabeth Minchin]]'s 2001 ''Homer and the Resources of Memory'' draws on several forms of narratology and cognitive science, such as the [[script theory]] developed in the 1970s by [[Roger Schank]] and [[Robert Abelson]].

'''Human science''' studies the philosophical, [[biological]], social, and cultural aspects of human life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/human-sciences?wssl=1| title=Human Sciences |publisher=University of Oxford | access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Sciences aims to expand our understanding of the [[human]] world through a broad interdisciplinary approach. It encompasses a wide range of fields - including [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[genetics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[neurosciences]] and [[anthropology]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/journal/history-human-sciences#description | title=History of the Human Sciences |publisher= SAGE Publications Inc. | access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the study and interpretation of the experiences, activities, constructs, and artifacts associated with human beings. The study of the human sciences attempts to expand and enlighten the human being's knowledge of their existence, its interrelationship with other [[species]] and systems, and the development of artifacts to perpetuate the [[human]] expression and [[thought]]. It is the study of human [[phenomena]]. The study of the human experience is historical and current in nature. It requires the evaluation and interpretation of the historic human experience and the analysis of current human activity to gain an understanding of human phenomena and to project the outlines of [[human evolution]]. Human science is the [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], informed critique of human existence and how it relates to [[reality]].

==Meaning of 'science'==
Ambiguity and confusion regarding usage of the terms '[[science]]', '[[empirical science]]', and '[[scientific method]]' have complicated the usage of the term 'human science' with respect to human activities. The term 'science' is derived from the Latin ''scientia'' meaning 'knowledge'. 'Science' may be appropriately used to refer to any branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged to show the operation of general laws.

However, according to [[Positivism|Positivists]], the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge which comes from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific method, the application of knowledge or mathematics. As a result of the positivist influence, the term ''science'' is frequently employed as a synonym for ''empirical science''. Empirical science is knowledge based on the [[scientific method]], a systematic approach to verification of knowledge first developed for dealing with natural physical phenomena and emphasizing the importance of experience based on sensory observation. However, even with regard to the [[natural sciences]], significant difference exist among scientists and philosophers of science with regard to what constitutes valid scientific method&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl, ''Logic of Scientific Discovery'', Routledge, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2012}}—for example, [[evolutionary biology]], [[geology]] and [[astronomy]], studying events that cannot be repeated, can use a method of historical narratives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e36_2/darwin_influence.htm Mayr, Ernst. ''Darwin's Influence on Modern Thought''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717184042/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e36_2/darwin_influence.htm |date=2006-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, usage of the term has been extended to the study of human social phenomena. Thus, natural and social sciences are commonly classified as science, whereas the study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts are referred to as the [[humanities]]. Ambiguity with respect to the meaning of the term ''science'' is aggravated by the widespread use of the term [[formal science]] with reference to any one of several sciences that is predominantly concerned with abstract form that cannot be validated by physical experience through the senses, such as logic, mathematics, and the theoretical branches of computer science, information theory, and statistics.

==History==
The phrase 'human science' in English was used during the 17th-century scientific revolution, for example by [[Theophilus Gale]]&lt;ref name="Gale1677"&gt;{{cite book|author=Theophilus Gale|title=The Court of the Gentiles, Or, A Discourse Touching the Original of Human Literature: Both Philologie and Philosophie, from the Scriptures &amp; Jewish Church : in Order of a Demonstration Of, I. The Perfection of Gods Word, and Church-light. II. The Imperfection of Natures Light ... III. The Right Use of Human Learning ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjCI52YG1zIC&amp;pg=RA3-PA327|year=1677|publisher=H. Hall|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to draw a distinction between supernatural knowledge (divine science) and study by humans (human science). [[John Locke]] also uses 'human science' to mean knowledge produced by people, but without the distinction&lt;ref name="Locke1753"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Locke|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brYUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA170|year=1753|publisher=S. Birt|pages=170–}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By the 20th century, this latter meaning was used at the same time&lt;ref name="Jennings1930"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Spencer Jennings|title=The Biological Basis of Human Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lu0nAAAAYAAJ|year=1930|publisher=W.W. Norton, Incorporated}}&lt;/ref&gt; as 'sciences that make human beings the topic of research'.&lt;ref name="Education1928"&gt;{{cite book|author=United States. Congress. House. Committee on Education|title=Proposed department of education: Hearing&amp;#91;s&amp;#93; before the Committee on education, House of Representatives, Seventieth Congress, first session on H. R. 7, a bill to create a department of education and for other purposes. April 25, 26, 27,28 and May 2, 1928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eGkvAAAAMAAJ|year=1928|publisher=U.S. Govt. print. off.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human science''' (also, '''humanistic social science''', '''moral science''' and '''human sciences''') refers to the investigation of human life and activities via an interdisciplinary framework spanning the sciences and humanities. Underlying Human science is the relationship between various humanistic modes of inquiry within fields such as, [[history]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and [[economics]], and advances in such things as [[genetics]], [[evolutionary biology]] and the [[social sciences]] for the purpose of understanding our lives in a rapidly changing world. Its use of an [[empirical]] methodology that encompasses psychological experience contrasts to the purely [[positivism|positivistic]] approach typical of the [[natural sciences]] which exclude all methods not based solely on sensory observations. Modern approaches in the human sciences integrate an understanding of human structure, function and adaptation with a broader exploration of what it means to be human.  The term is also used to distinguish not only the content of a field of study from those of the natural sciences, but also its methodology.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;Georg Henrik von Wright, ''Explanation and Understanding'', {{ISBN|0-8014-0644-7}}, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early development===
The term '''moral science''' was used by [[David Hume|David Hume (1711-1776)]] in his ''Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals'' to refer to the systematic study of human nature and relationships. Hume wished to establish a "science of human nature" based upon [[empirical]] phenomena, and excluding all that does not arise from [[observation]]. Rejecting [[teleological]], [[theological]] and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] explanations, Hume sought to develop an essentially descriptive methodology; phenomena were to be precisely characterized. He emphasized the necessity of carefully explicating the cognitive content of ideas and vocabulary, relating these to their empirical roots and real-world significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of early thinkers in the humanistic sciences took up Hume's direction. [[Adam Smith]], for example, conceived of economics as a moral science in the [[David Hume|Hume]]an sense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acton.org/publicat/m_and_m/2001_spring/crespo.html Book Review] of Jeffrey T. Young's ''Economics As a Moral Science: The Political Economy of Adam Smith''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later development===
Partly in reaction to the establishment of [[positivism|positivist philosophy]] and the latter's [[Auguste Comte|Comtean]] intrusions into traditionally humanistic areas such as sociology, non-postivistic researchers in the humanistic sciences began to carefully but emphatically distinguish the methodological approach appropriate to these areas of study, for which the unique and distinguishing characteristics of phenomena are in the forefront (e.g. for the biographer), from that appropriate to the [[natural science]]s, for which the ability to link phenomena into generalized groups is foremost. In this sense, [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] contrasted the humanistic science's need to ''comprehend'' the phenomena under consideration with natural science's need to ''explain'' phenomena, while [[Windelband]] coined the terms [[idiographic]] for a descriptive study of the individual nature of phenomena, and [[nomothetic]] for sciences that aim to define the generalizing laws.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] brought nineteenth-century attempts to formulate a methodology appropriate to the humanistic sciences together with Hume's term "moral science", which he translated as ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'' - a term with no exact English equivalent. Dilthey attempted to articulate the entire range of the moral sciences in a comprehensive and systematic way.&lt;ref name="Dilthey"&gt;Wilhelm Dilthey, ''An Introduction to the Human Sciences'', Princeton Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chap. I}} Meanwhile, his conception of “Geisteswissenschaften” encompasses also the abovementioned study of classics, languages, literature, music, philosophy, history, religion, and the visual and performing arts. He characterized the scientific nature of a study as depending upon:&lt;ref name="Dilthey"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter XI}}
* The conviction that perception gives access to reality
* The self-evident nature of logical reasoning
* The [[principle of sufficient reason]]
But the specific nature of the ''Geisteswissenschaften'' is based on the "inner" experience (''Erleben''), the "comprehension" (''[[Verstehen]]'') of the meaning of expressions and "understanding" in terms of the relations of the part and the whole – in contrast to the ''Naturwissenschaften'', the "[[explanation]]" of phenomena by [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] laws in the "[[natural science]]s".&lt;ref name=Dilthey7&gt;Wilhelm Dilthey, ''Gesammelte Schriften'', vol. VII&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 86}}

[[Edmund Husserl]], a student of [[Franz Brentano]], articulated his phenomenological philosophy in a way that could be thought as a basis of Dilthey's attempt. Dilthey appreciated Husserl's ''Logische Untersuchungen''&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Husserl, ''Logical Investigations'', 1973 [1913], Findlay, J. N., trans. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; (1900/1901, the first draft of Husserl's ''Phenomenology'') as an “epoch making“ epistemological foundation of his conception of Geisteswissenschaften.&lt;ref name=Dilthey7/&gt;{{rp|p. 14}}

In recent years, 'human science' has been used to refer to "a philosophy and approach to science that seeks to understand human experience in deeply subjective, personal, historical, contextual, cross-cultural, political, and spiritual terms. Human science is the science of qualities rather than of quantities and closes the subject-object split in science. In particular, it addresses the ways in which self-reflection, art, music, poetry, drama, language and imagery reveal the human condition. By being interpretive, reflective, and appreciative, human science re-opens the conversation among science, art, and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saybrook.edu/phs/academicprograms/hs Saybrook Graduate School]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective vs. subjective experiences==

Since [[Auguste Comte]], the positivistic [[social science]]s have sought to imitate the approach of the natural sciences by emphasizing the importance of objective external observations and searching for universal laws whose operation is predicated on external initial conditions that do not take into account differences in subjective human [[perception]] and attitude. Critics argue that [[subjectivity|subjective]] human experience and intention plays such a central role in determining human social behavior that an objective approach to the social sciences is too confining. Rejecting the positivist influence, they argue that the scientific method can rightly be applied to subjective, as well as objective, experience. The term subjective is used in this context to refer to inner [[psychological]] experience rather than outer [[sensory perception|sensory]] experience. It is not used in the sense of being prejudiced by personal motives or beliefs.

==Human sciences in universities==
The Human Sciences degree is relatively young. It has been a degree subject at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] since 1969, and at [[University College London|UCL]] was proposed in 1973 by Professor [[John Zachary Young|J. Z. Young]] and implemented two years later. His aim was to train general science graduates who would be scientifically literate, numerate and easily able to communicate across a wide range of disciplines, replacing the traditional Classics training for higher-level government and management careers. Central topics include the evolution of [[human]]s, their behaviour, [[molecular]] and population [[genetics]], population growth and ageing, ethnic and cultural diversity and the human interaction with the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], including conservation, disease and [[nutrition]]. The study of both [[biological]] and social disciplines, integrated within a framework of human diversity and sustainability, should enable the human scientist to develop professional competencies suited to address such multidimensional human problems. In the [[United Kingdom]], Human Sciences is offered at degree level at several institutions. These include:

'''Hyperpersonal theory''' (HPT) is related and understood through [[computer-mediated communication]](CMC). Hyperpersonal theory is part of [[interpersonal communication]] theory meaning that the HPT suggests CMC due to the uses technological messages rather than [[face-to-face interaction]]s. According to Erin Schumaker (2013) the hyperpersonal theory represents how people communicate online rather than FtF.  The theory displays predictions on how people present themselves in a virtual environment. HPT demonstrates how individuals communicate uniquely, while representing themselves to others, how others interpret them, and how the interactions create a reciprocal spiral of FtF communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schumaker|first1=Erin|date=2013|title=Exploring the Hyperpersonal Model: Determining the inflated nature of feedback in computer-mediated communication|journal=Dissertation at Ohio State University|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Walther ==
Joseph Walther is noted to be the founder of this theory, however, he uses his finding to teach at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In his research he found "the hyperpersonal model of CMC proposes a set of concurrent theoretically based processes to explain how CMC may facilitate impressions and relationships online"&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Processes and Functions|last1=Walther|first1=Joseph|location=Chapter 14|pages=443–471|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to FtF relationships. The model Walther created has four main components that illustrate how CMC relates to message structure and reception:&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

# Effects due to receiver processes
# Effects among message senders
# Attributes of the channel
# Feedback effects

Effects due to receiver processes explains how communication could be misunderstood or exaggerated perceptions by the sender. By this, Walther explains that without FtF interactions and gesture cues, receivers fill in the missing information from the sender. The second component involves the sender. Walther illustrates that senders are able to avoid distractions of conversation with FtF interaction, allowing the sender to compose messages making themselves more desirable over text and online rather than the receiver being able to see their characteristics and gesture cues. Senders are able to disclose information while being able to provide only the information they want the receiver to know. The third component describes how CMC is the channel of the conversation. In this section, senders are able to take their time and craft messages or responses without conversation flow.  Senders are able to perfect messages through the channel without  communication interruptions. The fourth component involves feedback from CMC. It exemplifies behavioral conformation and overall impressions made by the receiver of the channel. The feedback effects component has been under study recently due to acknowledging if this component was enhancing the identity of the sender.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; These four components represent how CMC may effect how relationships online exceed offline relationships.

== Background ==
Orignination of the hyperpersonal theory model came from [[Joseph Walther]]. He is the Director of Center for Information Technology and Society at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Walther, according to the University of California, Santa Barbara says, "his teaching and research focus on [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and social media in personal relationships, groups, educational settings, and inter-ethic conflict, topics on which he has contributed several original theories and numerous experiments and surveys".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/joe-walther|title=UC Santa Barbara Department of Communication|website=comm.ucsb.edu|accessdate=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer-mediated communication ==
Computer-mediated communication, also known as CMC, relates to hyperpersonal theory model because it suggests that computer-mediated communication can turn hyperpersonal since they both lack the use of face-to-face communication. CMC "may be [[wikt:impersonal|impersonal]]".&lt;ref name=":023"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walther |first1=Joseph B. |title=Computer-Mediated Communication |journal=Communication Research |date=29 June 2016 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=3–43 |doi=10.1177/009365096023001001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are now online friendships and virtual communities. CMC was "emerged as an unintended byproduct of linking large computers to one another for security and information redundancy".&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; In doing so, operators found that the computers were able to send messages to other people, enabling computer-mediated communication. From this, researchers began to question whether CMC could replace traveling to events, such as business meetings, and indicate whether or not CMC might provide meetings more effective than FtF meetings.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; This is where researchers developed online behaviors vs personal interaction behaviors. They tested this by interactions through e-mail. Researchers then found that computer-mediated communication was more task-oriented rather than FtF conversations/meetings.

In contrast, Daft and Lengel's [[Media richness theory|Media Richness theory]] depict FtF interactions contain more richness than CMC. Daft and Lengel state, "messages should be communicated on channels with sufficient and appropriate media richness capacities."&lt;ref name=":423"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlson|first=John|last2=Zmud|first2=Robert|date=April 1999|title=Channel Expansion Theory and the Experiential Nature of Media Richness Perceptions|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=42|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They continue to propose that "messages communicated on channels that are inappropriate to the equivocality of a situation and the richness of the information may be misinterpreted by recipients or may be otherwise ineffective"&lt;ref name=":423" /&gt; Whereas, Walther explains HPT represents how communication interpersonally online has enhanced society with new technologies, allowing people to create virtual communities. Walther enacted the finding and research of CMC when Daft and Lengel stated that management problems became too difficult and complex; stating that the richness of communication was lost when tying to convey adequate insight and understanding &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt; Walther explains that growing numbers of reports indicate that CMC interactions are sometimes just as interactive as FtF interactions.

== Uses of Hyperpersonal theory ==
Hyperpersonal theory Model describes how people use virtual communication, or [[computer-mediated communication]], rather than [[face-to-face communication]] (FtF). There are two directions Walther makes on the work of CMC and its interpersonal effects:&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

# To integrate theories and findings based on impersonal and interpersonal interactions in CMC, allowing favorable outcomes for certain contexts in HPT &lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;
# To view a new perspective on intimacy, solidarity, and liking via CMC, allowing HPT to surpass FtF interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name=":023"/&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock ===
Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock use Joseph Walther's hyperpersonal theory model to indicate the understandings of intimacy interpersonal relationships through CMC. In their study, the three researchers established "some online relationships tend to be more intimate than FtF relationships and CMC interactions are often rated as significantly more intimate than FtF counterparts. One approach to explain this phenomenon is the hyperpersoanl model, which highlights the cognitive and behavioral processes and CMC affordances that can contribute to greater online intimacy".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Crystal|last2=Bazarova|first2=Natalie|last3=Hancock|first3=Jeffrey|date=2010|title=The Disclosure–Intimacy Link in Computer-Mediated Communication: An Attributional Extension of the Hyperpersonal Model|url=|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=37|pages=58–77|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They depicted that people tend to "put their best foot forward"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; while engaging in CMC relationships. They found that CMC allows a person to self-present themselves. One thing they studied throughout this research was the context of online dating. Online dating allows a person to post a picture of themselves that they chose and avoid a less attractive photo of them. Jiang, Bazarova and Hancock discovered that "related to the sender's behavior in CMC, people appear to be more comfortable disclosing personal information in CMC than FtF".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jiang, et al. argue this may lead to a "more positive hyperpersonal relationship”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Related theories ==

=== Daft &amp; Lengel's Media Richness Theory ===
Daft and Lengel's Media Richness theory first began in the setting of organizations to evaluate media channels within. The theory describes having a set of organizational communication channels with objectives that enable researchers to determine the capacity of rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; According to Daft and Lengel, they believe communication channels such as email and phone recede the necessary abilities to convey messages that use rich information.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt;

=== Kock's Media Naturalness and Channel Expansion Theory ===
[[Ned Kock]], is a researcher of the [[Media naturalness theory|Media Naturalness]] and [[Channel expansion theory|Channel Expansion theory]] (CET). In 2004, Kock originally argued that humans were not equipped to deal with CMC when compared to "richer" forms of communication like FtF interactions. He reasoned this by stating that people evolved in FtF communication and have not had time to evolve into being equally adequate CMC communicators. The Channel Expansion Theory (Carlson and Zmud 1999) essentially undercut Kock's view of evolutionary changes. CET illustrates how a person is able to develop certain perceptions of a new media channel.&lt;ref name=":423"/&gt; In contrast, in 2011, Kock revisits the issue of Media Naturalness in light of the Channel Expansion theory and, in turn, argues that Media Naturalness and CET can co-exist.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kock|first=Ned|last2=Garza|first2=Vanessa|date=April–June 2011|title=Media Naturalness and Compensatory Channel Expansion: A Study of Online and Face-to-Face Sections of the Same Course|url=|journal=International Journal of Distance Education Technologies|volume=9|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kock finally concludes that CMC interactions can achieve "positive effects" &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; when compared to an equivalent FtF interaction, in the case of distance learning.

== Critique ==
Walther describes some challenges to CMC research. His area of concern lies within three areas:&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

# Neglect of off-line comparisons in CMC
# New technologies
# Studying interpersonal communication

Walthers seeks to tell researchers not compare FtF communication with CMC due the fact they rely on different users and features.

According to Charles Soukup (2000), the problem with CMC communication lies within the multi-media aspects. Many researcher have lacked studying new technologies and multi-media outlets in today's society. Researchers are failing to see the new dimensions CMC has to offer, the researchers are relying too much on textual aspects of CMC rather than communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soukup |first1=Charles |title=Building a Theory of Multi-Media CMC |journal=New Media &amp; Society |date=30 June 2016 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=407–425 |doi=10.1177/1461444800002004002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institute of Philosophy''' of the [[University of Warsaw]] (Polish ''Instytut filozofii Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego'') is a research institution located in Warsaw, part of the Faculty of Philosophy and Sociology of the University of Warsaw. It is renowned mainly for its contribution to the development of modern [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]] ([[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lvov-Warsaw School]] - [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]]) and to [[history of ideas]] ([[Warsaw School of the History of Ideas]] - [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], [[Stanisław Ossowski]], [[Maria Ossowska]], [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Adam Schaff]]). Provides master's degree studies, doctor's degree studies and postgraduate studies in philosophy both in Polish and in English.

== The 18th and 19th century ==

The main centre of the medieval and early modern [[History of philosophy in Poland|Polish philosophy]] was [[Kraków]] - history of philosophy in Warsaw begins in the 18th century. In the pre-partition Varsovian institutions, the [[Collegium Nobilium (Warsaw)|Collegium Nobilium]] and the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Szkoła Rycerska]] to the lecturers of philosophy belonged [[Antoni Wiśniewski]] and [[Marcin Nikuta]]. In the 19th century, after the foundation of the University of Warsaw in 1815, due to [[russification]] of the schools Polish philosophy, both idealist and positivist, developed mainly outside universities. Among main Polish philosophers connected with the 19th century University of Warsaw were [[Adam Zabellewicz]] and  [[Henryk Struve]].

== Interwar period ==

After 1918, when Poland regained independence, University of Warsaw was reorganized. Chairs of philosophy were held by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Kotarbiński]], [[Stanisław Leśniewski]], [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]] and [[Stanisław Schayer]].

Initially, philosophical education were organized in the Faculty of Historical-Philosophical Studies (1915–16), soon transformed into the Faculty of Philosophical Studies (1916–27), and then into the Faculty of the Humanities (Tatarkiewicz, Kotarbiński and Schayer) and the Faculty of Mathematical Studies and Physics (Łukasiewicz, Leśniewski and Ajdukiewicz).

Other important philosophers teaching in Warsaw were [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Henryk Elzenberg]], [[Maria Ossowska]] and [[Stanisław Ossowski]]. Worldwide renown in [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]] was enjoyed by the Warsaw School of Logic, part of the philosophical movement of [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic|Lvov-Warsaw School]].

During the German occupation of Warsaw secret courses of philosophy were conducted by Łukasiewcz, Tatarkiewicz, Kotarbiński and others.

== History after 1945 ==

After 1945, during the stalinist era, due to political predominance of marxist philosophy in Poland some professors were partially prohibited from pursuing didactic activity. After the [[Polish October]] (1956) a separate Faculty of Philosophical Studies (1954–65) emerged from the Faculty of Arts and many leading philosophers were allowed to teach. It was subsequently transformed into the Faculty of Philosophical-Sociological Studies (1965–68).

In the 50. and 60. [[Warsaw School of the History of Ideas]] emerged. To this informal group of non-analytical philosophers belonged mainly former marxists (called "revisionist"), inspired to some extent by the ideas of Tatarkiewicz and Ossowskis. After the [[1968 Polish political crisis|Polish March]] (1968), when many "revisionist" Polish philosophers and sociologists (for example [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Zygmunt Bauman]], [[Adam Schaff]]) participated in the events, philosophy at Warsaw University was subjected to a thorough reorganization. Chairs were renamed to departments and the Faculty of Philosophical Studies were forcibly joined with the Faculty of Sociology, within which the Institute of Philosophy was established.

In the post-war period the tradition of Lvov-Warsaw School was also continued. To the most important philosophers and logicians of the post-war period connected with the University of Warsaw belong [[Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz]], [[Zdzisław Augustynek]], [[Bronisław Baczko]], [[Marek Fritzhand]], [[Henryk Jankowski]], [[Andrzej Kasia]], [[Leszek Kołakowski]], [[Władysław Krajewski]], [[Tadeusz Kroński]], [[Jan Legowicz]], [[Stefan Morawski]], [[Elżbieta Pietruska-Madej]], [[Marian Przełęcki]], [[Adam Schaff]], [[Marek Siemek]], [[Adam Sikora]], [[Roman Suszko]], [[Klemens Szaniawski]] and [[Bogusław Wolniewicz]].

[[File:IAESTE letter.png|thumb|Letter from [[United Nations]] General Secretary [[Ban Ki-moon]].]]
The '''International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience''' commonly referred to as IAESTE (pronounced i-a-es-te or ai-es-te) is an international organization exchanging students for technical work experience abroad. Students gain relevant technical [[training]] lasting from 4 weeks to 18 months. IAESTE includes committees representing more than 80 countries, with the potential of accepting new countries into the organization every year. At the general conference 2005 held in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], the statute and by-laws of IAESTE a.s.b.l. were established, making IAESTE a registered "associacion sans but lucratif" ([[non-profit organization]]), with the centre in [[Luxembourg]]. The current President is prof. Bernard Baeyens from [[Colombia]]. IAESTE's motto is "Work, Experience, Discover". IAESTE's aims are to connect students with employers in foreign countries, provide university students with technical experience, and culturally enrich students and their host communities.

==History==
IAESTE was founded in 1948 at [[Imperial College]], [[London]]. The Imperial College Vacation Work Committee headed by Mr. James Newby initiated a meeting with national organizations from 10 European countries in a [[Effects of World War II#A New Europe|post war]] effort to promote better understanding between countries and cultures.

Since 1948, the association has grown to include more than 80 countries worldwide and has exchanged in excess of 300,000 students. IAESTE exchanges around 7000 students annually playing an important role in giving technical undergraduates practical work experience and a global perspective.

==Organization structure==

===International organization structure===
The IAESTE Association is a confederation of National Committees representing academic, industrial, and student interests. Coordinating the daily administration of the association is the responsibility of the President. The President is elected for two years and is responsible for the General Conference or the GC as it is called in IAESTE. The GC makes the formal decisions in IAESTE and is composed of one delegate (National Secretary) from each country. The GC meets every year in January and is a forum for discussion.

The Board is an elected body which prepares the work of the General Conference and advises the President. It is composed of four elected members and the President.

The GC is the most important event of IAESTE each year. Here every country brings job offers they have obtained in their own country. Every job is written on a standardized form stating where and when the job is, who is eligible for the job and which qualifications (language, skills, etc.) are required. The jobs are traded during the ''Exchange Sessions''. During these sessions, countries meet and try to get the best possible jobs to bring back home. This is very hectic as countries try to get the best jobs. These jobs either have to fit pre-selected students or are open for applications from students back home.

One other notable event at the GC is the "International Party". At this party, every member country brings a national dish, drinks and clothes.

The international work is funded by member fees based on [[GDP per capita]] and the number of students sent abroad and is paid by the National Committees.

===National organization structure===
The National Committees represent the member countries and are composed of persons representing academic, industrial and student interests.  Every full member of the IAESTE has one vote at the GC. The National Secretary is normally the person with the formal vote, even though the decisions are often made by the whole National Committee.

Each National Committee is responsible for the administration of the exchange in its own country. Membership is given after the establishment of a National Committee in accordance with the statutes of IAESTE, together with a responsible permanent secretariat. The type of secretariat which administers the exchange varies according to each country's national structure, educational system, and funding policies. The essential requirement is that the national secretariat, whatever its organization and status, should have competent permanent staff.

Every country has their own way of organizing the work of IAESTE, but the National Committee can mainly be classified into four categories:
* Student driven - The National Secretary is a student, normally serving for one to two years. Often there is one employed administrative staff for paperwork and keeping contact with other national committees, but the students are making decisions, organizing trainees and even raising funds. Examples are Norway, Denmark, Austria, Slovakia or Croatia (see [[#CEC|CEC]]).
* Academically - The National Secretary is a professor or employed by a university to front IAESTE on the behalf of the university or the country. Usually, they have students to welcome trainees, but students are not involved in the decision-making. Examples are Turkey, Portugal.
* Governmental - An employee of a governmental international work exchange organization is the National Secretary. Usually the organization is responsible for several exchange programs and is quite professional. They also often employ students to welcome incoming students. Examples are Finland, Switzerland and UK.
* Other - Non-profit organizations funded by various sources (students, companies, government) but not affiliated with a single institution. Examples are China, USA.

IAESTE varies a lot from country to country and even within countries there can be a big difference from one city to another. Traineeships also vary a lot: some countries have extended programmes with students employed to help and organize events,&lt;ref&gt;[http://iaeste.no/nyweb/modules/content/index.php?id=78 Example from Norway of the social part of being a trainee]&lt;/ref&gt; while in other places arriving trainees organize events themselves.

==Annual Conference (AC)==
The most important international event that connects IAESTE leaders from all over the world. Next AC will be held by IAESTE Cyprus. It will host the 72nd IAESTE Annual Conference in January 2019 (18 January to 24 January 2019 in Limassol). More information you can find [http://web.cut.ac.cy/iaeste-cy2019/ here].
73rd AC will be held by IAESTE Slovakia in January 2020.

==The IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN)==
The Friends of IAESTE Network (FoIN) was founded 1996 in Denmark as the official Alumni branch of IAESTE, with the goal of helping former IAESTE trainees and members keep in touch.

In 2010, FoIN was re-branded as the IAESTE Alumni Network (IAN) and an Alumni Relations Manager was appointed to oversee all activities. The current holder of this position is Bruce Wicks from the [[United Kingdom]]. In 2011, IAN launched a new, online network which currently has over 10,000 members.

==IAESTE Day==
In 2005, an international IAESTE Day was created, for the purpose of global promotion of the organization as well as the celebration of its aims and goals. Starting with 6 countries, IAESTE Day was celebrated in 28 of its member countries in 2007. IAESTE Day is held on 20 October every year.

==JUMP==
Join Us to Motivate People (JUMP) is the "Motivation and Training Seminar" of IAESTE. JUMP was founded in 1995 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] on the initiative of Martin Klaus, former National Secretary of IAESTE Austria. Martin became co-ordinator of JUMP, later this role was taken over by Adrian Keller from IAESTE Switzerland, and in 2009 by Tomasz (Tomek) Pawliszyn from IAESTE Poland.
JUMP is aimed to young members of IAESTE who want to explore more the organisation and meet other members of IAESTE.

Primarily new members of IAESTE meet in a different European city each year during four days in September or October for training sessions and discussion groups. An important component is cultural exchange with corporate tours, cultural events and tours and social events incorporating local cuisine and customs.  The theme song for the seminar is [[Jump (For My Love)]] by the [[Pointer Sisters]].

Usually 40 - 70 participants take part in the event. Each JUMP is combined of six workshop sessions, led by experienced members, that cover the essence of IAESTE activities:
*Introduction to IAESTE
*Administration
*Company Marketing and Fundraising
*Job-Raising
*Local Committee Management
*Student Marketing and Member-Raising
Additionally all participants visit various information boots on the topics of summer reception, career fairs, career websites, etc. All together combined with IAESTE related games, international evening, sightseeing trip and company presentation to show that IAESTE is much more than the exchange of job offers. One of the other highlights are motivation speeches by invited guests.

==CEC==
The '''Central European Convention''' is a group of several [[IAESTE]] member countries in the specific geographic region. Those are all "student-run" countries, so students are in the decision making positions (contrary to academic or professional-run countries).

Those countries agree to meet twice a year and hold working and discussion groups. At the same time, they get to know the culture of the hosting country.

===Goals===

* Motivation
* Education
* Developing IAESTE
* Improve the situation of student run countries

===History===
The Central European Convention (CEC) was founded in May 1998 in [[Tuheljske Toplice]], [[Croatia]], on the initiative of Thomas Haim, former National Secretary IAESTE AUSTRIA, and Mario Kauzlaric, former National Secretary IAESTE CROATIA. Because of the great success, the CEC is held 2 times a year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">An '''interpolation''', in relation to [[literature]] and especially ancient [[manuscript]]s, is an entry or passage in a text that was not written by the original author. As there are often several generations of copies between an extant copy of an ancient text and the original, each handwritten by different scribes, there is a natural tendency for extraneous material to be inserted into such documents over time.

Interpolations originally may be inserted as an authentic explanatory note (for example, {{bracket|[[sic]]}}), but may also be included for fraudulent purposes. The forged passages and works attributed to the [[Pseudo-Isidore]] are an example of the latter. Similarly, the letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] were interpolated by Apollinarian heretics, three centuries after the originals were written. Charters and legal texts are also subject to [[forgery]] of this kind.  In the 13th century a medieval romance, the ''[[Prose Tristan]]'', inserted another prose romance, the [[Vulgate]] ''Queste del Saint Graal'', in its entirety in order to reinterpret the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]] through the optics of the Tristan story.&lt;ref&gt;On the Medieval technique of manuscript ''[[interpolation]]'' and the ''Prose Tristan'', see Emmanuèle Baumgartner, "La préparation à la ''Queste del Saint Graal'' dans le ''Tristan'' en prose" in Norris Lacy, ed. ''Conjunctures'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1994), pp. 1-14, Fanni Bogdanow, "L'Invention du texte, intertextualité et le problème de la transmission et de la classification de manuscrits" ''Romania'' 111 (190): 121-40 and Janina P. Traxler, "The Use and Abuse of the Grail Quest" ''Tristania'' 15 (1994): 23-31.  Gaston Paris, in 1897, also noted the interpolation of a verse romance on [[Brunor]] in ''Prose Tristan''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, most interpolations result from the errors and inaccuracies which tend to arise during hand-copying, especially over long periods of time. For example, if a [[scribe]] made an error when copying a text and omitted some lines, he would have tended to include the omitted material in the margin. However, margin notes made by readers are present in almost all manuscripts. Therefore, a different scribe seeking to produce a copy of the manuscript perhaps many years later could find it very difficult to determine whether a margin note was an omission made by the previous scribe (which should be included in the text) or simply a note made by a reader (which should be ignored or kept in the margin).

Conscientious scribes tended to copy everything which appeared in a manuscript, but in all cases scribes needed to exercise personal judgement. Explanatory notes would tend to find their way into the body of a text as a natural result of this subjective process.

Modern scholars have developed techniques{{Which|date=August 2010}} for recognizing interpolation, which are often apparent to modern observers, but would have been less so for medieval copyists.

The [[Comma Johanneum]], for example, is commonly regarded as interpolation. The specific problem of Christian transmission of Jewish texts outside the Jewish and Christian canons is often described as [[Christian interpolation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13615">'''Media psychology''' is the branch of psychology that focuses on the interaction of [[human behavior]] and [[Mass media|media]] and technology. Media psychology is not restricted to mass media or media content; it includes all forms of mediated communication and media technology-related behaviors, such as the use, design, impact and sharing behaviors. This branch is a relatively new field of study because of advancement in [[technology]].  It uses various methods of critical analysis and investigation to develop a working model of a user's perception on media experience. These methods are used for society as a whole and on an individual basis. Media psychologists are able to perform activities that include consulting, design, and production in various media like television, video games, films, and news broadcasting. Media psychologists are not considered to be those who are featured in media (such as counselors-psychotherapists, clinicians etc.), rather than those who research, work or contribute to the field.

== History ==
There are overlaps with numerous fields, such as media studies, communication science, anthropology, education, and sociology, not to mention those within the discipline of psychology itself.&amp;nbsp;Much of the research that would be considered as ‘media psychology’ has come from other fields, both academic and applied. In the 1920s, marketing, advertising and public relations professionals began conducting research on consumer behavior and motivation for commercial applications.&lt;ref&gt;Rutledge, P. B. (2013). Arguing for Media Psychology as a Distinct Field. In K. Dill (Ed.), Oxford Handbook of Media Psychology (pp. 43-58). New York: Oxford University Press. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; The use of mass media during World War II, created a surge of academic interest in mass media messaging and resulted in the creation of a new field, communication science (Lazarsfeld &amp; Merton, 2000).&amp;nbsp;The field of media psychology gained prominence n the 1950s when [[television]] was becoming popular in American households. Psychologists responded to widespread social concerns about the children and their television viewing. For example, researchers began to study the impact of television viewing on children's reading skills. Later, they began to study the impact of violent television viewing on children's behavior, for example, if they were likely to exhibit anti-social behavior or to copy the violent behaviors that they were seeing. These events led up to the creation of a new division of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1987. Division 46, the Media Psychology Division (now the APA Society for Media Psychology and Technology), is one of the fastest growing in the American Psychological Association.&amp;nbsp; Today's media psychologists study both legacy and new media forms that have risen in recent years such as [[Smartphone|cellular phone technology]], the [[internet]], and new genres of [[television]]. Media psychologists are also involved in how people are impacted and can benefit from the design of technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and mobile technologies, such as using VR to help trauma victims.&lt;ref&gt;Rizzo, A., John, B., Newman, B., Williams, J., Hartholt, A., Lethin, C., et al. (2013). Virtual Reality as a Tool for Delivering PTSD Exposure Therapy and Stress Resilience Training. Military Behavioral Health, 1(1), 52-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories ==
Media psychology's theories include the user's [[perception]], [[cognition]], and [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic components]] in regards to their [[experience]] to their surroundings. Media psychologists also draw upon developmental and narrative psychologies and emerging findings from neuroscience. The theories and research in psychology are used as the backbone of media psychology and guide the discipline itself. Theories in psychology applied to media include multiple dimensions, i.e., text, pictures, symbols, video and sound. Sensory Psychology, [[semiotics]] and semantics for visual and language communication, social cognition and neuroscience are among the areas addressed in the study of this area of media psychology. A few of the theories employed in media psychology include:

=== Affective disposition theory (ADT) ===

{{main|Affective disposition theory}}
The concept of [[affective disposition theory]] is used to differentiate users' perspectives on different forms of media content and the differences within attentional focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=The Role of Morality in Emotional Reactions to and Enjoyment of Media Entertainment |last=Arthur |first=Raney |date=2011 |journal=Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, and Applications |doi=10.1027/1864-1105/a000027 |pmid= |access-date= |publisher=Hogrefe Publishing |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory consists of four components that revolve around emotion: (1) media is based on an individual’s [[emotion]]s and [[opinion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s towards characters, (2) media content is driven from enjoyment and appreciation from individuals, (3) individuals form feelings about characters that are either positive or negative and (4) media relies on conflicts between characters and how individuals react to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Affective Disposition Theories {{!}} Media Psychology Review |url=http://mprcenter.org/review/tag/affective-disposition-theories/ |website=mprcenter.org |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulation theory (ST)===

Simulation theory&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Simulation theory |last1=Shanton |first1=Karen |last2=Goldman |first2=Alvin |date=2010 |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=527–538 |doi=10.1002/wcs.33 |pmid=26271500 |url=http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/goldman/Simulation%20Theory.pdf |access-date=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that mental simulations do not fully exclude the external information that surrounds the user.  Rather that the mediated stimuli are reshaped into imagery and memories of the user in order to run the simulation. It explains why the user is able to form these experiences without the use of technology, because it points to the relevance of construction and internal processing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Psychological theory of play===

The psychological theory of play applies a more general framework to the concept of media [[entertainment]].  This idea potentially offers a more conceptual connection that points to
presence. The activity of playing exhibits consistent results to the use of entertainment objects. This theory states that play is a type of action that is characterized by three major aspects:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PLAY THEORY |url=http://communicationtheory.org/play-theory/ |website=Communication Theory |accessdate=2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# It is intrinsically motivated and highly attractive.
# It implies a change in perceived reality, as players construct an additional reality while they are playing.
# It is frequently repeated.

The psychological theory of play is based upon the explanations given by eminent people such as [[William Stephenson (psychologist)|Stephenson]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], and [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]].  The theory is based on how an individual uses media for their satisfaction and how media changes within a person's life according to its contents.  Play is used for pleasure and is self-contained.  People are influenced by media both negatively and positively because we are able to relate to what we see within the environment. Through looking more in depth at the different forms of playing; it becomes apparent that the early versions of make believe play demonstrate the child's need for control and the desire to influence their current environment.

== Major contributors ==
Major contributors to media psychology include [[Marshall McLuhan]], Dolf Zillmann,  Katz, Blumler and Gurevitch, Bernard Luskin and David Giles. [[Marshall McLuhan]] is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] communication philosopher who was active from the 1930s to the 1970s in the realm of Media Analysis and Technology. He was appointed by the President of the University of Toronto in 1963 to create a new Centre for Culture and Technology to study the psychological and social consequences of technologies and media. McLuhan's famous statement pertaining to media psychology was, "[[The medium is the message]]".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Media Psychology|last = Giles|first = David|publisher = Routledge|year = 2003|isbn = |location = Mahwah, N.J.|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan's famous statement was suggestive towards the notion that media is inherently dangerous.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McLuhan's theory on media called "technological determinism" would pave the way for other people to study media.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Dolf Zillmann advanced the two-factor model of emotion. The two-factor of emotion proposed that emotion involves both psychological and cognitive components.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zillmann advanced the theory of ''"Excitation transfer"'' by establishing the explanation for the effects of violent media.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zillmann's theory proposed the notion that viewer's are physiologically aroused when they watch aggressive scenes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After watching an aggressive scene, an individual will become aggressive due to the arousal from the scene.

In 1974 Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch used the [[uses and gratifications theory]] to explain media psychology. Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch discovered five components of the theory; (1) the media competes with sources of satisfaction, (2) goals of mass media can be discovered through data and research, (3) media lies within the audience, (4) a audience is conceived as active, and (5) judgment of mass media should not be expressed until the audience has time to process the media and its content on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Uses and Gratifications Research |last=Katz |first=Elihu |publisher=Public Opinion |year=1973 |isbn= |location= |pages= |last2=Blumer |last3=Gurevitch |first2=Jay |first3=Michael |volume=37 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Giles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winchester.ac.uk/academicdepartments/psychology/staff/Pages/DrDavidGiles.aspx |title=David Giles Website |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been publishing in the area of media psychology since 2000.  He wrote the first book about media psychology in 2003. {{Citation needed|reason=The terms mass media and media psychology were in wide-spread use in the 1970s, long before Giles. How can he possibly be the first to write about it? This statement seems to be patently false. |date=March 2017}} His book ''Media Psychology'' gives an overview of media psychology as a field, its subcategories, theories, and developmental issues within media psychology.

Bernard Luskin launched the first MA PhD program and EdD program in Media Psychology in any university at Fielding Graduate University in 2002. Writing extensively and producing media, he also launched the MA program in Media Psychology and Social Change with UCLA Extension and the MA program in Media and Communications Psychology at Touro University Worldwide. Luskin is a pioneer in media literature, program development and he conducted the APA Task Force Study that redefined Media Psychology in 1998. He is past Chair of the Society for Media Psychology and Technology.

Pamela Rutledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pamelarutledge.com/ |title=Pamela Rutledge Website |date= |accessdate=2015-12-08 |website= |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the Director of the [http://www.mprcenter.org Media Psychology Research Center] in Newport Beach, California, and a faculty member in the Media Psychology Program at [http://www.fielding.edu Fielding Graduate University]. She is well known for the application of media psychology as to marketing and brand strategy, transmedia storytelling and audience engagement. According to Rutledge, while there is no specific consensus or career path for media psychology, there are many opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Rutledge, P. (2016). Media Psychologists. In R. J. Sternberg (Ed.), Career Paths in Psychology: Where Your Degree Can Take You (pp. 291-308). Washington D.C.: American Psychological Assn.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutledge argues that media psychology will be increasingly important because of the ubiquity of technology and the rapid adoption, particularly by the young.  This, combined with the global political and economic impact of mobile technologies,  suggest that technology will continue to disrupt systems and has the potential to generate solutions to problems and challenge our imagination. Rutledge believes that media psychologists are uniquely positioned to examine the questions that arise, establish best practices and standards for positive and ethical media and technology use, and inform the development of media and technology that can benefit individuals and society.  Emerging areas include media literacy, digital citizenship, transmedia storytelling, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and making sense out of the vast quantities of data analysis increasingly available through the emerging field of data science and data visualization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3782">In Germany, a '''medical-psychological assessment''' (MPA) is used by the authorities in deciding whether to revoke or reissue a [[driving licence]]. Medical-psychological  assessment  has  been  shown  to be  highly effective in  reducing the number of repetitions of [[driving under the influence]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/6/605.full.pdf Medical screening and medical-psychological assessment as prerequisites for regranting of licences; Alcohol &amp; Alcoholism Vol. 31, No. 6, pp. 605-607, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erste deutsche Autolenkerschule 2.jpg|thumb|250px| First German driving school in 1906, [[Aschaffenburg]]]]

==History==
The first standards mandating the MPA for certain prospective drivers were legally adopted in 1955.  Its stated purpose was to improve traffic safety and reduce the number of accidents by identifying unfit dangerous drivers and removing them from traffic until fitness to drive was restored.
[[File:BAST statistics 2006 for WP.png|thumb|200px|]]

The MPA has an interdisciplinary basic approach. Although it is considered a punishment by many offenders, it offers them the chance to rehabilitate themselves.&lt;ref name = "müller laub"&gt;[http://www.fit-to-drive.com/2006/downloads/Mueller_Laub.pdf Müller &amp; Laub 2006. The Medical Psychological Assessment: An Opportunity for the Individual, Safety for the General Public]&lt;/ref&gt; German medical-psychological institutes issue about 100,000 MPAs a year. Many of their clients have to take the MPA twice because more than 50% fail to get a positive opinion on their first try.

==Drunk drivers==
The prerequisites for operating a motor vehicle are only met once the level of alcohol consumption has changed appropriately. The change in drinking behaviour must be stabilised and motivationally consolidated. Passing the MPA is not easy: Drunk drivers with a blood alcohol level of 0.16% or more may in some instances be required to establish that they have been completely abstinent for at least one year; test administrators corroborate drivers' certifications (formal statements) as to their abstinence by measuring their liver function levels and conducting random urine screenings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Other offences==
A conviction for driving while impaired by alcohol and/or drugs is not the only scenario in which the MPA can be imposed.  Many test subjects who have ridden{{Clarify|date=October 2010}} a motorcycle under the influence or who regularly use drugs must present a favorable MPA opinion to the license-issuing agency by a certain deadline (usually several weeks after an incident) or face suspension of their driver's licenses.  This justification for requiring an MPA opinion enables the government to suspend the licenses of many alcoholics who were not apprehended while driving drunk.
[[File:BAST statistics 2006 for WP - results.png|thumb|200px|]] Also, in addition to justification, an MPA (which is much more often passed than alcohol-related MPAs) is necessary if someone wants a dispensation from the minimum driving age.

==Measures==
If possible, the MPA gives a clear recommendation to the offender to attend a specific course to re-establish his fitness to drive.&lt;ref name="krohn"&gt;[http://www.fit-to-drive.com/2006/downloads/Krohn_Fitness_to_Drive.pdf Krohn 2006. Courses for the re-establishment of fitness to drive with legal consequences]&lt;/ref&gt; These courses are well adapted to the specific problems of the offenders: Alcohol, drugs, or other traffic safety violations.

==Other countries==
In Russia, all professional drivers must pass a similar test at 2-year intervals.

==Early life and education==
Barker was born in Hull, England, on 23 June 1974, grew up in [[Bradford]],  and  holds a PhD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barker |first=M. |date=1999 |title=Student Loneliness: An Exploratory Investigation. PhD. Psychology |publisher=University of Nottingham. Unpublished}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Psychology]] from the [[University of Nottingham]]. After teaching at  a number of higher education institutions Barker settled at the [[Open University]] in 2008, having also qualified with an MA in [[Psychotherapy]] from the [[University of Sheffield]] and trained at the major [[National Health Service|NHS]] sexual and relationship clinic at [[Guy's Hospital]] for several years.

==Recent career==
Barker's   main area of expertise is human sexuality, gender and romantic relationships, with a focus on the experiences of people in sexual, gender and relationship communities  located outside the mainstream – particularly [[polyamorous]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clarke |first1=V. |last2=Ellis |first2=S. J. |last3=Peel |first3=E. |last4=Riggs |first4=D.

Theoretically their work draws on [[social constructionism]], [[existentialism]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. Barker, with co-author Darren Langdridge,   has published two   edited collections on [[sadomasochism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barker |first1=M. |last2=Langdridge |first2=D. |date=2013 |title=Safe, Sane and Consensual: Contemporary Perspectives on Sadomasochism |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1137338372}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[non-monogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barker |first1=M. |last2=Langdridge |first2=D. |date=2012 |title=Understanding Non-Monogamies |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0415652964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a recent book for mental health professionals (co-authored with Christina Richards). Barker founded the journal of ''Psychology &amp; Sexuality''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Psychology &amp; Sexuality |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |issn=1941-9899 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rpse20/current}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with Langdridge in 2010, and they co-edited it until 2017. Barker co-organized the Critical Sexology&lt;ref name="Critical Sexology"&gt;{{citation |title=Critical Sexology |url=http://criticalsexology.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; series from 2006 to 2018, and BiReCon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=BiReCon |url=https://bisexualresearch.wordpress.com/birecon/}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a biennial research conference which takes place prior to the annual [[BiCon (UK)|BiCon]] event).

===Writing===
Barker coined the phrase ‘anti self-help’ to describe self-help materials which locate the struggles that people have in their wider societal structures and cultural messages rather than in them as individuals[12]. Barker’s anti self-help books aim to help people to navigate their relationship with wider sociocultural understandings, rather than viewing themselves as a problem that needs fixing. They have produced books applying this approach to relationships&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barker |first1=M.-J. |date=2018 |title=Rewriting the Rules: An Anti Self-help Guide to Love, Sex and Relationships. Second edition. |publisher=Routledge. |isbn=978-1138676497}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sex (with Justin Hancock)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barker |first1=M.-J. |last2=Hancock |first2=J. |date=2017 |title=Enjoy Sex (How, When and If You Want To): A Practical and Inclusive Guide. |publisher=Icon Books. |isbn=978-1785780806}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and gender (with Alex Iantaffi)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Iantaffi |first1=A. |last2=Barker |first2=M.-J. |date=2017  |title=How to Understand Your Gender: A Practical Guide for Exploring Who You Are. |publisher=Jessica Kingsley. |isbn=978-1785927461}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as producing graphic-novel style non-fiction books and zines on queer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barker |first1=M.-J. |last2=Scheele |first2=J. |date=2016 |title=Queer: A Graphic History. |publisher=Icon Books. |isbn=978-1785780714}}&lt;/ref&gt;, mindfulness and other topics&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Zines |url=https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/zines/}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and a podcast on sex and relationships&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Meg-John and Justin |url=https://megjohnandjustin.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Consulting===
Barker has a background in psychotherapy, and led production on the [[Open University]] module Counselling: Exploring Fear and Sadness&lt;ref name="Counseling: Exploring Fear and Sadness"&gt;{{citation | title=Counseling: Exploring Fear and Sadness | url=http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/study/tasters/d240.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They are trained in [[existential therapy|existential psychotherapy]] and [[mindfulness]] with books on the latter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barker |first=M. |date=2013 |title=Mindful Counselling and Psychotherapy. |publisher=Sage Publications. |isbn=978-1446211113}}&lt;/ref&gt; developing the approaches of social mindfulness and mindful sex and relationship therapy (MSRT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brotto |first1=L. |last2=Barker |first2=M. |date=2014 |title=Mindfulness in Sexual and Relationship Therapy. |publisher=Routledge. |isbn=978-0415736961}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Their practice now takes the form of peer-to-peer consulting and mentoring with writers, practitioners, activists, and organisers, with a focus on relationships with self, others, and the wider world.

{{Linguistics}}
'''Metalinguistics''' is the branch of [[linguistics]] that studies [[language]] and its relationship to other [[culture|cultural behavior]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{dubious|date=December 2014}} It is the study of dialogue relationships between units of speech communication as manifestations and enactments of co-existence.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} [[Jacob L. Mey]] in his book, ''Trends in Linguistics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpfyF9W6xiMC&amp;pg=PA354&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ei=qb2wS6j8Ho20MN3eraYM&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=false |title=When Voices Clash: A Study in Literary Pragmatics|author=Jacob L. Mey |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s interpretation of metalinguistics as "encompassing the life history of a speech community, with an orientation toward a study of large events in the speech life of people and embody changes in various cultures and ages."


==Definitions==

Jean-Émile Gombert, teaching genetic psychology at Dijon University, France, states that one thing is to find an adequate way to treat the comprehension and the production of language, and another is to successfully adopt a reflexive attitude regarding the language objects and their manipulation. This is the second time that a psycholinguistic tradition recently developed has been given the name metalinguistics.

The linguist Noam Chomsky defines the field of metalinguistics as the subject knowledge of the characteristics and the operation of language or, from a more functionalist perspective, of its structure, its operation and its use. The relevant psychological description cannot be based on abstraction, it requires that the researchers and theorists widen their scopes till the point they can embrace the importance of the behavioural actions in the cognitive context of the subjects that realise them. The French linguist [[Jules Gilliéron]] wrote that ''All consciousness is necessarily 'meta' from the vantage point of the beholder, as it is not based on the real, but on its intelligibility of the real''.

==Literacy development==
Metalinguistic skills involve amplified and logical understanding of the rules used to govern language. Scholar Patrick Hartwell points out how substantial it is for students to develop these capabilities, especially heightened [[phonological awareness]], which is a key precursor to literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/376562|title=Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar|author=Patrick Hartwell|publisher=College English|volume=47|date=February 1985|pages=105–127|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An essential aspect to language development is focused on the student being aware of language and the components of language.

This idea is also examined in the article, 'Metalinguistic Awareness and Literacy Acquisition in Different Languages',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED391147&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED391147 |title=Metalinguistic Awareness and Literacy Acquisition in Different Languages. Technical Report No. 618|author1=Nagy, William E.|author2=Anderson, Richard C.|publisher=Eric.ed.gov |date=1964-05-15 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that centers on how the construction of a language and writing strategy shape an individual's ability to read. It also discusses the manner in which bilingualism increases particular elements of metalinguistic awareness.

Published research studies by Elizabeth McAllister have concluded that metalinguistic abilities are associated to cognitive development and is contingent on metalinguistic awareness which relates to reading skill level, academic success and cultural environment that starts at infancy and continues through preschool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED308489&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED308489 |title=The Literacy of Metalinguistic Awareness|date=1989|author=McAllister, Elizabeth|publisher=Eric.ed.gov|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Text in Education and Society'', some examples of metalinguistic skills include discussing, examining, thinking about language, grammar and reading comprehension. The text also states that a student's recognition or self-correction of language in verbal and written form helps them further advance their skills. The book also illustrates manners in which literature can form connections or create boundaries between educational intelligence and practical knowledge.

Gail T. Gillion wrote the book, ''Phonological Awareness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDWymkbfP30C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Metalinguistics+awareness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RiL7T5XJu2&amp;sig=wAewxCdualj97xznyWOgxhJshas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MImxS-zkOYaKNPWLvKME&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Metalinguistics%20awareness&amp;f=false |title=Phonological Awareness: From Research to Practice|author=Gail T. Gillon|date=2004 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which illustrates the connection between phonological awareness and metalinguistic awareness's in literacy learning. It essentially states that a student's ability to understand the spoken word and their ability to recognize a word and decode it are dependent on each other. The text also discusses ways in which students struggling with speech impairments and reading difficulties can improve their learning process.

==In linguistics==
[[Linguists]] use this term to designate activities associated with ''[[metalanguage]]'', a language composed of the entirety of words forming linguistic terminology (for example, [[syntax]], [[semantics]], [[phoneme]], [[lexeme]]... as well as terms in more current usage, such as word, sentence, letter, etc.) Metalinguistics is used to refer to the language, whether natural or formalized (as in [[logic]]), which is itself used to speak of language; to a language whose sole function is to describe a language.  The language itself must constitute the sole sphere of application for the entire vocabulary.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TMuhVO7LBdAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ots=YAATKdlPLa&amp;sig=W2K52EEyrK6GnmtQxQnAf3G0-BE#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=true |title=Metalinguistic Development |author=Jean Émile Gombert|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|date=1992|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Experts are undecided about the value of awareness of metalanguage to language learners, and some "schools of thought" in language learning have been heavily against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott|title=An A-Z of ELT (Methodology)|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|location=Oxford|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalinguistic awareness and bilingualism==
[[Metalinguistic awareness]]  refers to the understanding that language is a system of communication, bound to rules, and forms the basis for the ability to discuss different ways to use language (Baten, Hofman, &amp; Loeys, 2011). In other words, it is the ability to consciously analyze language and its sub-parts, to know how they operate and how they are incorporated into the wider language system (Beceren, 2010). An individual with such ability is aware that linguistic forms and structure can interact and be manipulated to produce a vast variety of meanings. Words are only arbitrarily and symbolically associated with their referents, and are separable from them. For example, a dog is named "Cat", but the word "Cat" is only a representation for the animal, dog. It does not make the dog a cat.

The term was first used by Harvard professor Courtney Cazden in 1974 to demonstrate the shift of linguistic intelligence  across languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{dubious|date=December 2014}} Metalinguistic awareness in [[bilingual]] learners is the ability to objectively function outside one language system and to objectify languages’ rules, structures and functions. [[Code-switching]] and translation are examples of bilinguals’ metalinguistic awareness. Metalinguistics awareness was used as a construct in research extensively in the mid 1980s and early 1990s.
 
Metalinguistic awareness is a theme that has frequently appeared in the study of bilingualism. It can be divided into four subcategories, namely phonological, word, syntactic and pragmatic awareness (Tunmer, Herriman, &amp; Nesdale, 1988). Amongst the four, phonological and word awareness are the two aspects of metalinguistic awareness that have garnered the greatest attention in bilingual literacy research. Research has shown metalinguistic awareness in bilinguals to be a crucial component because of its documented relationship and positive effects on language ability, symbolic development and literacy skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/jmora/moramodules/MetaLingResearch.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225082333/http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/jmora/moramodules/MetaLingResearch.htm|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many studies investigating the impact of bilingualism on phonological and word awareness have indicated a positive bilingual effect (Baten, et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2004; Goetz, 2003; Kang, 2010; Ransdell, Barbier, &amp; Niit, 2006; Whitehurst &amp; Lonigan, 1998). Bilinguals are simultaneously learning and switching between two languages, which may facilitate the development of stronger phonological awareness. It is postulated that bilinguals’ experiences of acquiring and maintaining two different languages aid them in developing an explicit and articulated understanding of how language works (Adesope, Lavin, Thompson, &amp; Ungerleider, 2010). Hence they are equipped with stronger metalinguistic awareness as compared to their monolingual counterparts.

In their book ''Literacy and Orality'',&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VKSIC5H8sd8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ots=roD1IxtB-e&amp;sig=oWlgDG1nC_elQbjBs9kxB_IZgbc#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=false |title=Literacy and Orality|author1=Olson, David R.|author2=Torrance, Nancy |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1991-07-26 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  scholars David R. Olson and Nancy Torrance explore the relationship between literacy and metalinguistic awareness, citing a link that arises from the fact that, in both reading and writing, language can become the object of thought and discussion.  Prose reading and writing can be an instrument of metalinguistic reflection and in those cases one must assess the particular meaning of terms and of grammatical relations between them in order, either to understand such texts or write them.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Mezquita]], [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]]]]
'''Moorish architecture''' is the [[articulation (architecture)|articulated]] [[Islamic architecture]] of North Africa and parts of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] ([[Al Andalus]]), where the Andalusians ([[Moors]]) were dominant between 711 and 1492. The best surviving examples are La [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] and the [[Alhambra]] palace in Granada (mainly 1338–1390),&lt;ref name="1curl"&gt;Curl p. 502.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Giralda]] in Seville (1184).&lt;ref name="pev1"&gt;Pevsner, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable examples include the ruined palace city of [[Medina Azahara]] (936–1010), the church (former mosque) San [[Cristo de la Luz]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the [[Aljafería]] in [[Saragossa]] and baths at for example [[Ronda]] and [[Alhama de Granada]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Paderne Castle 26 Nov 2007 (9).JPG|thumb|[[Paderne Castle]], Portugal]]
{{expand section|date=December 2016|Article should describe the key features (dates, styles, innovations...) of each of the buildings mentioned, with suitable citations}}

Characteristic elements of Moorish architecture include [[muqarnas]], [[horseshoe arch]]es, [[voussoir]]s, domes, crenellated arches, [[lancet arch]]es, [[ogee arch]]es, courtyards, and decorative tile work known as [[zellij]] in Arabic or [[azulejo]] in Spanish and Portuguese. The architectural tradition is exemplified by [[mosque]]s, fortifications, and other edifices such as the [[Mezquita]] in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] (784–987, in four phases); the [[Alhambra]] (mainly 1338–1390&lt;ref name="curl"&gt;Curl p.502&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Generalife]] (1302–9 and 1313–24) in [[Granada]] and the [[Giralda]] in [[Seville]] in 1184;&lt;ref name="Pev"&gt;Pevsner, Niklaus. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paderne Castle]] in the [[Algarve]], Portugal; the mosque of [[Koutoubia Mosque|Koutoubia]], [[Hassan II Mosque|Hassan Mosque]], [[Andalusian Mosque]], and [[University of Al-Karaouine]] in [[Morocco]]; the [[Great Mosque of Algiers]] and the [[Great Mosque of Tlemcen]] in [[Algeria]]; and the [[Mosque of Uqba]] in [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]]. Other notable buildings include the ruined palace city of [[Medina Azahara]] (936-1010), the church (former mosque) San [[Cristo de la Luz]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], the [[Aljafería]] in [[Zaragoza]] and baths at for example [[Ronda]] and [[Alhama de Granada]].

==History==
There is no proof for administration of Muslim personal law until 1206 in Indian peninsula, even though there were Muslim invasions during this period.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman"/&gt; During the reign of Slave dynasty  (1206-1290 A.D), Khalji dynasty (1290- 1321), the Tughlak dynasty (1321-1413), the Lodi dynasty (1451 - 1526) and the Sur dynasty (1539- 1555), the court of Shariat, assisted by the Mufti, dealt with the cases involving personal law among Muslims. During Sher Shah's regime, the powers of Shariat court were restricted and Muslim law was modified to suit the requirements of the times.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rahiman|first1=Abdul, K.K|title=History of the Evolution of Muslim Personal Law in India|url=http://www.dharmaramjournals.in/ArticleFiles/History%20of%20the%20Evolution%20of%20Muslim%20Personal%20Law--K.%20K.%20Abdul%20Rahiman.pdf|publisher=Journal of Dharma: Dharmaram Journal  of Religions and Philosophies|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the regime of [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal kings]] [[Babur]] and [[Humayun]], the earlier laws were followed, and the ''ulemas'' (religious scholars) had considerable influence on legal decisions. During Akhbar's regime, Ulemas' powers were significantly reduced and shattered the dominance of the orthodox Sunni school. During [[Jehangir]]'s regime, cutting of noses and ears and death penalty could not be inflicted without the permission of the Emperor. Aurangazeb ordered for the complication of code of law.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman" /&gt;

===Under East India Company===
Under the East India company, Muslim Law was enforced except when Muslims left the disputes to be determined according to Hindu ''Saastras''.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman" /&gt; The Regulation 11 of .1772 by Sec. 27 enacted that {{Quote
|text= "in all suits regarding inheritance, succession, marriage and caste and other religious usages or institutions, the laws of the Quran with respect of Mohamedan and those of the Shastras with respect to Gentoos (Hindus) shall be invariably adhered to."}}
In 1822, the Privy Council recognized the right of [[Shia]] Muslims to their own law.

===Under British India===
The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act was passed on 7 October 1937 in [[British India]] to ensure that Indians following Islamic faith shall be ruled according to their cultural norms.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt; This Act gave strength to the pre-existing customary laws, although it was in conflict with Islamic jurisprudence in several aspects.&lt;ref name="abdulrahiman" /&gt; This Act is still being followed in India in matters related to marriage, divorce and succession among Muslims.&lt;ref name="indianexpress1"/&gt;&lt;ref name= scroll&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniyal|first1=Shoaib|title=A short history of Muslim personal law in  India|url=https://scroll.in/article/849068/a-short-history-of-muslim-personal-law-in-india|website=Scroll.in|publisher=Scroll.in|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act was passed in 1939, in order to give Muslim women the right to seek divorce.

==Marriage and Divorce==
In India, Muslim marriage is a civil contract between a man and a woman. Dissolution of marriage can be done at the instance of the husband (''[[talaq]]''), wife (''[[khula]]'') or mutually (''[[mubarat]]''). Talaq allows Muslim men to legally divorce his wife by stating the word talaq (Arabic word for divorce) three times with 3 months period between all three, in oral. written and electronic form of talaq is not allowed in Islamic law.&lt;ref name= practicallaw&gt;{{cite web|title=Practical Law UK Signon|url=https://uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/6-581-5985?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;firstPage=true&amp;bhcp=1|website=uk.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com|publisher=Thompson Reuters|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim groups recognize [[Triple talaq in India|triple talaq]] (or talaq-i-biddat), stating three talaqs at once and proclaiming instant divorce as valid method of divorce.&lt;ref name="hanafi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hanafi jurisprudence sanctions triple talaq - Times of India|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/hanafi-jurisprudence-sanctions-triple-talaq/articleshow/60182584.cms|website=The Times of India|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 2017, the [[Supreme Court of India]] deemed instant triple talaq unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triple Talaq verdict: What exactly is instant divorce practice banned by court?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/triple-talaq-verdict-what-exactly-is-instant-divorce-practice-banned-by-court/story-mhQ1SbxnCUUgySQq82sdbJ.html|website=hindustantimes.com|publisher=Hindustan Times|accessdate=2 December 2017|language=en|date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Muslim groups follow ''talaq-i-hasan'', where the husband pronounces three talaqs on three separate instances, each one at least 1 lunar month apart. If the husband changes mind after the first or the second talaq, or cohabits with the wife, the divorce is revoked.&lt;ref name= practicallaw /&gt; In Islam, only husband can pronounce the talaq on his wife, and not vice versa. However, he can delegate this power to his wife or a third person by agreement, called talaq-e-tafweez.&lt;ref name= practicallaw /&gt; The Muslim man does not have to cite a reason for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court suspends 'triple talaq' divorce law|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/india-supreme-court-suspends-muslim-divorce-law-170822052829982.html|website=www.aljazeera.com|publisher=Al-Jazeera|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Section 5 of Shariat Act of 1937 concerns with Muslim women seeking dissolution of her marriage. Section 5 was subsequently deleted and replaced by Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act 1939. Muslim women can seek divorce at the court of law. A woman can ask for divorce in the following circumstances:
* if whereabouts of the husband has not been known for a period of four years
* if the husband has neglected or failed to provide for her maintenance for a period of two years
* if the husband has been sentenced to imprisonment for a period of seven years or upwards
* if the husband has failed to perform his marital obligations for a period of three years
* if the husband was impotent at the time of marriage and continues to do so
* if the husband has been insane for a period of two years or is suffering from leprosy or virulent venereal disease
* if the husband treats the wife with cruelty, even if such conduct does not amount to physical violence
* if the wife has been given in marriage by her father or guardian before she attained 15 years of age
* if the husband associates with women of evil repute or leads an infamous life or attempts to force her to lead an immoral life
* if the husband disposes of her property or prevents her exercising her legal rights over it
* if the husband obstructs her in the observance of her religious profession or practice
* if he has more wives than one, does not treat her equitably in accordance with the injunctions of the Quran; or
carries out any other ground recognised as valid for the dissolution of marriages under Muslim law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1458498/|website=indiankanoon.org|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inheritance==
===Rules of inheritance===
* A son gets double the share of the daughter wherever they inherit together.&lt;ref name="makaan" /&gt;
* The wife gets one-eighth of the share if there are children and one-fourth of the share if there are no children. In case the husband has more than one wife, the one-eighth share will be divided equally among all wives. The husband gets one fourth of the share of his dead wife's property,If there are children and one-half if there are no children &lt;ref&gt;mulla mohammaden law vol. 3&lt;/ref&gt;.
* If the parent has more than one daughter, only two-third of the property shall be divided equally among daughters. If the parent has only one daughter, half of the parent's property is inherited by her.
* The mother gets one-sixth of her dead child's property if there are grandchildren, and one-third of the property if there are no grandchildren.
* Parents, children, husband and wife must, in all cases, get shares, whatever may be the number or degree of the other heirs.
* Slavery, homicide, difference of religion and difference of allegiance, exclude from inheritance.

===Mahr===
[[Mahr]] is the total money or property that the husband is required to give the wife at the time of marriage ([[Nikah]]). There are two types of mahr, the prompt mahr which is given to the wife soon after the marriage, and the deferred mahr which is given to the wife when the marriage has ended, either due to the death of the husband or by divorce.&lt;ref name="makaan"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Muslim Woman's Right To Property In Islamic Law|url=https://www.makaan.com/iq/legal-taxes-laws/examining-a-muslim-womans-right-to-property|publisher=Makaan|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Will===
A Muslim can only give one third of his/her total property through a will ([[Wasiyat]]).&lt;ref name="makaan" /&gt;

===Gift===
Any type of property can be given as gift by a Muslim.&lt;ref name="makaan" /&gt;

Operation Icarus was launched in 2013 by West Mercia Police (WMP) following the recovery by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] (MPS) of several stolen religious artefacts. The MPS had received information from [[HM Revenue and Customs]] relating to the illegal importation of a gorilla's head by an art collector in [[South London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rare artefacts fall prey to mystery church raider|first=Steven|last=Morris|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=21 May 2015|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When police confronted the collector they also found two 15th century decorative oak panels and a 13th-century stone memorial.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; The oak panels, depicting [[Victor of Marseilles|St Victor of Marseille]] and [[Margaret the Virgin|St Margaret of Antioch]], were identified as priceless parts of a [[medieval]] [[rood screen]] from Holy Trinity Church, [[Torbryan]], [[Devon]], and had been stolen in August 2013.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Priceless Medieval panels 'hacked' from Torbryan Church have been recovered by police|url=http://www.torquayheraldexpress.co.uk/Priceless-Medieval-panels-hacked-Torbrayn-Church/story-26553642-detail/story.html|first=Ginny|last=Ware|date=22 May 2015|work=[[Herald Express]]|location=Torquay|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifteenth-century icons stolen from Devon church|first=Maev|last=Kennedy|date=13 August 2013|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/aug/13/15th-century-icons-stolen-devon-church|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone was identified as a "heart stone" which had marked the place where the [[Bishop of Hereford]] [[John de Breton]]'s heart was interred in the wall of [[Dore Abbey]], [[Golden Valley (Herefordshire)|Golden Valley]], [[Herefordshire]].&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; It had been stolen in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church effigies targeted by gangs who steal them to order and smuggle artefacts abroad|first=Kerry|last=McDermott|date=11 September 2012|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2201586/Church-effigies-targeted-gangs-steal-order-smuggle-artefacts-abroad.html|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the force responsible for Herefordshire, WMP took over and interviewed the collector, widening the investigation to include art dealers and internet sales. The operation discovered that "for at least six years, and more likely for a decade, a person — or persons — had been targeting remote, often unlocked, churches and stripping them of precious artefacts."&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; Searching [[eBay]], police discovered at least one stolen artefact for sale on the internet auction site: a 14th-century stone carving depicting the head of Robert de Wakering, stolen from All Saints Church, [[Newland, Gloucestershire]], in 2012.&lt;ref name="gloucester"&gt;{{cite news|title=Church's stolen statue head found on eBay after two years and returned to Forest of Dean|work=[[Gloucester Citizen]]|location=Gloucester|date=9 June 2015|url=http://www.gloucestercitizen.co.uk/Church-s-stolen-statue-head-ebay-years-returned/story-26663015-detail/story.html|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detective Sergeant Andy Bennett said that while some thieves are "taking pot luck and taking whatever they can steal" others are stealing specific items to order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Theft-to-order threat to historic church treasures|first=John|last=Bingham|date=1 May 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11641729/Theft-to-order-threat-to-historic-church-treasures.html|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DI Barnes said that art dealers purchasing stolen artefacts "were not doing enough to ensure that objects were on the market legitimately.... Our general consensus is that their records are woefully inadequate. They say they comply with the law and they probably do — just — but do they turn a blind eye? I would say, yes they do."&lt;ref name=hallett/&gt;

'''Orenda''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔːr|ɛ|n|d|ə}} is an [[Iroquois]] name for a spiritual power inherent in people and their [[Natural environment|environment]].{{sfn|Hewitt|1902}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=orenda|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/orenda|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities of nature were seen to be a "ceaseless struggle of one orenda against another, uttered and directed by the beings or bodies" in the environment.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=41}} Orenda was deemed a motive force behind miracles, soothsaying, divination, prophecy, blessing, cursing, prayer, worship, and superstitions.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=42}} Orenda is not a collective power and does not have a personification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=nature worship|date=2015|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://original.search.eb.com/eb/article-38271|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteenth- and 20th-century scholars compared the concept of orenda to that of [[mana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=mana|date=2015|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=Web|url=http://original.search.eb.com/eb/article-9050428|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Herbert Jennings|title=Nvmen and Mana|journal=Harvard Theological Review|date=1951|volume=44|issue=3|pages=109–120|doi=10.1017/s0017816000027760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist J. N. B. Hewitt notes intrinsic similarities between the Iroquoian concept of Orenda and that of the [[Sioux]]an wakd or mahopa; the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] manitowi, and the pokunt of the [[Shoshone]]. Across the Iroquois tribes, the concept was referred to variously as orenna or karenna by the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Oneida people|Oneida]]; urente by the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], and iarenda or orenda by the Huron. A related term, otgon, denoted a specifically "malign, deadly, lethal, or destructive use" of orenda.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=37}} Hewitt notes that orenda was regarded by Iroquoian peoples as distinct from concepts of life, soul, ghost, and mind.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=44}}

For the Iroquois, a shaman was considered to be "one whose orenda is great, powerful", while a hunter's orenda determined whether he was successful in overcoming the orenda of the game, and in conflicts between nations, orenda determined the outcome.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=38}} Orenda was also present in nature: storms were said to possess orenda. A strong connection existed between prayers and songs and orenda: through song, a bird, shaman, or rabbit put forth orenda.{{sfn|Hewitt|1902|p=40-43}}

'''Ponce Creole''' is an [[architectural style]] created in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]], in the late 19th and early 20th century.  This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of the French, the Spaniards, and the Caribbean to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico’s [[Caribbean Sea]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MjXG2vg5YFsC&amp;pg=PA225 Puerto Rico. By Randall Peffer. Page 225.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from [[Classical revival]] and [[Spanish Revival]] to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/traveler/articles/1056puerto_rico.html National Geographic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302194306/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/traveler/articles/1056puerto_rico.html |date=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The [[Ponce Historic Zone|central district of Ponce]] in particular is a blend of Ponce Creole and [[Art Deco]]: "The Historic District of Ponce: Second only to Old San Juan in terms of historical significance, the central district of Ponce is a blend of Ponce Creole and Art Deco building styles, dating mainly from the 1890s to the 1930s. One street, Calle Isabel, offers an array of Ponceño architectural styles, which often incorporate [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] details. The city underwent a massive restoration preceding the celebration of its 300th anniversary in 1996."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frommers.com/destinations/puertorico/0094023568.html ''Puerto Rico: The Best Attractions.'' Frommer’s.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Architectural structures of the Ponce Creole style are amongst the 1,046 buildings being restored in Ponce: "The commonwealth has allocated $440 million to restore a 66-block downtown area of 1,046 buildings ranging in style from old Spanish colonial to neoclassical, from "Ponce Créole" to Art Deco. Many of Ponce's central buildings were erected between the late 1890s and the 1930s, when the city was the hub of the island's rum, sugar cane and shipping industries and was known as La Perla del Sur, the 'Pearl of the South.' It was home to many artists, politicians, and poets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuertorico.org/culture/architec.shtml ''Architecture.'' Welcome to Puerto Rico.]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, three styles dominate the architectural landscape in Ponce: [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], Ponce Creole, and [[Art Deco]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rCsUml9xc3kC&amp;pg=PA496 Frommer's Caribbean 2008. By Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince. Page 496.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Ponce Creole is the name given to the architectural style that is unique to Ponce only: "San Juan, the capital, was planned and built by the Spanish conquerors, one writer points out, while Ponce is the work of its native sons, making it a truly authentic Puerto Rican city."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1991/7/1991_7_30.shtml  ''The Pearl of the South.'' American Heritage Magazine.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The Ponce Creole style is characterized by wood and stucco buildings with broad columned porches and balconies and painted in the tasty pinks, peaches, and limes common to hot countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1991/7/1991_7_30.shtml  ''The Pearl of the South.'' American Heritage Magazine.]&lt;/ref&gt; The style is a blend of Spanish Creole and neoclassical architecture: "In the late 19th century, Ponce developed its own blend of Spanish Creole and neoclassical architecture called Ponce Creole; it's characterized by the use of Corinthian columns, wrought-iron balconies, and gas lamps. It was dubbed Creole because it reminded some of New Orleans's French Quarter. Wealth from Ponce's sugarcane industry financed most of the elegantly ornamented buildings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-13540430/admiring-architecture-old-puerto.html ''Admiring architecture in old Puerto Rico''. Sunset. 1 February 1993. By Lora J. Finnegan.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other prominent characteristcis of this architectural style have been described by Pablo Ojeda O'Neill as "a long raised porch, stone rostrium-raised homes to achieve ventilation and to protect the wood foundation, a series of front doors with wooden windows to maximize ventilation."&lt;ref&gt;Neysa Rodriguez Deynes, et al. ''Breviario sobre la Historia de Ponce y sus Principales Lugares de Interes. San Juan, PR: Model Offset Printing. 1991. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their classic study about Ponce architecture, Reed and Torres identified the Ponce Creole style as "a one-storyed residential masonry dwelling with front [[lintel]] doors and side gate, garage with interior ceiling arches, interior walls with wall guards, porch and garage ironwork in wrought-iron, multiple front double doors with four sets of wooden blinds each, porch with simple wooden columns with crowns in the classical tradition, simple door frames, and porch roof of wood and zinc."&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Torres, et. al. ''Un Estudio de la Zona Histórica y el Area Central de la Ciudad de Ponce, para la Junta de Planificacion de Puerto Rico y el Municipio de Ponce.'' c. 1965. Pages 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Socorro Giron. ''Ponce, el teatro La Perla y La Campana de la Almudaina.'' 1992. p.481.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmelo Rosario Natal.

==Architects responsible==
[[File:Blas C. Silva Boucher, ingeniero de Ponce, PR, cerca 1909 (32B).jpg|thumb|left|Blas Silva, the most prominent of Ponce Creole architects]]
While Ponce had many prominent architects during this period, such as [[Manuel V. Domenech]], [[Francisco Porrata-Doría]], and [[Alfredo Wiechers Pieretti|Alfredo B. Wiechers]], it was [[Blas Silva]] who distinguished himself in that he actually ''created'' a whole new architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Felix Juan del Campo, State Historian; and Hector F. Santiago, State Architectural Historian, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) August, 1987.  In ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form''. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.) Page 3. Listing Reference Number 87001826: Residencia Subira/Residencia Frau. 29 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adapting the curves of the [[Art Nouveau]] to the persistent [[Neo-classicism]] of Puerto Rico, Silva succeeded in creating a movement in architecture which broke away from the traditional forms while remaining within them. The traditional continuous raised [[verandah]] along the front facade is broken up into two and twisted out of its usual linearity into the curved forms preserved today. Characteristic of the architecture to abound in Ponce contemporaneous to Castillo 34, for example, is a profusion of aplique, and [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] combination and juxtaposition of shapes, particularly [[curvilinear]], and a general ostentation of articulation. The structure at 34 Castillo Street is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Felix Juan del Campo, State Historian; and Hector F. Santiago, State Architectural Historian, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office. (San Juan, Puerto Rico) August, 1987.  In ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form''. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.) Page 3. Listing Reference Number 87001825: Residencia Font-Ubides. 29 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blas Silva was probably the most established of the "wedding-cake architects" and was thus sought after mostly by the "nouveau riche" of the period. Silva's houses are among the richest in Ponce, among which the [[Font-Ubides House]] (a.k.a. Monsanto Residence) stands out for its circular porches. Other buildings by Blas Silva include the [[Frau Residence]] and the [[Museo de la Historia de Ponce|Salazar-Candal Residence]], both also listed in the [[NRHP]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G. Coronas Castro, Certifying Official; Felix Juan del Campo, State Historian; and Hector F. Santiago, State Architectural Historian, Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office.

Page 3. Listing Reference Number 87001825: Residencia Font-Ubides. 29 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Blas Silva, at least 10 other architects designed in the Ponce Creole style: Herminio Valls, Francisco Valls, Eduardo Salichs, [[Alfredo Wiechers]], Adolfo Nones, Francisco Grevi,{{efn|Francisco Grevi was a master builder who implemented Ponce Creole concepts in his buildings.

Calle Cristina number 70, commissioned by [[Ermelindo Salazar]] and subsequently home to the [[Museum of Puerto Rican Music]] and currently headquarters of the [[Centro Cultural de Ponce Carmen Solá de Pereira]], is another example of Ponce Creole architecture.

=== Reina 107===
[[File:IMG 2911 - Subira Residence in Barrio Segundo in Ponce, PR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Residencia Subirá|Frau Residence]] (by [[Blas Silva]]) at Reina 107]]
The [[Residencia Subirá|Frau Residence]] at Calle Reina number 107 is a magnificent example of the architecture of Ponce's [[aristocracy]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. "This structure is one of the remaining symbols of Ponce's "Golden Period" in which land-owning families lived in the urban core and great immigrations from Europe, Latin America and the other Antilles had turned the originally small settlement into the cultural capital of Puerto Rico. The "Criollo Ponceno" or Ponce Creole architecture to which this building belongs is extremely important in itself since it represents the birth of a high-style native architecture, a hybrid of influences rather than the purely Spanish, or spontaneous vernacular expressions of previous centuries. In particular, the Frau Residence is significant within this genre as it was designed by one of Ponce's most well-known architects, Blas Silva. Silva was particularly well known among the wealthy classes of the period. His buildings can usually be characterized by what is popularly referred to as ''wedding-cake architecture'' of the landed nouyeau riche, for the richness of ornament and detail. Other buildings by Silva include the Monsanto Residence and the Salazar-Candal Residence, both listed in the NRHP."&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G.

[[File:IMG 2901 - Salazar-Candal Residence in Barrio Tercero in Ponce, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Casa Salazar-Candal|Salazar-Candal Residence]] (by Blas Silva) at Calle Isabel 53]]
The [[Casa Salazar-Candal|Salazar-Candal Residence]] located at Calle Isabel 53, but today occupied by the [[Museo de la Historia de Ponce]] is one of a group of stylistically eclectic houses built in Ponce between 1900 and 1915. Designed by architect Blas C. Silva in 1911, the building reflects an emerging tendency to incorporate freely disparate and competing architectural motifs. The facade is distinctly rendered in [[rococo]] and [[Moorish]] detailing to emphasize its bi-functional character as a home and an office respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G.

===Marina 27===
The "fin de siecle" detailing and wall paintings present a material document of the 19th-century European immigration to Puerto Rico and the way of life of the landed bourgeois Criollo (Creole) class. In the architecture of Ponce of the period, elements of the Puerto Rican folk dwelling are integrated to Spanish and French-influenced classical detailing, thus resulting in a Ponce-Creole Architecture, of which the [[Zaldo de Nebot Residence]] at Calle Marina #27 is a prime example.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano G.

The '''privileged positions of business and science''' refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic, political, and technosocial affairs. Businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society, essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop. Scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge and the ability to pursue the technological innovations they want. They proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations.

== Privileged position of business ==

Businesses have considerable power in decision-making processes in business-oriented societies. High level executives make discrete decisions about technological innovation without regard to consequences. Political scientist Edward Woodhouse states that businesses make key economic decisions that include creating jobs, choosing industrial plant and equipment, and deciding which new products to develop and market.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, businesses hold a privileged position related to politics in the sense that they are capable of considerable influence over key public choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership role that business has in the economy gives executives of large corporations an unusual kind of degree of influence over governmental policy making.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government officials have incentives to carry out businesses' demands. They know that failure of businesses to maintain high employment will upset voters more quickly than anything else.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Our economy functions as a chain effect. Businesses that get what they want provide plentiful jobs and stimulate cash flow in the economy. As a result, citizens are happy, and this happiness translates to more trust and faith in the government party. Government officials thus have a higher chance of reelection.

It is clear that the businesses have the most influence in this chain effect. If a business fails, jobs are lost, citizens are unhappy, and the government party loses trust and their chance of reelection. One example of this was President Bush’s plummeting popularity and resulting defeat by Bill Clinton.&lt;ref name="Lindblom_91"/&gt; Therefore, it would make sense for government officials to reach out to these executives and provide valuable resources to benefit both parties. Power is shifted from government officials to business executives, because these executives have the ability to influence government officials to meet their demands. As a result, a large category of decisions is turned over to businessmen, and taken off the agenda of government. In a way, business managers become the public officials they represent.

This privilege of power is unique to corporations only. If workers want reform on unfair working conditions or pay, they must form a worker’s union. However, a worker’s union has considerably less influence than a corporation. As opposed to workers’ unions, businesses exercise more control on governmental policy making because workers are expendable – workers need money more urgently than society needs their services, so a business can operate for a lot longer than workers can afford to stay off the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lindblom|Woodhouse|1993|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Privileged position of science ==

Without the knowledge of scientists and technologists, there would be no possibility of producing new technology and progress in a positive manner. Those who have these types of  knowledge and abilities are essentially the "seed" of technological innovation. They have the following three privileges:

*Knowledge
*Learning and teaching of new knowledge 
*Political implications of innovation

Based on previous scientific knowledge, one or several are able to use it and/or build on it to innovate. Kleinman and Vallas, point out that scientists control the modification, mediation and contest of emerging knowledge.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this knowledge can also teach future generations the same to keep this process moving forward. Woodhouse that states that engineers are among the top professionals that promote the new innovations without consequences.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the foundation of the privileged position of science, that only a select have scientific and/or technological knowledge and capable of substantial feats, good or bad. Engineers and scientists have the powerful position of being able to choose the path of innovation for emerging technology. Technologists and scientists hold a privileged position additionally in that their innovations often have political implications. Woodhouse makes the comparison of innovation to legislative acts, stating that they both establish a framework that will follow for many generations.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_1997"/&gt;

== Relationships between privileged positions of business and science ==

Business and science are part of an important societal circle specifically relating to the production and implementation of technology. In simple terms, scientists and technologists design and create, while businesses provide the means to create, produce and implement. As Woodhouse claims, it would be a mistake to overlook business executives' and elected officials' dependence on the technologists because innovation is so highly regarded.&lt;ref name="Woodhouse_153"/&gt;

Businesses that rely on scientists and technologists cannot function without them, but have authority over them. Woodhouse claims that the one reason green technology has not emerged faster and stronger is because the brown chemistry formula fulfilled many of the needs of scientists and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, since brown chemistry was innovated over less toxic and recyclable green technologies, it is shown that business has more authority over that of technologists and scientists. Woodhouse points out that there has been considerable delay on a promising area of green chemistry: supercritical fluids. The opinions range from targeting the culprit as the complexity of the equipment, to maintenance difficulties, to the equipment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of the interconnection of business and science, and how technology can be slowed by technology and/or business (and vice versa). Woodhouse also states that twentieth-century chemists, chemical engineers, and chemical industry executives made central decisions which considerably modeled society's experiences with chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical industry, which includes scientists, technologists, and businessmen, uniquely controls what happens or what can happen to large number of people who are exposed to chemicals.

Business and science are considered of utmost importance in current developed countries. However, one working without the other has the potential to cause major issues. Woodhouse points out what the vice president of Shaw Carpets explained at a congressional hearing: that the V.P. is the person whose job it is to tell the chemists and chemical engineers that it is possible to produce carpets using "green" processes, because the students had not learned this from their respective university curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Woodhouse|2006|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; There can be many positive outcomes of the unison operation of business and science, and it is vital that this does occur in order to prevent major problems and unintended consequences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22683">'''Reciprocal teaching''' is an instructional activity that takes the form of a dialogue between teachers and students regarding segments of text for the purpose of constructing the meaning of text. Reciprocal teaching is a reading technique which is thought to promote students' reading comprehension.  A reciprocal approach provides students with four specific reading strategies that are actively and consciously used to support comprehension: Questioning, Clarifying, Summarizing, and Predicting. Palincsar (1986) believes the purpose of reciprocal teaching is to facilitate a group effort between teacher and students as well as among students in the task of bringing meaning to the text.&lt;ref&gt;Palincsar, A.S. (1986). Reciprocal teaching. In Teaching reading as thinking. Oak Brook, IL: North Central Regional Educational Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reciprocal teaching is best represented as a dialogue between teachers and students in which participants take turns assuming the role of teacher.&lt;ref&gt;DeVillar, R. A., &amp; Faltis, C. (1991). Organizing the classroom for communication and learning. ''Computers and cultural diversity: Restructuring for school success'' (p. 9). Albany: State University of New York Press.&lt;/ref&gt; -Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reciprocal teaching is most effective in the context of small-group collaborative investigation, which is maintained by the teacher or reading tutor.

== Conceptual underpinnings ==
The concept of reciprocal teaching was first developed by Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar and Ann L. Brown in 1986 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stricklin|first=Kelly|title=Hands-On Reciprocal Teaching: A Comprehension Technique|journal=The Reading Teacher|year=2011|volume=64|issue=8|doi=10.1598/RT.64.8.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As previously mentioned, reciprocal teaching was developed as a technique to help teachers bridge the gap for students who demonstrated a discrepancy between [[phonics|decoding]] skills and [[reading comprehension|comprehension]] skills (Palincsar, Ransom, &amp; Derber, 1989). That is, the process is aimed at aiding students who possess grade-level skills in letter-sound correspondence ("sounding out" words and "chunking"), but are unable to construct meaning from the texts they decode. Reciprocal teaching utilizes the strategy of prediction, whereby students predict before reading, and then use those predictions during reading to check if they are correct (Stricklin, 2011). 

Reciprocal teaching is made up of four components: predicting, clarifying, questioning, and comprehension. In 2005, [http://www.reading.org/General/Publications/Books/bk507.aspx Oczkus] coined the phrase the "fab four" to describe the processes involved with reciprocal teaching (Stricklin, 2011). Students then move on to clarifying things they do not understand by asking the instructor questions, or having the teacher ask questions during reading, in order to clarify difficult sections of text or point out areas where students should pay particular attention. After the text is read, questions are asked of a student or group of students to enhance retention and check how much was learned. Finally, comprehension is achieved by engaging the students in a summary of either a page or the entire text selection of what they just read (Stricklin, 2011). The teacher supports the students by rephrasing or elaborating on their answers, statements, and questions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenshine, B. &amp; Meister, C. (1994). Reciprocal Teaching: A review of the research. ''Review of Educational Research. 64''(4)479-530.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of reading strategies ==
Reciprocal teaching is an amalgamation of reading strategies that effective readers are thought to use. As stated by Pilonieta and Medina in their article  "Reciprocal Teaching for the Primary Grades: We Can Do It, Too!", previous research conducted by Kincade and Beach (1996) indicates that proficient readers use specific comprehension strategies in their reading tasks, while poor readers do not (Pilonieta &amp; Medina, 2009). Proficient readers have well-practiced decoding and comprehension skills which allow them to proceed through texts somewhat automatically until some sort of triggering event alerts them to a comprehension failure (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984).

This trigger can be anything from an unacceptable accumulation of unknown concepts to an expectation that has not been fulfilled by the text. Whatever the trigger, proficient readers react to a comprehension breakdown by using a number of strategies in a planned, deliberate manner. These "fix-up" strategies range from simply slowing down the rate of reading or decoding, to re-reading, to consciously summarizing the material. Once the strategy (or strategies) has helped to restore meaning in the text, the successful reader can proceed again without conscious use of the strategy (Palincsar &amp; Brown).

All readers—no matter how skilled—occasionally reach cognitive failure when reading texts that are challenging, unfamiliar, or "inconsiderate"—i.e. structured or written in an unusual manner (Garner, 1992; Wade, 2001).  Poor readers, on the other hand, do not demonstrate the same reaction when comprehension failure occurs. Some simply do not recognize the triggers that signal comprehension breakdown. Others are conscious that they do not understand the text, but do not have or are unable to employ strategies that help. Some use maladaptive strategies (such as avoidance) that do not aid in comprehension (Garner, 1992).  Mayer notes in his paper on Learning Strategies that reciprocal teaching can help even novice learners become more adept at utilizing learning strategies and furthering their understanding of a subject (1996). Mayer also notes that the reciprocal teaching process gives the students the chance to learn more by having the teachers as role models, and that the reciprocal teaching process gives beginners in an academic field a chance to learn from the experts by taking turns leading the class (Mayer, 1996).

== Reciprocal teaching strategies ==
Approaching the problem from the perspective of Cognitive Strategy Instruction (Slater &amp; Horstman, 2002), reciprocal teaching attempts to train students in specific and discrete strategies to prevent cognitive failure during reading. Palincsar and Brown (1984) identified four basic strategies that may help students recognize and react to signs of comprehension breakdown: Questioning, Clarifying, Summarizing, and Predicting. These strategies serve dual purposes of being both comprehension-fostering and comprehension-monitoring; that is, they are thought to enhance comprehension while at the same time affording students the opportunity to check whether it is occurring. The leader follows these four steps in this specific order:

=== Predicting ===
The prediction phase involves readers in actively combining their own background knowledge with what they have gathered from the text. With a narrative text students imagine what might happen next. With an informational text, students predict what they might learn or read about in subsequent passages.

Predicting involves combining the reader’s prior knowledge, new knowledge from the text, and the text’s structure to create hypotheses related to the direction of the text and the author’s intent in writing. Predicting provides an overall rationale for reading – to confirm or disconfirm self-generated hypotheses (Doolittle et al., 2006).

The ''Predictor'' can offer predictions about what the author will tell the group next or, if it's a literary selection, the predictor might suggest what the next events in the story will be. As Williams points out, predictions don't necessarily need to be accurate, but they need to be clear (2011). 

The sequence of reading, questioning, clarifying, summarizing, and predicting is then repeated with subsequent sections of text.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, W. H., &amp; Horstman, F. R. (2002). Teaching reading and writing to struggling middle school and high school students: The case for reciprocal teaching. ''Preventing School Failure'', 46(4), 163.&lt;/ref&gt;
Different reading strategies have been incorporated into the reciprocal teaching format by other practitioners. Some other reading strategies include visualizing, making connections, inferencing, and questioning the author.

=== Questioning ===
When using the questioning strategy, readers monitor and assess their own understanding of the text by asking themselves questions. This self-awareness of one's own internal thought process is termed "[[metacognition]]."

Questioning involves the identification of information, themes, and ideas that are central and important enough to warrant further consideration. The central or important information, themes, or ideas are used to generate questions that are then used as self-tests for the reader. Questioning provides a context for exploring the text more deeply and assuring the construction of meaning (Doolittle, Hicks, Triplett, Nichols, &amp; Young, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Doolittle, P.E., Hicks,D., Triplett, C.F., Nichols,W.D., &amp; Young, C.A. (2006). Reciprocal teaching for reading comprehension in higher education: A strategy for fostering the deeper understanding of texts. International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education. 17(2), 106-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Questioner'' will pose questions about the selection:
* Unclear parts
* Puzzling information
* Connections to other concepts already learned

=== Clarifying ===
The clarification strategy focuses on training students in specific steps to help with decoding (letter-sound correspondence, "[[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]," spelling, etc.), as well as fix-up strategies to deal with difficult vocabulary and lapses in concentration.

Clarifying involves the identification and clarification of unclear, difficult, or unfamiliar aspects of a text. These aspects may include awkward sentence or passage structure, unfamiliar vocabulary, unclear references, or obscure concepts. Clarifying provides the motivation to remediate confusion through re-reading, the use of context in which the text was written and/or read, and the use of external resources (e.g., dictionary or thesaurus) (Doolittle et al., 2006).

The ''Clarifier'' will address confusing parts and attempt to answer the questions that were just posed.

=== Summarizing ===
Summarization requires the reader to perform the task of discriminating between important and less-important information in the text. It must then be organized into a coherent whole (Palincsar &amp; Brown, 1984).

Summarizing is the process of identifying the important information, themes, and ideas within a text and integrating these into a clear and concise statement that communicates the essential meaning of the text. Summarizing may be based on a single paragraph, a section of text, or an entire passage. Summarizing provides the impetus to create a context for understanding the specifics of a text (Doolittle et al., 2006).

The ''Summarizer'' will use his/her own words to tell the main idea of the text. This can happen anywhere in the story, and it should happen often for those students who are at-risk. It can happen first at sentence level, then paragraphs, then to whole text.

== Instructional format ==
Reciprocal teaching follows a dialogic/dialectic process. Palincsar, Ransom, and Derber (1989) wrote that there were two reasons for choosing dialogue as the medium. First, it is a language format with which children are familiar (as opposed to writing, which may be too difficult for some struggling readers). Second, dialogue provides a useful vehicle for alternating control between teacher and students in a systematic and purposeful manner.

Reciprocal teaching illustrates a number of unique ideas for teaching and learning and is based on both developmental and cognitive theories.  The strategies embedded in reciprocal teaching represent those that successful learners engage in while interacting with text.  They are thought to encourage self-regulation and self-monitoring and promote intentional learning (Brown, 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A. L. (1980). Metacognitive development and reading. In R. S. Spiro, B. B. Bruce, &amp; W. L. Brewer (Eds.), Theoretical issues in reading comprehension. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;

Reciprocal teaching also follows a very scaffolded curve, beginning with high levels of teacher instruction, modeling, and input, which is gradually withdrawn to the point that students are able to use the strategies independently. Reciprocal teaching begins with the students and teacher reading a short piece of text together. In the beginning stages, the teacher models the "Fab Four" strategies required by reciprocal teaching, and teacher and students share in conversation to come to a mutual agreement about the text (Williams, 2011). The teacher then specifically and explicitly models his or her thinking processes out loud, using each of the four reading strategies. Students follow the teacher's model with their own strategies, also verbalizing their thought processes for the other students to hear.

Over time, the teacher models less and less frequently as students become more adept and confident with the strategies. Eventually, responsibility for leading the small-group discussions of the text and the strategies is handed over to the students. This gives the teacher or reading tutor the opportunity to diagnose strengths, weaknesses, misconceptions, and to provide follow-up as needed.

Reciprocal teaching encompasses several techniques involving the who, what, and where, of learning (Mayer, 475-476):&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E. (2008). Learning and instruction. (2 ed.) Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What is learned are cognitive strategies for reading comprehension rather than specific facts and procedures. The teaching focuses on how to learn rather than what to learn.
* Learning of the cognitive strategies occurs within real reading comprehension tasks rather than having each strategy taught in isolation. Learning takes place in an order, rather than learning everything separately.
* Students learn as apprentices within a cooperative learning group that is working together on a task. The students are learning through themselves, and through the others in their group.

== Current uses ==
The reciprocal teaching model has been in use for the past 20 years (Williams, 2011) and has been adopted by a number of school districts and reading intervention programs across the United States and Canada. It has also been used as the model for a number of commercially produced reading programs such as Soar to Success, Connectors, Into Connectors
. Unfortunately, according to Williams, most students and teachers in this country have "never even heard of it" (2011).  Available from Global Ed in New Zealand, written by Jill Eggleton is the Connectors and Into Connectors Series.  These two series have both non fiction and fiction text. (2015) Abrams Learning Trends publishers ''Key Links Peer Readers'' by Jill Eggleton (2016)

Reciprocal teaching is also being adopted and researched in countries other than the United States. For example, Yu-Fen Yang of Taiwan conducted a study to develop a reciprocal teaching/learning strategy in remedial English reading classes (2010). Yang's study concluded that 
"...students expressed that they observed and learned from the teacher’s or their peers’ externalization of strategy usage. Students’ reading progress in the remedial instruction incorporating the RT system was also identified by the pre- and post-tests. This study suggests that there may be benefits for teachers in encouraging students to interact with others in order to clarify and discuss comprehension questions and constantly monitor and regulate their own reading" (2010).

In a 2008 study presented effective implementation of reciprocal teaching to students diagnosed with mild to moderate forms of disability. Within this group, ten percent of students had difficulty in learning due to Down Syndrome. The average of the participants was around eighteen years of age. The researchers, Miriam Alfassi, Itzhak Weiss, and Hefziba Lifshitz, developed a study based on Palincsar and Brown's design of reciprocal teaching for students who were considered academically too low for the complex skills of reading comprehension. The study compared two styles of teaching, remediation/direct instruction to Palincsar/Brown reciprocal teaching. After twelve weeks of instruction and assessments, reciprocal teaching was found to produce a greater success rate in improving the literacy skills in the participants with mild to moderate learning disabilities. After the study was completed, researchers recommended reciprocal teaching so that students are taught in an interactive environment that includes meaningful and connected texts. This research for the European Journal of Special Needs Education, promotes reciprocal teaching for its structure in dialogues and how students learn to apply those dialogues based on the reading taking place in instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Alfassi,Miriam; Weiss,Itzhak; Lifshitz,Hefziba. (2008) The efficacy of reciprocal teaching in fostering the reading literacy of students with intellectual disabilities. Oxford: Routledge Taylor &amp; Frances Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in the United States research has also been conducted on the use of reciprocal teaching in primary grades. Pilonieta and Medina conducted a series of procedures to implement their version of reciprocal teaching in elementary school students (2009). The researchers adopted an age-appropriate model for reciprocal teaching and called it "Reciprocal Teaching for the Primary Grades," or RTPG (2009). Their research shows that even in younger children, reciprocal teaching apparently benefited the students and they showed retention of the RTPG when re-tested 6 months later (2009).

Reciprocal teaching has been heralded as effective in helping students improve their reading ability in pre-post trials or research studies (Pearson &amp; Doyle, 1987; Pressley et al., 1987)&lt;ref&gt;Carter, C. (1997). Why reciprocal teaching? ''Educational Leadership. 54''64.&lt;/ref&gt; Further trials employing Reciprocal Teaching have consistently indicated the technique promotes reading comprehension as measured on standardized reading tests (Carter, 1997).

== Vygotsky connection ==
In "Thought and Language" [[Lev Vygotsky]] limns the profound connection between (oral) language,cognition and learning. Refer to ''Learning by Teaching'' for additional evidence. The intensive oral language component in Reciprocal Teaching is Vygotskian.

Reciprocal Teaching is a contemporary application of Vygotsky's theories; it is used to improve students' ability to learn from text.  In this method, teacher and students collaborate in learning and practicing four key skills: summarizing, questioning, clarifying, and predicting.  The teacher's role in the process is reduced over time.  Also, reciprocal teaching is relevant to instructional concepts such as "scaffolding" and "apprenticeship", in which a teacher or more advanced peer helps to structure or arrange a task so that a novice can work on it successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Mcleod, S. A. (2007). Simply Psychology; Vygotsky. Retrieved 6 December 2011, from http://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of this instructional method was influenced primarily by the work of Vygotsky and his notion of a “zone of proximal development,” which he characterized as “the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers” (Vygotsky, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;86).&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky. L. S. (1978). Mind in society: The development of the higher psychological processes. Cambridge, MA: The Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The assistance provided the learner is a good example of scaffolding in that both temporary and adjusted support is provided, according to the needs of the participants.  The assistance is withdrawn when it is no longer needed.  The sequence of teacher modeling, coaching, and then fading also provides an excellent example of the structure of a cognitive apprenticeship as outlined by Collins, Brown, and Newman (1989).&lt;ref&gt;Collins, A., Brown, J. S., &amp; Newman, S. (1989). Cognitive apprenticeship: Teaching the craft of reading, writing, and mathematics. In L. Resnick (Ed.), Knowing, learning and instruction: Essays in honor of Robert Glaserm, 453-494.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22627">A musical line which is the reverse of a previously or simultaneously stated line is said to be its '''retrograde''' or '''cancrizans''' ("walking backward", medieval Latin, from ''cancer'', crab). An exact retrograde includes both the pitches and rhythms in reverse. An even more exact retrograde reverses the physical contour of the notes themselves, though this is possible only in [[electronic music]]. Some composers choose to subject just the pitches of a musical line to retrograde, or just the rhythms. In [[twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone music]], reversal of the [[pitch class]]es alone—regardless of the [[Pitch contour|melodic contour]] created by their [[Register (music)|registral placement]]—is regarded as a retrograde.

=== In treatises ===
Retrograde was not mentioned in theoretical treatises prior to 1500.&lt;ref name="Newes, p. 218"&gt;Newes, p.&amp;nbsp;218.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicola Vicentino]] (1555) discussed the difficulty in finding canonic imitation: "At times, the fugue or canon cannot be discovered through the systems mentioned above, either because of the impediment of rests, or because one part is going up while another is going down, or because one part starts at the beginning and the other at the end. In such cases a student can begin at the end and work back to the beginning in order to find where and in which voice he should begin the canons."&lt;ref name=vic&gt;Vicentino, p.&amp;nbsp;298.&lt;/ref&gt; Vicentino derided those who achieved purely intellectual pleasure from retrograde (and similar permutations): "A composer of such fancies must try to make canons and fugues that are pleasant and full of sweetness and harmony. He should not make a canon in the shape of a tower, a mountain, a river, a chessboard, or other objects, for these compositions create a loud noise in many voices, with little harmonic sweetness. To tell the truth, a listening is more likely to be induced to vexation than to delight by these disproportioned fancies, which are devoid of pleasant harmony and contrary to the goal of the imitation of the nature of the words."&lt;ref name=vic/&gt;

[[Thomas Morley]] (1597) described retrograde in the context of canons and mentions a work by Byrd.&lt;ref name=Morley&gt;Morley, pp.&amp;nbsp;288–89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg]] (1754) notes various names for the procedure ''imitatio retrograda'' or ''cancrizans'' or ''per motum retrogradum'' and says it is used primarily in canons and fugues.&lt;ref&gt;Marpurg, pp.&amp;nbsp;148–49.{{Full|date=November 2011}}&lt;!--Source is in two volumes, paginated separately. In which volume is the citation?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers acknowledge that hearing retrograde in music is a challenge, and consider it a [[self-referential]] compositional device.&lt;ref&gt;Levarie and Levy, p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazzola, Göller, and Müller, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The fact that listeners may not recognize the second phrase as a reversal of the  first does not defeat the idea: a mirror structure under time produces a possible, comprehensible result, not necessarily a recognizable transformation." Morgan, "Symmetrical Form", p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In music ===
[[File:Nusmido - folio 150 verso of Pluteo 29.1 in the Laurentian Library in Florence.jpg|thumb|Nusmido, folio 150 verso of manuscript [[Pluteo 29.1]], located in the [[Laurentian Library]] in Florence - the earliest known example of retrograde in music]]
Despite not being mentioned in theoretical treatises prior to 1500, compositions written before that date show retrograde.&lt;ref name="Newes, p. 218"/&gt; According to Willi Apel, the earliest example of retrograde in music is the 13th century [[Clausula (music)|clausula]], ''Nusmido'', in which the [[tenor]] has the liturgical melody "Dominus" in retrograde (found in the manuscript [[Pluteo 29.1]], folio 150 verso, located in the [[Laurentian Library]] in Florence).&lt;ref&gt;Apel, p.&amp;nbsp;728. Todd and Newes accept Apel's identification of Nusmido as the earliest work found containing a retrograde passage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many citations to early examples of retrograde and other [[permutation (music)|permutations]] and their literature can be found in Todd pp.&amp;nbsp;71–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newes, p.&amp;nbsp;218. Newes transcribes the excerpt.&lt;/ref&gt; (The word "Nusmido" is a syllabic retrograde of the word "Dominus.")&lt;ref name=buk&gt;Bukofzer, p.&amp;nbsp;176. Bukofzer believes the existence of this retrograde is based on intellectual satisfaction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surveying medieval examples of retrograde, Virginia Newes notes that early composers were often also poets, and that musical retrogrades could have been based on similarly constructed poetic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Newes, p.&amp;nbsp;233.&lt;/ref&gt; She quotes Daniel Poirion in suggesting that the retrograde canon in Machaut's three-voice rondeau, "Ma Fin est mon Commencement" could symbolize a metaphysical view of death as rebirth, or else the ideal circle of the courtly outlook, which encloses all initiatives and all ends.&lt;ref&gt;Poirion, p.&amp;nbsp;322.&lt;/ref&gt; She concludes that, whatever the reasons, construction of retrogrades and their transmission were part of the medieval composers' world, as they prized symmetry and balance as intellectual feats in addition to the aural experience. &lt;ref&gt;Newes, pp.&amp;nbsp;218, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Machaut opening and closing bars of 'Ma fin...'.png|thumb|center|500px|Machaut, the opening and closing bars of 'ma fin est mon commencement' (My end is my beginning.) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcfPr4IN2MM Listen]]]

Todd notes that although some composers ([[John Dunstaple]], [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Johannes Ockeghem]]) used retrograde occasionally, they did not combine it with other [[permutation (music)|permutations]]. In contradistinction, [[Antoine Busnois]] and [[Jacob Obrecht]], used retrograde and other permutations extensively, suggesting familiarity with one another's compositional techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt; Todd also notes that, by use of retrograde, inversion, and retrograde-inversion, composers of this time viewed music in a way similar to serialists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, pp.&amp;nbsp;69–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as [[Edmund Rubbra|Edmund]] {{harvtxt|Rubbra|1960|p=35}} points out, “This is, of course, a purely mental concept, as music can never do anything but go forwards, even if the given tune is reversed.  The different relationships set up by reversing the direction of a theme make it completely unrecognizable; and when a composer indulges in this device the disclosure of it makes not the slightest difference to our apprehension of the music, which must be listened to as going parallel with the time-processes of our existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Rubbra, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are examples of retrograde motion in the music of [[J.S. Bach]], [[Haydn]] and [[Beethoven]].  Bach’s [[Musical Offering]] includes a two-voice canon in which the second voice performs the melodic line of first voice backwards:[[File:Bach Canon 2 from Musical offering.wav|thumb|Bach Canon 2 from Musical offering]][[File:Bach Canon 2 from Musical offering.png|thumb|center|500px| Bach, two part canon from 'The Musical Offering.'  The lower part is an exact retrograde of the upper part. ]]

The minuet (third) movement of [[Joseph Haydn]]’s, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMm_R7RFcMg Symphony no. 47],  is an exact [[palindrome]].  Haydn also transcribed this piece for piano and this version forms the second movement of his Piano Sonata in A major XVI/26 [[File:Haydn minuet- with slurs removed.wav|thumb|Minuet from Piano Sonata in A]][[File:Haydn minuet- with slurs removed.png|thumb|center|500px|Minuet 'al rovescio' from Haydn Sonata in A major. ]]

The fugal fourth movement of Beethoven, [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata no. 29]], op. 106, "Hammerklavier", has the following main theme:[[File:Hammeklavier fugue subject, first four bars 01.wav|thumb|Hammeklavier fugue subject, first four bars]][[File:Hammeklavier fugue subject, first four bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Hammeklavier fugue subject, first four bars]]Later in this movement, Beethoven conjures up and uses the retrograde version of the subject.  It should be noted, however, that Beethoven does not create a strict note-for-note reversal of the theme.&lt;ref&gt;In a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR5f8yAnGik&amp;t=56m40s lecture] on this Sonata, pianist Andras Schiff explains at how Beethoven explores the retrograde version of this subject.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Hammeklavier fugue subject, retrograde version, last four bars.wav|thumb|Hammeklavier fugue subject, retrograde version, last four bars]][[File:Hammeklavier fugue subject, retrograde version, last four bars.png|thumb|center|500px|Hammeklavier fugue subject, retrograde version, last four bars]]

== In post-tonal music ==
[[File:P-R-I-RI.png|thumb|Prime (top-left), retrograde (top-right), inverse (bottom-left), and retrograde-inverse (bottom-right).]]
As early as 1923, [[Arnold Schoenberg]] expressed the equivalence of melodic and harmonic presentation as a "unity of musical space." Taking the example of a hat, Schoenberg explained that the hat remains the same no matter if it is observed from below or above, from one side or another.  Similarly, permutations such as inversion, retrograde, and retrograde inversion are a way to create musical space.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p.&amp;nbsp;184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinrich Jalowetz discussed [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s frequent use of retrograde (and other permutations) as a compositional device for twelve-tone music:  "The technique serves two main functions. One is to provide a substitute for classical tonality, with  all its melodic and harmonic consequences...The second function is to provide a means of interrelationship. This is done by presenting the row not only in normal position but in inversion, retrogression, and retrograde inversion. The music derives a strict inner cohesion through the artful treatment of such relationships, even though the listener may often be unable to follow what is happening."&lt;ref&gt;Jalowetz, p.&amp;nbsp;394.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone music]], retrograde treatment of pitch is a commonplace, but rhythmic retrogrades are comparatively rare. Examples of rhythmic retrogrades occur in the music of [[Alban Berg]], for example in the operas ''[[Wozzeck]]'' and ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and in the Chamber Concerto.&lt;ref&gt;Jarman, pp.&amp;nbsp;351, 357, and 364.&lt;/ref&gt;  In discussing Berg's extensive use of retrograde and palindrome, Robert Morgan coins the word "circular" to describe musical situations "in which an opening gesture returns at a composition's close, thereby joining the music's temporal extremes."&lt;ref&gt;Covach, p. 20, citing Morgan, "The Eternal Return," p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Slepian, writing in 1947, observed that "modern American composers write canons that, whether simple or complicated in structure, clearly discernible or subtly concealed, are a natural means of expression growing directly out of the individual needs of the melodic material. Therefore, most of the composers regard cancrizans as an artificial device imposed upon a theme rather than as a consequence germinated by it."&lt;ref name="Slepian, p. 314"&gt;Slepian, p.&amp;nbsp;314.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[Douglas Moore]], [[Harold Morris (composer)|Harold Morris]], [[Paul Creston]], and [[Bernard Rogers]] "flatly refute the expressive powers of the cancrizans" whereas [[Walter Piston]], [[Adolph Weiss]], [[Wallingford Riegger]], and [[Roger Sessions]] use it often.&lt;ref&gt;Slepian, p.&amp;nbsp;322.&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly colorful and effective example is found in the second movement of Piston's Concerto for Orchestra, where continuous rapid string passages with an ostinato bass rhythm and a melody in the English horn returns later in the movement performed backwards as a recapitulation.&lt;ref name="Slepian, p. 314"/&gt;

=== Examples in post-tonal music ===

*[[Alban Berg]], [[Lulu (opera)| ''Lulu'']], the "silent film " interlude in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQh8saNM-74&amp;t=8s Act 2].
*[[Ruth Crawford Seeger]], ''Diaphonic Suite No. 3'' for two clarinets (1930), third movement, the first clarinet in bars 45–56 present an exact retrograde of the same part, bars 2–13,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–07.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Karel Goeyvaerts]], ''[[Nummer 5]] met zuivere tonen'' (Number 5 with Pure Tones, 1953) superimposes an ''exact'' retrograde of its materials on the "forwards" version.&lt;ref&gt;Sabbe, p.&amp;nbsp;73.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, not only does each event in the second half occur according to an axis of symmetry at the centre of the work, but each event itself is reversed, so that the note attacks in the first half become note decays in the second, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, pp.&amp;nbsp;64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Paul Hindemith]]'s [[Ludus Tonalis]] cycle is highly palindromic, its ''Postludium'' being almost a retrograde inversion of its ''Introitus''.
*[[Charles Ives]], ''Scherzo: All the Way Around and Back'' (1907–08) is palindromic.&lt;ref&gt;Burkholder, Sinclair, and Sherwood.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olivier Messiaen]], "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBZcuO7gW-w Abîme des oiseaux]", from the ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'' (1941) exhibits many retrograde relationships among its elements,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, pp.&amp;nbsp;129, 135, 138–39, 144–45, 147–48, 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one rhythm that is "a retrograde version of ''rāgavardhana'', No. 93 in [[Sarangadeva|Sharngadeva]]'s collection," the ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, p.&amp;nbsp;148.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Luigi Nono]], ''Incontri'' (1955).&lt;ref&gt;Stenzl, pp.&amp;nbsp;150–53.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Carl Ruggles]], ''Sun-Treader'' (1926–31) has a rhythmically free pitch palindrome in b. 68–118, and a retrograde canon in b. 124–33.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–101.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Igor Stravinsky]], ''[[Canticum Sacrum]]'' (1956). The fifth [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tGwTl3Ui0E&amp;t=7m20s movement] is an almost exact retrograde of the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE8WE6YIy-M&amp;t=1m22s first].&lt;ref&gt;van den Toorn, p.&amp;nbsp;414; White, pp.&amp;nbsp;488–89.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Iannis Xenakis]], ''[[Metastaseis (Xenakis)|Metastaseis]]'' (1953–54) contains many instances of retrograde relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Barthel-Calvet, pp.&amp;nbsp;155, 166, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-retrogradable rhythm==
In [[music]] and [[music theory]], a '''non-retrogradable [[rhythm]]''' is a rhythmic [[palindrome]], i.e., a pattern of note [[duration (music)|durations]] that is read or performed the same either forwards or backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used most frequently in the context of the music of [[Olivier Messiaen]]. For example, such rhythms occur in the "Liturgie de cristal" and "Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes"—the first and sixth movements—of Messiaen's ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]''.

==History of chemistry in Manchester==
[[File:Schunk Building.jpg|thumb|The Schunck Building, University of Manchester]]Manchester has a long and distinguished history of Chemistry. [[John Dalton]] founded modern Chemistry in 1803 with his [[atomic theory]]. [[William Henry (chemist)|William Henry]] (1774 – 1836) was a Manchester chemist who developed what is known today as [[Henry's Law]]. [[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]] pioneered the science of thermodynamics in the 1840s while working in Manchester. In the basement of the [[Royal Manchester Institution]] a laboratory was installed by [[Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair|Lyon Playfair]] who worked there briefly as Professor of Chemistry after he left Thomson's of Clitheroe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Lyon Playfair (1818-1898)|author=W.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed the first UK Professor of Organic Chemistry in 1874.

The teaching of chemistry in Owens College began in 1851 in a house in St John Street and was later transferred to the main college building in Quay Street. When the college removed to the present university site in 1873 the chemical laboratory was designed by [[Henry Roscoe (chemist)|Henry Roscoe]]. To this was added in 1895 the Schorlemmer laboratory for organic chemistry and in 1904 three more laboratories were added; these were the Dalton and Perkin laboratories and the [[Schunck Building|Schunck laboratory]] which was brought from Kersal and rebuilt. The Morley laboratories (1909) provided further accommodation for organic chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1939), pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2nd World War three more laboratories were built further down Burlington Street; these were the Dixon Laboratory (1946), the Robinson Laboratory (1950) and the Lapworth Laboratory (1950);&lt;ref&gt;Portrait (1951), app. VII&lt;/ref&gt; all three were vacated in the 1960s when the present building in Brunswick Street was available. The architect for the present chemistry building was H. S. Fairhurst &amp; Son.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, Nikolaus (1969) ''Lancashire. The Buildings of England. 1: The Urban South''.

'''School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences''', or '''SFOS''', is part of the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]. SFOS offers a bachelor of arts and a bachelor of science in fisheries, master’s and doctoral degrees in oceanography, fisheries and marine biology, and a minor in marine science.

The school was established by the [[University of Alaska]] Board of Regents in 1987 from units at several campuses and placed under a single umbrella administered within the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

SFOS is headquartered in [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], with major divisions in [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]], [[Anchorage]], [[Juneau]] and [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]]:

The ''Institute of Marine Science'' in Fairbanks is active in research and graduate training at the master’s and doctoral levels. IMS conducts marine science studies in the world’s oceans, with special emphasis on arctic and Pacific subarctic waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kodiak Seafood and Marine Science Center'' in Kodiak works to increase the value of the Alaska fishing industry through academic and research programs in [[sustainability|sustainable harvesting]] and seafood technology.

The ''[[NOAA]] Alaska Sea Grant College Program'' in Fairbanks funds marine research, offers education and advisory services, distributes information about Alaska’s seas and coasts and provides outreach to coastal communities.

The ''Alaska Sea Grant Marine Advisory Program'' in Anchorage is a statewide outreach and technical assistance program helping Alaskans widely use, conserve and enjoy Alaska’s marine and coastal resources.

The ''Seward Marine Center'' in Seward  provides access to saltwater laboratories and the coastal environment with laboratories, constant temperature chambers and a running seawater system. The University of Alaska's new icebreaker, the R/V [[Sikuliaq]] will be based here.

The ''Fisheries Division'' in Juneau and Fairbanks collaborates with state, national and international organizations to study how to develop and maintain sustainable fisheries programs in Alaska and global waters. Faculty at the Fisheries Division train undergraduate and graduate programs in fisheries.

==Research projects==
The school is involved in the first ever study of [[ocean acidification]] in the North Pacific and its effects on fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aprn.org/2010/08/31/university-of-alaska-collecting-data-on-ocean-acidification/ University of Alaska Collecting Data on Ocean Acidification ''Steve Heimel, [[Alaska Public Media|APRN]] 8-31-2010'']&lt;/ref&gt; They are also part of an ongoing project to use [[radar]] to map surface currents in the [[Arctic Ocean]], and UAF SFOS researchers designed and deployed a solar and wind powered "remote power module" to provide energy for the programs equipment, which is often located in remote, unpopulated areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/2010/07/24/1380368/remote-module-will-power-current.html Remote module will power current radar in the Arctic ''Dan Joling, [[Associated Press]]/[[Anchorage Daily News]] 7-4-2010''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610204432/http://www.adn.com/2010/07/24/1380368/remote-module-will-power-current.html |date=2011-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from the school have also been studying the feeding behavior of [[bowhead whales]] near [[Point Barrow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/2010/10/02/1482740/autumn-sea-north-of-barrow-heavy.html Autumn sea north of Barrow heavy with whales ''Ned Rozell, [[Anchorage Daily News]] 10-2-2010'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
''The She Spot'' looks at the impact of women on [[social change]], and focuses on the influence women have had on the world, as well as on volunteering. The book incorporates several case studies, polls, and the potential for women to be underrepresented in these polls and studies. It also covers the potential mis-representation in marketing towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The she spot; why women are the market for changing the world--and how to reach them (Book review) |author= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-183483734.html |newspaper=Reference &amp; Research Book News |date=August 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Critical reception for ''The She Spot'' has been positive, with [[Publishers Weekly]] calling it a "thoughtful, helpful guide to nonprofit marketers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nonfiction review - The She Spot: Why Women Are the Market for Changing the World—and How to Reach Them |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57675-472-6 |newspaper=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=April 21, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AdAge|AdAge's]] Matt Kinsey wrote that the book was "good fodder for discussion" but that he was unsure that Witter and Chen's "formula alone can commandeer a loyal female audience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Finding 'The She Spot' More Important Than You Thought |author=Matt Kinsey |url=http://adage.com/article/ad-and-marketing-book-reviews/finding-spot-important-thought/130170/ |newspaper=[[Advertising Age]] |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in [[ForeWord (magazine)|ForeWord]] magazine by Mary Spiro said that, "If one agrees with the premise that marketing has been male-centered or that the strategies they present are uniquely suited to impact women then this text offers plenty of practical advice for those courting female clientele" and that the end of chapter summaries offer "quick inspiration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The She Spot: Why Women are the Market for Changing the World--and How to Reach Them (Book review) |author=Mary Spiro |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-236034590.html |newspaper=[[ForeWord (magazine)|ForeWord]] |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=April 17, 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures''''' is a 1997 book by [[Anne Fadiman]] that chronicles the struggles of a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugee family from Houaysouy, [[Sainyabuli Province]], [[Laos]],&lt;ref name="Fadiman103"&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman]]. "Foua and Nao Kao." ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUHAXXvSUeYC&amp;pg=PA103 103]. "[...]I asked her to describe a typical day in Houaysouy, the village in the northwestern province of Sayaboury where the Lee family had lived."&lt;/ref&gt; the Lees, and their interactions with the health care system in [[Merced, California]]. In 2005 Robert Entenmann, [[Ph.D.]], of [[St. Olaf College]] wrote that the book is "certainly the most widely read book on the Hmong experience in America."&lt;ref name=Entenmannp1&gt;Entenmann, Robert. "[http://hmongstudies.org/EntenmannHSJ6.pdf The Myth of Sonom, the Hmong King]."

On the most basic level, the book tells the story of the family's second youngest and favored daughter, Lia Lee, who was diagnosed with a severe form of [[epilepsy]] named [[Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome]]  and the culture conflict that obstructs her treatment.

Through miscommunications about medical dosages and parental refusal to give certain medicines due to mistrust, misunderstandings, and behavioral side effects, and the inability of the doctors to develop more empathy with the traditional Hmong lifestyle or try to learn more about the Hmong culture, Lia's condition worsens. The dichotomy between the Hmong's perceived spiritual factors and the Americans' perceived scientific factors comprises the overall theme of the book.

The book is written in a unique style, with every other chapter returning to Lia's story and the chapters in-between discussing broader themes of [[Hmong customs and culture|Hmong culture, customs, and history]]; American involvement in and responsibility for the war in Laos; and the many problems of immigration, especially assimilation and discrimination. While particularly sympathetic to the Hmong, Fadiman presents the situation from the perspectives of both the doctors and the family. An example of [[medical anthropology]], the book has been cited by medical journals and lecturers as an argument for greater [[cultural competence]], and often assigned to medical, pharmaceutic, and anthropological students in the US. In 1997, it won the [[National Book Critics Circle]] Award for General Nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/page_2 National Book Critics Circle - past awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Merced, Mercy General.JPG|thumb|[[Mercy Medical Center Merced]], previously the Merced Community Medical Center; this is a new building and not the previous building where Lia Lee was taken]]
Lia experienced her first [[seizure]] at three months of age, but a resident at [[Merced Community Medical Center]] misdiagnosed her condition, and the hospital was unable to communicate with her parents since the hospital had no [[Hmong language|Hmong]] interpreters. [[Anne Fadiman]] wrote that Lia's parents did not give her medication as it was prescribed because they believed that Lia Lee's state showed a sense of spiritual giftedness, and they did not want to take that away. The American doctors did not understand the Hmong traditional remedies that the Lee family used. The doctors treating Lia Lee, Neil and Peggy Ernst, had her removed from her home when she was almost three years of age, and placed into [[foster care]] for one year, causing friction with her parents. By age 4½ Lia Lee had been admitted to hospital care 17 times and had made over 100 outpatient visits.&lt;ref name=Foxdead2&gt;Fox, Margalit. "Lia Lee Dies; Life Went On Around Her, Redefining Care."

Retrieved on October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The worst seizure Lia had put her onto the verge of death. She went to the emergency room and Dr. Neil Ernst could not do anything. He talked to Lia's parents about transferring her to Fresno, California because Lia would need further treatment that Dr. Ernst could not provide.  Lia's parents ". . .  believed their daughter was transferred not because of her critical condition but because of the Ernst's vacation plans".
Lia Lee slipped into a coma after suffering from a [[grand mal seizure]] in 1986, when she was four years of age. Lia Lee's doctors believed she would die, but Lia Lee remained alive but with no higher brain functions.&lt;ref name=Foxdead2/&gt;

==Research==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
Fadiman's sources for information about the history of the Hmong include ''[[Hmong: History of a People]]'' by Keith Quincy. She stated "Were I citing the source of each detail, Quincy's name would attach itself to nearly every sentence in the pages on the Hmong in China."&lt;ref name=fadiman&gt;{{citation|last=Fadiman|title=The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down|date=September 30, 1998|isbn=9781429931113|url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp370-us15/files/2015/05/The-Spirit-Catches-You-and-You-Anne-Fadiman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fadiman's book cited the Quincy theory that the Hmong people originated from Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Pfeifer|Pfeifer, Mark E.]] ([[Hmong Cultural and Resource Center]]).

==Legacy==
Marilyn Mochel, a nurse and clinical educator at Sutter Merced Medical Center&lt;!--This is the hospital which treated Lia Lee!!!!--&gt; (now [[Mercy Medical Center Merced]]), who heads the hospital's cross-cultural program, said in 1999 that "The book has allowed more dialogue.

Retrieved on October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the [[State of California]] Lia Lee's death was not widely reported. Fadiman said that [[pneumonia]] was the immediate cause of death. Margalit Fox of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "[b]ut Lia’s underlying medical issues were more complex still" because she had lived in a persistent vegetative state for such a long period of time. As of 2012 most individuals who go into that state die three to five years afterwards.&lt;ref name=Foxdead1/&gt;

==Reception==
Ralph Jennings of ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'' said "Hmong, including some among the 2,000 in [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], say the book typified conflicts between their culture and American institutions. But some say it didn't capture the complexity of the Hmong culture."&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

Cheng Lee, a brother of Lia Lee, said that his father and mother liked Fadiman's book.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

“Compellingly written, from the heart and from the trenches. I couldn’t wait to finish it, then reread it and ponder it again. It is a powerful case study of a medical tragedy.” - David H. Mark, Journal of the American Medical Association

Anne Fadiman's essay "Hmong Odyssey," adapted from the book, was published in the March–April 1998 ''[[Via (magazine)|Via]]''. The Hmong community leaders in [[Fresno, California]] praised the essay, saying that it was thoughtful and accurate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FB&amp;p_theme=fb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAE8A732D83B82C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM ESSAY VS.

'''Université Laval''' ({{lang-en|'''Laval University'''}}) is a [[French-language]], public [[research university]] in [[Quebec City]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The University was founded by [[royal charter]] issued by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1852, with roots in the founding of the [[Séminaire de Québec]] in 1663 by [[François de Laval|François de Montmorency-Laval]], making it the oldest centre of higher education in Canada and the first North American institution to offer higher education in French. The university, whose campus was erected from the 1950s onward in the suburban borough of [[Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge]], is ranked among the top ten Canadian universities in terms of research funding&lt;ref&gt;Université Laval. [http://www.scom.ulaval.ca/Presentation/anglais/background.html "Université Laval at a Glance"]. (accessed 17 April 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and holds four Canada Excellence Research Chairs.

==History==
[[File:François de Laval - Project Gutenberg eText 17174.jpg|thumb|left|200px|François de Laval]] 
[[File:Grand-Séminaire-Québec.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The Old Séminaire de Québec today]]
The university began as the [[Séminaire de Québec]], which was founded in 1663 by [[François de Laval|François de Montmorency-Laval]], a member of the [[House of Laval]] and the first [[Bishop of New France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/32699/32699-h/32699-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History, Edited by Lawrence Johnstone Burpee and Arthur G. Doughty.|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the French Regime the institution mainly trained priests to serve in [[New France]]. After the [[Conquest of 1760]], the British expanded education in Canada to include the liberal arts. French Canadians had at the time no opportunity to pursue higher education, and [[Ignace Bourget|Bishop Bourget]] of Montreal suggested expanding the Séminaire de Québec into Université Laval. [[Louis-Jacques Casault|Louis Casault]], a priest who taught physics at the Séminaire de Québec, went to Europe to seek a royal charter and study the best university systems there.

The Séminaire de Québec was granted a royal charter on December 8, 1852, by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], at the request of [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] (Governor-General of the Province of Canada), creating Université Laval with "the rights and privileges of a university".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001990 Laval University/Université Laval&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816195903/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001990 |date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter was signed in 1852. [[Pope Benedict XV]] approved the plan and authorized the institution to establish chairs of theology and confer degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6466.mobile The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, the university opened a second campus in [[Montreal]], which became the [[Université de Montréal]] on May 8, 1919, by a writ of [[Pope Benedict XV]]. In 1971, a second charter transferred all authority to the Université Laval council.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

By 1925, the university had outgrown its location. The Old City was very crowded, making it difficult to add new buildings to the campus. The university moved to [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]] in the 1950s, which at the time was a semi-rural community west of the Quebec city centre. The School of Architecture returned to the old building (now affectionately referred to as ''Le Vieux Séminaire'') in 1989.

Université Laval is governed by a board of governors and a faculty senate. This structure was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to serve as a link between the two bodies and lead the institution.&lt;ref name=langton1906&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DfNNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA306|title=The University of Toronto and its colleges, 1827-1906|last=Langton|first=Hugh Hornby|last2=Macallum|first2=Archibald Byron|publisher=The University Library, pub. by the librarian|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|306}}

In the early part of the 20th century, the need for higher education expanded beyond the classical fields of theology, law and medicine, and the university introduced science and social-science departments such as forestry and household science.&lt;ref name=langton1906 /&gt;{{rp|1904}} In addition, graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

"Laval", a waltz by French-Canadian ragtime composer, [[Wilfrid Beaudry]], was dedicated to the students at Laval University and the University of Montreal. The music for piano was published in Québec by J. Beaudry, circa 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2016-07-01T18%3A38%3A44Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;rft_dat=16182129&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fcollectionscanada.gc.ca%3Aamicus&amp;lang=eng |title= Laval |newspaper=Amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1906  |author=Wilfrid Beaudry |accessdate= July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university opened its department of social, political, and economic sciences in 1938, signalling a change of approach that continued into the 1960s, based on an idea of higher education as the key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and society.&lt;ref&gt;Behiels, Michael, "Le père Georges-Henri Lévesque et l'établissement des sciences sociales à Laval: 1938–1955", Revue de l'Université d'Ottawa 52, no. 3 (juil.-sept. 1982). Appears in English translation in "Youth, University, and Canadian Society", edited by Paul Axelrod and John G. Reid. Kingston and Montreal: McGill-Queen's University of Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal charter that founded Université Laval in 1852 was designated a National Historic Event in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=1378&amp;oqeName=Laval+University&amp;oqfName=Universit%E9+Laval National Historic Event] {{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and features==
After it was granted a university charter, several buildings were built in Old Quebec, including the School of Chemistry (1923), the addition on Ste. Famille Street (1931), the Mining School (1938), and the cafeteria building (1945), all by architect Joseph Simeon Bergeron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/node/1103|title=Bergeron, Joseph Simeon|publisher=|accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the neighborhood was already crowded and activities later moved in nearby Sainte-Foy, which was more spacious. 

===Campus building===
Today's campus covers {{cvt|1.2|km2}} and has over 30 buildings (also called ''pavillons''), including many iconic exemplars of [[modern architecture]]. Its earliest buildings and landscapes were designed by [[Edouard Fiset]] ([[:fr:Édouard Fiset|fr]]) from the 1950s, and of its lands, 56 percent are wooded areas, grasslands, and sports fields{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} .

Pratically all buildings are linked by {{cvt|10|km}} of underground walkways, which are particularly useful in the winter and whose walls are mostly covered by murals painted by student associations and student visitors over the years, as well as graffiti. The campus is also home to the ''Roger-Van den Hende'' botanical garden ([[:fr:Jardin universitaire Roger-Van den Hende|fr]]) which contains some 67 species of deciduous and coniferous trees and 60 different species of birds. The Louis-Jacques-Casault building also hosts the regional branch of the [[Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec|National Archives of Quebec]]. The sport building is called [[PEPS]] and is said to be the largest sport complex in eastern Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.quebecoriginal.com/en-ca/listing/things-to-do/sports-and-nature/skating-rinks/pavillon-de-leducation-physique-et-des-sports-peps-universite-laval-230331533 |title=Pavillon de l'Éducation physique et des sports (PEPS) (Université Laval) |website=Québec Original |access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is adjacent to the covered TELUS stadium ([[:fr:Stade TELUS-Université Laval|fr]]).

==Programs==
As of 2002, Université Laval offered over 350 programs to more than 38,000 students. The university also attracts more than 2,500 foreign students annually, and has almost 1,000 students drawn from Canadian provinces outside of Quebec. Many students come to the university for the ''Français pour non-francophones'' program that offers instruction in French as a second language to students from Canada and around the world. It is also the only university in Quebec which trains forestry engineers.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Since the mid-1980s, Université Laval has offered distance learning; over 30 programs and 400 courses are offered by distance learning, of which 80% are accessible from the internet.

The '''Venus Butterfly''' is a term used for various [[Human sexual activity|sexual techniques]], one of which being the subject of the 1988 book ''The One Hour Orgasm.'' It was first publicly mentioned in a 1986 episode of the American television drama ''[[L.A. Law]],'' although a technique of the same name appears in the book ''[[The Sensuous Woman]],'' which was first published in 1969.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
==''L.A. Law'' television episode==
In an episode of ''[[L.A. Law]]'' titled "The Venus Butterfly", which first aired on November 21, 1986, a man who is unimpressive in appearance and personality, but who nevertheless has tremendous success with women, claims to have a sexual technique that has caused this success, and reveals it to his lawyer, Stuart Markowitz ([[Michael Tucker (actor)|Michael Tucker]]). The technique itself is never described to the audience. In a hotel bedroom scene it is implied that Markowitz uses the technique on his girlfriend, Ann Kelsey ([[Jill Eikenberry]]), with great positive effect. According to authors Tim Brooks &amp; Earle Marsh, the Venus Butterfly was pivotal in Kelsey and Markowitz becoming a long-term couple.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Brooks &amp; Earle Marsh, "The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Show, 1946–present."&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer of that section of the episode, [[Terry Louise Fisher]], stated that she had just made it up. The show received many letters and phone calls from viewers asking what it was, as well as two requests to license the term.&lt;ref name="cosmo"&gt;[http://srino.com/dey/susan_dey_cosmopolitan.html A Behind the Scenes Look at L.A. Law], ''Cosmopolitan,'' December 1987 (reprint on fansite, retrieved 23:45, August 12, 2006 (UTC))&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine did a feature speculating on what the technique was and included suggestions from readers. Years later, actors on the show reported still being asked about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Insider/default.htm?cmsRedir=true&amp;rmDate=01242002&amp;cmsGuid=%7BD3C490A0-5D62-43EE-9396-D7D9C2136669%7D Daniel R. Coleridge, "L.A. Law Reunion's Sexy Secret!" ''[[TV Guide]],'' January 24, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sue Johanson variation==
As described by writer and sex educator [[Sue Johanson]] in 2005, the Venus Butterfly is a variant of [[cunnilingus]]. It involves using one's tongue on a woman's [[clitoris]], using one's fingers on her [[vagina]] and using the other hand in the perineal area, "even penetrating the rectum [i.e. anus] if that is pleasurable for her."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talksexwithsue.com/oralfemale.php Performing Oral Sex on a Female] Talk Sex Productions Inc. &amp; Sue Johanson 2005, URL accessed August 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar description was given in a 2004 episode of the TV series ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]].''&lt;ref&gt;Colloquially, this configuration is also known as The Shocker. [http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/2004cablestudy/main.asp Basic Cable Awash in Raunch: a content analysis of expanded basic cable's original prime-time series], Parents Television Council, November, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The One Hour Orgasm'' variation==
The 1988 book ''The One Hour Orgasm: How to Learn the Amazing "Venus Butterfly" Technique,'' written by Leah and Bob Schwartz, is dedicated to educating readers on how to perform the technique. In this variation either the woman or man is lying down, and their partner, sitting next to them with their legs positioned around each other, very gently, with just the minimal amount of pressure (the "touch" of a butterfly's wing, at least on the clitoris) stimulates the clitoris or the hood, with the penis at the two-o'clock or ten-o'clock position. The book suggests keeping the clitoral shaft steady with one thumb laid gently along and beside it, with the other thumb lying lengthwise just within the vagina but not moving deep within it. (All of this is done using a lubricant.) The light pressure continues using the same speed throughout until a peak is reached close to orgasm but not quite (although it can be continued if multiple orgasms are the goal), then the speed is slowed down even further or stopped, but very soon continued again and the person is brought back near orgasm or given a second or third orgasm. This [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]] on the part of the person providing the technique can be learned over time with a particular partner. The technique can be sustained, "surfing" near the orgasm but stopping occasionally, for a very long time, hence the term "One Hour Orgasm".&lt;ref&gt;''The One Hour Orgasm: How to Learn the Amazing "Venus Butterfly" Technique,'' a book written by Leah and Bob Schwartz, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is mentioned in the film ''[[Meet the Fockers]].'' A set of video-tapes (for him, and for her) were later made by the Schwartzes, showing how the technique is performed.

'''Wefarm''' is a [[peer-to-peer]] knowledge sharing platform for [[smallholding|smallholder farmers]]. Wefarm users can ask and answer farming questions and share farming tips, via [[SMS]] or online, enabling farmers in rural areas without internet access to share information. Wefarm is built around the principle that rural farming communities in [[developing country|developing countries]] have generations worth of knowledge to share, but lack the tools to do so. Wefarm provides an SMS service based around peer-to-peer, [[crowdsourcing]] of knowledge. Users ask a wide range of questions regarding farming techniques and share information around business ideas, or how to improve livelihoods.

== History and Pilots ==

The idea for Wefarm was born in 2010 out of a perceived need for greater access to information for the 500 million smallholder farmers in developing countries. Only approximately 10% of smallholder farmers have any access to the internet but it is thought that around 90% have access to basic mobile ‘feature’ phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/02/13/emerging-nations-embrace-internet-mobile-technology/ Emerging Nations Embrace Internet, Mobile Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenny Ewan, CEO of Wefarm, and Claire Rhodes, General Manager of the Cafédirect Producers Foundation (CPF), developed the idea for Wefarm together in 2010 as a project for CPF, a UK-registered charity that works with ~280,000 smallholder tea, coffee and cocoa farmers and their organisations on innovative, community driven projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://producersfoundation.org/about/ Cafédirect Producers Foundation - About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; They developed Wefarm together as a peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform, giving smallholder farmers a way to access information from other farmers around the world through basic mobile phones and SMS.

Wefarm was piloted, tested and developed over 2011 and 2012 as a CPF project with funding from the Nominet Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/what-we-support/projects/wefarm-supporting-smallholders-overseas/ Wefarm - Supporting smallholders overseas]&lt;/ref&gt; This initial prototype of the system was tested in partnership with smallholder farming organisations in [[Peru]], [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]] with successful proof of concept achieved - a real-time, multilingual knowledge sharing by farmers in 3 countries with no access to internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/Nom_CaseStudy_cafe.pdf/ A Nominet Trust Case Study - Wefarm]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Wefarm was won the Knight News Challenge, run by the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]], providing support to build a more robust, scalable version of the proof of concept system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knightfoundation.org/grants/20123669/ Knight Foundation Grants]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Wefarm was an overall winner of the Google Impact Challenge, providing funding to launch Wefarm in several different countries around the world and take it to scale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/uk2014/charity/we-farm Google Impact Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018 Wefarm announced it has reached over 1.1 million users across Kenya and Uganda, with plans to expand into the rest of Africa in 2019, beginning with Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-largest-farmer-farmer-network-144800836.html World’s Largest Farmer-to-Farmer Network, Wefarm, Reaches over One Million Users]&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Launch ===

Wefarm launched its newly built v1.0 in Kenya in February 2015, and subsequently in Peru in August 2015.

As of late September 2015 Wefarm had a total number of 18,260 users, with over 1 million SMS messages sent through their platform to date, and more than 45,000 answers to farmers questions shared. Around 60% of farmers who sign-up to Wefarm subsequently actively contribute knowledge to the system.

== Social Goals ==

=== Social goals - users ===

Wefarm users can access vital information that will improve their livelihoods through increasing crop yield, diversifying farming practices, creating micro businesses, and increasing household incomes.

By sharing information users will also build up a bank of agricultural knowledge that can benefit isolated farmers around the developing world.

=== Social goals - commercial partners ===

Food and drink companies, supermarkets, and other businesses with suppliers in Africa and Latin America can improve supply chain transparency and increase supply chain sustainability through partnering with Wefarm.

== Technology ==

Wefarm is an SMS-based peer-to-peer knowledge sharing platform that can be accessed using a basic mobile phone. Users sign up for free sending an SMS to a national short-code number in each country of operation. The user then registers their name, and can ask a question by sending an SMS to the Wefarm number.

Questions are crowdsourced via other farmers in the region and around the world, using a voluntary translation tool.

== Business model ==

In January 2015 Wefarm was launched as a social enterprise subsidiary of CPF, with a for-profit business model in order to achieve long-term financial sustainability and scalability. Wefarm plans to partner with local, national, and international companies who want to increase sustainability and transparency in their supply chains and access isolated farming markets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9787">'''Wet oxidation''' is a form of hydrothermal treatment.  It is the [[oxidation]] of dissolved or suspended components in [[water]] using [[oxygen]] as the [[oxidizer]].  It is referred to as "Wet Air Oxidation" (WAO) when [[air]] is used.  The oxidation reactions occur in [[superheated water]] at a temperature above the normal boiling point of water (100&amp;nbsp;°C), but below the critical point (374&amp;nbsp;°C).

The system must be maintained under pressure to avoid excessive evaporation of water.  This is done to control energy consumption due to the [[latent heat of vaporization]].  It is also done because liquid water is necessary for most of the oxidation reactions to occur.  Compounds oxidize under wet oxidation conditions that would not oxidize under dry conditions at the same temperature and pressure.

Wet oxidation has been used commercially for around 60 years.  It is used predominantly for treating wastewater.  It is often referred to as '''Zimpro'''  (from ZIMmerman PROcess), after Fred T. Zimmermann who commercialized it in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water.siemens.com/en/about_us/legacy_brands/Pages/zimpro.aspx|title=Zimpro History|accessdate=February 2010|df=}}| archiveurl= | archivedate=2013-03-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==System Description==
Commercial systems typically use a [[bubble column reactor]], where air is bubbled through a vertical column that is liquid full of the hot and pressurized wastewater.  Fresh wastewater enters the bottom of the column and oxidized wastewater exits the top.  The heat released during the oxidation is used to maintain the operating temperature.

WAO is a liquid phase reaction using dissolved oxygen in water to oxidize wastewater contaminants.  The dissolved oxygen is typically supplied using pressurized air, but pure oxygen can also be used.  The oxidation reaction generally occurs at moderate temperatures of 150°-320&amp;nbsp;°C and at pressures from 10 to 220 barg.  The process converts organic contaminants to carbon dioxide, water, and biodegradable short chain organic acids.  Inorganic constituents such as sulfides and cyanides are converted to non-reactive inorganic compounds.

In the WAO reaction, complex organic molecules, including biological refractory compounds, are broken into simpler organic compounds or to a complete mineralized state (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; Simple organic compounds such as low molecular weight carboxylic acids and mineralized reaction products may be present in the WAO effluents.  Because of this, the WAO effluent generally requires post treatment prior to discharge. WAO effluents are typically readily biodegradable and exhibit high values for [[Biological oxygen demand|BOD]]:[[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] ratios.  Standard treatment techniques such as activated sludge biotreatment are typically used with WAO for complete treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Kumfer, B.; Lehmann, D. Wet Air Oxidation of Difficult to Treat Pharmaceutical Waste Streams. ''Water Practice'' '''2007,''' ''2''''',''' 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catalysis|Catalyst]] can be used in the WAO system to enhance treatment and achieve a higher COD destruction.  Heterogeneous and homogenous catalysts have been used.  Heterogeneous catalysts are based on precious metals deposited on a stable substrate.  Homogenous catalysts are dissolved transition metals.  Several processes, such as Ciba-Geigy, LOPROX, and ATHOS utilize a homogenous catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Levec,J.; Albin,P. Catalytic wet-air oxidation processes: A review. ''Catalysis Today''.

A special type of wet oxidation process was the so-called "VerTech process" system. A system of this type operated in [[Apeldoorn]], [[Netherlands]] between 1994 and 2004. The system was installed in a below-ground pressure vessel (also called a gravity [[pressure vessel]] or GPV). The pressure was supplied by feeding the material to a reactor with a depth of {{convert|1200|m|ft}}. The deep shaft reactor also served as a heat exchanger, so no pre-heating was required. The operating temperature was about 270&amp;nbsp;°C with a pressure of about {{convert|100|bar|psi}}. The installation was eventually shut down due to operational problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bhargava, S.K.; Tardio, J.; Prasad, J.; Folger, K.; Akolekar, D.B.; Grocott, S.C.

== Commercial Applications ==

=== Spent Caustic Treatment ===
The majority of commercial wet oxidation systems are used to treat industrial wastewater, such as [[sulfide]] laden [[spent caustic]] streams from ethylene and LPG production as well as naphthenic and cresylic spent caustics from refinery applications.

Typical classification of WAO treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kumfer, B.; Clark, M. “Wet Air Oxidation of Spent Caustic in Petroleum Refineries”, International Water Conference (IWC), San Antonio, TX, November 4–8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Low temperature WAO systems oxidize sulfides to thiosulfate and sulfate but high concentrations of thiosulfate are present in the treated effluent.  The mid temperature systems fully oxidize sulfides to sulfate and mercaptans are oxidized to sulfonic acids.  For sulfidic spent caustics, this results in a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) destruction (&gt;90%).  High temperature systems are used to oxidize organic compounds that are present in naphthenic and cresylic spent caustics.

=== Sewage Sludge Treatment ===
Almost as many systems are also used for treating [[biosolids]], in order to [[pasteurize]] and to decrease volume of material for disposal.  The thermal conditioning occurs at temperatures of 210 – 240&amp;nbsp;°C.  A 4% dry solid slurry can be processed in a WAO system where it is disinfected and the treated effluent can be dewatered to 55% dry solids using a filter press.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other Applications ===
Wet air oxidation has also been used to treat a variety of other industrial process waters and wastewaters which include:

The '''''Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft''''' ('''''ZATW'''''/'''''ZAW''''') is an academic German journal established in 1881. It is concerned with theological, linguistic and historical criticism of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Formerly, it represented a strictly Protestant point of view on the [[Old Testament]]. At the present time, it is more [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]], also representing Catholic and Jewish points of view.

Its first editor was [[Bernhard Stade]]. 
Currently, the journal is edited by [[Hans-Christoph Schmitt]] and [[Ernst-Joachim Waschke]] and published by [[Walter de Gruyter]]. It is edited two times per year in both a printed version and an internet version ({{ISSN|1613-0103}}). The majority of articles are written in German, but some of them are written in English and French.

A companion to the ''ZAW'' journal is the ''[[Zeitschrift für die Neutestamentliche Wissenschaft]]'' (ZNW).
