      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5741">In the [[United States]], '''Advanced Placement (AP) Physics''' collectively refers to the [[College Board]] [[Advanced Placement Program]] courses and exams covering various areas of [[physics]]. These are intended to be equivalent to university courses that use best practices of physics teaching pedagogy.

Each AP Physics course culminates in an optional exam for which high-performing students may receive some credit towards their college coursework, depending on which college or university they attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement | title = Credit &amp; Placement | work = AP Students | publisher = The [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AP Physics B (discontinued)==
[[AP Physics B]] – discontinued in 2014 – was supposed to be equivalent to an introductory algebra-based college course in physics, with a laboratory component.&lt;ref name="CB09"&gt;{{cite web |title=AP Physics B |url= http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_physb.html?physicsb| year=2011 |work=AP Central |publisher= [[College Board]]|accessdate=July 24, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110702141730/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_physb.html?physicsb| archivedate= 2 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course was non-calculus-based, utilizing [[algebra]] and basic [[trigonometry]] to solve various physics problems.&lt;ref name=Physics2009/&gt; AP Physics B was divided into five different sections: [[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian Mechanics]], [[Fluid mechanics|Fluid Mechanics]] and [[Thermodynamics|Thermal Physics]], [[Electricity]] and [[Magnetism]], [[Wave]]s and [[Optics]], and [[Atomic physics|Atomic]] and [[Nuclear physics|Nuclear Physics]].&lt;ref name=Physics2009&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/physics/ap-cd-physics-0708.pdf |publisher=The [[College Board]] |title=Physics Course Description |date=May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601132803/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/physics/ap-cd-physics-0708.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AP Physics B was replaced by AP Physics 1 and 2.

==AP Physics 1 and 2==
[[AP Physics 1]] and [[AP Physics 2]] were introduced for the 2015 exam administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/math-and-science/physics | title = AP Physics 1 and 2, 2014–15 | work = AP: Advances in AP | publisher = The College Board | deadurl = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141018200254/http://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/math-and-science/physics | archive-date = October 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The courses were designed to emphasize critical thinking and reasoning as well as learning through inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/2262.html | title = AP Physics 1 Course Home Page | work = AP Central | publisher = The College Board | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141015040347/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/2262.html | archive-date = October 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remain as algebra-based courses that do not require students to have taken calculus.&lt;ref name=CourseAndExam&gt;{{citation | url = http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-physics-1-and-2-course-and-exam-description.pdf | title = AP® PHYSICS 1: ALGEBRA-BASED AND AP® PHYSICS 2: ALGEBRA-BASED – Course and Exam Description – Effective Fall 2014 | publisher = The College Board | location = New York, NY | year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AP Physics 1 covers the same Newtonian mechanics as AP Physics B plus rotational mechanics, as well as an introduction to electricity (Coulomb's Law and simple DC circuits), and mechanical waves and sound.&lt;ref name=CourseAndExam/&gt;

AP Physics 2 covers the remaining subjects from AP Physics B: thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, optics, electricity and magnetism, and modern physics.&lt;ref name=CourseAndExam/&gt;

==AP Physics C==
The College Board offers two courses in the AP Physics C suite, each equivalent to a semester-length [[calculus]]-based [[college]] course for [[Major (academic)|majors]] in [[Outline of physical science|physical science]] or [[engineering]]:&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview/&gt;&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt;

* [[AP Physics C: Mechanics]] studies [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], with units on kinematics; Newton’s laws of motion; work, energy, and power; systems of particles and linear momentum; circular motion and rotation; and oscillations and gravitation.&lt;ref name=PhysCMechoverview&gt;{{citation | url = http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-course-overviews/ap-physics-c-mechanics-course-overview.pdf | format = PDF | title = AP®  PHYSICS C: MECHANICS | publisher = [[College Board]] | date = December 2016 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

* [[AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism]] studies [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], covering electrostatics; conductors, capacitors, and dielectrics; electric circuits; magnetic fields; and electromagnetism.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview&gt;{{citation | url = http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-course-overviews/ap-physics-c-mechanics-course-overview.pdf | format = PDF | title = AP® PHYSICS C: ELECTRICITY &amp; MAGNETISM | publisher = [[College Board]] | date = December 2016 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two AP Physics C courses can be combined to make a unified Physics C course that prepares for both exams.

In [[linguistics]], an '''alphaphonetic pronunciation''' is the pronunciation of an [[alphabet]]ical glyph ("[[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]") with the canonical pronunciation employed in learning the alphabet, rather than in accord with other [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] variants. It is a concept within [[phonemic orthography]], particularly with the pronunciation of [[vowel]]s, in which the alphabetic pronunciation of a letter name is taken as a default and employed in the pronunciation of particular [[word]]s spelled with that letter. [[Phonological change]] may be constrained by the influence of canonical [[alphabet#Pronunciation|alphabet pronunciation]].

== Overview ==
In languages such as [[English language|English]] in which many words have several [[morphophonemic]] variants, the pronunciation of the letters of the alphabet influences an invariant "alphaphonemic pronunciation" of words. The concept is less relevant to languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in which the phonemic orthographies are always alphaphonemic, and thus no distinctions are relevant. The latter type of languages may be said to have "good" or "1:1" grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence.

For example, the letter "a," in English alphaphonemic pronunciation, is pronounced {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} and not {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} as in [[Latin]]-based languages. 
Hence a word like "[[amen]]," which in its original Latin alphaphonemic pronunciation is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} ("ah-men"), in English it is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} ("A-men"). In both American and British English, the English alphaphonemic pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} is colloquially (if not formally) dominant, while the {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} pronunciation is typically regarded as "Latin" or "Latinized" (which, in context of Protestantism, may carry a certain negative connotation of [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] culture and influence).

The English alphaphonemic pronunciation of many words can be confusing to non-English speakers. The letter "i" in English words like "light" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|t}}, "bicycle" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|s|ᵻ|k|əl}}, "triad" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|.|æ|d}}, "final" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|aɪ|n|əl}}, and "spike" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|aɪ|k}} are all pronounced alphaphonemically, and thus differ particularly from other orthographies. (The historic basis for this is in the [[Great Vowel Shift]].) For example, with Latin-based language speakers, a Latin-based pronunciation of "i" is constant, and considers "i" to always indicate {{IPAc-en|ɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|iː}}. In Latin orthography, the English alphaphonemic "I" {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is spelled "ai," not "i," thus the Latin orthographic transcription of English pronunciations would be close the IPA examples above, while their native pronunciations of these English words would unintelligible (variations from English [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], etc. isolated in [brackets],): "light" {{IPA|/ˈliː[x]t/}}, "bicycle" {{IPA|/ˈbiːsikl[ɛ]/}}, "triad" {{IPA|/ˈtriː[aː]d/}}, "final" {{IPA|/ˈfiːn[aː]l/}}, and "spike" {{IPA|/ˈspiːk[ɛ]/}}.

As these examples show, because English alphaphonemics deviate significantly from Latinate pronunciations, the correspondence of English word spellings with their correct English pronunciations are not intuitively obvious to a learner.

'''Aquacultural engineering''' is a multidisciplinary field of [[engineering]] that aims to solve technical problems associated with farming aquatic [[vertebrates]], [[invertebrates]], and [[algae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Wheaton|title=Aquacultural Engineering|edition= |publisher=Kreiger Pub Co|year=1933 |page= |isbn= 978-0-8946-4786-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common aquaculture systems requiring optimization and engineering include sea cages, [[ponds]], and recirculating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Odd-Ivar Lekang|title=Aquaculture Engineering|edition= 2nd |publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons|year=2013|page=165 |isbn=978-0-470-67085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design and management of these systems is based on their production goals and the economics of the farming operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colt |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1990 |month= |title=The Role of Engineering Disciplines in Aquaculture|url= |journal=iChemE Symposium Series No. 111 |issn= |volume= |issue= |pages=1–17 |id=|accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquaculture technology is varied with design and development requiring knowledge of mechanical, biological and environmental systems along with [[material engineering]] and [[instrumentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas B. Lawson|title=Fundamentals of Aquaculture Engineering|edition= |publisher=Springer US|year=1995|page= |isbn=978-1-4615-7049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, engineering techniques often involve solutions borrowed from [[wastewater treatment]], fisheries, and traditional agriculture.

Aquacultural engineering has played a role in the expansion of the aquaculture industry, which now accounts for half of all [[seafood products]] consumed in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5555e.pdf|title=2016 The State of the Worlds Fisheries and Aquaculture|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Food and Agriculture Organization|publisher=United Nations|location=Rome, Italy|page=77|isbn=978-92-5-109185-2|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; To identify effective solutions the discipline is combined with both fish physiology and business economics knowledge.

==Recirculating aquaculture systems==
[[Recirculating aquaculture systems]] often involve intensive, high-density culture of a species with limited water usage and extensive filtration. In a typical recirculating aquaculture system, a series of filtration steps maintains a high level of water quality that promotes rapid fish growth.&lt;ref name="Timmons"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Timmons and James B. Ebeling|title=Recirculating Aquaculture|edition= 3rd |publisher=Ithaca Publishing Company Publishers|year=2013|page=3 |isbn=978-0971264656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steps include solids removal, biofiltration, oxygenation, and pumping, with each one requiring different equipment and engineering considerations. Comprehensive instrumentation and sensor controls are required to monitor this equipment and the underlying water conditions such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH. Development of recirculating aquaculture systems is still underway in 2017, and engineering advances are needed to make the systems economically viable for culturing most species.

==Research==
The ''Journal of Aquacultural Engineering'' publishes engineers' studies related to the design and development of aquacultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |month= |title=Aims &amp; Scope|url=http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/405852/description#description|trans_title= |journal=Aquacultural Engineering |issn= 0144-8609|volume= |issue= |pages= |id=|accessdate=2009-08-23 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, universities provide aquacultural engineering education often under the umbrella of agricultural or biological engineering.

The '''British Nutrition Foundation''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|251681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC040061}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticised for conflicts of interest and for acting as an industry lobby group.&lt;ref name=BMJSpinwatch/&gt;

==History==
It was founded in 1967 by Professor Alastair Frazer. In 1973 it held its first annual conference. It is based between [[Holborn tube station|Holborn]] and [[Chancery Lane tube station|Chancery Lane]] tube stations. The BNF educational programme, ''Food - a fact of life'', was launched in 1991.

==Aims==
According to its entry in the Charity Commission's register, the aims of the British Nutrition Foundation are:
#to advance the education of the public, and those involved in the training and education of others, in nutrition; and
#to advance the study of and research into nutrition for the public benefit, and to disseminate and publish the useful results of such research.&lt;ref name=CharityCommission&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=251681&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|title= Charity framework|publisher= [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|location= London|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The BNF's team of nutrition scientists conduct academic reviews of published research on issues of diet and public health.&lt;ref name=BNFScienceProg&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Programme|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do?start=2|publisher=British Nutrition Foundation|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They present their reports in the BNF's Nutrition Bulletin, as well as various Task Force reports, intended for both academic and lay dissemination.&lt;ref name=BNFScienceProg/&gt; The BNF also organises educational programs designed to provide accessible information on diet and health for children and young people, aged 3–16+ years.&lt;ref name=BNFEducation&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Programme|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do?start=1|publisher=British Nutrition Foundation|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNF's education website, foodafactoflife.org.uk, provides teaching and learning resources about food and nutrition.&lt;ref name=BNFEducation/&gt;

The BNF receives funding for its projects from a variety of sources, including contracts with the European Commission, national government departments and agencies; food producers and manufacturers, retailers and food service companies; grant providing bodies, trusts and other charities.&lt;ref name=BNFWhoWeAre&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/aboutbnf/values/who-we-are-what-we-do|title= Who we are, what we do|year= 2009|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Concerns have been raised about the BNF's close relationship with the food industry.&lt;ref name=BMJSpinwatch&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://spinwatch.org/-articles-by-category-mainmenu-8/40-pr-industry/5353-independence-of-nutritional-information-the-british-nutrition-foundation|title= Independence of nutritional information?|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]]|location= London|accessdate= 23 February 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425125849/http://spinwatch.org/-articles-by-category-mainmenu-8/40-pr-industry/5353-independence-of-nutritional-information-the-british-nutrition-foundation|archivedate= 25 April 2012|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNF receives funding from almost every large food manufacturer and distributor in the UK, including [[Tate and Lyle]], [[Nestle]], [[PepsiCo]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Sainsburys]].

Furthermore, Paul Hebblethwaite, a member of the BNF board of trustees and its former chairman, has had "a distinguished career in the food industry working for a number of major companies including [[Cadbury-Schweppes]] and [[Chivers-Hartley]]".&lt;ref name=BNFNews&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/attachments/288_Issue%2047%20Spring%202009.pdf|title= BNF News|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also chairman of the Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Trade Association.&lt;ref name=BNFNews/&gt; Many other members of the organisation’s board of trustees and oversight committees are or have been employees of the food industry.&lt;ref name=BNFReport09&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nutrition.org.uk/attachments/330_BNF%20Annual%20Report%202008%2009.pdf|title= Annual Report and Accounts|publisher= British Nutrition Foundation|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BNF is open about its intention to shape UK Government policy on food,&lt;ref name=BNFWhoWeAre/&gt; and this has led to concerns that it is serving as a lobbying group for the food industry which largely funds it.&lt;ref name=BMJSpinwatch/&gt; Derek Shrimpton, former director general, has been quoted as saying: "In the period I was there the foundation was solely taken up with defence actions for the industry." He said that the foundation had been constantly engaged in frustrating government committees aiming to recommend reductions in sugars, salt, and fats.&lt;ref name=CannonG&gt;{{cite book|last=Cannon|first=G|title=The Politics of Food|year=1997|publisher=Century|location=London|pages=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''''[[Candidatus]]'' Brocadia anammoxidans"''' is a [[bacterial]] member of the order [[Planctomycetes]] and therefore lacks [[peptidoglycan]] in its [[cell wall]], and has a compartmentalized [[cytoplasm]].

"''Candidatus'' Brocadia anammoxidans" was the first discovered organism capable of the [[Anammox|anaerobic oxidation of ammonium]], and it is the only organism known to produce [[hydrazine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/11/1109_051109_rocketfuel.html&lt;/ref&gt; This process (dubbed the [[anammox]]-process) was discovered in the 1980s by the [[Gijs Kuenen]] lab in a [[List of waste water treatment technologies|waste water treatment]] plant in [[Delft]], [[Netherlands]]. Ammonium [[oxidation]] is coupled to [[nitrite]] reduction to form the harmless [[dinitrogen]] gas.

The key [[enzyme]] involved in this reaction, [[hydroxylamine oxidoreductase]], is located in an [[organelle]]-like structure called the [[anammoxosome]]. The ability to oxidize ammonium anaerobically makes "''Candidatus'' Brocadia anammoxidans" potentially useful for reducing&amp;mdash;or eliminating&amp;mdash;ammonium from waste water.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

== In waste treatment ==
Because of its ability to eliminate ammonium, a variety of uses have been found for this bacteria, particularly removal of [[nitrogen]] from waste streams.&lt;ref&gt;B. Kartal, G.J. Kuenen and M.C.M van Loosdrecht Sewage Treatment with Anammox, Science, 2010, vol 328 p 702-3&lt;/ref&gt; The first full scale experiment employing the anammox process in the world was built at the waste water treatment plant Dokhaven/Sluisjesdijk in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

Existing treatment plants use bacteria that convert ammonium into [[nitrate]]. The bacteria that do this need oxygen, which must be supplied by electric pumps. [[Denitrifying bacteria]] convert the nitrate into nitrogen gas. These require adding [[methanol]]. This process consumes an average of 44 [[watt-hour]]s per day per person served by the [[sewage]] system.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

Researchers estimate that a [[methanogenic]] digester coupled to a [[nitrification]]-anammox bioreactor could generate 24 watt-hours per person per day, a net swing of 70 watt-hours.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt;

The main choice of practice is Christian counseling. It allows aspects of psychology, such as emotion, to be partially explained by Christian beliefs. The understanding of the human mind is thought of as both psychological and spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, R. C. (2012). The Idea of a Christian Psychology.

== History ==
Religious and science scholars have often clashed over the idea of the two subjects being combined, making Christian psychology no stranger to controversy. Christianity has affected the field of psychology throughout history and has influenced the beliefs and works of famous psychologists. in 17th-century Europe, aspects of psychology were thought to go against Christian teachings. For example important figures such as Descartes, Locke, and Leibniz have delayed or altered their ideas to match culturally acceptable beliefs at the time. This is because the publication of psychological theories that went against Christian teachings often resulted in punishment.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is a time period in which several groundbreaking ideas, including those of science and religion were introduced in Western society. Ideas geared toward the Catholic Church teachings were challenged. One scholar describes the shift in ideas during the Enlightenment as gradual and subtle, rather than sudden.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, J.M.(1996). ''Religion and the Enlightenment: From Descartes to Kant''. Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Several philosophers contributed to the introduction of scientific ideas that clashed against religion at the time. One early contributor was a French philosopher, Rene Descartes. He reinforced an Aristotelian concept explaining the human mind that fit teachings of the Church—the idea of a soul. As time progressed, so did the existence and presence of once “radical” ideas. The question on the human ability to fully comprehend the existence of God was introduced by Pascal. Other philosophers, such as John Locke, brought on the concept of deism. Major ideas that influenced psychology and religion at the time were the rejection of “original sin”, acceptance of personal morality without religion, and an emphasis on the individual conscience. However, while this time period brought on many radical ideas that contradicted ideas of the church, that is not to say they were completely rejected. Ideas such as atheism and deism were continued to be perceived as radical schools of thought. Religious teachings still remain influential in modern areas of psychology.

== Significant people ==

===Rene Descartes===
[[Rene Descartes]], a famous French philosopher, contributed to the field of psychology while also keeping the Catholic church's beliefs in mind. Descartes' beliefs were controversial during the 17th-century because some of his beliefs went against Christian teachings. Contrary to Christian teachings, Descartes believed that animals could be understood as a machine that did not have a soul.&lt;ref name="Facher, R. E. 2012"&gt;Facher, R. E. &amp; Rutherford, A. (2012). Pioneers of psychology: A history (4th edition). New York, New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he did not specifically say that humans did not have a soul, Christians found this statement to be controversial because human beings resembled animals. These beliefs were written in his work titled ''The World''. ''The World'' was never published because Descartes feared the Catholic church would punish him for his controversial beliefs.

===John Locke===
[[John Locke]], was an English philosopher, who took the stance of "reason" being "the last judge and Guide in ever Thing" even in religious matters. Evidence was not something he concerned himself with, and instead, was a seeker of consistency, meaning,
and how humans should respond to the desires and especially, their own faith.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Losonsky, M. (2012). Locke and Leibniz on Religious Faith. British Journal For The History Of Philosophy, 20(4), 703-721.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his major contributions to psychology, was his [[Philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], in which this becomes the precursor to explaining the idea of identity and the self.

===Gottfried Leibniz===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], was a Lutheran philosopher, who unlike [[John Locke|Locke]], believed that there are some religious ideas that stand on their own as being irrefutable and incontrovertible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With this in mind, most of his philosophical ideas, including the ones that aided to the foundation of psychological concepts, were hoped to be nonintrusive to the Christian-based beliefs in Europe and also be used unified the division between the Christian denomination. As a major contribution to psychology, Leibniz made a distinction between conscious and unconscious states that [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and other successors would further expand upon centuries later.&lt;ref name="Facher, R. E. 2012"/&gt;

== Modern influences ==

=== Christian counseling ===
[[Christian counseling]] is a manner of psychological therapy that emphasizes the importance of person's relationship with God. Christian counseling utilizes the ideas of Christian psychology in order to properly understand and treat patients. Both Christian psychology and Christian counseling help people understand the self psychologically and in the eyes of God. This specific form of counseling incorporates a person's unique religious views to create a more individualized form of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, R. B. (1999). Christian Counseling: An Emerging Specialty. ''Counseling &amp; Values. 43(3).'' 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climax species, also called '''late [[Sere (ecology)|seral]]''', '''late-successional''', '''[[K-selected]]''' or '''equilibrium''' species, are [[plant]] [[species]] that will remain essentially unchanged in terms of species composition for as long as a site remains undisturbed.  They are the most [[Shade tolerance|shade-tolerant]] species of [[tree]] to establish in the process of [[Ecological succession|forest succession]].  The [[seedling]]s of climax species can grow in the shade of the parent trees, ensuring their dominance indefinitely.  A [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], such as fire, may kill the climax species, allowing [[pioneer species|pioneer]] or earlier successional species to re-establish for a time.  They are the opposite of [[pioneer species]], also known as [[ruderal species|ruderal]], fugitive, opportunistic or [[R-selected]] species, in the sense that climax species are good competitors but poor colonizers, whereas pioneer species are good colonizers but poor competitors.  Climax species dominate the [[climax community]], when the pace of succession slows down, the result of [[ecological homeostasis]], which features maximum permitted [[biodiversity]], given the prevailing [[ecology|ecological]] conditions.  Their reproductive strategies and other adaptive characteristics can be considered more sophisticated than those of opportunistic species.  Through [[negative feedback]], they adapt themselves to specific environmental conditions. Climax species are mostly found in forests. Climax species, closely controlled by [[carrying capacity]], follow [[K strategy|K strategies]], wherein species produce fewer numbers of potential offspring, but invest more heavily in securing the reproductive success of each one to the micro-environmental conditions of its specific [[ecological niche]].  Climax species might be [[Semelparity and Iteroparity|iteroparous]], [[Efficient energy use|energy consumption efficient]] and [[Biogeochemical cycle|nutrient cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html Relationships Among Species] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616010027/http://www.marietta.edu/~mcshaffd/eco/sym/4SPEC98.html |date=June 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputed term==
The idea of a climax species has been criticized in recent ecological literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/doaklab/timberland/timberland/results.htm Results, Analysis of Timberland Owned by San Jose Water Company] 2007-04-27&lt;/ref&gt;  Any assessment of successional states depends on assumptions about the natural fire regime.  But the idea of a dominant species is still widely used in [[Silviculture|silvicultural]] programs and [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|California Department of Forestry]] literature.

==Examples==

[[Picea glauca|White spruce]] (''Picea glauca'') is an example of a climax species in the northern forests of North America.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2361">'''Conceptual architecture''' is a form of architecture that utilizes [[conceptualism]], characterized by an introduction of ideas or concepts from outside of architecture often as a means of expanding the discipline of architecture. This produces an essentially different kind of building than one produced by the widely held 'architect as a master-builder' model, in which craft and construction are the guiding principles. The finished building as product is less important in conceptual architecture, than the ideas guiding them, ideas represented primarily by texts, diagrams, or art installations. Architects that work in this vein are [[Diller and Scofidio|Diller + Scofidio]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], [[Peter Eisenman]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]].

Conceptual architecture was studied in the essay, ''Notes on Conceptual Architecture: Towards a Definition'' by [[Peter Eisenman]] in 1970, and again by the Harvard Design Magazine in Fall of 2003 and Winter 2004, by a series of articles under the heading ''Architecture as Conceptual Art''. But the understanding of design as a construction of a concept was understood by many [[modern architecture|modernist architects]] as well. To quote [[Louis Kahn]] on [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]:

:''It doesn't work, it doesn't have to work. Wright had the shape conceived long before he knew what was going into it. I claim that is where architecture starts, with the concept.''&lt;ref&gt;
Louis Kahn quote from Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture, a critical history.'' page 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy-efficient landscaping''' is a type of [[Landscape architecture|landscaping]] designed for the purpose of [[energy conservation|conserving energy]]. There is a distinction between the embedded energy of materials and constructing the landscape, and the energy consumed by the maintenance and operations of a landscape.

Design techniques include:
* Planting [[trees]] for the purpose of providing [[shade (shadow)|shade]], which reduces cooling costs.
* Planting or building [[windbreak]]s to slow winds near buildings, which reduces heat loss.
* Wall sheltering, where [[shrubbery]] or vines are used to create a windbreak directly against a wall.
* [[Earth sheltering]] and positioning buildings to take advantage of natural landforms as windbreaks.

'''Energy engineering''' or '''energy systems engineering''' is a broad field of [[engineering]] dealing with [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[energy services]], [[facility management]], plant engineering, [[environmental compliance]] and [[alternative energy]] technologies. Energy engineering is one of the more recent engineering disciplines to emerge. Energy engineering combines knowledge from the fields of [[physics]], [[math]], and [[chemistry]] with economic and environmental engineering practices. Energy engineers apply their skills to increase efficiency and further develop renewable sources of energy.
The main job of energy engineers is to find the most efficient and sustainable ways to operate buildings and manufacturing processes. Energy engineers audit the use of energy in those processes and suggest ways to improve the systems. This means suggesting advanced lighting, better insulation, more efficient heating and cooling properties of buildings.&lt;ref name=Berkeley&gt;Berkeley Engineering (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Although an energy engineer is concerned about obtaining and using energy in the most environmentally friendly ways, their field is not limited to strictly renewable energy like hydro, solar, biomass, or geothermal. Energy engineers are also employed by the fields of oil and natural gas extraction.&lt;ref name=Berkeley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AGCAS editors (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Energy minimization is the purpose of this growing discipline. Often applied to building design, heavy consideration is given to [[HVAC]], [[lighting]], [[refrigeration]], to both reduce energy loads and increase [[efficiency]] of current systems. Energy engineering is increasingly seen as a major step forward in meeting [[Carbon neutrality|carbon reduction targets]]. Since buildings and houses consume over 40% of the United States energy, the services an energy engineer performs are in demand.&lt;ref&gt;Science Buddies (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Human beings have been transferring [[energy]] from one form to another since their use of fire. The efficiency of the transfer of energy is a new field. The [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of 1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|energy crisis of 1979]] brought to light the need to get more work out of less energy. The [[United States]] government passed several laws in the seventies to promote increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], such as United States public law 94-413, the [[Federal Clean Car Incentive Program]].&lt;ref&gt;Berman (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power engineering==
Considered a subdivision of energy engineering, [[power engineering]] applies math and physics to the movement and transfer of energy to work in a system.

==Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design==
[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) is a program created by the [[United States Green Building Council]] (USGBC) in March 2000. LEED is a program that encourages green building and promotes sustainability in the construction of buildings and the efficiency of the utilities in the buildings.

In 2012 the United States Green Building Council asked the independent firm [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] to conduct a study on the effectiveness of LEED program. "This study confirmed that green buildings generate substantial energy savings. From 2000–2008, green construction and renovation generated $1.3 billion in energy savings. Of that $1.3 billion, LEED-certified buildings accounted for $281 million." The study also found the summation of all green construction supported 2.4 million jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Booz Allen Hamilton (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
[[Energy efficiency (physics)|Energy efficiency]] is seen two ways. The first view is that more work is done from the same amount of energy used. The other perception is that the same amount of work is accomplished with less energy used in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Battles and Burns (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Some ways to get more work out of less energy is to "Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle" the materials used in daily life. The advancement of technology has led to other uses of waste. Technology such as [[waste-to-energy]] facilities which convert solid wastes through the process of [[gasification]] or [[pyrolysis]] to liquid fuels to be burned. The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] stated that the United States produced 250 million tons of municipal waste in 2010. Of that 250 million tons roughly 54% gets thrown in land fills, 33% is recycled, and 13% goes to [[energy recovery]] plants.&lt;ref name=Crawford_2013&gt;Crawford (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In European countries who pay more for fuel, such as Denmark where the price for a gallon of gas neared $10 in 2010, have more fully developed waste-to energy facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Denmark sent 7% of waste to landfills, 69% was recycled, and 24% was sent to waste-to-energy facilities. There are several other developed Western European countries that also have taken energy engineering into consideration.&lt;ref name=Crawford_2013/&gt; [[Germany]]'s "[[Energiewende]]", a policy which set the goal by 2050 to meet 80% of electrical needs from renewable energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;Baake and Morgan (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The median yearly salary for an energy engineer is $64,587 U.S. dollars. 83% of energy engineers are male while the remaining 17% are female. 65% of energy engineers have less than five years of experience in their profession.&lt;ref&gt;PayScale (June 12, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations==
Energy engineers have one main professional organization. The [[Association of Energy Engineers]] (AEE) founded in 1977. It now has 16,000 members in 89 countries. The organizations main responsibility is to lead energy certification programs to teach individuals across the world and certify as qualified to perform the job of an energy engineer.

==Education==

A bachelor’s degree is a primary requirement of becoming an energy engineer. Some energy engineers are registered [[Professional Engineer|Professional Engineers]] (P.E.); although the completion of that program is not a necessity. Of the 16,000 energy engineers that are in the [[Association of Energy Engineers]] (AEE), 58.4% have post-graduate degrees from accredited colleges. If the engineer is not a P.E. he or she would need a Certified Energy Manager (CEM) or Certified Energy Auditor (CEA) certificate from a group like the [[Association of Energy Engineers]] (AEE). Both CEM and CEA Certifications are recognized by the [[United States Department of Energy]]&lt;ref&gt;https://commonwealthengineers.com/cea-program-receives-recognition-from-department-of-energy/&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student who wants to become an energy engineer does not directly need to get a degree in energy engineering, several universities across the world have established departments or centers offering energy engineering degrees, to better prepare future engineers for their career. One of those programs is the IEP PEM Certification which is offered at [[Virginia Tech]] University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpe.vt.edu/pemcert/&lt;/ref&gt; The Certified Professional Energy Manager (PEM) was created in conjunction by the Institute of Energy Professionals (IEP) and Energy University. Since 2009, Energy University has provided energy efficiency education to more than 130,000 professionals worldwide. The program offers more than 150 courses.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.energymanagertoday.com/energy-university-intros-online-energy-manager-certification-086994/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13593">'''Engaged theory''' is a methodological framework for understanding [[social complexity]]. It takes social life or [[social relations]] as its base category, with 'the social' always understood as grounded in 'the natural', including humans as embodied beings. Engaged theory provides a framework that moves from detailed empirical analysis about things, people and processes in the world&lt;ref&gt;See for example the engaged research associated with Circles of Sustainability. [http://www.CirclesofSustainability.org www.CirclesofSustainability.org]&lt;/ref&gt; to abstract theory about the constitution and social framing of those things, people and processes.&lt;ref&gt;See Paul James, ''Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In'', Sage Publications, London, 2006 [https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Engaged theory is one approach within the broader tradition of [[critical theory]]. Engaged theory crosses the fields of [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[political studies]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], and [[global studies]]. At its most general, the term ''engaged theory'' is used to describe theories that provide a tool box for engaging with the world while seeking to change it.&lt;ref&gt;James Clifford, 'On Ethnographic Authority', Representations, vol. 1, no. 2, 1983, pp. 118–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

One lineage of engaged theory is called the 'constitutive abstraction' approach associated with a group of writers publishing in [[Arena (Australian publishing co-operative)|''Arena Journal'']] such as John Hinkson, Geoff Sharp (1926–2015), and Simon Cooper.&lt;ref&gt;For a book that uses this approach see Simon Cooper, ''Techno-Culture and Critical Theory'', Routledge, London, 2002. One of the most important early pieces of writing in this approach was Geoff Sharp, 'Constitutive Abstraction and Social Practice', ''Arena'', 70, 1985, pp. 48–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related lineage of engaged theory has been developed by researchers who began their association through the Centre for Global Research at [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] in Australia – scholars such as [[Manfred Steger]], [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and Damian Grenfell – drawing upon a range of writers from [[Pierre Bourdieu]] to [[Benedict Anderson]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. A group of researchers at Western Sydney University describe their work as 'Engaged Research'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uws.edu.au/ics/about | title=About ICS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The politics of engagement==

For all of its concern for epistemological grounding (see below), Engaged theory is an approach that is 'in the world'. All theory in some way affects what happens in the world, but it does not always theorize its own place in the constitution of ideas and practices. [[Anthony Giddens]] calls this movement a [[double hermeneutic]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Giddens (1987), ''Social Theory and Modern Sociology'', Cambridge, Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Engaged theory is more explicit than most about its political standpoint. [[Carol J. Adams]] expresses one dimension of this when she writes: 
{{cquote| It is engaged theory, theory that arises from anger about what is, theory that envisions what is possible. Engaged theory makes change possible.&lt;ref&gt;Carol J. Adams in ''Species Matters: Human Advocacy and Cultural Theory'', New York, Columbia University Press, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
However, the other important dimension is that any theory needs to be aware of its own tendencies to be ideologically driven by dominant concerns of its day. [[Liberalism]], for example, with its reductive advocacy of the ideology of 'freedom', fails to be reflexive about this dimension. Similarly, critical theory sometimes fails to be reflexive of what it means to be critical or advocate social change.

== The grounding of analysis ==
All social theories are dependent upon a process of [[abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hartle (1997), ''Self-knowledge in the Age of Theory'', Lanham Rowman and Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; This is what philosophers call [[Epistemology|epistemological]] abstraction. However, they do not characteristically theorize their own bases for establishing their standpoint. Engaged theory does. By comparison, [[Grounded theory]], a very different approach, suggests that empirical data collection is a neutral process that gives rise to theoretical claims out of that data. Engaged theory, to the contrary, treats such a claim to ''value neutrality'' as naively unsustainable. Engaged theory is thus reflexive in a number of ways: 
* Firstly, it recognises that doing something as basic as collecting data already entails making theoretical presuppositions. 
* Secondly, it names the levels of analysis from which theoretical claims are made. Engaged theory works across four levels of theoretical abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See below: ''Modes of Analysis''.) 
* Thirdly, it makes a clear distinction between theory and method, suggesting that a social theory is an argument about a social phenomenon, while an analytical method or set of methods is defined a means of substantiating that theory. Engaged theory in these terms works as a 'Grand method', but not a '[[Grand theory]]'. It provides an integrated set of methodological tools for developing different theories of things and processes in the world.
* Fourthly, it seeks to understand both its own epistemological basis, while treating knowledge formation as one of the basic [[ontology|ontological]] categories of human practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gunter Abel and James Conant, eds (2012) ''Rethinking Epistemology'', Berlin, De Gruyter&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fifthly, it treats ''history'' as a ''modern'' way of understanding temporal change; and therefore different ontologically from a tribal [[saga]] or cosmological [[narrative]]. In other words, it provides meta-standpoint on its own capacity to historicize.

==The modes of analysis==
In the version of Engaged theory developed by an Australian-based group of writers, analysis moves from the most concrete form of analysis – empirical generalization – to more abstract modes of analysis. Each subsequent mode of analysis is more abstract than the previous one moving across the following themes: 1. doing, 2. acting, 3. relating, 4. being.

This leads to the 'levels' approach as set out below:

===1. Empirical analysis (ways of doing)===
The method begins by emphasizing the importance of a first-order abstraction, here called ''empirical analysis''. It entails drawing out and generalizing from on-the-ground detailed descriptions of history and place. This first level either involves generating empirical description based on observation, experience, recording or experiment—in other words, abstracting evidence from that which exists or occurs in the world—or it involves drawing upon the empirical research of others. The first level of analytical abstraction is an ordering of ‘things in the world’, in a way that does not depend upon any kind of further analysis being applied to those ‘things’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719 | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach is a form of engaged theory distinguishing (at the level of empirical generalization) between different domains of social life. It can be used for understanding and assessing [[quality of life]]. Although that approach is also analytically defended through more abstract theory, the claim that economics, ecology, politics and culture can be distinguished as central domains of [[Social Practice|social practice]] has to be defensible at an empirical level. It needs to be useful in analyzing situations on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2013 |author1=Liam Magee |author2=Andy Scerri |author3=Paul James |author4=James A. Thom |author5=Lin Padgham |author6=Sarah Hickmott |author7=Hepu Deng |author8=Felicity Cahill | title= Reframing social sustainability reporting: Towards an engaged approach | url= https://www.academia.edu/4362669 | journal= Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume= 15 | issue= 1 |pages=225–43
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success or otherwise of the method can be assessed by examining how it is used. One example of use of the method was a project on Papua New Guinea called ''[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-8630-9780824836405.aspx Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul James, Yaso Nadarajah, Karen Haive, and Victoria Stead, ''[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-8630-9780824836405.aspx Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development]: Other Paths for Papua New Guinea'', Honolulu, University of Hawaii Press, 2012 ({{ISBN|978-0-8248-3588-0}} hb 978-0-8248-3640-5 pb).&lt;/ref&gt;

===2. Conjunctural analysis (ways of acting)===
This second level of analysis, conjunctural analysis, involves identifying and, more importantly, examining the intersection (the conjunctures) of various patterns of action (practice and meaning). Here the method draws upon established sociological, anthropological and political categories of analysis such as production, exchange, communication, organization and inquiry.

===3. Integrational analysis (ways of relating)===
This third level of entry into discussing the complexity of social relations examines the intersecting modes of social integration and differentiation. These different modes of integration are expressed here in terms of different ways of relating to and distinguishing oneself from others—from the face-to-face to the disembodied. Here we see a break with the dominant emphases of classical social theory and a movement towards a post-classical sensibility. In relation to the nation-state, for example, we can ask how it is possible to explain a phenomenon that, at least in its modern variant, subjectively explains itself by reference to face-to-face metaphors of blood and place—ties of genealogy, kinship and ethnicity—when the objective ‘reality’ of all nation-states is that they are disembodied communities of abstracted strangers who will never meet. This accords with [[Benedict Anderson]]'s conception of 'imagined communities', but recognizes the contradictory formation of that kind of community.&lt;ref&gt;B. Anderson, ''Imagined Communities'', Verso, London, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===4. Categorical analysis (ways of being)===
This level of enquiry is based upon an exploration of the ontological categories (categories of being such as time and space). If the previous form of analysis emphasizes the different modes through which people live their commonalities with or differences from others, those same themes are examined through more abstract analytical lenses of different grounding forms of life: respectively, embodiment, spatiality, temporality, performativity and [[epistemology]]. At this level, generalizations can be made about the dominant modes of categorization in a social formation or in its fields of practice and discourse. It is only at this level that it makes sense to generalize across modes of being and to talk of ontological formations, societies as formed in the uneven dominance of formations of [[tribalism]], traditionalism, [[modernism]] or [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest formulations of the notion of a postmodern level of the economy was John Hinkson, ‘Postmodern Economy: Value, Self-Formation and Intellectual Practice’, ''Arena Journal'', New Series, no. 1, 1993, pp. 23–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Field Archaeology Act'' is a state Act legislating the preservation, interpretation and protection of [[archaeology]] in  the state of [[Minnesota]], [[United States of America]]. The Act is divided into twelve sections.

== Passage and revisions ==
The Act was first brought into force in 1963 and has undergone ten revisions since that time.

== Effects ==
The passage of the Field Archaeology Act in 1963 impacted the practice of archaeology in Minnesota in several critical ways. It provided proscriptions related to the practice of archaeology, banned unlicensed practitioners from conducting archaeological investigations on state sites, and enacted penalties for violations of the Act. It also officially established the Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist, and outlined the licensing process and requirements for archaeologists seeking to work on state sites. In terms of physical archaeological remains and data recovered as a result of field archaeology, the Act explicitly granted ownership and title to the state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=138|title=Field Archaeology Act|last=|first=|publisher=Revisor of Statutes|year=1963|isbn=|location=Minnesota, United States|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological protection ==
The Act affords protection to state archaeological sites under Section 138.32, in that the state "reserves to itself the exclusive right and privilege of field archaeology on state sites, in order to protect and preserve archaeological and scientific information, matter, and objects".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist ==
The Act defines the position of the State Archaeologist, and dictates the lawful duties thereof. The Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist is charged with the following duties:
* Acts as the agent of the state to enforce the Act. 
* Sponsors, engages in, and directs fundamental archaeological research.
* Cooperates with agencies to preserve and interpret archaeological sites.
* Encourages protection of archaeological sites on private property.
* Retrieves and protects artifacts and data discovered on public property.
* Retrieves and protects archaeological remains disturbed by agency construction.
* Helps preserve artifacts and data recovered by archaeological work.
* Disseminates archaeological information through report publication.
* Approves archaeologist's qualifications for licensing to work on public property.
* Formulates licensing provisions for archaeological work on public property.
* Issues emergency licenses for archaeological work on public property.
* Revokes or suspends archaeological licenses due to good cause
* Approves curation arrangements of artifacts and data from state sites.
* Repossesses artifacts from state sites that are not being properly curated.
* Consults with the Minnesota Historical Society and Minnesota Indian Affairs Council regarding significant field archaeology.
* Completes annual reports about the Office of the State Archaeologist's and licensees' activities.
* Reviews and comments on agency development plans that may affect state sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/|title=Our Role|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Archaeological licensing ==
The Act provides that any archaeological work conducted on non-federal public land in Minnesota, requires a permit issued by the Office of the State Archaeologist. There are four kinds of licenses, including 
* Yearly license for reconnaissance/Phase I survey.
* Site-specific license for site evaluations/Phase II.
* Site-specific license for major excavations/Phase III.
* Site-specific license for burial authentications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/professional-archaeologists/manuals-licenses/license-types/|title=License Types|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State archaeologist provides a review and vetting of an archaeologist's qualifications, and forwards the application onto the Minnesota Historical Society for license issuance.

== Burial grounds ==
Burial grounds and cemeteries in Minnesota are governed by the ''[[Private Cemeteries Act (Minnesota)|Private Cemeteries Act]]''. The Act was first enacted in 1976, and has been amended eight times, most recently in 2007. The State Archaeologist oversees the implementation of this Act and has the following associated duties: 
* Authenticates all unrecorded burial sites over 50 years old
* Grants permission for disturbances in unrecorded non-Indian cemeteries.
* Allows posting and approves signs for authenticated non-Indian cemeteries.
* Maintains unrecorded cemetery data.
* Provides burial sites data to the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGEO) -- formerly the Land Management Information Center (LMIC).
* Determines the ethnic identity of burials over 50 years old.
* Helps determine tribal affiliation of Indian burials.
* Determines if osteological analysis should be done on recovered remains.
* Helps establish provisions for dealing with unaffiliated Indian remains.
* Reviews development plans that may impact unrecorded burials.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mn.gov/admin/archaeologist/the-public/resources/laws-and-statutes/|title=Laws and Statutes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Minnesota Office of the State Archaeologist|access-date=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Figleafva.jpg|thumb|A fig leaf cast in plaster used to cover the genitals of a copy of a statue of David in the [[Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum)|Cast Courts of the Victoria and Albert Museum]]. In the reign of [[Queen Victoria]], display of male nudity was contentious and the Queen herself was said to find it shocking. The museum commissioned this fig leaf and kept it in readiness in case of a visit by the Queen or other female dignitaries: the fig leaf was then hung on the figure using a pair of hooks. Today, the fig leaf is no longer used, but it is displayed in a case at the back of the cast's plinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Mercury fig leaf.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] holding the [[caduceus]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], with a fig leaf placed over the genitalia. The fig leaf was placed there under the more "[[chaste]]" [[Pope]]s; later, most such coverings were removed.]]

The expression "'''fig leaf'''" is widely used figuratively to convey the covering up of an act or an object that is embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance, a [[metaphor]]ical reference to the [[Biblical]] [[Book of Genesis]], in which [[Adam and Eve]] used [[ficus|fig]] leaves to cover their [[nudity]] after eating the forbidden fruit from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. Some paintings and statues have the genitals of their subjects covered by a representation of an actual fig leaf or similar object, either as part of the work or added afterwards for perceived modesty.

==History==

In [[Ancient Greek art]], male nakedness, including the [[genitals]], was common, although the female [[Mons pubis|vulval area]] &lt;!--anyone offended by this link may substitute [[groin]]--&gt; was generally covered in art for public display.  This tradition continued in [[Ancient Roman art]] until the conversion of the [[Roman Empire]] to [[Christianity]], when [[heroic nudity]] vanished.  During the [[Middle Ages]], only the unfortunate (most often the [[damnation|damned]]) were usually shown naked, although the depictions were then often rather explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Clark |title=The Nude, A Study in Ideal Form |year=1956 |isbn=0-691-01788-3 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam and Eve were often shown wearing fig or other leaves, following the Biblical description.  This was especially a feature of [[Northern Renaissance]] art.

From about 1530, the developing reaction to [[Renaissance]] freedoms and excesses that led to the [[Council of Trent]] also led to a number of artworks, especially in churches or public places, being altered to reduce the amount of nudity on display.  Often, as in the famous case of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgement]]'', drapery or extra branches from any nearby bush was used. This has been dubbed the "fig leaf campaign". For free-standing statues this did not work well, and carved or cast fig leaves were sometimes added, such as with the plaster copy of Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' displayed in [[Victorian era]] [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David's Fig Leaf|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/stories/david/index.html|publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|accessdate=2017-02-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603175714/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/stories/david/index.html|archivedate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adam and Eve panels on the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', already equipped with fig leaves by [[Jan van Eyck]],  were simply replaced with 19th-century panels copying the figures but clothed.   Many of these alterations have since been reversed, damaging some of the statues.

==Modern day==
[[File:Falk,_Benjamin_J._(1853-1925)_-_Eugen_Sandow_(1867-1925)-_1894.jpg|thumb|right|275px|In this photo, Sandow portrays ''[[The Dying Gaul]]'', a pose taken from an ancient Roman sculpture.]]

[[Eugen Sandow]], often considered the first modern-day [[bodybuilder]], was an admirer of the human physique, and in addition to strongman [[sideshow]]s; he performed "muscle displays" by posing in the nude — save for a fig leaf that he would don in imitation of statues he had seen in [[Italy]] as a boy.&lt;ref name=sandow&gt;{{cite web |last= Anderson |first= R. Christian |url= http://www.sandowmuseum.com/page7.html |title= Sandow Wearing a Figleaf |publisher= SandowMuseum.com |accessdate= 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical use==
[[File:Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden]]'', by [[Masaccio]], before and after restoration. It was painted in 1425, covered up in 1680, and restored in 1980.]]

The expression ''fig leaf'' has a [[pejorative]] [[metaphor]]ical sense meaning a flimsy or minimal cover for anything or behaviour that might be considered shameful, with the implication that the cover is only a token gesture and the truth is obvious to all who choose to see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7746088.stm |title=Cable derides 'fig leaf' tax cuts |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-09-16 | date=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A metaphorical fig leaf is something visible but innocuous, as against a [[coverup]] in which the existence of something may be entirely hidden.

In the context of negotiation, an offer might be characterized as a "fig leaf" if that offer is actually a ploy to conceal a sinister plan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10640">A relationship between '''handedness and sexual orientation''' has been suggested by a number of researchers, who report that heterosexual individuals are somewhat more likely to be right-handed than are homosexual individuals.

The relationship between [[handedness]] and [[sexual orientation]] has been suggested within both sexes and may reflect the biological [[etiology]] of [[sexual orientation]]; work by [[Ray Blanchard]] has linked the relationship to the [[fraternal birth order effect]], which suggests that a man with several older biological brothers is more likely to be homosexual. The theory is still tentative and not all research has been able to confirm the disparity between homosexual and heterosexual men.

== Studies ==

=== Lalumière et al., 2000 meta-analysis ===
Lalumière et al. conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of 20 studies with a total of 6,987 homosexual and 16,423 heterosexual participants. They found that homosexual men had a 34% greater odds of non-right-handedness, and homosexual women had a 91% greater odds (39% overall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lalumière, M.

=== Williams et al., 2000 ===
In a study involving 382 men—278 homosexual and 104 heterosexual—no significant association emerged between handedness and sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Finger-length ratios and sexual orientation|url=https://www.msu.edu/~breedsm/pdf/breedlove2000.pdf|year=2000|author1=Terrance J.

=== Mustanski et al., 2002 study ===

Mustanski et al. examined sexual orientation and hand preference in a sample of 382 men (205 heterosexual; 177 homosexual) and 354 women (149 heterosexual; 205 homosexual). Although a significantly higher proportion of [[Lesbian|homosexual women]] was found to be left-handed compared to heterosexual women (18% vs 10%), no significant differences were found between heterosexual and homosexual men with respect to hand preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Lippa, 2003 study ===

Lippa examined sexual orientation and handedness in a sample of 812 men (351 heterosexual; 461 homosexual) and 1189 women (707 heterosexual; 472 homosexual). Homosexual men were 82% more likely to be non-right-handed than heterosexual men, but no significant differences were found between heterosexual and homosexual women in terms of handedness.  When combining men and women into one large sample, homosexual individuals were 50% more likely to be non-right-handed than heterosexual individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Blanchard et al., 2006 study ===

Blanchard et al. argued that the [[Fraternal birth order and sexual orientation|fraternal birth order effect]] (the probability that a boy will be homosexual increases with the number of older brothers who have the same biological mother) appears to be limited to right-handed men. Moreover, the same study indicates that left-handed men without older brothers are more likely to be homosexual than non-right-handed men who have older brothers.  As Blanchard et al. said in their report, "the odds of homosexuality is higher for men who have a non-right hand preference or who have older brothers, relative to men with neither of these features, but the odds for men with both features are similar to the odds for men with neither".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== BBC survey ===
In a multinational online survey, it was found that gay men and lesbians are more likely to be left-handed (13 and 11%, respectively) than heterosexual men and women (11% and 10%, respectively). Bisexuals of both sexes more often described themselves as ambidextrous than gay or heterosexual individuals of the same sex (bisexual men: 12%; gay and heterosexual men: 8%; bisexual women: 16%; lesbians: 12%; heterosexual women: 8%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/sex/articles/results/handedness.shtml|title=BBC – Science &amp; Nature – Sex ID – Study Results|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bogaert, 2007 study ===
In a study of 373 heterosexual and 538 gay or bisexual men, a link was found between non-heterosexual orientation and extreme right-handedness, but not left-handedness.&lt;ref name=boga&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anthony Bogaert|year=2007|journal=Neuropsychology|title=Extreme right-handedness, older brothers, and sexual orientation in men.|volume=21|issue=1|pages=141–8|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.21.1.141|pmid=17201537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blanchard, 2008 ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'' study ===

A subsequent study by Blanchard found that both right-handed homosexual men and left-handed heterosexual men had a statistically significant number of older male siblings, but that there was no significant observable effect for right-handed heterosexual men ''or'' for left-handed homosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blanchard, 2008 ''Laterality'' study ===

Blanchard discussed ways in which the [[fraternal birth order effect]] and handedness could be explained in terms of the maternal immune hypothesis. In this, the mother is assumed to grow more immune to male [[antigens]] with each pregnancy, and thus produce a greater number of "anti-male" [[antibodies]]. He suggests two possibilities; that non-right-handed fetuses are less sensitive to the antibodies, or that the mothers of left-handed fetuses do not, for some reason, produce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Schwartz et al., 2010 hair whorl study ===
In a sample including 694 gay men and 894 straight men, it was found that 13.9% of gay men and 15.9% of straight men were non-right handed, a non-significant difference. The study replicated the older brother effect for homosexual men, but unlike Blanchard 2006 (see above), it found that the effect applied to both right-handed and left-handed gay men, being in effect stronger for the latter than for the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gene Schwartz et al.|year=2010|journal=Arch Sex Behav|volume=39|pages=93–109|doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9499-1|title=Biodemographic and Physical Correlates of Sexual Orientation in Men|pmid=19387815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kishida and Rahman, 2015 ===
In a sample of 478 heterosexual men and 425 homosexual men, gay men were found to show a significantly greater likelihood of extreme right-handedness and non-right-handedness compared to heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-014-0474-0|title=Fraternal Birth Order and Extreme Right-Handedness as Predictors of Sexual Orientation and Gender Nonconformity in Men|author1=Mariana Kishida|author2=Qazi Rahman|year=2015|journal=[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]|doi=10.1007/s10508-014-0474-0|volume=44|pages=1493–1501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lee Ellis et al., 2016 ===
Among a sample of university students in [[Malaysia]] and the US, it was found that same-sex attraction was linked with left handedness among women. Among men, no such correlation was found after controlling for ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Lee |last2=Skorska |first2=Malvina N. |last3=Bogaert |first3=Anthony F.|title=Handedness, sexual orientation, and somatic markers for prenatal androgens: Are southpaws really that gay? |journal=Laterality |doi=10.1080/1357650X.2016.1151024 |pmid=26932806 |year=2016 |pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asexuality ===

A 2014 Internet study attempted to analyze the relationship between self-identification as [[asexuality|asexual]], handedness and other biological markers, in comparison to individuals of other sexual orientation groups. A total of 325 asexuals (60 men and 265 women), 690 heterosexuals (190 men and 500 women), and 268 non-heterosexuals (64 men and 204 women) completed online questionnaires. The study asserts that non-sexual men and women were 2.4 and 2.5 times, respectively, more likely to be non-right-handed than their heterosexual counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yule MA, Brotto LA, Gorzalka BB |title=Biological markers of asexuality: Handedness, birth order, and finger length ratios in self-identified asexual men and women.|website=Arch Sex Behav|year=2014|pmid=24045903|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0175-0|volume=43|pages=299–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canters studied [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Groningen]]. She went on to study the philosophy of religion with feminist philosopher and theologian Professor [[Grace Jantzen]] at King's College, London University. Canters was awarded a Master of Arts degree. Following this Canters won a scholarship to study for a doctorate at the University of Sunderland under the supervision of Dr. [[Pamela Sue Anderson]] and others.

Her thesis was a study of the Belgian feminist philosopher and former Lacanian psychoanalyst [[Luce Irigaray]], in particular her book ''Elemental Passions''. Eventually, her thesis was supervised by Jantzen and successfully examined.

'''Hermann von Münster''' (c. 1330 - March 1392) was a German master glassmaker, native of [[Münster]], in [[Westphalia]], and active in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]].

== Biography ==
Hermman von Münster  is actually the first stained glass artist to be mentioned by the archives of the Cathedral chapter of [[Metz Cathedral|Saint-Etienne]] of Metz. On August 29, 1381, master Hermann received an annuity of 22 [[Livre tournois|pounds]], to pay for its work on the western large window of the cathedral of Metz. His work was supported by Cardinal William Aigrefeuille, legate of the antipope [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]], who then reorganized the Chapter of Metz. Three years later, on 2 May 1384, the Cathedral chapter negotiated the price of the "GRANT OZ", the western [[Rose window]] with Hermann von Munster. Hermann was still working on the windows of the western facade in December 1384. In August 1385, the Cathedral Chapter borrowed 420 pounds to set the work completed.

In 1388, Hermann bought a home in Metz, beside the cathedral, where he died in March 1392. Thanks to his fame and to the excellent quality of his work, Hermann was buried in the aisle of the cathedral. An epitaph on the north wall of the cathedral indicates in [[old French]]:

CI DEVANT GIST&lt;br&gt;
MAISTRE HARMAN LI VALRIER&lt;br&gt;
DE MUNSTERE AN WAILTEFALLE,&lt;br&gt;
ET FIST LE GRANT OZ DE CEANS,&lt;br&gt;
QUI MORUT LE JOR DE LA NOSTRE DAME&lt;br&gt;
EN MARS M.CCC.IIIIXX et XII.&lt;ref&gt;Here, lies the master glassmaker Hermann, from Münster in Westphalia, who made the great rose window there, and died the day of Our Lady, in March 1392.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The only information known about Herman von Münster concerns of the [[Metz Cathedral|cathedral of Metz]], in particular the large western window of the nave of Metz.

== Technical overview ==
To [[came glasswork|assemble the window]], pieces of colored and painted glass were first laid out on the design board, with the edges of each piece fitted into H-shaped strips of lead. Then, these [[came]]s were soldered to one another. When a panel was completed, putty was inserted between the glass and the lead cames for waterproofing. The entire composition was then stabilized with an iron armature and mounted in the window.&lt;ref&gt;Stained Glass in Medieval Europe, Thematic Essay, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stylistic influences ==
It seems that the style of Herman von Münster is to link to the [[Westphalia|Westphalian context]]. His work is close in style to the work of the master of [[Altenberg (Bergisches Land)|Altenberg]], near Münster. But the figures of the master of Altenberg are less expressive, and stricter. The characters in the bottom of the western windows of Metz, richly dressed, stand under colourful architectural niches. The use of thicker glass, with more sustained tones than in France, far from being an archaism, testifies of the influence that the medieval Rhenish style had on his work.

'''Historical demography''' is the [[quantitative study]] of [[human population]] in the past. It is concerned with population size, with the three basic components of population change--[[fertility]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], and  [[Human migration|migration]], and with population characteristics related to those components, such as marriage, [[socioeconomic status]], and the configuration of families.

==Sources==
The sources of historical demography vary according to the period and topics of the study.

For the recent period - beginning in the early nineteenth century in most European countries, and later in the rest of the world - historical demographers make use of data collected by governments, including [[census]]es and [[vital statistics (government records)|vital statistics]].&lt;ref name="EoPH"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/historical-demography Historical Demography] in [[Encyclopedia of Public Health]], Retrieved on 3 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early modern period, historical demographers rely heavily on ecclesiastical records of baptisms, marriages, and burials, using methods developed by French historian [[Louis Henry]], as well as hearth and poll tax records.

For population size, sources can also include the size of cities and towns, the size and density of smaller settlements, relying on [[field survey]] techniques, the presence or absence of agriculture on [[marginal land]], and inferences from historical records. For population health and life expectancy, [[paleodemography]], based on the study of skeletal remains, is another important approach for populations that precede the modern era, as is the study of ages of death recorded on funerary monuments.

The PUMS (Public User Microdata Samples) data set allows researchers to analyze contemporary and historical data sets.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Andrews, "Public User Microdata Samples (PUMS): Do-lt-Yourself Census Data." ''Indiana Libraries'' (2014) 13#2 pp: 19-26. [https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/IndianaLibraries/article/viewFile/16733/pdf_198 Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of  techniques==
Historical analysis has played a central role in the study of population, from [[Thomas Malthus]] in the eighteenth century to major twentieth-century demographers such as [[Ansley Coale]] and [[Samuel H. Preston]]. The French historian [[Louis Henry]] (1911-1991) was chiefly responsible for the development of historical demography as a distinct subfield of demography.&lt;ref name="Rosental"&gt;Paul-André Rosental, [http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=POPE&amp;ID_NUMPUBLIE=POPE_301&amp;ID_ARTICLE=POPE_301_0097 The Novelty of an Old Genre: Louis Henry and the Founding of Historical Demography], ''Population'' (English edition), Volume 58 –2003/1, Retrieved on 3 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, new research in historical demography has proliferated owing to the development of massive new population data collections, including the Demographic Data Base in Umeå, Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddb.umu.se/index_eng.html, Retrieved on 3 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the Historical Sample of the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iisg.nl/hsn/, Retrieved on 3 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]] (IPUMS).

According to Willigan and Lynch, the main sources used by demographic historians include archaeological methods, parish registers starting about 1500 in Europe, civil registration records, enumerations, national [[census]] beginning about 1800, genealogies and family reconstruction studies, population registers,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Cotts Watkins and Myron P. Gutmann. "Methodological issues in the use of population registers for fertility analysis." ''Historical Methods: A Journal of Quantitative and Interdisciplinary History'' (1983) 16#3: 109-120.&lt;/ref&gt; and organizational and institutional records.  Statistical methods have included model life tables, time series analysis, event history analysis, causal model building and hypothesis testing, As well as theories of the demographic transition and the epidemiological transition.&lt;ref&gt;Willigan and  Lynch, ''Sources and methods of historical demography'' (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David S.

'''[[Attachment theory]]''', originating in the work of [[John Bowlby]], is a [[psychological]], [[Adaptation|evolutionary]] and [[Ethology|ethological]] theory that provides a descriptive and explanatory framework for understanding [[interpersonal relationship]]s between human beings.

In order to formulate a comprehensive theory of the nature of early attachments, Bowlby explored a range of fields including [[evolution]] by natural selection, [[object relations theory]] ([[psychoanalysis]]), [[systems theory|control systems theory]], [[evolutionary biology]] and the fields of [[ethology]] and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name="simpson"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=Simpson JA|title=Attachment Theory in Modern Evolutionary Perspective|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year = 1999|pages=115–140|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-57230-087-6|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were some preliminary papers from 1958 onwards but the full theory is published in the trilogy ''Attachment and Loss'', 1969-&amp;nbsp;82. Although in the early days Bowlby was criticised by academic psychologists and ostracised by the psychoanalytic community,&lt;ref name="Rutter 95"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Rutter M|year=1995|title=Clinical Implications of attachment Concepts: Retrospect and Prospect|journal=Journal of Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|volume=36|pages=549–571 |pmid=7650083|issue = 4|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb02314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; attachment theory has become the dominant approach to understanding early social development and given rise to a great surge of empirical research into the formation of children's close relationships.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaffer R|year=2007|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher= Blackwell|isbn=0-631-21628-6 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief description of theory==
In infants, behavior associated with attachment is primarily a process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure in situations of perceived distress or alarm, for the purpose of survival. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a ''secure base'' to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref name="Bretherton/Mul"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Bretherton I, Munholland KA |title= Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=1999|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |publisher= Guilford press|isbn= 1-57230-087-6|pages=89–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant.

The human infant is considered by attachment theorists to have a need for a secure relationship with adult caregivers, without which normal social and emotional development will not occur. However, different relationship experiences can lead to different developmental outcomes. [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed a theory of a number of [[Attachment in children|attachment patterns]] or "styles" in infants in which distinct characteristics were identified; these were secure attachment, avoidant attachment, anxious attachment and, later, disorganized attachment. In addition to care-seeking by children, peer relationships of all ages, romantic and sexual attraction, and responses to the care needs of infants or sick or elderly adults may be construed as including some components of attachment behavior.

===Earlier theories===
A theory of attachment is a framework of ideas that attempt to explain attachment, the almost universal human tendency to prefer certain familiar companions over other people, especially when ill, injured, or distressed.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, certain social preferences, like those of parents for their children, were explained by reference to instinct, or the moral worth of the individual.&lt;ref name="fildes"&gt;{{cite book|author= Fildes V| year=1988|title=Wet nursing|location= New York|publisher= Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Aboriginer.gif|thumb|left|Father and child]] The concept of infants' emotional attachment to caregivers has been known anecdotally for hundreds of years. Most early observers focused on the anxiety displayed by infants and toddlers when threatened with separation from a familiar caregiver.&lt;ref name="fildes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deS"&gt;{{cite journal|author= de Saussure RA|year=1940|title= JB Felix Descuret|journal=Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume=2|pages=417–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories about attachment were suggested from the late nineteenth century onward.&lt;ref name="Bretherton"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|page=759|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freud]]ian theory attempted a systematic consideration of infant attachment and attributed the infant's attempts to stay near the familiar person to motivation learned through feeding experiences and gratification of [[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|libidinal drives]]. In the 1930s, the British developmentalist [[Ian Dishart Suttie|Ian Suttie]] put forward the suggestion that the child's need for affection was a primary one, not based on hunger or other physical gratifications.&lt;ref name="Suttie"&gt;{{cite book|author= Suttie I |year=1935 |title= The origins of love and hate |location= London |isbn=978-0-415-21042-3|publisher= Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third theory prevalent at the time of Bowlby's development of attachment theory was "dependency". This approach posited that infants were dependent on adult caregivers but that dependency was, or should be outgrown as the individual matured. Such an approach perceived attachment behaviour in older children as [[Regression (psychology)|regressive]] whereas within attachment theory older children and adults remain attached and indeed a secure attachment is associated with independent exploratory behaviour rather than dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Prior and Glaser p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Blatz]], a Canadian psychologist and teacher of Bowlby's colleague Mary Ainsworth, was among the first to stress the need for security as a normal part of personality at all ages, as well as normality of the use of others as a secure base and the importance of social relationships for other aspects of development.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Wright M |year=1996|title= William Emet Blatz|editors=Kimble GA, Wertheimer M, Boneau CA|encyclopedia= Portraits of pioneers in psychology|volume= II|pages=199–212|location= Mahwah, NJ|publisher= Erlbaum|isbn=978-0-8058-2198-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current attachment theory focuses on social experiences in early childhood as the source of attachment in childhood and in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory was developed by Bowlby as a consequence of his dissatisfaction with existing theories of early relationships.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Cassidy J|title=The Nature of a Childs Ties|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year = 1999|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-57230-087-6|location=New York|pages=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early developments===

Bowlby was influenced by the beginnings of the [[Object relations theory|object relations school]] of [[psychoanalysis]] and in particular, [[Melanie Klein]], although he profoundly disagreed with the psychoanalytic belief then prevalent that saw infants' responses as relating to their internal fantasy life rather than to real life events. As Bowlby began to formulate his concept of attachment, he was influenced by case studies by Levy, Powdermaker, Lowrey, Bender and Goldfarb.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 51 quote"&gt;{{cite book|title= Maternal Care and Mental Health|year=1951|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organisation|quote=With monotonous regularity each put his finger on the child's inability to make relationships as being the central feature from which all other disturbances sprang, and on the history of institutionalisation or, as in the case quoted, of the child's being shifted about from one foster-mother to another as being its cause|author=Bowlby J|isbn= 1-56821-757-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the one by David Levy that associated an adopted child's lack of social emotion to her early emotional deprivation.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Levy, D| year=1935|title= American Journal of Psychiatry|volume= 94|pages=643–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby himself was interested in the role played in delinquency by poor early relationships, and explored this in a study of young thieves.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 44"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bowlby J|year=1944|title=Forty-four juvenile thieves: Their characters and home life|journal= [[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]|volume=25 |issue=19–52 |pages=107–127|quote= sometimes referred to by Bowlby's colleagues as "Ali Bowlby and the Forty Thieves"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby's contemporary [[René Spitz]] proposed that "psychotoxic" results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care.&lt;ref name="spitz"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Spitz RA|year=1951|title=The psychogenic diseases in infancy|journal= Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume= 6|pages= 255–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong influence was the work of [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film ''A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital'' illustrating the impact of loss and suffering experienced by young children separated from their primary caretakers. This film was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visiting by parents.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book | author= Schwartz J | title= Cassandra's Daughter: A History of Psychoanalysis | year=1999 | page=225 |publisher= Viking/Allen Lane |isbn= 0-670-88623-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1951 monograph for the [[World Health Organization]], [[Maternal deprivation|''Maternal Care and Mental Health'']], Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that "the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment" and that not to do so may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This proposition was both influential in terms of the effect on the institutional care of children, and highly controversial.&lt;ref name="WHO 62"&gt;{{cite book|contribution= Preface|title=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects|location=Geneva|publisher= World Health Organization|series= Public Health Papers|issue= No. 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was limited empirical data at the time and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby (1988) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{main article|Attachment theory}}
Following the publication of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health'', Bowlby sought new understanding from such fields as evolutionary biology, ethology, developmental psychology, cognitive science and control systems theory and drew upon them to formulate the innovative proposition that the mechanisms underlying an infants tie emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"/&gt; He realised that he had to develop a new theory of motivation and behaviour control, built on up-to-date science rather than the outdated psychic energy model espoused by Freud.&lt;ref name="Bretherton"/&gt; Bowlby expressed himself as having made good the "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" in "Maternal Care and Mental Health" in his later work "Attachment and Loss" published between 1969 and 1980.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 86"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bowlby J|date=December 1986 |title= Citation Classic, ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''|url= http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1986/A1986F063100001.pdf|volume=50|issue= 18|publisher=Current Contents|series=Citation Classics|accessdate = 2008-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby's first official representations were carried out for the relationship theory in three very controversial lectures in 1957 by the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton, Inge: Developmental Psychology (1992), 28, S. 759-775&lt;/ref&gt; The formal origin of attachment theory can be traced to the publication of two 1958 papers, one being Bowlby's ''The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother'', in which the precursory concepts of "attachment" were introduced, and [[Harry Harlow]]'s ''The Nature of Love'', based on the results of experiments which showed, approximately, that infant [[rhesus monkeys]] spent more time with soft mother-like dummies that offered no food than they did with dummies that provided a food source but were less pleasant to the touch.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 58"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowlby J | title = The nature of the child's tie to his mother | journal = Int J Psychoanal | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 350–73 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13610508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby 05"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bowlby J | title= The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds| publisher=Routledge Classics | year=2005 | isbn= 0-415-35481-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HH"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Harlow/love.htm|title= The Nature of Love| year=1958|author=Harlow H|journal=American Psychologist|volume= 13|pages= 573–685|doi=10.1037/h0047884|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VderH"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Van der Horst FC, LeRoy HA, Van der Veer R | year = 2008 | title = "When strangers meet": John Bowlby and Harry Harlow on attachment behavior | journal = Integrative Psychological &amp; Behavioral Science | issn = 1936-3567 | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–388 | doi = 10.1007/s12124-008-9079-2 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/47012q360531r664/fulltext.pdf | accessdate = 2008-09-11| pmid = 18766423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby followed this up with two more papers, ''Separation Anxiety'' (1960a), and ''Grief and Mourning in Infancy and Early Childhood'' (1960b).&lt;ref name="Bowlby 60"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowlby J | title = Separation anxiety | journal = Int J Psychoanal | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 89–113 | year = 1960 | pmid = 13803480 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby 60b"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1960|author=Bowlby J |title=Grief and mourning in infancy and early childhood |journal= The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child |volume=15 |pages=9–52|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, Bowlby's former colleague, [[Mary Ainsworth]] was completing extensive observational studies on the nature of infant attachments in [[Uganda]] with Bowlby's ethological theories in mind.

====Ethology====
Bowlby's attention was first drawn to ethology when he read [[Konrad Lorenz|Lorenz]]'s 1952 publication in draft form although Lorenz had published much earlier work.&lt;ref name="lorenz 37"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lorenz KZ | year = 1937 | title = The companion in the bird's world | journal = The Auk | volume = 54 | pages = 245–273 | doi=10.2307/4078077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this he encountered the work of [[Tinbergen]],&lt;ref name="tinbergen"&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen N | title=The study of instinct |isbn=978-0-19-857722-5| year=1951 | publisher=Oxford University Press|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to collaborate with [[Robert Hinde]].&lt;ref name="3 vans"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van der Horst FC, Van der Veer R, Van IJzendoorn MH | year = 2007 | title = John Bowlby and ethology: An annotated interview with Robert Hinde | journal = Attachment &amp; Human Development | issn = 1469-2988 | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–335 | doi = 10.1080/14616730601149809 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a773405215 | accessdate = 2007-11-30 | pmid = 17852051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he stated "the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests".&lt;ref name="bowlby 53"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bowlby J |title=Critical phases in the development of social responses in man and other animals |year=1953 |series=New Biology|location=London|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Lorenz and Tinbergen1.jpg|thumb|right|Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen]]

Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of "[[imprinting (psychology)#Filial imprinting|imprinting]]" and felt that it might have some parallels to human attachment. Imprinting, a behavior characteristic of some birds and a very few mammals, involves rapid learning of recognition by a young bird or animal exposed to a conspecific or an object or organism that behaves suitably. The learning is possible only within a limited age period, known as a critical period. This rapid learning and development of familiarity with an animate or inanimate object is accompanied by a tendency to stay close to the object and to follow when it moves; the young creature is said to have been imprinted on the object when this occurs. As the imprinted bird or animal reaches reproductive maturity, its courtship behavior is directed toward objects that resemble the imprinting object. Bowlby's attachment concepts later included the ideas that attachment involves learning from experience during a limited age period, and that the learning that occurs during that time influences adult behavior. However, he did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment, nor assume that human development was as simple as that of birds. He did, however, consider that attachment behavior was best explained as instinctive in nature, an approach that does not rule out the effect of experience, but that stresses the readiness the young child brings to social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby (1969) 2nd ed. pp. 220–223&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Lorenz's work had been done years before Bowlby formulated his ideas, and indeed some ideas characteristic of ethology were already discussed among psychoanalysts some time before the presentation of attachment theory.&lt;ref name="hartman"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Hartmann H |year=1950 |title= Psychoanalysis and developmental psychology|journal= Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume= 5|pages= 7–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoanalysis====
Bowlby's view of attachment was also influenced by psychoanalytical concepts and the earlier work of psychoanalysts. In particular he was influenced by observations of young children separated from familiar caregivers, as provided during World War II by [[Anna Freud]] and her colleague Dorothy Burlingham.&lt;ref name="anna"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Freud A, Burlingham DT | title=War and children | year=1943 |isbn=978-0-8371-6942-2 | publisher=Medical War Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Es sci 1937 spainish-civil-war 02 Evacuation.jpg|thumb|left|Evacuee children in 1937]] Observations of separated children's grief by [[René Spitz]] were another important factor in the development of attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Spitz R | year=1945 | title=Hospitalism: An Inquiry into the Genesis of Psychiatric Conditions in Early Childhood}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds. He rejected both Freudian "[[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|drive-theory]]", which he called the [[Cupboard Love]] theory of relationships, and early object-relations theory as both in his view failed to see the attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes pp. 62–3&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking in terms of primary attachment and neo-darwinism, Bowlby identified as what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis, namely the overemphasis of internal dangers at the expense of external threat, and the picture of the development of personality via linear "phases" with "[[regression (psychology)|regression]]" to fixed points accounting for psychological illness. Instead he posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes pp. 64–5&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internal working model====
The important concept of the internal working model of social relationships was adopted by Bowlby from the work of the philosopher [[Kenneth Craik]],&lt;ref name="Craik"&gt;{{cite book|author= Craik K |year=1943|title= The Nature of Explanation|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-09445-0|publisher= Cambridge University Press |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had noted the adaptiveness of the ability of thought to predict events, and stressed the survival value of and natural selection for this ability. According to Craik, prediction occurs when a "small-scale model" consisting of brain events is used to represent not only the external environment, but the individual's own possible actions. This model allows a person to mentally try out alternatives and to use knowledge of the past in responding to the present and future. At about the same time that Bowlby was applying Craik's ideas to the study of attachment, other psychologists were using these concepts in discussion of adult perception and cognition.&lt;ref name="JLaird"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnson-Laird PN |year=1983|isbn=0-674-56881-8 
|title= Mental models|location= Cambridge, MA |publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cybernetics====
The theory of control systems (cybernetics), developing during the 1930s and '40s, influenced Bowlby's thinking.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robbins P, Zacks JM | title = Attachment theory and cognitive science: commentary on Fonagy and Target | journal = J Am Psychoanal Assoc | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 457–67; discussion 493–501 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17601100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The young child's need for proximity to the attachment figure was seen as balancing [[wikt:homeostasis|homeostatically]] with the need for exploration. The actual distance maintained would be greater or less as the balance of needs changed; for example, the approach of a stranger, or an injury, would cause the child to seek proximity when a moment before he had been exploring at a distance.

===Behavioural development and attachment===
[[Behavior analysis of child development|Behaviour analysts]] have constructed models of attachment. Such models are based on the importance of contingent relationships. Behaviour analytic models have received support from research.&lt;ref name="kassow"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kassow DZ, Dunst CJ |year=2004|title= Relationship between parental contingent-responsiveness and attachment outcomes|journal= Bridges|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meta-analytic reviews.&lt;ref name="dunst"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dunst CJ, Kassow DZ|year=2008|title=Caregiver Sensitivity, Contingent Social Responsiveness, and Secure Infant Attachment|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention|volume=5|issue=1|pages=40–56|url=http://www.behavior-analyst-online.org BAO|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309131808/http://www.behavior-analyst-online.org/|archivedate=2008-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments===
Although research on attachment behaviors continued after Bowlby's death in 1990, there was a period of time when attachment theory was considered to have run its course. Some authors argued that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organizing principle with varying behaviors resulting from contextual factors.&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sroufe LA, Waters E |year=1977|title= Attachment as an organizational construct|journal= Child Development|volume= 48 |pages=1184–1199|doi=10.2307/1128475|jstor=1128475|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption  that attachment is expressed identically in all humans.&lt;ref name="Tronick"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tronick EZ, Morelli GA, Ivey PK |year=1992|title=The Efe forager infant and toddler's pattern of social relationships: Multiple and simultaneous|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|pages=568–577|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.4.568|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study conducted in [[Sapporo]], Behrens, et al., 2007 found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main &amp; Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Behrens"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behrens KY, Hesse E, Main M | title = Mothers' attachment status as determined by the Adult Attachment Interview predicts their 6-year-olds' reunion responses: a study conducted in Japan | journal = Dev Psychol | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1553–67 |date=November 2007 | pmid = 18020832 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1553 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/43/6/1553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MainCass"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Main M, Cassidy J |year=1988|title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period|journal=  Developmental Psychology|volume= 24|pages= 415–426|doi= 10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in attachment theory continued, and the theory was later extended to adult romantic relationships by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver.&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1987"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR | title = Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 511–24 |date=March 1987 | pmid = 3572722 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511| url = http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/52/3/511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1990"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1990|title= Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 59|pages= 270–280|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1994"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1994|title= Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships|journal= Psychological Inquiry|volume= 5|pages= 1–22|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Fonagy]] and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship by way of such aspects of cognitive science as mentalization, the ability to estimate what the beliefs or intentions of another person may be.&lt;ref name="Robbins"/&gt; A "natural experiment" has permitted extensive study of attachment issues, as researchers have followed the thousands of Romanian orphans who were adopted into Western families after the end of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by [[Michael Rutter]], has followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption and new relationships, and the physical and medical problems associated with their early lives. Studies on the Romanian adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, have in fact yielded reason for optimism. Many of the children have developed quite well, and the researchers have noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rutter M|date=Jan–Feb 2002| title = Nature, nurture, and development: From evangelism through science toward policy and practice| journal = Child Development| issn = 0009-3920| volume = 73| issue = 1| pages = 1–21| pmid = 14717240
| doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroscientific studies are examining the physiological underpinnings of observable attachment style, such as vagal tone which influences capacities for intimacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Porges S|date=2011| title = The polyvagal theory: Neurophysiological foundations of emotions, attachment, communication, self-regulation|publisher = Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt; stress response which influences threat reactivity (Lupien, McEwan, Gunnar &amp; Heim, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Lupien SJ, McEwan BS, Gunnar MR, Heim C|date=2009| title = Effects of stress throughout the lifespan on the brain, behaviour and cognition| journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 10| issue = 6| pages = 434–445| doi = 10.1038/nrn2639}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as neuroendocrinology such as oxytocin,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Carter CS |date=1998| title = Neuroendocrine perspectives on social attachment and love| journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 23| issue = 8| pages = 779–818| doi=10.1016/s0306-4530(98)00055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Uvnas-Moberg K |date=1996| title = Neuroendocrinology of the mother-child interaction| journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism| volume = 7|  pages = 126–131| doi=10.1016/1043-2760(96)00036-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of studies underscore the fact that attachment is an embodied capacity not only a cognitive one.

===Effects of changing times and approaches===
Some authors have noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. The implication of this connection is that attachment-related experiences (and perhaps attachment itself) may alter as young children's experience of care change historically. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers and being cared for outside the home while the mothers work.[[File:The trinity of life.png|Parents and baby|thumb|right]] This social change, in addition to increasing abortion rates, has also made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries, and has increased the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and even gained some legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp. 152–56&lt;/ref&gt;

One focus of attachment research has been on the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called "day care wars" of the late 20th century, during which the deleterious effects of day care were stressed.&lt;ref name="belsky"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belsky J, Rovine MJ | title = Nonmaternal care in the first year of life and the security of infant-parent attachment | journal = Child Dev | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 157–67 |date=February 1988 | pmid = 3342709 | doi = 10.2307/1130397 | jstor = 1130397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a beneficial result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues and the need for relationship-building through techniques such as assignment of a child to a specific care provider. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to follow through on these considerations, nevertheless a larger number of infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than was the case in the past, and emotional development of children in nonparental care may be different today than it was in the 1980s or in Bowlby's time.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp. 160–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, any critique of attachment theory needs to consider how the theory has connected with changes in other psychological theories. Research on attachment issues has begun to include concepts related to [[behaviour genetics]] and to the study of [[temperament]] (constitutional factors in personality), but it is unusual for popular presentations of attachment theory to include these. Importantly, some researchers and theorists have begun to connect attachment with the study of [[mentalization]] or [[Theory of Mind]], the capacity that allows human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions, and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression or eye movement.&lt;ref name="Fonagy et al."&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Fonagy P, Gergely G, Jurist EL, Target M |year=2002 |title=Affect regulation, mentalization, and the development of the self|location= New York|publisher=Other Press|isbn=1-59051-161-1 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection of theory of mind with the internal working model of social relationships may open a new area of study and lead to alterations in attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp. 165–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===1950s to the 1970s===
The [[maternal deprivation]] hypothesis, attachment theory's precursor, was enormously controversial. Ten years after the publication of the hypothesis, Ainsworth listed nine concerns that she felt were the chief points of controversy.&lt;ref name="WHO 62quote"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Ainsworth MD|year=1962|title= The effects of maternal deprivation: A review of findings and controversy in the context of research strategy|encyclopedia=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects|location=Geneva|publisher= World Health Organization|quote=1) The vagueness of the term "maternal deprivation" used in the description of a child's history of attachment experiences. 2) The lack of clarity of the theory's implications for experiences with multiple caregivers. 3) The implications for the theory of the degree of variability following "deprivation". 4) The question of what specific effects result from "deprivation". 5) The question of individual differences in children's reactions to separation or loss. 6) The question of the degree of permanence of specific effects of "deprivation". 7) The question of delinquency as an infrequent outcome of separation and loss. 8) The question of specifics of deprivation and whether these have to do with the caregiver or the more general environment. 9) Controversies having to do with the effects of genetic defects or of brain damage on the developmental outcome.|series= Public Health Papers|issue= No. 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ainsworth separated the three dimensions of maternal deprivation into lack of maternal care, distortion of maternal care and discontinuity of maternal care. She analysed the dozens of studies undertaken in the field and concluded that the basic assertions of the maternal deprivation hypothesis were sound although the controversy continued.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 123–24&lt;/ref&gt; As the formulation of attachment theory progressed, critics commented on empirical support for the theory and for the possible alternative explanations for results of empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 115–18&lt;/ref&gt; Wootton questioned the suggestion that early attachment history (as it would now be called) had a lifelong impact.&lt;ref name="Wootton"&gt;{{cite book|author= Wootton B|isbn=978-0-313-20339-8

In 1957 found the young relationship theory in the DDR ([[East Germany]]) by an essay of [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] in the ''Zeitschrift für ärztliche Fortbildung'' (magazine for a medical further education) and [[Eva Schmidt-Kolmer]] carried out some journal extracts from Bowlby's essay ''Maternal Care and mental Health'' for WHO.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, J.: ''Über den Verlust mütterlicher Fürsorge in früher Kindheit.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für ärztliche Fortbildung'' 1957, 21/22&lt;/ref&gt; In the following period it came to extensive comparative development psychological in the DDR at the end of the fifties. Examinations between family-bound babies and small children, day and week hayracks-as well as Institution children. The findings could do with regard to the morbidity for the family-bound children, the physical and emotional development as well as adaption disturbances at change of environment. After the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] 1961 it didn't come to any additional publications in the DDR Relationship theory and comparative investigations with family-bound children. The previous ones Research results weren't published further and got like the relationship theory into oblivion in the DDR in the subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fhpotsdam/frontdoor/index/index/docId/226 Plückhahn, Jens: ''Dauerheime für Säuglinge und Kleinkinder in der DDR aus dem Blickwinkel der Bindungstheorie''.

In the 1970s, problems with the emphasis on attachment as a trait (a stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with important organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to consider that "attachment (as implying anything but infant-adult interaction) [may be said to have] outlived its usefulness as a developmental construct..." and that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"/&gt; Children may achieve a given function, such as a sense of security, in many different ways and the various but functionally comparable behaviours should be categorized as related to each other. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept (the organisation of exploration of an unfamiliar situation around returns to a familiar person) as "central to the logic and coherence of attachment theory and to its status as an organizational construct."&lt;ref name="WatCum"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters E, Cummings EM | title = A secure base from which to explore close relationships | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 164–72 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10836570 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00130| url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0009-3920&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=71&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Thompson pointed out that "other features of early parent-child relationships that develop concurrently with attachment security, including negotiating conflict and establishing cooperation, also must be considered in understanding the legacy of early attachments."&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thompson RA | title = The legacy of early attachments | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 145–52 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10836568 |url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0009-3920&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=71&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=145 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific disciplines===

====Psychoanalysis====
From an early point in the development of attachment theory, there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with the various branches of psychoanalysis. Like other members of the [[Object relations theory|British object-relations]] group, Bowlby rejected [[Melanie Klein]]'s views that considered the infant to have certain mental capacities at birth and to continue to develop emotionally on the basis of fantasy rather than of real experiences. But Bowlby also withdrew from the object-relations approach (exemplified, for example, by Anna Freud), as he abandoned the "drive theory" assumptions in favor of a set of automatic, instinctual behaviour systems that included attachment. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on problems similar to those he addressed.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year=1998|title= Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 92–119|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cass 98"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cassidy J|year=1998|title=Commentary on Steele and Steele: Attachment and object relations theories and the concept of independent behavioral systems|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 120–26|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele 98"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year= 1998|title= Debate: Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages=92–119 |doi=10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby was effectively ostracized from the psychoanalytic community.&lt;ref name="Rutter 95"/&gt; More recently some psychoanalysts have sought to reconcile the two theories in the form of [[attachment-based psychotherapy]], a therapeutic approach.

====Ethology====
Ethologists expressed concern about the adequacy of some of the research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalisation to humans from animal studies.&lt;ref name="crnic"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Crnic LS, Reite ML, Shucard DW |year=1982|title= Animal models of human behavior: Their application to the study of attachment|veditors=Emde RN, Harmon RJ |isbn=978-0-306-40849-6 |encyclopedia= The development of attachment and affiliative systems|pages=31–42|location= New york|publisher= Plenum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brann"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Brannigan CR, Humphries DA |year=1972|title= Human non-verbal behaviour: A means of communication|editor=Blurton-Jones N|isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |encyclopedia= Ethological studies of child behaviour|pages= 37–64|publisher= Cambridge University Press|quote=...it must be emphasized that data derived from species other than man can be used only to ''suggest'' hypotheses that may be worth applying to man for testing by critical observations. In the absence of critical evidence derived from observing man such hypotheses are no more than intelligent guesses. There is a danger in human ethology... that interesting, but untested, hypotheses may gain the status of accepted theory. [One author] has coined the term 'ethologism' as a label for the present vogue [in 1970]... for uncritically invoking the findings from ethological studies of other species as necessary and sufficient explanations... Theory based on superficial analogies between species has always impeded biological understanding... We conclude that a valid ethology of man must be based primarily on data derived from man, and not on data obtained from fish, birds, or other primates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schur, discussing Bowlby's use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that these concepts as used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in ethology itself.&lt;ref name="schur"&gt;{{cite journal |quote=Bowlby...assumes the fully innate, unlearned character of most complex behavior patterns...(whereas recent animal studies showed)...both the early impact of learning and the great intricacy of the interaction between mother and litter"...(and applies)..."to human behavior an instinct concept which neglects the factor of development and learning far beyond even the position taken by Lorenz [the ethological theorist] in his early propositions| author = Schur M | title = Discussion of Dr. John Bowlby's paper | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 15 |pages = 63–84 | year = 1960 | pmid = 13749000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Szymon i Krystian 003.JPG|thumb|right|Ready to explore]]
Ethologists and others writing in the 1960s and 1970s questioned the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment, and offered alternative approaches. For example, crying on separation from a familiar person was suggested as an index of attachment.&lt;ref name="SchafEm"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schaffer HR, Emerson PE |year=1964|title= The development of social attachment in infancy|journal= Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, serial no. 94|volume=29|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observational studies of young children in natural settings also provided behaviours that might be considered to indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects and bringing them to the mother, but usually not other adults.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Anderson JW|year=1972|title= Attachment behaviour out of doors|editor= Blurton-Jones N|isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |encyclopedia= Ethological studies of child behaviour|pages=199–216|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ethological work tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, work like that just described led to the conclusion that "[w]e appear to disagree with Bowlby and Ainsworth on some of the details of the child's interactions with its mother and other people". Some ethologists pressed for further observational data, arguing that psychologists "are still writing as if there is a real entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures."&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Jones NB, Leach GM |year=1972|title= Behaviour of children and their mothers at separation and greeting|isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |editor=Blurton-Jones N |encyclopedia= Ethological studies of child behaviour|pages= 217–48|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hinde]] expressed concern with the use of the word "attachment" to imply that it was an intervening variable or a hypothesised internal mechanism rather than a data term. He suggested that confusion about the meaning of attachment theory terms "could lead to the 'instinct fallacy' of postulating a mechanism [[Wikt:isomorphisms|isomorphous]] with the behaviours, and then using that as an explanation for the behaviour". However, Hinde considered "attachment behaviour system" to be an appropriate term of theory language which did not offer the same problems "because it refers to postulated control systems that determine the relations between different kinds of behaviour."&lt;ref name="Hinde 82"&gt;{{cite book|author= Hinde R|year=1982|isbn=978-0-00-686034-1|title= Ethology|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive development====
Bowlby's reliance on [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s theory of cognitive development gave rise to questions about object permanence (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) and its connection to early attachment behaviours, and about the fact that the infant's ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother's absence seems to occur some months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible.&lt;ref name="fraiberg"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fraiberg S | title = Libidinal object constancy and mental representation | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 24 |pages = 9–47 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5353377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby's day that present views can be far more specific than those of Bowlby's time.&lt;ref name="waters2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters HS, Waters E | title = The attachment working models concept: among other things, we build script-like representations of secure base experiences | journal = Attachment &amp; Human Development | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 185–97 |date=September 2006 | pmid = 16938702 | doi = 10.1080/14616730600856016 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;doi=10.1080/14616730600856016&amp;magic=pubmed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Behaviourism====
In 1969, Gerwitz discussed how mother and child could provide each other with [[positive reinforcement]] experiences through their mutual attention and therefore learn to stay close together; this explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment.&lt;ref name="Gewirtz"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Gewirtz N|year=1969|title=Potency of a social reinforcer as a function of satiation and recovery|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 1|pages= 2–13|doi= 10.1037/h0026802}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behaviourism|Learning theory]] saw attachment as a remnant of dependency and the quality of attachment as merely a response to the caregivers cues. [[Behaviourism|Behaviourists]] saw behaviours such as crying as a random activity that meant nothing until reinforced by a caregivers response therefore frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behaviour to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth's research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists view.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 166–73&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decade, [[Behavior analysis of child development|behaviour analysts]] have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of contingent relationships. These behaviour analytic models have received some support from research&lt;ref name="kassow"/&gt; and meta-analytic reviews.&lt;ref name="dunst"/&gt;

===Methodology===
There has been critical discussion of conclusions drawn from clinical and observational work, and whether or not they actually support tenets of attachment theory. For example, Skuse based criticism of a basic tenet of attachment theory on the work of Anna Freud with children from Theresienstadt, who apparently developed relatively normally in spite of serious deprivation during their early years. This discussion concluded from Freud's case and from some other studies of extreme deprivation that there is an excellent prognosis for children with this background, unless there are biological or genetic risk factors.&lt;ref name="Skuse"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Skuse D | title = Extreme deprivation in early childhood--II. Theoretical issues and a comparative review | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–72 |date=October 1984 | pmid = 6480730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1984.tb00172.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoanalyst Margaret Mahler interpreted ambivalent or aggressive behaviour of toddlers toward their mothers as a normal part of development, not as evidence of poor attachment history.&lt;ref name="mahler"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mahler MS | title = A study of the separation-individuation process and its possible application to borderline phenomena in the psychoanalytic situation | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 403–24 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5163236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:ParentsDaughterAug1931.jpg|thumb|left|Parents and child]]

Some of Bowlby's interpretations of the data reported by James Robertson were eventually rejected by the researcher, who reported data from 13 young children who were cared for in ideal circumstances during separation from their mothers. Robertson noted, "...Bowlby acknowledges that he draws mainly upon James Robertson's institutional data. But in developing his grief and mourning theory, Bowlby, without adducing non-institutional data, has generalized Robertson's concept of protest, despair and denial beyond the context from which it was derived. He asserts that these are the usual responses of young children to separation from the mother regardless of circumstance..."; however, of the 13 separated children who received good care, none showed protest and despair, but "coped with separation from the mother when cared for in conditions from which the adverse factors which complicate institutional studies were absent".&lt;ref name="robertson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson J, Robertson J | title = Young children in brief separation. A fresh look | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 264–315 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5163230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second volume of the trilogy, ''Separation'', published two years later, Bowlby acknowledged that Robertsons foster study had caused him to modify his views on the traumatic consequences of separation in which insufficient weight was given to the influence of skilled care from a familiar substitute.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have questioned the idea of attachment patterns, thought to be measured by techniques like the Strange Situation Protocol. Such techniques yield a taxonomy of categories considered to represent qualitative difference in attachment relationships (for example, secure attachment versus avoidant). However, a categorical model is not necessarily the best representation of individual difference in attachment. An examination of data from 1139 15-month-olds showed that variation was continuous rather than falling into natural groupings.&lt;ref name="FraSpe2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraley RC, Spieker SJ | title = Are infant attachment patterns continuously or categorically distributed? A taxometric analysis of strange situation behavior | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–404 |date=May 2003 | pmid = 12760508| url = http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/39/3/387 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.39.3.387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism introduces important questions for attachment typologies and the mechanisms behind apparent types, but in fact has relatively little relevance for attachment theory itself, which "neither requires nor predicts discrete patterns of attachment."&lt;ref name="WatBea"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters E, Beauchaine TP | title = Are there really patterns of attachment? Comment on Fraley and Spieker (2003) | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–22; discussion 423–9 |date=May 2003 | pmid = 12760512 |url = http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/39/3/417 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.39.3.417}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was noted above, ethologists have suggested other behavioural measures that may be of greater importance than Strange Situation behaviour.[[File:Khmerchildren.jpg|thumb|right|Children]]

===1980s on===
Following the argument made in the 1970s that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organising principle with varying behaviours resulting from contextual factors,&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"/&gt; later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption  that attachment is expressed identically in all humans.&lt;ref name="Tronick"/&gt; Various studies appeared to show cultural differences but a 2007 study conducted in [[Sapporo]] in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main &amp; Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Behrens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MainCass"/&gt;

Recent critics such as [[Judith Rich Harris|J. R. Harris]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Jerome Kagan]] are generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism ([[Nature versus nurture]]) and stress the possible effects of later experience on personality.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Nurture Assumption]]: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do|isbn=978-0-684-84409-1 |author=Harris JR|year=1998|location=New York|publisher=Free press |authorlink=Judith Rich Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-14-027605-3 
|author=Pinker S|title=[[The Blank Slate]]: The Modern Denial of Human Nature| publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|year=2002 |authorlink=Steven Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kagan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kagan J|year=1994|isbn=978-0-674-89033-6 |title=Three Seductive Ideas|location= Cambridge, MA|publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the earlier work on [[temperament]] of [[Stella Chess]], Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory [[etiology]] was based, arguing that heredity was far more important than the transient effects of early environment, for example a child with an inherent difficult temperament would not illicit sensitive behavioural responses from their care giver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 248–64&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has not bourne out  Kagan's argument and broadly demonstrates that it is the caregivers' behaviours that form the child's attachment style although how this style is expressed may differ with temperament.&lt;ref name="Pearce,2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pearce R|year=2009|title= Attachment Theory Predicts the Formation of Romantic Relationships|journal= Griffith University Undergraduate Psychology Journal|url= http://www104.griffith.edu.au/index.php/psyche/article/viewFile/137/286|format=PDF|volume= 1|pages= 25–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris and Pinker have put forward the notion that the influence of parents has been much exaggerated and that socialisation takes place primarily in peer groups, although H. Rudolph Schaffer concludes that parents and peers fulfill different functions and have distinctive roles in children's development.&lt;ref name="schaffer"&gt;{{cite book|author =Schaffer HR|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher=Blackwell|year = 2004|isbn=978-0-631-21627-8|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Concern about attachment theory has been raised with regard to the fact that infants often have multiple relationships, within the family as well as in child care settings, and that the [[wikt:dyadic|dyadic]] model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences.&lt;ref name="McHale"&gt;{{cite journal|author= McHale JP|year=2007|title=When infants grow up in multiperson relationship systems|journal= Infant Mental Health Journal|volume= 28|pages= 370–92|doi= 10.1002/imhj.20142|issue= 4|pmc= 3079566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''History of science''' is the study of the development of [[science]] and scientific knowledge, including both the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s. (The history of the arts and humanities is termed [[history of scholarship]].) [[Science]] is a body of [[empirical knowledge|empirical]], [[theory|theoretical]], and [[Procedural knowledge|practical]] knowledge about the [[Nature|natural world]], produced by scientists who emphasize the observation, [[scientific explanation|explanation]], and prediction of real world [[phenomenon|phenomena]]. [[Historiography of science]], in contrast, studies the methods employed by historians of science.

The English word ''scientist'' is relatively recent—first coined by [[William Whewell]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/sciencecomma/2015/04/09/whewell-and-the-coining-of-scientist-in-the-quarterly-review/|title=Whewell and the coining of 'scientist' in the Quarterly Review » Science Comma|website=blogs.kent.ac.uk|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, investigators of nature called themselves "[[natural philosophers]]". While [[empirical]] [[Discovery (observation)|investigations]] of the natural world have been described since [[classical antiquity]] (for example by [[Thales]] and [[Aristotle]]), and [[scientific method]] has been employed since the [[Middle Ages]] (for example, by [[Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Roger Bacon]]), modern science began to develop in the [[early modern period]], and in particular in the [[scientific revolution]] of 16th- and 17th-century Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendrix|first=Scott E. |title=Natural Philosophy or Science in Premodern Epistemic Regimes?

[[William Cecil Dampier|William C. Dampier-Whetham]], "Science", in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed. (New York: 1911); "Science comprises, first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking." [[Marshall Clagett]], ''Greek Science in Antiquity'' (New York: Collier Books, 1955); "Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation.  Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed."

From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golinski |first=Jan  |year=2001 |title=Making Natural Knowledge: Constructivism and the History of Science |edition= reprint |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226302324 |page=2 | quote=When [history of science] began, during the eighteenth century, it was practiced by scientists (or "natural philosophers") with an interest in validating and defending their enterprise.  They wrote histories in which ... the science of the day was exhibited as the outcome of the progressive accumulation of human knowledge, which was an integral part of moral and cultural development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of [[Thomas Kuhn]], tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137: "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient civilizations systematically collected astronomical observations. Rather than speculate on the material nature of the planets and stars, the ancients charted the relative positions of celestial bodies, often inferring their influence on human society. This demonstrates how ancient investigators generally employed a holistic  intuition, assuming the interconnectedness of all things, whereas modern science rejects such conceptual leaps.

Basic facts about human physiology were known in some places, and [[alchemy]] was practiced in several civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;See Homer's ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D219 4.227–232] '[The Egyptians] are of the race of [[Paean (god)|Paeeon]] [(physician to the gods)]'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example [[Joseph Needham]] (1974, 1976, 1980, 1983) and his co-authors, ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'', '''V''', Cambridge University Press, specifically:

These physicians, who could be either male or female, also dressed wounds, set limbs, and performed simple surgeries. The ancient Mesopotamians also practiced [[prophylaxis]] and took measures to prevent the spread of disease.&lt;ref name="McIntosh2005"/&gt;

The ancient Mesopotamians had extensive knowledge about the chemical properties of clay, sand, metal ore, [[bitumen]], stone, and other natural materials, and applied this knowledge to practical use in manufacturing [[pottery]], [[faience]], glass, soap, metals, [[lime plaster]], and waterproofing. [[Metallurgy]] required scientific knowledge about the properties of metals. Nonetheless, the Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in gathering information about the natural world for the mere sake of gathering information and were far more interested in studying the manner in which the gods had ordered the universe. Biology of non-human organisms was generally only written about in the context of mainstream academic disciplines. [[Animal physiology]] was studied extensively for the purpose of [[divination]]; the anatomy of the [[liver]], which was seen as an important organ in [[haruspicy]], was studied in particularly intensive detail.

[[File:SumerianClayTablet,palm-sized422BCE.jpg|thumb|[[Mesopotamian]] clay tablet, 492 BC. Writing allowed the recording of [[Astronomy|astronomical]] information.]]

In [[Babylonian astronomy]], records of the motions of the [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[moon]] are left on thousands of [[clay tablet]]s created by [[scribe]]s. Even today, astronomical periods identified by Mesopotamian proto-scientists are still widely used in Western calendars such as the [[solar year]] and the [[lunar month]]. Using these data they developed arithmetical methods to compute the changing length of daylight in the course of the year and to predict the appearances and disappearances of the Moon and planets and eclipses of the Sun and Moon.  Only a few astronomers' names are known, such as that of [[Kidinnu]], a [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] astronomer and mathematician. Kiddinu's value for the solar year is in use for today's calendars. Babylonian astronomy was "the first and highly successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena." According to the historian A. Aaboe, "all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy, in the Hellenistic world, in India, in Islam, and in the West—if not indeed all subsequent endeavour in the exact sciences—depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Scientific Astronomy in Antiquity |author=Aaboe, A. |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] |volume=276 |issue=1257|date=2 May 1974 |pages=21–42|ref=harv |doi=10.1098/rsta.1974.0007 |bibcode=1974RSPTA.276...21A |jstor=74272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3-4-5 [[right triangle]] and other rules of geometry were used to build rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt was also a center of [[Alchemy#History|alchemy]] research for much of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]]. The [[Edwin Smith papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document that attempts to describe and analyse the brain: it might be seen as the very beginnings of modern [[neuroscience]]. However, while [[Egyptian medicine]] had some effective practices, it was often ineffective and sometimes harmful. Medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology, for example, was largely ineffective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf Microsoft Word – Proceedings-2001.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062556/http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf |date=7 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it applied the following components to the treatment of disease: examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Edwin-Smith-papyrus |title=Edwin Smith papyrus: Egyptian medical book |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which display strong parallels to the basic [[empirical method]] of science and, according to G.E.R. Lloyd,&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, G.E.R.  "The development of empirical research", in his ''Magic, Reason and Experience: Studies in the Origin and Development of Greek Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; played a significant role in the development of this methodology. The [[Ebers papyrus]] (c. 1550 BC) also contains evidence of traditional [[empiricism]].

{{Main|History of science in classical antiquity}}
[[File:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plato's Academy]]. 1st century [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]]]]

In [[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]], the inquiry into the workings of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investigations known as [[natural philosophy]]. The ancient people who are considered the first ''[[scientists]]'' may have thought of themselves as ''natural philosophers'', as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers).

The earliest Greek philosophers, known as the [[pre-Socratics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|pp=3,37}} called the pre-Socratics the transition from ''[[Mythology|mythos]]'' to ''[[logos]]''&lt;/ref&gt; provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their neighbors: "How did the ordered [[cosmos]] in which we live come to be?"&lt;ref&gt;[[F.M. Cornford]], ''Principium Sapientiae: The Origins of Greek Philosophical Thought'', (Gloucester, Massachusetts, Peter Smith, 1971), p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-Socratic philosopher [[Thales]] (640–546 BC), dubbed the "father of science", was the first to postulate non-supernatural explanations for natural phenomena. For example, that land floats on water and that earthquakes are caused by the agitation of the water upon which the land floats, rather than the god Poseidon.&lt;ref&gt;Arieti, James A. ''Philosophy in the ancient world: an introduction'', p. 45 [https://books.google.com/?id=L0w6kvdKJ8QC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=thales+earthquakes&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8nb_TqSrFuGmiQKq0siMCA&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=thales%20earthquakes&amp;f=false].

This was greatly expanded on by his pupil [[Democritus]] and later [[Epicurus]].

Subsequently, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations of nature. Their development of [[deductive reasoning]] was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry.  Plato founded the [[Platonic Academy]] in 387 BC, whose motto was "Let none unversed in geometry enter here", and turned out many notable philosophers.  Plato's student Aristotle introduced [[empiricism]] and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction, thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=De Lacy |last=O'Leary |authorlink=De Lacy O'Leary |year=1949 |title=How Greek Science Passed to the Arabs |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul  |isbn=978-0-7100-1903-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle also produced [[Aristotle's biology|many biological writings]] that were empirical in nature, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life.

[[File:Archimedes pi.svg|thumb|upright=1.5&lt;!--fmt low-aspect image--&gt;|Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]] to approximate the value of [[pi|π]].]]

The important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in [[anatomy]], [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[mineralogy]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]]; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;[[G.E.R. Lloyd]], ''Early Greek Science: Thales to Aristotle'', (New York: W.W. Norton, 1970), pp. 144–146.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hellenistic age]] scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought: the application of [[mathematics]] and deliberate empirical research, in their scientific investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd (1973), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophers]], to medieval [[Early Islamic philosophy|Muslim philosophers]] and [[Islamic science|scientists]], to the European [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], to the secular [[science]]s of the modern day.
Neither reason nor inquiry began with the Ancient Greeks, but the [[Socratic method]] did, along with the idea of [[Substantial form|Forms]], great advances in [[geometry]], [[logic]], and the natural sciences. According to [[Benjamin Farrington]], former Professor of [[Classics]] at [[Swansea University]]:
:"Men were weighing for thousands of years before [[Archimedes]] worked out the laws of equilibrium; they must have had practical and intuitional knowledge of the principles involved. What Archimedes did was to sort out the theoretical implications of this practical knowledge and present the resulting body of knowledge as a logically coherent system."

and again:

:"With astonishment we find ourselves on the threshold of modern science. Nor should it be supposed that by some trick of translation the extracts have been given an air of modernity. Far from it. The vocabulary of these writings and their style are the source from which our own vocabulary and style have been derived."&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Science'', many editions, such as the paperback by Penguin Books.

[[File:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Schematic of the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (150–100 BC).]]

The astronomer [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known person to propose a heliocentric model of the solar system, while the geographer [[Eratosthenes]] accurately calculated the circumference of the Earth. [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190&amp;nbsp;– c. 120 BC) produced the first systematic [[Timeline of astronomical maps, catalogs, and surveys|star catalog]].  The level of achievement in Hellenistic [[astronomy]] and [[engineering]] is impressively shown by the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (150–100 BC), an [[analog computer]] for calculating the position of planets.  Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical [[astronomical clock]]s appeared in Europe.&lt;ref name=insearchoflosttime&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Marchant | first1=Jo | year=2006 | title=In search of lost time | url=| journal=Nature | volume=444 | issue=7119| pages=534–538 | doi=10.1038/444534a | pmid=17136067 | bibcode=2006Natur.444..534M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], [[Hippocrates]] (c. 460 BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 370 BC) and his followers were the first to describe many diseases and medical conditions and developed the [[Hippocratic Oath]] for physicians, still relevant and in use today. [[Herophilos]] (335–280 BC) was the first to base his conclusions on dissection of the human body and to describe the [[nervous system]]. [[Galen]] (129&amp;nbsp;– c. 200 AD) performed many audacious operations—including brain and eye [[surgery|surgeries]]— that were not tried again for almost two millennia.

[[Theophrastus]] wrote some of the earliest descriptions of plants and animals, establishing the first [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and looking at minerals in terms of their properties such as [[hardness]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] produced what is one of the largest [[encyclopedia]]s of the natural world in 77 AD, and must be regarded as the rightful successor to Theophrastus.  For example, he accurately describes the [[octahedral]] shape of the [[diamond]], and proceeds to mention that diamond dust is used by [[engraver]]s to cut and polish other gems owing to its great hardness. His recognition of the importance of [[crystal]] shape is a precursor to modern [[crystallography]], while mention of numerous other minerals presages [[mineralogy]]. He also recognises that other minerals have characteristic crystal shapes, but in one example, confuses the [[crystal habit]] with the work of [[lapidaries]]. He was also the first to recognise that [[amber]] was a fossilized resin from pine trees because he had seen samples with trapped insects within them.

'''Mathematics:''' The earliest traces of mathematical knowledge in the Indian subcontinent appear with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (c. 4th millennium BC ~ c. 3rd millennium BC).  The people of this civilization made bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4:2:1, considered favorable for the stability of a brick structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Projects/Pearce/Chapters/Ch3.html|title=3: Early Indian culture – Indus civilisation|work=st-and.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also tried to standardize measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy. They designed a ruler—the ''Mohenjo-daro ruler''—whose unit of length (approximately 1.32&amp;nbsp;inches or 3.4 centimetres) was divided into ten equal parts.  Bricks manufactured in ancient Mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bisht |first=R.S.|year=1982|chapter=Excavations at Banawali: 1974–77|editor=Possehl, Gregory L. |title=Harappan Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective|pages=113–124 |publisher=Oxford and IBH Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian astronomer and mathematician [[Aryabhata]] (476–550), in his ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499) introduced a number of [[trigonometric functions]] (including [[sine]], [[versine]], [[cosine]] and [[inverse sine]]), [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] [[Aryabhata's sine table|tables]], and techniques and [[algorithm]]s of [[algebra]].

In particular, [[Madhava of Sangamagrama]] is considered the "founder of [[mathematical analysis]]".&lt;ref&gt;George G. Joseph (1991). ''The crest of the peacock''. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astronomy:''' The first textual mention of astronomical concepts comes from the [[Veda]]s, religious literature of India.&lt;ref name=Sarma-Ast-Ind&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last =Sarma|first = K.V.|date = 2008 |encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|editor-last = Selin|editor-first = Helaine|doi= 10.1007/978-1-4020-4425-0_9554|publisher = Springer, Dordrecht|isbn = 978-1-4020-4425-0|pages = 317–321|chapter = Astronomy in India}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sarma (2008): "One finds in the [[Rigveda]] intelligent speculations about the genesis of the universe from nonexistence, the configuration of the universe, the [[Spherical Earth|spherical self-supporting earth]], and the year of 360 days divided into 12 equal parts of 30 days each with a periodical intercalary month.".&lt;ref name=Sarma-Ast-Ind/&gt; The first 12 chapters of the ''Siddhanta Shiromani'', written by [[Bhāskara II|Bhāskara]] in the 12th century, cover topics such as: mean longitudes of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; syzygies; lunar eclipses; solar eclipses; latitudes of the planets; risings and settings; the moon's crescent; conjunctions of the planets with each other; conjunctions of the planets with the fixed stars; and the patas of the sun and moon. The 13 chapters of the second part cover the nature of the sphere, as well as significant astronomical and trigonometric calculations based on it.

[[Nilakantha Somayaji]]'s astronomical treatise the [[Tantrasangraha]] similar in nature to the [[Tychonic system]] proposed by [[Tycho Brahe]] had been the most accurate astronomical model until the time of [[Johannes Kepler]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;George G. Joseph (2000). ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', p. 408. [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linguistics:''' Some of the earliest linguistic activities can be found in [[Iron Age India]] (1st millennium BC) with the analysis of [[Sanskrit]] for the purpose of the correct recitation and interpretation of [[Vedas|Vedic]] texts. The most notable grammarian of [[Sanskrit]] was {{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}} (c. 520–460 BC), whose grammar formulates close to 4,000 rules which together form a compact [[generative grammar]] of Sanskrit. Inherent in his analytic approach are the concepts of the [[phoneme]], the [[morpheme]] and the [[root]].

'''Medicine:''' Findings from [[Neolithic]] graveyards in what is now Pakistan show evidence of proto-dentistry among an early farming culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coppa|first1=A.|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7085/pdf/440755a.pdf|title=Early Neolithic tradition of dentistry: Flint tips were surprisingly effective for drilling tooth enamel in a prehistoric population |journal=Nature |volume=440 |date=6 April 2006 |doi=10.1038/440755a |pages=755–756 |pmid=16598247 |issue=7085 |ref=harv |bibcode=2006Natur.440..755C |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ayurveda]] is a system of traditional medicine that originated in ancient India before 2500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Pullaiah| title=Biodiversity in India, Volume 4| publisher=Daya Books| year=2006| page=83| url=https://books.google.com/?id=M0ucOe89GZMC&amp;pg=PA83| isbn=978-81-89233-20-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now practiced as a form of [[alternative medicine]] in other parts of the world. Its most famous text is the [[Sushruta Samhita|Suśrutasamhitā]] of [[Sushruta|Suśruta]], which is notable for describing procedures on various forms of [[surgery]], including [[rhinoplasty]], the repair of torn ear lobes, perineal [[lithotomy]], cataract surgery, and several other excisions and other surgical procedures.

'''Metallurgy:''' The [[wootz steel|wootz]], [[crucible steel|crucible]] and [[stainless steel|stainless]] [[steels]] were invented in India, and were widely exported in Classic Mediterranean world. It was known from [[Pliny the Elder]] as ''ferrum indicum''. Indian Wootz steel was held in high regard in Roman Empire, was often considered to be the best. After in Middle Age it was imported in Syria to produce with special techniques the "[[Damascus steel]]" by the year 1000.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Smith, A History of Metallography, University Press, Chicago (1960); Juleff 1996; Srinivasan, Sharda and Srinivasa Rangnathan 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Hindus excel in the manufacture of iron, and in the preparations of those ingredients along with which it is fused to obtain that kind of soft iron which is usually styled Indian steel (Hindiah). They also have workshops wherein are forged the most famous sabres in the world.

===China===
{{Main|History of science and technology in China|List of Chinese discoveries}} {{Further|Chinese mathematics|List of Chinese inventions}}
[[File:Sea island survey.jpg|thumb|upright|Lui Hui's Survey of sea island]]
'''Mathematics''': From the earliest the Chinese used a positional decimal system on counting boards in order to calculate. To express 10, a single rod is placed in the second box from the right. The spoken language uses a similar system to English: e.g. four thousand two hundred seven. No symbol was used for zero. By the 1st century BC, negative numbers and decimal fractions were in use and ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' included methods for extracting higher order roots by [[Horner's method]] and solving linear equations and by [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagoras' theorem]]. Cubic equations were solved in the [[Tang dynasty]] and solutions of equations of order higher than 3 appeared in print in 1245 AD by [[Ch'in Chiu-shao]]. [[Pascal's triangle]] for binomial coefficients was described around 1100 by [[Jia Xian]].

Although the first attempts at an axiomatisation of geometry appear in the [[Mohist]] canon in 330 BC, [[Liu Hui]] developed algebraic methods in geometry in the 3rd century AD and also calculated [[pi]] to 5 significant figures. In 480, [[Zu Chongzhi]] improved this by discovering the ratio &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{355}{113}&lt;/math&gt; which remained the most accurate value for 1200 years.

''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Astronomy''': Astronomical observations from China constitute the longest continuous sequence from any civilisation and include records of sunspots (112 records from 364 BC), supernovas (1054), lunar and solar eclipses. By the 12th century, they could reasonably accurately make predictions of eclipses, but the knowledge of this was lost during the Ming dynasty, so that the Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] gained much favour in 1601 by his predictions.&lt;ref&gt;Needham p422&lt;/ref&gt;
By 635 Chinese astronomers had observed that the tails of comets always point away from the sun.

From antiquity, the Chinese used an equatorial system for describing the skies and a star map from 940 was drawn using a cylindrical ([[Mercator projection|Mercator]]) projection. The use of an [[armillary sphere]] is recorded from the 4th century BC and a sphere permanently mounted in equatorial axis from 52 BC. In 125 AD [[Zhang Heng]] used water power to rotate the sphere in real time. This included rings for the meridian and ecliptic. By 1270 they had incorporated the principles of the Arab [[torquetum]].

[[File:EastHanSeismograph.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A modern replica of [[Zhang Heng]]'s [[seismometer]] of 132 CE]]

'''Seismology''': To better prepare for calamities, Zhang Heng invented a [[seismometer]] in 132 CE which provided instant alert to authorities in the capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific [[Cardinal direction|cardinal or ordinal direction]].&lt;ref&gt;de Crespigny (2007), 1050; Morton &amp; Lewis (2005), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest, a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck 400&amp;nbsp;km (248&amp;nbsp;mi) to 500&amp;nbsp;km (310&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Luoyang (in what is now modern [[Gansu]]).&lt;ref&gt;Minford &amp; Lau (2002), 307; Balchin (2003), 26–27; Needham (1986a), 627; Needham (1986c), 484; Krebs (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth' (Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 626"&gt;Needham (1986a), 626.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Zhang Heng#Zhang's seismometer|Zhang's seismometer]] for further details.

There are many notable contributors to the field of Chinese science throughout the ages. One of the best examples would be [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095), a [[polymath]] scientist and statesman who was the first to describe the [[magnetic]]-needle [[compass]] used for [[navigation]], discovered the concept of [[true north]], improved the design of the astronomical [[gnomon]], [[armillary sphere]], [[sight tube]], and [[water clock|clepsydra]], and described the use of [[drydock]]s to repair boats. After observing the natural process of the inundation of [[silt]] and the find of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[fossil]]s in the [[Taihang Mountains]] (hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean), Shen Kuo devised a theory of land formation, or [[geomorphology]]. He also adopted a theory of gradual [[climate change]] in regions over time, after observing [[petrified]] [[bamboo]] found underground at [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi]] province. If not for Shen Kuo's writing,&lt;ref&gt;[[Shen Kuo]] 沈括 (1086, last supplement dated 1091), ''Meng Ch'i Pi Than (夢溪筆談, [[Dream Pool Essays]])'' as cited in {{harvnb|Needham|2004}} p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; the architectural works of [[Yu Hao]] would be little known, along with the inventor of [[movable type]] [[printing]], [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051). Shen's contemporary [[Su Song]] (1020–1101) was also a brilliant polymath, an astronomer who created a celestial atlas of star maps, wrote a pharmaceutical treatise with related subjects of [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[mineralogy]], and [[metallurgy]], and had erected a large [[astronomical]] [[clocktower]] in [[Kaifeng]] city in 1088. To operate the crowning [[armillary sphere]], his clocktower featured an [[escapement]] mechanism and the world's oldest known use of an endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]].

The [[Jesuit China missions]] of the 16th and 17th centuries "learned to appreciate the scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe. Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture."&lt;ref&gt;Agustín Udías, ''Searching the Heavens and the Earth: The History of Jesuit Observatories''. (Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003). p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Western academic thought on the history of Chinese technology and science was galvanized by the work of [[Joseph Needham]] and the Needham Research Institute. Among the technological accomplishments of China were, according to the British scholar Needham, early [[seismometer|seismological]] detectors ([[Zhang Heng]] in the 2nd century), the [[hydraulics|water-powered]] [[celestial globe]] (Zhang Heng), [[match]]es, the independent invention of the [[decimal|decimal system]], [[dry dock#Graving|dry docks]], sliding [[calipers]], the double-action [[piston pump]], [[cast iron]], the [[blast furnace]], the [[iron]] [[plough]], the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the [[wheelbarrow]], the [[suspension bridge]], the [[winnowing machine]], the [[Mechanical fan|rotary fan]], the [[parachute]], [[natural gas]] as fuel, the [[raised-relief map]], the [[propeller]], the [[crossbow]], and a solid fuel [[rocket]], the [[multistage rocket]], the [[horse collar]], along with contributions in [[logic]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], and other fields.

However, cultural factors prevented these Chinese achievements from developing into what we might call "modern science".  According to Needham, it may have been the religious and philosophical framework of Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to accept the ideas of laws of nature:
{{quote|It was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The [[Taoists]], indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too naïve for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|1954}} 581.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In the Middle Ages {{anchor|Science in the Middle Ages}}==
In the Middle Ages the classical learning continued in three major linguistic cultures and civilizations: Greek (the Byzantine Empire), Arabic (the Islamic world), and Latin (Western Europe).

Because of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the intellectual level in the western part of Europe declined [[Migration Period|in the 400s]]. In contrast, the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] or [[Byzantine Empire]] resisted the barbarian attacks, and preserved and improved the learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Byzantine Empire]] still held learning centers such as [[Constantinople]], Alexandria and Antioch, Western Europe's knowledge was concentrated in [[Monastery|monasteries]] until the development of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]] in the 12th centuries. The curriculum of monastic schools included the study of the few available ancient texts and of new works on practical subjects like medicine&lt;ref&gt;Linda E.

In the sixth century in the Byzantine Empire, Isidore of Miletus compiled Archimedes' mathematical works in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]], where all Archimedes' mathematical contributions were collected and studied.

[[John Philoponus]], another Byzantine scholar, was the first to question Aristotle's teaching of physics, introducing the [[theory of impetus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Philoponus, John|editor=Craig, Edward|year=1998|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 7, Nihilism-Quantum mechanics|pages=371–377, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0zPyhAxhDz8C&amp;pg=PA373 373]|isbn=978-0415187121}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lindberg, David C. |year=2007|title=The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450|edition=second|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=307–308|isbn=978-0226482057}} Link to [https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&amp;pg=PA307 p. 307] from Google's copy of 2008 reprint.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of impetus was an auxiliary or secondary theory of Aristotelian dynamics, put forth initially to explain projectile motion against gravity.

The first record of separating conjoined twins took place in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the 900s when the surgeons tried to separate a dead body of a pair of conjoined twins. The result was partly successful as the other twin managed to live for three days. The next recorded case of separating conjoined twins was several centuries later, in 1600s Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medievalists.net/2014/01/the-case-of-conjoined-twins-in-10th-century-byzantium/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://denysmontandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/conjoined-twins.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, a number of Greek scholars flee to North Italy in which they fueled the era later commonly known as "[[Renaissance]]” as they brought with them a great deal of classical learning including an understanding of botany, medicine, and zoology. Byzantium also gave the West important inputs: John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian physics, and the works of Dioscorides.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992). The Beginnings of Western Science.

[[File:Islamic MedText c1500.jpg|thumb|upright|15th-century manuscript of [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''.]]

In the [[Middle East]], [[Greek philosophy]] was able to find some support under the newly created [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]]. With the [[spread of Islam]] in the 7th and 8th centuries, a period of [[Muslim]] scholarship, known as the [[Islamic Golden Age]], lasted until the 13th century. This scholarship was aided by several factors. The use of a single language, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], allowed communication without need of a translator. Access to [[Greek language|Greek]] texts from the [[Byzantine Empire]], along with [[History of India|Indian]] sources of learning, provided Muslim scholars a knowledge base to build upon.

[[Scientific method]] began developing in the Muslim world, where significant progress in methodology was made, beginning with the experiments of [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) on [[optics]] from c. 1000, in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hZvL5eYAAAAJ&amp;hl Sameen Ahmed Khan], Arab Origins of the Discovery of the Refraction of Light; Roshdi Hifni Rashed (Picture) Awarded the 2007 King Faisal International Prize, Optics &amp; Photonics News (OPN, Logo), Vol. 18, No. 10, pp. 22–23 (October 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally [[empiricism|empirical]] orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics, especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light. Some have also described Ibn al-Haytham as the "first scientist" for his development of the modern scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Al-Khalili |first=Jim |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7810846.stm |title=BBC News |publisher=BBC News |date=4 January 2009 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], the mathematician [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] (c. 780–850) gave his name to the concept of the [[algorithm]], while the term [[algebra]] is derived from ''al-jabr'', the beginning of the title of one of his publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald J.

Islamic science began its decline in the 12th or 13th century, before the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, and due in part to the 11th–13th century [[Mongol conquests]], during which libraries, observatories, hospitals and universities were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Erica Fraser 1600"&gt;Erica Fraser.

===Western Europe===
{{main|European science in the Middle Ages}}
{{further|Renaissance of the 12th century|Scholasticism|Medieval technology|List of medieval European scientists|Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe}}

By the eleventh century, most of Europe had become Christian; stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made, increasing the food supply and population. Classical Greek texts were translated from Arabic and Greek into Latin, stimulating scientific discussion in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''  University of Chicago Press. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

An intellectual revitalization of Western Europe started with the birth of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]] in the 12th century. Contact with the Byzantine Empire,&lt;ref name=Lindberg1992p162/&gt; and with the Islamic world during the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Crusades]], allowed Latin Europe access to scientific [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] texts, including the works of [[Aristotle]], [[Ptolemy]], [[Isidore of Miletus]], [[John Philoponus]], [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]], [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī|al-Khwarizmi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. European scholars had access to the translation programs of [[Raymond of Toledo]], who sponsored the 12th century [[Toledo School of Translators]] from Arabic to Latin. Later translators like [[Michael Scotus]] would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly. The European universities aided materially in the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation and propagation of these texts]] and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities. In fact, European university put many works about the natural world and the study of nature at the center of its curriculum,&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Toby. ''Rise of early modern science'' 2nd ed. pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that the "medieval university laid far greater emphasis on science than does its modern counterpart and descendent."&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Edward. "Science in the Medieval University", in James M. Kittleson and Pamela J. Transue, ed., ''Rebirth, Reform and Resilience: Universities in Transition, 1300–1700'', Ohio State University Press, 1984, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical antiquity]], Greek and Roman taboos had meant that dissection was usually banned, but in the Middle Ages medical teachers and students at Bologna began to open human bodies, and [[Mondino de Luzzi]] (c. 1275–1326) produced the ﬁrst known anatomy textbook based on human dissection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057418 |last=Numbers |first=Ronald |title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion|pages=45|publisher= Harvard University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0674033276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/04/debunking-a-myth/ |title=Debunking a myth |date=7 April 2011 |publisher=Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Pax Mongolica]], Europeans, such as [[Marco Polo]], began to venture further and further east. This led to the increased awareness of Indian and even Chinese culture and civilization within the European tradition. Technological advances were also made, such as the early flight of [[Eilmer of Malmesbury]] (who had studied Mathematics in 11th century England),&lt;ref name="Eilmer"&gt;[[William of Malmesbury]], ''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]] / The history of the English kings'', ed. and trans. R.A.B. Mynors, R.M. Thomson, and M.

[[File:Roger-bacon-statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Roger Bacon]] at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Oxford University Museum]].]]

At the beginning of the 13th century, there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural philosophy in these texts began to be extended by [[Scholasticism|scholastics]] such as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Precursors of the modern scientific method, influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world, can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his ''[[Opus Majus]]''.  [[Pierre Duhem]]'s thesis is that [[Stephen Tempier]] - the Bishop of Paris - [[Condemnation of 1277]] led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline, "but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277".&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/condemnation/ |title=Condemnation of 1277 |author=Hans Thijssen |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=30 January 2003 |accessdate=14 September 2009 |publisher=[[University of Stanford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many scholars agree with Duhem's view that the Middle Ages saw important scientific developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/blog/rediscovering-the-science-of-the-middle-ages |title=Rediscovering the Science of the Middle Ages |publisher=BioLogos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icucourses.com/pages/023-a03-the-middle-ages-and-the-birth-of-science|title=023-A03: The Middle Ages and the Birth of Science – International Catholic University|work=International Catholic University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/history-a-medieval-multiverse-1.14837|title=History: A medieval multiverse|volume=507|issue=7491|pages=161–163|journal=Nature News &amp; Comment|doi=10.1038/507161a|year=2014|last1=McLeish|first1=Tom C.

The first half of the 14th century saw much important scientific work, largely within the framework of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] commentaries on Aristotle's scientific writings.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 127–131.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Ockham]] emphasised the principle of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]]: natural philosophers should not postulate unnecessary entities, so that motion is not a distinct thing but is only the moving object&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''A Source Book in Medieval Science'', (Harvard Univ. Press, 1974), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and an intermediary "sensible species" is not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, ''Theories of Vision from al-Kindi to Kepler'', (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1976), pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] started to reinterpret elements of Aristotle's mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a first step towards the modern concept of [[inertia]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxford Calculators]] began to mathematically analyze the [[kinematics]] of motion, making this analysis without considering the causes of motion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional, and Intellectual Contexts'', (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1996), pp. 100–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1348, the [[Black Death]] and other disasters sealed a sudden end to philosophic and scientific development. Yet, the rediscovery of ancient texts was stimulated by the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, when many [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] scholars sought refuge in the West. Meanwhile, the introduction of printing was to have great effect on European society. The facilitated dissemination of the printed word democratized learning and allowed ideas such as [[algebra]] to propagate more rapidly. These developments paved the way for the [[Scientific Revolution]], where scientific inquiry, halted at the start of the Black Death, resumed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The renewal of learning in Europe began with 12th century [[Scholasticism]]. The [[Northern Renaissance]] showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Debus]], ''Man and Nature in the Renaissance'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the [[Protestant Reformation]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]]; the discovery of the Americas by [[Christopher Columbus]]; the [[Fall of Constantinople]]; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] questioned religious doctrine. The works of [[Ptolemy]] (astronomy) and [[Galen]] (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by [[Vesalius]] on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Precise titles of these landmark books can be found in the collections of the [[Library of Congress]]. A list of these titles can be found in {{harvnb|Bruno|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] initiated [[classical mechanics]] in [[physics]].]]

The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements, now known as the [[Scientific Revolution]]. The Scientific Revolution is traditionally held by most historians to have begun in 1543, when the books ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''On the Workings of the Human Body'') by [[Andreas Vesalius]], and also ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|De Revolutionibus]]'', by the astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], were first printed. The thesis of Copernicus' book was that the Earth moved around the Sun. The period culminated with the publication of the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' in 1687 by [[Isaac Newton]], representative of the unprecedented growth of [[antiquarian science book|scientific publications]] throughout Europe.

Other significant scientific advances were made during this time by [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Edmond Halley]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Blaise Pascal]]. In philosophy, major contributions were made by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]], Sir [[Thomas Browne]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]]. The scientific method was also better developed as the modern way of thinking emphasized experimentation and reason over traditional considerations.

===Age of Enlightenment===

[[File:Painting of Volta by Bertini (photo).jpeg|thumb|[[Alessandro Volta]] demonstrates the first [[Electrochemical cell|electrical cell]] to [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] in 1801.]]

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] was a European affair. The 17th century brought decisive steps towards modern science, which accelerated during the 18th century. Directly based on the works&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}, 741&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], the way was now clear to the development of modern [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[technology]]
by the generation of [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790), [[Leonhard Euler]] (1707–1783), [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1711–1765) and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1717–1783). [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', published between 1751 and 1772 brought this new understanding to a wider audience. The impact of this process was not limited to science and technology, but affected [[history of philosophy|philosophy]] ([[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hume]]), [[history of religion|religion]] (the increasingly significant impact of [[Relationship between religion and science|science upon religion]]), and society and politics in general ([[Adam Smith]], [[Voltaire]]). The [[early modern period]] is seen as a flowering of the European Renaissance, in what is often known as the [[Scientific Revolution]], viewed as a foundation of [[#Modern science|modern science]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, pp. 741–744 of {{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism in science===
{{Main|Romanticism in science}}
The Romantic Movement of the early 19th century reshaped science by opening up new pursuits unexpected in the classical approaches of the Enlightenment. Major breakthroughs came in biology, especially in [[Darwinism|Darwin's theory of evolution]], as well as physics (electromagnetism), mathematics (non-Euclidean geometry, group theory) and chemistry (organic chemistry).  The decline of Romanticism occurred because a new movement, [[Positivism]], began to take hold of the ideals of the intellectuals after 1840 and lasted until about 1880.

==Modern science==
The [[scientific revolution]] established science as a source for the growth of knowledge.{{clarify|reason=a source for the growth of knowledge? It is knowledge.|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heilbron|2003}}, 741–743&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century, the practice of science became professionalized and institutionalized in ways that continued through the 20th century. As the role of scientific knowledge grew in society, it became incorporated with many aspects of the functioning of nation-states.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The scientific revolution is a convenient boundary between ancient thought and classical physics. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] revived the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the solar system described by [[Aristarchus of Samos]]. This was followed by the first known model of planetary motion given by [[Johannes Kepler]] in the early 17th century, which proposed that the planets follow [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbits, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] ("''Father of Modern Physics''") also made use of experiments to validate physical theories, a key element of the scientific method. [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] did some of the earliest experiments with electricity and magnetism, establishing that the Earth itself is magnetic.

In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories: [[Newton's laws of motion]], which led to classical mechanics; and [[gravity|Newton's Law of Gravitation]], which describes the fundamental force of gravity.

During the late 18th and early 19th century, the behavior of electricity and magnetism was studied by [[Luigi Galvani]], [[Giovanni Aldini]], [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]], and others. These studies led to the unification of the two phenomena into a single theory of [[electromagnetism]], by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (known as [[Maxwell's equations]]).

The beginning of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all circumstances. Beginning in 1900, [[Max Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Niels Bohr]] and others developed quantum theories to explain various anomalous experimental results, by introducing discrete energy levels. Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, but even more disturbingly, the theory of [[general relativity]], proposed by Einstein in 1915, showed that the fixed background of [[spacetime]], on which both [[Newtonian mechanics]] and [[special relativity]] depended, could not exist. In 1925, [[Werner Heisenberg]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] formulated [[quantum mechanics]], which explained the preceding quantum theories. The observation by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, and the formulation of the [[Big Bang]] theory by [[Georges Lemaître]].

[[File:Trinity Test Fireball 25ms.jpg|thumb|The [[atomic bomb]] ushered in "[[Big Science]]" in [[physics]].]]

In 1938 [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] discovered [[nuclear fission]] with radiochemical methods, and in 1939 [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Robert Frisch]] wrote the first theoretical interpretation of the fission process, which was later improved by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[John A. Wheeler]]. Further developments took place during World War II, which led to the practical application of [[radar]] and the development and use of the [[atomic bomb]]. Around this time, [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] was recruited by the [[Manhattan Project]] to help develop a process for separating uranium metal into U-235 and U-238 isotopes by [[Gaseous diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald K. Smeltzer. “Chien-Shiung Wu.” Atomic Heritage Foundation, https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/chien-shiung-wu.

Though the process had begun with the invention of the [[cyclotron]] by [[Ernest O. Lawrence]] in the 1930s, physics in the postwar period entered into a phase of what historians have called "[[Big Science]]", requiring massive machines, budgets, and laboratories in order to test their theories and move into new frontiers. The primary patron of physics became state governments, who recognized that the support of "basic" research could often lead to technologies useful to both military and industrial applications.

Currently, general relativity and quantum mechanics are inconsistent with each other, and efforts are underway to unify the two.

====Chemistry====
{{Main|History of chemistry}}
[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dmitri Mendeleev]]]]
Modern chemistry emerged from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy, medicine, manufacturing and mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |editor=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |editor2= Mauskopf, Seymour |editor3=Newman, William R. |title=Chemical Knowledge in the Early Modern World|journal= Osiris |volume= 29 |date=2014|pages=1–15|url=https://www.academia.edu/6629576|last1= Newman |first1= William R. |last2= Mauskopf |first2= Seymour H. |last3= Eddy |first3= Matthew Daniel |pmid= 26103744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A decisive moment came when 'chemistry' was distinguished from [[alchemy]] by [[Robert Boyle]] in his work ''The Sceptical Chymist'', in 1661; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work.  Other important steps included the gravimetric experimental practices of medical chemists like [[William Cullen]], [[Joseph Black]], [[Torbern Bergman]] and [[Pierre Macquer]] and through the work of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] ([[Father or mother of something|''Father of Modern Chemistry'']]) on [[oxygen]] and the law of [[conservation of mass]], which refuted [[phlogiston theory]]. The theory that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by [[John Dalton]] in 1803, although the question took a hundred years to settle as proven. Dalton also formulated the law of mass relationships. In 1869, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] composed his [[periodic table]] of elements on the basis of Dalton's discoveries.

The synthesis of [[urea]] by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] opened a new research field, [[organic chemistry]], and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from [[whaling]]. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in [[physiological chemistry]], the precursor to [[biochemistry]]. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. [[Linus Pauling]]'s book on ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond'' used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce [[bond angle]]s in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of [[DNA]], ''the secret of life'' (in the words of [[Francis Crick]], 1953). In the same year, the [[Miller–Urey experiment]] demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple [[amino acid]]s, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.

====Geology====
{{Main|History of geology}}
Geology existed as a cloud of isolated, disconnected ideas about rocks, minerals, and landforms long before it became a coherent science. [[Theophrastus]]' work on rocks, ''Peri lithōn'', remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution. Chinese polymath [[Shen Kua]] (1031–1095) first formulated hypotheses for the process of land formation. Based on his observation of fossils in a geological [[stratum]] in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he deduced that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] of silt.

[[File:Wegener.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plate tectonics]]—[[seafloor spreading]] and [[continental drift]] illustrated on a relief globe]]

Geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the [[Scientific Revolution]], but individual theorists made important contributions. [[Robert Hooke]], for example, formulated a theory of earthquakes, and [[Nicholas Steno]] developed the theory of [[Law of superposition|superposition]] and argued that [[fossils]] were the remains of once-living creatures. Beginning with [[Thomas Burnet]]'s ''Sacred Theory of the Earth'' in 1681, natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over time. Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth's past in terms of events described in the Bible, but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of Earth history.

[[File:Hutton James portrait Raeburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Hutton]], the father of modern geology]]

Modern geology, like modern chemistry, gradually evolved during the 18th and early 19th centuries. [[Benoît de Maillet]] and the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] saw the Earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars. [[Jean-Étienne Guettard]] and [[Nicolas Desmarest]] hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps.  Aided by chemical experimentation, naturalists such as Scotland's [[John Walker (natural historian)|John Walker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matthew Daniel Eddy|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750–1800|date=2008|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden's Torbern Bergman, and Germany's [[Abraham Werner]] created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals—a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century.  These early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of Earth history that led [[James Hutton]], [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Alexandre Brongniart]], following in the steps of  [[Nicolas Steno|Steno]], to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained: a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin. The use of [[index fossil]]s became a powerful tool for making geological maps, because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other, distant localities. Over the first half of the 19th century, geologists such as [[Charles Lyell]], [[Adam Sedgwick]], and [[Roderick Murchison]] applied the new technique to rocks throughout Europe and eastern North America, setting the stage for more detailed, government-funded mapping projects in later decades.

Midway through the 19th century, the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand ''how'' the surface of the Earth had changed. The first comprehensive theories of mountain building were proposed during this period, as were the first modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes. [[Louis Agassiz]] and others established the reality of continent-covering [[ice age]]s, and "fluvialists" like [[Andrew Crombie Ramsay]] argued that river valleys were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them. After the discovery of [[radioactivity]], [[radiometric dating]] methods were developed, starting in the 20th century. [[Alfred Wegener]]'s theory of "continental drift" was widely dismissed when he proposed it in the 1910s, but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of [[plate tectonics]], which provided a plausible mechanism for it. Plate tectonics also provided a unified explanation for a wide range of seemingly unrelated geological phenomena. Since 1970 it has served as the unifying principle in geology.

Geologists' embrace of [[plate tectonics]] became part of a broadening of the field from a study of rocks into a study of the Earth as a planet. Other elements of this transformation include: geophysical studies of the interior of the Earth, the grouping of geology with [[meteorology]] and [[oceanography]] as one of the "earth sciences", and comparisons of Earth and the solar system's other rocky planets.

====Astronomy====
{{Main|History of astronomy}}
[[Aristarchus of Samos]] published [[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|work]] on how to determine the sizes and distances of the Sun and the Moon, and [[Eratosthenes]] used this work to figure the size of the Earth. [[Hipparchus]] later discovered the [[precession (astronomy)|precession]] of the Earth.

Advances in astronomy and in optical systems in the 19th century resulted in the first observation of an [[asteroid]] ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|1 Ceres]]) in 1801, and the discovery of [[Neptune]] in 1846.

In 1925, [[Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin]] determined that stars were composed mostly of Hydrogen and Helium.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gregersen. “Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin | American Astronomer.” Encyclopædia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cecilia-Payne-Gaposchkin.&lt;/ref&gt; She was dissuaded by astronomer [[Henry Norris Russell]] from publishing this finding in her Ph.D.thesis because of the widely held belief that stars had the same composition as the Earth.&lt;ref name="newn.cam.ac.uk"&gt;Rachael Padman. “Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin (1900–1979).” Newnham College Biographies, 2004, http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/about/history/biographies/.&lt;/ref&gt; However, four years later, in 1929, [[Henry Norris Russell]] came to the same conclusion through different reasoning and the discovery was eventually accepted.&lt;ref name="newn.cam.ac.uk"/&gt;

[[George Gamow]], [[Ralph Alpher]], and [[Robert Herman]] had calculated that there should be evidence for a Big Bang in the background temperature of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Alpher | first1=Ralph A. | last2=Herman | first2= Robert| year =1948 | title=Evolution of the Universe| url=| journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=162  | issue=4124| pages=774–775 | doi=10.1038/162774b0 | bibcode=1948Natur.162..774A | ref=harv}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gamow | first1=G. | doi=10.1038/162680a0 | title=The Evolution of the Universe | pmid=18893719 | journal=Nature | year=1948 | volume=162 | issue=4122 | pages=680–682 | bibcode=1948Natur.162..680G | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1978/wilson-lecture.pdf|format=PDF|title=Wilson's 1978 Nobel lecture|website=nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered a 3&amp;nbsp;Kelvin background hiss in their [[Bell Labs]] [[radiotelescope]] (the [[Holmdel Horn Antenna]]), which was evidence for this hypothesis, and formed the basis for a number of results that helped determine the [[age of the universe]].

Supernova [[SN1987A]] was observed by astronomers on Earth both visually, and in a triumph for [[neutrino astronomy]], by the solar neutrino detectors at [[Kamiokande]]. But the solar neutrino flux was [[solar neutrino problem|a fraction of its theoretically expected value]]. This discrepancy forced a change in some values in the [[standard model]] for [[particle physics]].

====Biology and medicine====

[[File:DNA replication split.svg|thumb|left|100px|Semi-conservative [[DNA replication]]]]

[[William Harvey]] published ''De Motu Cordis'' in 1628, which revealed his conclusions based on his extensive studies of vertebrate circulatory systems.  He identified the central role of the heart, arteries, and veins in producing blood movement in a circuit, and
failed to find any confirmation of Galen's pre-existing notions of heating and cooling functions.&lt;ref&gt;Power, d'Arcey. Life of Harvey.

In 1847, Hungarian physician [[Ignaz Semmelweis|Ignác Fülöp Semmelweis]] dramatically reduced the occurrency of [[puerperal fever]] by simply requiring physicians to wash their hands before attending to women in childbirth. This discovery predated the [[germ theory of disease]]. However, Semmelweis' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and handwashing came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], who in 1865 proved the principles of [[antisepsis]]. Lister's work was based on the important findings by French biologist [[Louis Pasteur]]. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised one of the most important methods in [[preventive medicine]], when in 1880 he produced a [[vaccine]] against [[rabies]]. Pasteur invented the process of [[pasteurization]], to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell | first1=Neil A. |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J.

Perhaps the most prominent, controversial and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] put forward by the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] in his book [[On the Origin of Species]] in 1859. Darwin proposed that the features of all living things, including humans, were shaped by natural processes over long periods of time. The theory of evolution in its current form affects almost all areas of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dobzhansky | first1=Theodosius | year=1964 | title=Biology, Molecular and Organismic | url=http://people.ibest.uidaho.edu/~bree/courses/1_Dobzhansky_1964.pdf | journal=American Zoologist | volume=4 | issue=4 | pages=443–452 | doi=10.1093/icb/4.4.443 | access-date=5 February 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220935/http://people.ibest.uidaho.edu/~bree/courses/1_Dobzhansky_1964.pdf | archive-date=3 March 2016 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both [[Social effect of evolutionary theory|opposition and support]] from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of "man's place in the universe". In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the [[Moravia]]n&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Henig |first=Robin Marantz |title=The Monk in the Garden : The Lost and Found Genius of Gregor Mendel, the Father of Genetics |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2000 |isbn=978-0395977651 |oclc=43648512}}&lt;/ref&gt; monk [[Gregor Mendel]] in 1866. Mendel's laws provided the beginnings of the study of [[genetics]], which became a major field of research for both scientific and industrial research. By 1953, [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]] clarified the basic structure of DNA, the [[genetic material]] for expressing life in all its forms.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Watson and Francis H. Crick. "Letters to ''Nature'': Molecular structure of Nucleic Acid." ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''171''', 737–738 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, the possibilities of [[genetic engineering]] became practical for the first time, and a massive international effort began in 1990 to map out an entire human [[genome]] (the [[Human Genome Project]]).

====Ecology====
{{Main|History of ecology}}
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Earthrise]]'', the Earth from above the [[Moon]], [[Apollo 8]]. This 1968 [[NASA]] image by astronaut [[William Anders]] helped create awareness of the finiteness of Earth, and the limits of its [[natural resource]]s.]]
The discipline of [[ecology]] typically traces its origin to the synthesis of [[evolution|Darwinian evolution]] and [[Humboldtian science|Humboldtian]] [[biogeography]], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Equally important in the rise of ecology, however, were [[microbiology]] and [[soil science]]—particularly the [[biogeochemical cycle|cycle of life]] concept, prominent in the work [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Ferdinand Cohn]]. The word ''ecology'' was coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]], whose particularly holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin's theory in particular) was important in the spread of ecological thinking. In the 1930s, [[Arthur Tansley]] and others began developing the field of [[ecosystem ecology]], which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of [[natural history|field biology]].

===Social sciences===
{{Main|History of the social sciences}}
Successful use of the scientific method in the physical sciences led to the same methodology being adapted to better understand the many fields of human endeavor. From this effort the social sciences have been developed.

====Political science====
{{Main|History of political science}}
Political science is a late arrival in terms of [[social sciences]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} However, the discipline has a clear set of antecedents such as [[moral philosophy]], [[political philosophy]], [[political economy]], history, and other fields concerned with [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]] determinations of what ought to be and with [[Deductive reasoning|deducing]] the characteristics and functions of the ideal form of [[Forms of government|government]]. The roots of politics are in [[prehistory]]. In each historic period and in almost every geographic area, we can find someone studying politics and increasing political understanding.

In [[Western culture]], the study of politics is first found in [[Ancient Greece]]. The antecedents of European politics trace their roots back even earlier than [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], particularly in the works of [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], [[Thucydides]], [[Xenophon]], and [[Euripides]]. Later, Plato analyzed political systems, abstracted their analysis from more [[literary]]- and history- oriented studies and applied an approach we would understand as closer to [[philosophy]]. Similarly, Aristotle built upon Plato's analysis to include historical empirical evidence in his analysis.

In this treatise, the behaviors and relationships of the people, the King, the State, the Government Superintendents, Courtiers, Enemies, Invaders, and Corporations are analysed and documented. [[Roger Boesche]] describes the ''Arthaśāstra'' as "a book of political realism, a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink= Roger Boesche | last=Boesche | first=Roger | title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra | year=2002 | publisher=Lexington Books | isbn=978-0739104019 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the rule of Rome, famous historians such as [[Polybius]], [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]] documented the rise of the [[Roman Republic]], and the organization and histories of other nations, while [[Politician|statesmen]] like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and others provided us with examples of the politics of the republic and Rome's empire and wars. The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments.

With the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies. The rise of [[monotheism]] and, particularly for the Western tradition, [[Christianity]], brought to light a new space for politics and political action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Works such as [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of [[Christianity]], redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between [[Religion and politics|Church and State]] were clarified and contested in this period.

In the Middle East and later other [[Islam]]ic areas, works such as the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]] and Epic of Kings by [[Ferdowsi]] provided evidence of political analysis, while the Islamic [[Aristotelians]] such as [[Avicenna]] and later [[Maimonides]] and [[Averroes]], continued [[Aristotle]]'s tradition of analysis and [[empiricism]], writing commentaries on Aristotle's works.

During the [[Italian Renaissance]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] established the emphasis of modern political science on direct [[empirical]] [[observation]] of political [[institution]]s and actors. Later, the expansion of the scientific paradigm during the [[the Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] further pushed the study of politics beyond normative determinations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In particular, the study of [[statistics]], to study the subjects of the [[Sovereign state|state]], has been applied to [[Opinion poll|polling]] and [[voting]].

In the 20th century, the study of ideology, behaviouralism and international relations led to a multitude of 'pol-sci' subdisciplines including [[rational choice theory]], [[voting theory]], [[game theory]] (also used in economics), [[psephology]], [[political geography]]/[[geopolitics]], [[political psychology]]/[[political sociology]], [[political economy]], [[policy analysis]], [[public administration]], comparative political analysis and [[peace studies]]/conflict analysis.

====Linguistics====
{{Main|History of linguistics}}
[[Historical linguistics]] emerged as an independent field of study at the end of the 18th century. [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]] proposed that [[Sanskrit]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], and [[Celtic languages]] all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''[[Cours de linguistique générale]]'' created the development of [[descriptive linguistics]]. Descriptive linguistics, and the related [[structuralism]] movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. [[Noam Chomsky]] further diversified linguistics with the development of [[generative linguistics]] in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid [[syntax]]. Additional specialties such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[cognitive linguistics]], and [[computational linguistics]] have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.

====Economics====
{{Main|History of economics}}
[[File:Supply-demand-right-shift-demand.svg|thumb|right|The [[supply and demand]] model]]
[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adam Smith]] wrote ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', the first modern work of economics]]
The basis for [[classical economics]] forms [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776. Smith criticized [[mercantilism]], advocating a system of free trade with [[division of labour]]. He postulated an "[[invisible hand]]" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. [[Karl Marx]] developed an alternative economic theory, called [[Marxian economics]]. Marxian economics is based on the [[labor theory of value]] and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, [[capitalism]] was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The [[Austrian School]] responded to Marxian economics by viewing [[entrepreneurship]] as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of [[supply and demand]].

In the 1920s, [[John Maynard Keynes]] prompted a division between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]]. Under [[Keynesian economics]] macroeconomic trends can overwhelm economic choices made by individuals. Governments should promote [[aggregate demand]] for goods as a means to encourage economic expansion. Following World War II, [[Milton Friedman]] created the concept of [[monetarism]]. Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity. In the 1970s, monetarism has adapted into [[supply-side economics]] which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion.

Other modern schools of economic thought are [[New Classical economics]] and [[New Keynesian economics]]. New Classical economics was developed in the 1970s, emphasizing solid microeconomics as the basis for macroeconomic growth. New Keynesian economics was created partially in response to New Classical economics, and deals with how inefficiencies in the market create a need for control by a central bank or government.

The above "history of economics" reflects modern economic textbooks and this means that the last stage of a science is represented as the culmination of its history ([[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn]], 1962). The "[[invisible hand]]" mentioned in a lost page in the middle of a chapter in the middle of the "[[Wealth of Nations]]", 1776, advances as Smith's central message.{{clarify|date=July 2015}} It is played down that this "invisible hand" acts only "frequently" and that it is "no part of his [the individual's] intentions" because competition leads to lower prices by imitating "his" invention. That this "invisible hand" prefers "the support of domestic to foreign industry" is cleansed—often without indication that part of the citation is truncated.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Smith's original phrase with [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] quotation of it. In brackets what Samuelson curtailed without indication and without giving a reference:
"[As] every individual … [therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed,] neither intends to promote the general [Smith said "public"] interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. [By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry,] he intends only his own security, [and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only] his own gain; and he is in this, [as in many other cases,] led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. [Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.] By pursuing his own interest, he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it" Samuelson, Paul A./Nordhaus, William D., 1989, [[Economics (textbook)|''Economics'']], 13th edition, New York: McGraw-Hill, p. 825; Smith, Adam, 1937, ''The Wealth of Nations'', N.Y.: Random House, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; The opening passage of the "Wealth" containing Smith's message is never mentioned as it cannot be integrated into modern theory: "Wealth" depends on the division of labour which changes with market volume and on the proportion of productive to [[Unproductive labor]].

====Psychology====
{{Main|History of psychology}}
The end of the 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study. In that year [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research (in [[Leipzig]]). Other important early contributors to the field include [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (a pioneer in memory studies), [[Ivan Pavlov]] (who discovered [[classical conditioning]]), [[William James]], and [[Sigmund Freud]]. Freud's influence has been enormous, though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology.

The 20th century saw a rejection of Freud's theories as being too unscientific, and a reaction against [[Edward Titchener]]'s atomistic approach of the mind. This led to the formulation of [[behaviorism]] by [[John B. Watson]], which was popularized by [[B.F. Skinner]]. Behaviorism proposed [[epistemology|epistemologically]] limiting psychological study to overt behavior, since that could be reliably measured. Scientific knowledge of the "mind" was considered too metaphysical, hence impossible to achieve.

The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as [[cognitive science]]. Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation, using the tools of [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]], and [[neurobiology]]. New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain, such as [[PET scan]]s and [[CAT scan]]s, began to exert their influence as well, leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain, rather than cognition. These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible, and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains, such as [[artificial intelligence]].

====Sociology====
{{Main|History of sociology}}
[[Ibn Khaldun]] can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammed Abdullah Enan, ''Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works'', The Other Press, 2007, pp. 104–105. {{ISBN|9839541536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern sociology emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., [[Émile Durkheim]]), the aim of sociology was in [[Structural functionalism|structuralism]], understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an "antidote" to social disintegration. [[Max Weber]] was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]], which he believed would trap individuals in an "iron cage" of rational thought. Some sociologists, including [[Georg Simmel]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], utilized more [[microsociology|microsociological]], qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology, with the theories of [[George Herbert Mead]] and his student [[Herbert Blumer]] resulting in the creation of the [[symbolic interactionism]] approach to sociology.

In particular, just Auguste Comte, illustrated with his work the transition from a theological to a metaphysical stage and, from this, to a positive stage. Comte took care of the classification of the sciences as well as a transit of humanity towards a situation of progress attributable to a re-examination of nature according to the
affirmation of 'sociality' as the basis of the scientifically interpreted society (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''Natura, cultura e induzione nell'età delle scienze. Fatti e idee del movimento scientifico in Francia e Inghilterra'', Roma, Nuova Cultura, 2015, pp. 79–, {{ISBN|978-8868124977}}).

American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by [[Talcott Parsons]], who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore "functional". This [[structural functionalism]] approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo. In reaction, [[conflict theory]] was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of [[Karl Marx]]. Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources. Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. [[Erving Goffman]] saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing "backstage" and attempting to control their audience through [[impression management]]. While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including [[feminist theory]], [[post-structuralism]], [[rational choice theory]], and [[postmodernism]].

====Anthropology====
{{Main|History of anthropology}}
Anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It was during this period that Europeans attempted systematically to study human behaviour. Traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part.

At the same time, the romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the [[culture]] concept which is central to the discipline. Traditionally, much of the history of the subject was based on [[Colonialism|colonial]] encounters between Western Europe and the rest of the world, and much of 18th- and 19th-century anthropology is now classed as [[scientific racism]].

During the late 19th-century, battles over the "study of man" took place between those of an "anthropological" persuasion (relying on [[anthropometry|anthropometrical]] techniques) and those of an "[[ethnology|ethnological]]" persuasion (looking at cultures and traditions), and these distinctions became part of the later divide between [[physical anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]], the latter ushered in by the students of [[Franz Boas]].

In the mid-20th century, much of the methodologies of earlier anthropological and ethnographical study were reevaluated with an eye towards research ethics, while at the same time the scope of investigation has broadened far beyond the traditional study of "primitive cultures" (scientific practice itself is often an arena of anthropological study).

The emergence of [[paleoanthropology]], a scientific discipline which draws on the [[methodology|methodologies]] of [[paleontology]], [[physical anthropology]] and [[ethology]], among other disciplines, and increasing in scope and momentum from the mid-20th century, continues to yield further insights into human origins, evolution, genetic and cultural heritage, and perspectives on the contemporary human predicament as well.

===Emerging disciplines===
During the 20th century, a number of interdisciplinary scientific fields have emerged. Examples include:

[[Communication studies]] combines [[animal communication]], [[information theory]], [[marketing]], [[public relations]], [[telecommunication]]s and other forms of communication.

[[Computer science]], built upon a foundation of [[theoretical linguistics]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[electrical engineering]], studies the nature and limits of computation. Subfields include [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability]], [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], [[database]] design, [[computer networking]], [[artificial intelligence]], and the design of [[computer hardware]]. One area in which advances in computing have contributed to more general scientific development is by facilitating large-scale [[Scientific data archiving|archiving of scientific data]]. Contemporary computer science typically distinguishes
itself by emphasising mathematical 'theory' in contrast to the practical emphasis of [[software engineering]].

[[Environmental science]] is an interdisciplinary field. It draws upon the disciplines of biology, chemistry, [[earth sciences]], ecology, geography, mathematics, and physics.

[[Materials science]] has its roots in [[metallurgy]], [[mineralogy]], and [[crystallography]]. It combines chemistry, physics, and several engineering disciplines. The field studies metals, [[ceramic]]s, [[glass]], [[plastic]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[composite material]]s.

[[Neuroscience]] is a multidisciplinary branch of science that combines [[Neurophysiology|physiology]], [[neuroanatomy]], [[Molecular neuroscience|molecular biology]], [[Development of the nervous system|developmental biology]], [[cellular neuroscience|cytology]], [[Theoretical neuroscience|mathematical modeling]] and [[psychology]] to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of [[neuron]]s, [[glia]], [[nervous system]]s and [[Biological neural network|neural circuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles of Neural Science, Fifth Edition|last=Kandel|first=Eric R.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2012|isbn=978-0071390118|location=|chapter=I. Overall perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study==
{{Main|History of science and technology}}
As an academic field, [[history of science and technology]] began with the publication of [[William Whewell]]'s ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (first published in 1837). A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]]'s publications, ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th-century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a [[Whig history#In the history of science|Whiggish]] belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0007087400023268 | last1=Reingold | first1=Nathan | year=1986 | title=History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920–1940 | url=| journal=British Journal for the History of Science | volume=19 | issue=3| pages=243–262 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dauben | first1=Joseph W. |name-list-format=vanc| last2=Gleason | first2=ML| year=2009 | last3=Smith | first3=GE | title=Seven Decades of History of Science | url=| journal=Isis | volume=100 | issue=1| pages=4–35 | pmid=19554868 | doi=10.1086/597575 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[history of mathematics]], [[history of technology]], and [[history of philosophy]] are distinct areas of research and are covered in other articles. Mathematics is closely related to but distinct from natural science (at least in the modern conception). Technology is likewise closely related to but clearly differs from the search for empirical truth.

History of science is an academic discipline, with an international community of specialists. Main professional organizations for this field include the [[History of Science Society]], the [[British Society for the History of Science]], and the [[European Society for the History of Science]].

===Theories and sociology of the history of science===
{{Main|Theories and sociology of the history of science}}
Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science ''is'', how it ''functions'', and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Dp1f03arcbYC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=What+is+science | title=What is this thing called science? | isbn=978-0872204522 | year=1999 | publisher=Hackett Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sociology of science]] in particular has focused on the ways in which scientists work, looking closely at the ways in which they "produce" and "construct" scientific knowledge. Since the 1960s, a common trend in [[science studies]] (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the "human component" of scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data are self-evident, value-free, and context-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=I_3i18x5BqcC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=sociology+of+science |title=The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations |first1=Robert |last1=King Merton |isbn=978-0226520926 |year=1979 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of [[Science and Technology Studies]], an area that overlaps and often informs historical studies of science, focuses on the social context of science in both contemporary and historical periods.

[[Humboldtian science]] refers to the early 19th century approach of combining scientific field work with the age of [[Romanticism]] sensitivity, ethics and aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Böhme, Hartmut: Ästhetische Wissenschaft, in: Matices, Nr. 23, 1999, S. 37–41&lt;/ref&gt; It helped to install [[natural history]] as a separate field, gave base for [[ecology]] and was based on the role model of scientist, naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The later 19th century [[positivism]] asserted that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;[[Jorge Larrain]] (1979) ''The Concept of Ideology'' [https://books.google.com/?id=9ocOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 p. 197], quotation: {{quotation|one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major subject of concern and controversy in the [[philosophy of science]] has been the nature of ''theory change'' in science. [[Karl Popper]] argued that scientific knowledge is progressive and cumulative; [[Thomas Kuhn]], that scientific knowledge moves through "[[paradigm shift]]s" and is not necessarily progressive; and [[Paul Feyerabend]], that scientific knowledge is not cumulative or progressive and that there can be no [[demarcation problem|demarcation]] in terms of method between science and any other form of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=qnwzRqh5jFMC&amp;pg=RA1-PR11&amp;dq=philosophy+of+science |title=Science Teaching: The Role of History and Philosophy of Science | first1= Michael Robert |last1=Matthews |isbn=978-0415908993 |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of [[sociology of scientific knowledge|science in a social context]], starting from Thomas Kuhn's ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' in 1962. It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;ref name=kuhn&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies, e.g. [[Jerome Ravetz]] 1971 ''Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems'' referred to the role of the scientific community, as a social construct, in accepting or rejecting (objective) scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="isbn0195197216 "&gt;{{cite book |author=Ravetz, Jerome R. |title=Scientific knowledge and its social problems |publisher=Oxford University Press  |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=978-0195197211}}{{page needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Science wars]] of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers, which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so. They described as well differences between the idealized model of a pure science and the actual scientific practice; while [[scientism]], a revival of the positivism approach, saw in precise measurement and rigorous calculation the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lears|first=T.J. Jackson|title=Get Happy!!|journal=The Nation|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/177016/get-happy?page=full#|accessdate=21 December 2013|quote=...scientism is a revival of the nineteenth-century positivist faith that a reified "science" has discovered (or is about to discover) all the important truths about human life. Precise measurement and rigorous calculation, in this view, are the basis for finally settling enduring metaphysical and moral controversies—explaining consciousness and choice, replacing ambiguity with certainty.|date=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Sorell | first=Thomas | title=Scientism: Philosophy and the Infatuation with Science | publisher=Routledge | year=1994 | pages=1ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently some of the leading critical theorists have recognized that their postmodern deconstructions have at times been counter-productive, and are providing intellectual ammunition for reactionary interests. [[Bruno Latour]] noted that "dangerous extremists are using the very same argument of social construction to destroy hard-won evidence that could save our lives.  Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies? Is it enough to say that we did not really mean what we meant?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Latour | first1=B | year=2004 | title=Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern | url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/89-CRITICAL-INQUIRY-GB.pdf| journal=[[Critical Inquiry]] | volume=30 | issue=2| pages=225–248 | doi=10.1086/421123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plight of many scientific innovators ===
One recurring observation in the history of science involves the struggle for recognition of  first-rate scientists working on the periphery of the scientific establishment.  For instance, the great physicist  [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] looked back (cited [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|here]]) on [[John James Waterston]]'s  seminal paper on the kinetic theory of gases.  The history of the neglect of Waterston's path-breaking article, Rayleigh felt, suggests that "a young author who believes himself capable of great things would usually do well to secure favourable recognition of the scientific world . . . before embarking upon higher flights."

[[William Harvey]]'s experiences led him to an even more pessimistic view:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silencing Scientists and Scholars in Other Fields: Power, Paradigm Controls, Peer Review, and Scholarly Communication |last=Moran|first=Gordon |publisher=Ablex |year=1998 |isbn=978-1567503432 |pages=(cited on page) 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"But what remains to be said about the quantity and source of the blood which thus passes, is of so novel and unheard-of character that I not only fear injury to myself from the envy of a few, but I tremble lest I have mankind at large for my enemies, so much doth wont and custom, that become as another nature, and doctrine once sown and that hath struck deep root, and respect for antiquity, influence all men."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In more general terms, Robert K. Merton remarks that "the history of science abounds in instances of basic papers having been written by comparatively unknown scientists, only to be rejected or neglected for years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sociology of Science |last=Merton |first=Robert K. |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1973 |isbn= |pages=456–457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani |first=Moti |date=1995|title=The Plight of the Obscure Innovator in Science: A Few Reflections on Campanario's Note |url=http://sss.sagepub.com/content/25/1/165.short|journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=25 |doi=10.1177/030631295025001008 |pages=165–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- USE POSSESSIVE HITCHENS'S IT IS ONE BRITISH VERSION SEE [[MOS:POSS]]#1. --&gt;
'''Hitchens's razor''' is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Razor (philosophy)|razor]] asserting that the [[Philosophical burden of proof|burden of proof]] regarding the truthfulness of a claim lies with the one who makes the claim, and if this burden is not met, the claim is unfounded, and its opponents need not argue further in order to dismiss it.

==Overview==
The concept is named, echoing [[Occam's razor]], for the journalist and writer [[Christopher Hitchens]], who in a 2003 ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article formulated it thus: "'''What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence'''".&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2003/10/mommie_dearest.html|title=Mommie Dearest|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|authorlink=christopher hitchens|work=Slate|date=20 October 2003|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cillian|last=McGrattan|title=The Politics of Trauma and Peace-Building: Lessons from Northern Ireland|location=Abingdon|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|page=2|isbn=978-1138775183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictum also appears in ''[[God Is Not Great|God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]]'', a book by Hitchens published in 2007.&lt;ref name=God&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens|title=God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|year=2007|page=150|publisher=Twelve Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1843545743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens's razor is actually an English translation of the Latin proverb ''[[:q:en:Latin proverbs#Q|quod grātīs asseritur, grātīs negātur]]'' ("What is freely asserted is freely dismissed"), which was commonly used in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=SkepticInk&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skepticink.com/backgroundprobability/2015/07/25/the-long-history-of-hitchens-razor|title=The Long History of Hitchens' Razor|first=Damion|last=Reinhardt|work=Skeptic Ink|date=25 July 2015|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Jon R. Stone}}, ''The Routledge Dictionary of Latin Quotations'' (2005), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; It takes a stronger stance than the [[Sagan standard]] ("Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"), instead applying to even non-extraordinary claims.

'''Johnnie Garry''' was an entertainment director, producer, historian, nightclub manager, and road manager for [[Sarah Vaughan]] and [[Mary Lou Williams]].  He was the stage manager at the New York jazz club [[Birdland (New York jazz club)|Birdland]] in the 1960s.  He also worked as a stagehand, and as production coordinator and historian for [[Jazzmobile]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzicons.com/ji2_vaughan.html|title=Jazz Icons: Sarah Vaughan DVD|website=Jazzicons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harlemonestop.com/news/522/johnnie-garry-mr-jazzmobile-october-31-1924-march-13-2018|title=JOHNNIE GARRY - 'MR. JAZZMOBILE' October 31, 1924 – March 13, 2018|website=Harleminestop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Early life ==
Garry was born in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in 1924.  He was an only child.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.harlemonestop.com/news/522/johnnie-garry-mr-jazzmobile-october-31-1924-march-13-2018|title=JOHNNIE GARRY {{!}} 'MR. JAZZMOBILE' October 31, 1924 – March 13, 2018|work=Harlem One Stop|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928, his family moved to [[Harlem]], where they lived near the [[Apollo Theater]] on 127th Street.&lt;ref name=JazzMuseum&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmuseuminharlem.org/oldsite/archive.php?id=346|title=The Jazz Museum in Harlem|website=www.jazzmuseuminharlem.org|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Garry saw his first jazz show at the Apollo; it featured [[Don Redman|Don Redman and his orchestra]].  He was unable to finish high school because he needed to support his family, so he took a job in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]].&lt;ref name=JazzMuseum/&gt;

== Career ==
Garry's career as a stagehand began at [[Cafe Society]] in [[Greenwich Village]].  Garry's neighbor, [[Josh White]], recommended him to [[Barney Josephson]], Cafe Society's founder and owner. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Josephson employed him as a stagehand, and soon promoted him into the management side of the business, giving him the opportunity to learn about running a night club.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This opened new doors for Garry.  He met the road manager for pianist [[Mary Lou Williams]], worked as a stagehand for artists including  [[Lena Horne]], [[Billie Holiday]], and [[Eddie Heywood]], and worked on Sarah Vaughan's management team for fifteen years, from 1945 to 1960.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.allaboutjazz.com/this-week-at-the-jazz-museum-nov-27-30.php|title=Jazz news: This Week at the Jazz Museum Nov 27–30|last=|first=|date=2007-11-26|website=All About Jazz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Garry began working at the jazz club [[Birdland (New York jazz club)|Birdland]] and rose to the position of club manager.  He was the first African-American manager of a major downtown New York City night club.  During the 1960s, Garry also worked at Club Sahara, another New York City jazz club.  He remained at Birdland until 1977.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1977, Garry was hired to work for [[Jazzmobile]] by [[Billy Taylor]].  He stayed at Jazzmobile until 2012, working as production coordinator, technical director, and historian.  While at Jazzmobile, Garry's credits included production of the Philip Morris Super (Jazz) Band on Tour, an international touring festival, and Jazzmobile's free outdoor summer mobile concert series, held throughout the [[Boroughs of New York City|five boroughs of New York City]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Garry worked as booking agent and road manager for the Bill Lockett Music Festivals and Jazz Cruises, and as stage manager for the Jazz Foundation of America's gala concerts.

During his career, Garry worked with many jazz artists, including [[Billy Taylor]], [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]], [[Nancy Wilson (jazz singer)|Nancy Wilson]], [[B.B. King]], [[Jimmy Heath]], [[Clark Terry]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Wycliffe Gordon]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[James Brown]], [[Houston Person]], [[Lou Donaldson]], [[Jimmy Heath]], [[Roy Hargrove]], [[Dianne Reeves]], [[Solomon Hicks]], [[Randy Weston]], [[Christian Sands]], [[Frank Foster (musician)|Frank Foster]], [[Charenee Wade]], [[Bobby Sanabria]], [[Antoinette Montague]], [[Monty Alexander]], [[T.

'''Katoptronophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] for [[mirror]]s (the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for ''mirror'' is ''katoptron'').  It may include activities such as [[sexual intercourse|having sex]] in front of mirrors, [[masturbating]] in front of mirrors, enacting other paraphilias in front of a mirror, having an [[Group sex|orgy]] in front of a mirror, or enacting stripping fetishism in front of mirrors.

Enacting katoptronophiliac fantasies may involve constructing environments for erotic activity in which one is completely surrounded by mirrors, sometimes including even on the ceiling.  A person who is a ''katoptronophiliac'' may put mirrors all over their house so they can have sex in any room in the house.

Many [[pornographic films]] show [[porn stars]] having sex in front of mirrors.
Many people enjoy having sex in front of mirrors and have mirrors in their bedrooms in which they can watch themselves have sex. They sometimes engage in this activity for their personal enjoyment. On a deeper level this could relate to the person's need to reflect and critique themselves, and also being on a mental state of [[narcissism]].  The person often is solely absorbed in themselves and likes to watch their actions so as to admire.

==Katoptronophilia in popular culture==
'''[[Music]]'''

* [[Rhythm and blues|RnB]] singer [[Ne-Yo]] included a song on his debut album ''[[In My Own Words]]'' entitled "Mirror", describing the fetish.
* In the film, ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]'', from Bernardo Bertolucci, there is a scene in which one of the main characters practices the fetish.
*The film [[American Psycho (film)]] also contains a scene in which the protagonist, [[Patrick Bateman]] admires himself in the mirror whilst having intercourse with two escort girls, one of whom tries to get his attention shortly afterwards, apparently unsuccessfully, implying Bateman's fixation on his own image.

The '''media and American adolescent sexuality''' relates to the effect the media has on the [[Adolescent sexuality in the United States|sexuality of American adolescents]], and the portrayal thereof.

According to Sexual Teens, Sexual Media: Investigating Media's Influence on Adolescent Sexuality, adolescence can be divided into three different stages; early (ages 8–13 years), middle(ages 13–16 for girls, 14-17 for boys) and late (16 and older for girls, 17 and older for boys). Each stage focuses on different aspects of cognitive, physical, social and psychological development. Although not all teens develop through adolescence at the same rate the stages usually follow a specific pattern. For a teen in the early stages of adolescence they are in the beginning stages of puberty. In this stage of adolescence, relationships begin to become important as well as their physical appearance. Middle adolescence is characterized by independence from their family and increased activity with their peers. This is the stage where sexual activity may begin to occur. The last stage of adolescence the teenager begins to feel more secure in their bodies and their sexual behavior. With these aspects of adolescence in mind, media can play an important role in how teen shape their views about sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexual Teens, Sexual Media: Investigating Media's Influence on Adolescent Sexuality|year=2002|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|pages=2|author1=Jane D. Brown |author2=Jeanne R. Steele |author3=Kim Walsh-Childers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers remain divided on the role of sexuality in the media on adolescent sexual health.  The American Academy of Pediatrics has argued that media representations of sexuality may influence teen sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="PED media"/&gt;  However some scholars have argued that such claims have been premature.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2010"&gt;Steinberg, L., &amp; Monahan, K.  2010.  Developmental Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite increasing amounts of sexual media US Government statistic state that teens have delayed the onset of sexual intercourse in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;childstats.gov&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalism professor and media critic Jane Brown, the media is piquing teen interest in sex at ages younger than previous.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; Dr. Brown argues that research has "found a direct relationship between the amount of sexual content children see and their level of sexual activity or their intentions to have sex in the future."&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt;  However, the direction (and mechanism) of causality remains unclear.

==Sexuality in the media==
Some scholars argue that American media is the most sexually suggestive in the world.&lt;ref name="Strasburger"/&gt; According to this view, the sexual messages contained in film, television, and music are becoming more explicit in dialog, lyrics, and behavior. In addition, these messages may contain unrealistic, inaccurate, and misleading information. Some scholars argue that still developing teens may be particularly vulnerable to media effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruber|first=Enid|author2=Grube, Joel|title=Adolescent Sexuality and the Media|journal=Western Journal of Medicine|date=March 2000|volume=172|series=3|pages=210–214|doi=10.1136/ewjm.172.3.210|pmc=1070813}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2001 report found that teens rank the media second only to school sex education programs as a leading source of information about sex,&lt;ref name="PED media" /&gt; but a 2004 report found that "the media far outranked parents or schools as the source of information about birth control."&lt;ref name="Strasburger" /&gt;

Media often portray emotional side-effects of sexuality such as guilt, and disappointment, but less often physical risks such as pregnancy or STDs.&lt;ref name="Roberts et al."&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Roberts| author2=Henriksen| author3=Foehr| last-author-amp=yes| title=Adolescence,adolescents, and media| journal=Handbook of Adolescent Sexuality| edition=3rd| year=2009| volume=2| pages=314–344| doi=10.1002/9780470479193.adlpsy002010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One media analysis found that sex was usually between unmarried couples and examples of using condoms or other contraception were "extremely rare."&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt; Many of programs or films do not depict consequence for sexual behavior. For example, only 10% programs that contain sexual scenes include any warnings to the potential risks or responsibilities of having sex such as sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; In television programming aimed at teens, more than 90% of episodes had at least one sexual reference in it with an average of 7.9 references per hour.&lt;ref name="aubrey"/&gt;

However, government statistics suggest that since 1991, both teen sex and teen pregnancy have declined dramatically despite the media generally becoming increasingly sexually explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://childstats.gov/americaschildren/beh4.asp|title=Childstats.gov - America's Children: Key National Indicators of Well-Being, 2017 - Sexual Activity|website=childstats.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of the media on beliefs about sex==
Some scholars feel that adolescents may turn to the media as a "sexual super peer" when seeking information about sexual norms and adult roles given the lack of information about sexuality readily available to them.&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt; For example, in one study of 13-and 14-year-olds, heavy exposure to sexually oriented television also increased acceptance of non-marital sex.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; Another study found that teens overestimate how many of their peers are sexually active, a problem contributed to by the media.&lt;ref name="media impact"/&gt;

Another study found that middle-school-aged boys who watch music videos or pro-wrestling one day a week are 10% more likely to have a higher acceptance rate for rape than boys who do not watch any.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;!--&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt;--&gt; Boys who watch music videos four days a week and pro wrestling 1.7 days a week (the mean exposure rate for boys) have 70% higher odds of endorsing a greater level of rape acceptance.&lt;ref name="Kaestle"/&gt; "Both music videos and pro wrestling shows are popular with youth, combine violent and sexual content, and glorify individuals who behave violently."&lt;ref name="Kaestle"/&gt;

==Effects of the media on sexual behavior==

===Pregnancy===
Some researchers have found a correlation between the amount of television with high sexual content that teenagers watch and an increased likelihood of them becoming pregnant or fathering a child out of wedlock.&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; Some studies suggest teens exposed to the most sexual content on TV are twice as likely as teens watching less of this material to become pregnant before they reach age 20.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

These researchers believe that reducing the amount of sexual content adolescents watch on television could substantially reduce the teen pregnancy rate.&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; "It's a cumulative effect," Brown believes. "It's probably not any one portrayal that makes the difference, but it's a consistent, and now unhealthy, sexual script that adolescents do see as a depiction of appropriate behavior."&lt;ref name="brownusa"/&gt;

Several complementary studies have found that television viewing can influence multiple aspects of reproductive health among youths and that "earlier sexual initiation is associated with negative health outcomes."&lt;ref name="tv sex"/&gt; Previous research has suggested two ways that glamorized perception of sex may contribute to teen pregnancy: by encouraging teens to become sexually active early in their adolescence and by promoting inconsistent use of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

===Early sexual activity===
Some studies have also found that adolescents whose [[media diet]] was rich in sexual content were more than twice as likely as others to have had sex by the time they were 16.&lt;ref name="truth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Luscombe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="watching sex"/&gt; In a Kaiser Family Foundation study, 76 percent of teens said that one reason young people have sex is because TV shows and movies make it seem normal for teens.&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt; In addition to higher likelihoods that an adolescent exposed to sexual content in the media will engage in sexual behaviors, they are also have higher levels of intending to have sex in the future and more positive expectations of sex.&lt;ref name="tv sex 2006"/&gt;

Some studies suggest that children who watch adult content on television are more likely to have sex earlier once they reach adolescence.&lt;ref name="early tv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHB"/&gt; For every hour of adult-targeted television or movies watched by children when they were 6 to 8 years old, there was a 33% increased risk of becoming sexually active in early adolescence.

"Children have neither the life experience nor the brain development to fully differentiate between a reality they are moving toward and a fiction meant solely to entertain," explained David Bickham, a staff scientist in the Center on Media and Child Health.&lt;ref name="CHB"/&gt; "Children learn from the media, and when they watch media with sexual references and innuendos, our research suggests they are more likely to engage in sexual activity earlier in life."&lt;ref name="CHB"/&gt;

Other research has suggested that linking sexuality in media with adolescent sexual behavior is premature.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2010"/&gt; Steinberg and Monahan reanalized a dataset of teen sexual behavior (Collins et al.) using [[propensity score matching]] and discovered that with other risk factors controlled, viewing sexual media did not predict early onset of sexual behavior in adolescents. The authors concluded that links between media viewing and adolescent sexuality are more tenuous than previous believed.

Researchers on both sides of the debate acknowledge that assigning causality to correlations between media use and sexual behavior are difficult, given the lack of experimental research, and difficulty controlling for all potential confounding variables.&lt;ref name="Steinberg &amp; Monahan 2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinberg |author2=Monahan |last-author-amp=yes |title=Premature Dissemination of Advice Undermines Our Credibility as Scientists : Reply to Brown (2011) and to Collins, Martino, and Elliott (2011) |journal=Developmental Psychology |year=2011 |volume=47 |pages=582–584 |doi=10.1037/a0022562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study found that the relationship between exposure to sexual contact in the media and increased sexual activity among adolescents is more pronounced in white youths than black youths. Black teens are more likely to be influenced by their friends' sexual experiences and their parents' expectations than by what they see in the media.&lt;ref name="sexy media"/&gt;

==Pornography==
Between the 3rd and 10th grades more than 90% of children will be exposed to pornography.&lt;ref name="porn"/&gt; Psychiatrist Jerald says access, affordability and anonymity have made online sexual activity "extraordinarily common" among all ages, including adolescents.&lt;ref name="porn"/&gt; Adolescents who intentionally seek out pornography, both online and off, are overwhelmingly male.&lt;ref name="Ybarra"/&gt; Older youth are more likely than younger youth to seek porn.&lt;ref name="Ybarra"/&gt; Individuals who are already at risk of being attracted to sexual aggression are more likely to be influenced by pornographic exposure. This in turn explains that these individuals are more likely to believe in the various unusual sexual behaviors as common causing negative effects towards sexual experiences. However, it is important that once these negative attitudes have been formed, it was not easily reversed by education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malamuth|first=Neil|date=October 1993|title=Pornography's Impact on Male Adolescent|url=|journal=Adolescent Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tit-pull by ropemarks.jpg|thumb|225px|Nipple clamps with attached chain (chain is being pulled for added pain)]]
[[File:Nipple clamps MMB 01.jpg|thumb|225px|Clothespin-style clamps in use. The screw is used to adjust the pressure.]]
[[File:Nipple clamps 03.JPG|thumb|225px|Tweezer type of Nipple clamp]]
[[File:Clover nipple clamps.JPG|thumb|225px|Clover clamps]]

A '''nipple clamp''' is a [[sex toy]]. It is a [[Clamp (tool)|clamp]] that is applied to the [[nipple]]s of a person of any gender. It causes pain by the pinching of the nipple, by the restriction of blood flow, and by the reintroduction of blood flow. Nipple clamps are used in some [[BDSM]] activities, such as [[breast torture]]. The main types of nipple clamps are the ''clover clamp'', ''tweezer clamp'', ''piercing clamp'', and ''[[clothespin|clothes-pin]] style'', though any device that applies direct pressure can be used.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

Clamps are typically used in pairs and often connected by a chain.{{cn|date=July 2016}} Weights may be hung from the clamps to amplify the pain by increasing the pressure and pinching. The chain may be wrapped behind a fixed piece of [[erotic furniture]] such as a post, so that, when the wearer is prodded to jump or otherwise move suddenly, pain is increased by pulling of the nipples. Another variation involves attaching another chain to the chain, the end of which is connected to a clamp attached to either the [[clitoris]] for a female or a [[cock ring]] for a male. This variation is known as the "Y clamps" for the shape of the chain linking all three connection points when attached to the body.

== Clothes-pin style ==
A clothes-pin style clamp works like a common household clothes-pin — two short lengths of metal, joined by a spring to keep one end closed. This type often comes with screws to adjust the pressure, screwing in to release it.

== Tweezer clamp ==
A '''tweezer clamp''' consists of two short lengths of metal, no more than 5&amp;ndash;10&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;in) in length. The two lengths are fixed together at one end and open at the other end (just like a regular tweezer). The open ends are curved slightly to improve their ability to grip the nipple. Typically, they have a small 1&amp;nbsp;cm rubber sheath over this end to protect the nipple from damage and reduce slippage. A small ring wraps around the two pieces of metal and is used to adjust the tension. The user places the two sides of the metal head either side of the nipple, then by sliding the ring along the clamp shaft towards the nipple, causes the two halves to close tighter together. Tension can thus be adjusted depending on the location of the ring &amp;mdash; the closer the ring is along the shaft toward the nipple, the tighter the clamp.

== Clover clamp ==
The '''clover clamp''', also referred to as a "butterfly clamp", is of [[Japan]]ese design{{cn|date=January 2013}} and provides increasing tension if pulled. The clamp itself is flat, about 5&amp;nbsp;cm by 10&amp;nbsp;cm (2 by 4&amp;nbsp;in) in size. The clamp is applied to the nipple and the spring tension holds the clamp in place. The clamp usually provides a very high pain level, and is usually only used by more advanced users. To increase tension on the nipples, small weights such as fishing line sinkers can be attached to the ends of the clamp. As increased pulling tension is applied to the clamp, it will cause the jaws of the clamp to close tighter, depending on the amount of pull pressure. Another method is to use the clamps to keep a person in one place. If cord is tied from the clamp to a fixed place, the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move. Eventually the clamps would be pulled off the nipples but not before considerable pain is felt. If left on for too long can cause nipple irritation.

'''Omni art''' is an [[art movement]] that emerged in 1988 in [[New York City]] ([[United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Village Voice, 1988. Village Voice Media Group&lt;/ref&gt; Omni art followed [[Pop art]] and [[Postmodernism]] by shifting attention from social and political issues focusing on the emerging convergence of science, consciousness and art in the late 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Art and Consciousness 2008, Embracing The Journey Podcast with Karen Humphries Sallick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Weekly, Interview for performance installation "Khymera" benefit for The Boulder County AIDS Project.1999&lt;/ref&gt;

It draws from ancient [[Sanskrit]] mysticism, [[sacred geometry]], and [[Quantum field theory|theoretical quantum physics]], and its premise maintains that sentient experience is immersed in a multidimensional [[quantum field]] that can be distilled into 5 distinct yet connected planes or dimensions that together weave a Universal fabric or “cosmic soup” of existence.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Observer 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Creating an Art Style", The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1,2,3.

==The Omni art Perspective==
Within the Omni art paradigm,&lt;ref&gt;see OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. 2007, Voice One Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; there is an ascending series of vibrational fields ranging from the most coarse in vibratory rate (the physical dimension) to the most subtle and sublime (the etheric dimension). Each of the 5 dimensions (described below) maintain environmental vibrational fields that correlate with universal particle and wave energy signatures with qualities that can be ascertained through both [[empirical]] and subjective methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Observer'', September 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey 2007, Voice One Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-4276-1589-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Colorado Daily,University of Colorado 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Omni art is concerned with exploring and expressing sentient life experiences of and within these 5-dimensional fields that exhibit powerful influences within and upon sentient and other life forms.&lt;ref&gt;Boulder Weekly Interview, Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum physicist postulates that a wave/particle model of energy and matter substructs universal cosmology and in this way quantum physicists and Omni artists are concerned with the same observable and intuited phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;The Creation of an Art Movement,Episodes 1-3. The Omni Art Salon 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] postulates that these 5-dimensional vibrational particle and wave fields are experienced in the human consciousness through light and sound waves forming a 5-dimensional matrix that sustains the fabric of existence for all life in the visible and invisible universe.&lt;ref&gt;Omni Art - Language of Consciousness, Milburn, Jeffrey. Voice One Publishing 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Five Dimensions of Human Experience==
[[Image:Omni Art Book.jpg|thumb|200px|Language of Consciousness (2007) is a personal description of an art style he developed during the late 1980s and founded as a style in a groundbreaking museum installation in 1991.]]

'''The Physical Dimension''' - The [[primary vibrational field]] has the most dense oscillation pattern and energy signature manifested as matter within the physical universe.

'''The Astral Dimension''' - The [[secondary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the physical dimension. This is where dreams, psychic cognition, human emotions, and paranormal phenomenon take place.

'''The Causal Dimension''' - The [[tertiary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the astral dimension, and is described by many researchers as a resonant “brain” or record of all the cause-effect relationships in the universe, known in ancient [[Vedic]] texts as the [[akasha]].

'''The Mental Dimension''' - The [[quaternary vibrational field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the causal dimension. The human mind experiences this vibrational field as thoughts, ideas, concepts and connectivity.

'''The Etheric Dimension''' - The [[quinary dimensional field]] has a faster and finer oscillation pattern and energy signature than the mental dimension. This is the subconscious portal to the non-dual dimensions.
This dimension acts as the gateway into non-duality or singularity and can be observed in sudden, unexplainable awareness that spontaneously appears as an "aha!", or sudden, moment of realization.

==The Universalist Group Collection==

Artist [[Jeffrey Milburn]] mounted a museum installation of the foundational collection of 12 artworks called “The Universalist Group.” in 1991 at [http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/islip_art_museum/index.html The Islip Art Museum]&lt;ref&gt;The Islip Art Museum, Islip, New York. March 1991&lt;/ref&gt; in Islip, New York. This group of 12 assemblage artworks were created over a period of 10 years beginning in 1981, and provide the basic vocabulary for the language of the Omni art style. Milburn coined this style of art “Omni art” in 1988 when he founded this nascent art movement. The Universalist Group collection has appeared in whole or in part in all of Milburn's performance installations over the last 30 years and is described in detail in his book, OMNI ART - Language of Consciousness, Milburn’s treatise regarding Omni art.

Milburn's artworks are assemblages of found objects, canvas, and paint. Milburn describes the juxtaposition of objects in his artworks as creating a gestalt “language” allowing the observer to communicate with an inner experience he describes as a “language of consciousness” that is attuned to the observer's current state of developmental awareness. In this way, each artwork serves as a catalyst for a personal inspiration or realization that mirrors what quantum physicists describe as the observer and observed duality that collapses into a singularity field. This is the same [[Omega Point|singularity]] that scientists and ancient spiritual teachers describe as “Source” or “Oneness” that is the origination point for all particles and waves that form the phenomenon of existence.

In this way, Omni art is literally defined as “God art” or “Source art” both by intentional application and [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] utilization. The term Omni was discovered by Milburn when researching terminology that would apply to this emerging art form. Milburn describes his role as one of an artist/mystic and subsequently he has come to be known as “The Oracle of Omni.”

[[Image:Omni art universalist group.jpg|205px|thumb|left|Artist's statement from a 1991 installation at The Islip Art Museum in Islip, New York.]]

===Sacred Geometry===

One of the two primary artworks from The Universalist Group collection titled “SOUL” (1981) contains many elements that are fundamental in the science of [[sacred geometry]]. Surrounding the mirror in the center circle on this art work are 5 hand cut quartz crystals in the shape of the 5 platonic solids originally discovered and articulated upon by [[Plato]].

Milburn identified these platonic solids as corresponding to the 5-dimensional vibrational fields which he deduced constitute the basic elements forming a universal cosmological structure.

This center circle area is fronted with a 3-dimensional metaform mandala projecting out from the front of the artwork also containing many sacred geometry's. Milburn discovered 16 years after creating this artwork that its basic shape reflects the geometric shape of a black hole and posited that this peculiarity pertains to the ancient [[Kabbalistic]] theory that all in the invisible universe is reflected in the visible universe - or more commonly stated as “as above, so below.” In quantum physics jargon this same cosmological structure was articulated by physicist [[David Bohm]] as an “implicate and explicate order.”

Milburn further describes this artwork as a symbolic map or representation of universal [[cosmological]] structures that integrate with emerging scientific theories of conscious human evolution.

===The Omni art Movement===
According to Milburn, conscious human evolution is intrinsic and incontrovertible and can be seen in all aspects of life.  It naturally follows that this conscious evolution can then be observed in all the arts, sciences, and cultural idioms and he coined this process “meta-evolution” as it transcends the boundaries of [[scientific materialism]]. Reaching into the invisible regions of discovery not accessible by current technology, this evolutionary phenomenon is seen by Milburn to be the definition of the Omni art movement in the widest sense.&lt;ref&gt;Creating a New Art, The Omni Art Salon Episodes 1-3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Rocky Mountain News, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;radio interview, KGNU Boulder Public Radio 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, Public Dialogue on The Four Propositions 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Milburn states that in popular culture one can observe the contemporary appearance of this meta-evolutionary process in contemporary films, books, and videos exploring the many aspects of emerging awareness as it intersects with a popular fascination with metaphysical and [[paranormal phenomenon]].&lt;ref&gt;"Orbiting Omni Art", The Boulder Weekly 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this phenomenon such as UFO sightings, and most recently the light orbs that are appearing by the hundreds of thousands in low resolution (below 2 mega-pixels) digital photographs espoused upon in [[Miceal Ledwith]] and physicist Klaus Heinemann's 2008 book [http://books.simonandschuster.ca/Orb-Project/Klaus-Heinemann/9781582701820 The Orb Project], have captured the imaginations of millions of people around the world and show no sign of abating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12962">'''Onomasiology''' (from {{lang-el|ὀνομάζω}} (onomāzο)—to name, which in turn is from ὄνομα—name) is a branch of [[linguistics]] concerned with the question "how do you express X?" It is in fact most commonly understood as a branch of [[lexicology]], the study of words (although some apply the term also to [[grammar]] and conversation). 

Onomasiology, as a part of lexicology, starts from a concept which is taken to be prior&lt;ref&gt;OED: "The study of language which deals with the identification of a preconceived
meaning or concept by name or names"&lt;/ref&gt;
(i.e. an idea, an object, a quality, an activity etc.) and asks for its names. The opposite approach is known as [[semasiology]]: here one starts with a word and asks what it means, or what concepts the word refers to. Thus, an onomasiological question is, e.g., "what are the names for long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried?" (answers: ''french fries'' in the US, ''chips'' in the UK, etc.), while a semasiological question is, e.g., "what is the meaning of the term ''chips''?" (answers: 'long, narrow pieces of potato that have been deep-fried' in the UK, 'slim slices of potatoes deep fried or baked until crisp' in the US).

Onomasiology can be carried out [[wikt:synchronic|synchronically]] or [[wikt:diachronic|diachronically]], i.e. historically.

==Definition==

Onomasiology was initiated in the late 19th century, but it didn't receive its name until 1902, when the Austrian linguist Adolf Zauner published his study on the body-part terminology in [[Romance languages]]. And it was in Romance linguistics that the most important onomasiological works were written. Early linguists were basically interested in the etymology (i.e. the word-history) of the various expressions for a concept which was mostly a clearly defined, unchangeable concrete object or action. Later the Austrian linguists Rudolf Meringer and [[Hugo Schuchardt]] started the "[[Wörter und Sachen]]" movement, which emphasized that every study of a word needed to include the study of the object it denotes. It was also Schuchardt who underlined that the etymologist/onomasiologist, when tracing back the history of a word, needs to respect both the "dame phonétique" (prove the regularity of sound changes or explain irregularities) and the "dame sémantique" (justify semantic changes).

Another branch that developed from onomasiology and, at the same time, enriched it in turn was linguistic geography (areal linguistics), since it provided onomasiologists with valuable [[linguistic atlas]]es. The first ones are ''Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reiches'' of [[Georg Wenker]] and [[Ferdinand Wrede]], published beginning in 1888, the ALF (''[[Atlas Linguistique de la France]]'') by [[Jules Gilliéron]] (1902–1920), the AIS (''Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der Südschweiz'') by [[Karl Jaberg]] and [[Jakob Jud]] (1928–1940), the DSA (''Deutscher Sprachatlas'') by Ferdinand Wrede et al. (1927–1956). These atlases include maps that show the corresponding names for a concept in different regions as they were gathered in interviews with dialect speakers (mostly old rural males) by means of a questionnaire. Concerning English linguistics, onomasiology as well as linguistic geography has been playing only a minor role (the first linguistic atlas for the US was initiated by [[Hans Kurath]], the first one for the UK by Eugen Dieth).

In 1931 the German linguist [[Jost Trier]] introduced a new method in his book ''Der deutsche Wortschatz im Sinnbezirk des Verstandes'' which is known as the [[lexical field theory]]. According to Trier, lexical changes must always be seen, apart from the traditional aspects, in connection with the changes within a given word-field. After World War II few studies on onomasiological theory have been carried out (e.g. by [[Cecil H. Brown]], [[Stanley R. Witkowski]], [[Brent Berlin]]). But onomasiology has recently seen new light with the works of [[Dirk Geeraerts]], Andreas Blank, Peter Koch and the periodical ''Onomasiology Online'', which is published at the Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt by [[Joachim Grzega]], Alfred Bammesberger and Marion Schöner. A recent representative of synchronic onomasiology (with a focus on word-formation processes) is Pavol Stekauer.

==Instruments for the historical onomasiologist==

The most important instruments for the historical onomasiologist are:
* the [[linguistic atlas]]
* the [[etymological dictionary]]
* the dialect dictionary
* [[thesaurus|thesauri]]
* diachronic [[text corpus|text corpora]]

==Lexical change==
===Explanations===

When a speaker has to name something, they first try to categorize it. If the speaker can classify the referent as member of a familiar concept, they will carry out some sort of cognitive-linguistic cost-benefit-analysis: what should I say to get what I want. Based on this analysis, the speaker can then either fall back on an already existing word or decide to coin a new designation. These processes are sometimes more conscious, sometimes less conscious.

The coinage of a new designation can be incited by various forces (cf. Grzega 2004):
* difficulties in classifying the thing to be named or attributing the right word to the thing to be named, thus confusing designations
* fuzzy difference between superordinate and subordinate term due to the monopoly of the prototypical member of a category in the real world
* everyday contact situations
* institutionalized and non-institutionalized linguistic pre- and proscriptivism
* flattery
* insult
* disguising things (i.e. [[euphemism|euphemistic]] language, [[doublespeak]])
* taboo
* avoidance of words that are phonetically similar or identical to negatively associated words
* abolition of forms that can be ambiguous in many contexts
* wordplay/puns
* excessive length of words
* morphological misinterpretation (creation of transparency by changes within a word = [[folk-etymology]])
* deletion of irregularity
* desire for plastic/illustrative/telling names for a thing
* natural prominence of a concept
* cultural-induced prominence of a concept
* changes in the world
* changes in the categorization of the world
* prestige/fashion (based on the prestige of another language or variety, of certain word-formation patterns, or of certain semasiological centers of expansion)

The following alleged motives found in many works have been claimed (with corresponding argumentation) to be invalid by Grzega (2004): decrease in salience, reading errors, laziness, excessive phonetic shortness, difficult sound combinations, unclear stress patterns, cacophony.

===Processes===

In the case of intentional, conscious innovation, speakers have to pass several levels of a word-finding or name-giving process: (1) analysis of the specific features of the concept, (2) onomasiological level (where the semantic components for the naming units are selected ["naming in a more abstract sense"]), (3) the onomatological level (where the concrete morphemes are selected ["naming in a more concrete sense"]). The level of feature analysis (and possibly the onomasiological level) can be spared if the speaker simply borrows a word from a foreign language or variety; it is also spared if the speaker simply takes the word s/he originally fell back to and just shortens it.

If the speaker does not shorten an already existing word for the concept, but coins a new one, s/he can select from several types of processes. These coinages may be based on a model from the speaker's own idiom, on a model from a foreign idiom, or, in the case of root creations, on no model at all. In sum, we get the following catalog of formal processes of word-coining (cf. Koch 2002):

* adoption of either
# an already existing word of speaker's own language ([[semantic change]]) or (b)
# a word from a foreign language ([[loanword]])
* [[Conversion (word formation)|conversion]] (e.g. ''to e-mail'' from the noun ''e-mail'')
* composition (in a broad sense, i.e. [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] and derivations, which are, very consciously, not further subclassified)
* [[elliptical construction|ellipsis]] (i.e. morpheme deletion, e.g. the noun ''daily'' from ''daily newspaper'')
* [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]] (i.e. morpheme shortening, e.g. ''fan'' from ''fanatic'')
* [[acronym]]s (e.g. ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* [[Blend word|blend]]ings (including [[folk-etymology|folk-etymologies]], although these come up non-intentionally, e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* [[back-derivation]] (e.g. ''to baby-sit'' from ''babysitter'')
* [[reduplication]] (e.g. ''goody-goody'')
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] alteration (e.g. number change as in ''people'' as a plural word instead of a singular word)
* [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautological]] compounds (e.g. ''peacock'' for original ''pea'', which already meant 'peacock')
* wordplaying/[[pun]]s
* stress alteration (e.g. stress shift in E. ''ímport'' vs. ''impórt'')
* graphic alteration (e.g. E. ''discrete'' vs. ''discreet'')
* [[Phraseology|phraseologism]]
* [[Root (linguistics)|root creation]] (including [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] and expressive words)

The name-giving process is completed with (4) the actual phonetic realization on the morphonological level.

In order to create a new word, the speaker first selects one or two physically and psychologically salient aspects. The search for the motivations ([[iconeme]]s) is based on one or several cognitive-associative relations. These relations are:

*contiguity relations (= "neighbor-of" relations)
*similarity relations (= "similar-to" relations)
*partiality relations (= "part-of" relations)
*contrast relations (= "opposite-to" relations)
These relations can be seen between forms, between concepts and between form and concept. 

A complete catalog reads the following associative relations (cf. also Koch 2002):

* identity (e.g. with loans)
* "figurative", i.e. individually felt, similarity of the concepts (e.g. ''mouse'' for a computer device that looks '''like''' a mouse)
* contiguity of concepts (e.g. ''a Picasso'' for a painting '''by''' Picasso or ''glass'' for a container made '''out of''' glass)
* partiality of concepts (e.g. ''bar'' 'place of an inn where drinks are mixed' for the '''entire''' inn)
* contrast of concepts (e.g. ''bad'' in the sense of "good")
* "literal" or "figurative" similarity between the forms of a sign and the concept (e.g. with onomatopoetic words like ''purr'')
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. with generalization of meaning, e.g. ''Christmas tree'' for any kind of fir tree or even any kind of conifer)
* strong relation between contents of signs and contrast of concepts (e.g. with ''learn'' in the sense of "teach" in some English dialects)
* strong relation between contents of signs and "literal" similarity of concepts (e.g. ''corn'' in the English sense of "wheat" or Scottish sense of "oats" instead of "cereal")
* ("literal") similarity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''sparrow-grass'' for ''asparagus'')
* contiguity of the forms of signs (e.g. ''brunch'' from ''breakfast + lunch'', ''VAT'' from ''value added tax'')
* "literal", i.e. objectively visible, similarity and contiguity of concepts (e.g. with the transfer of names among spruce and fir in many dialects)
* "literal" similarity of referents and strong relation between contents of signs
* multiple associations (e.g. with certain forms of word-play)

The concrete associations can or cannot be incited by a model which may be of speaker's own idiom or a foreign idiom.

Dyslexia is a complex, lifelong disorder involving difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters and other symbols. Dyslexia does not affect general intelligence, but is often co-diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;ref name="NCLD"&gt;{{cite web|author=NCLD Editorial Team|title=What is Dyslexia|url=http://www.ncld.org/types-learning-disabilities/dyslexia/what-is-dyslexia|publisher=National center for Learning disabilities|accessdate=2013-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.childrenshospital.org/az/Site3074/mainpageS3074P1.html | title = Dyslexia | publisher=Boston Children's Hospital | accessdate = 2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least three sub-types of dyslexia that have been recognized by researchers: orthographic, or surface dyslexia, phonological dyslexia and mixed dyslexia where individuals exhibit symptoms of both orthographic and phonological dyslexia.&lt;ref name="caplan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caplan|first=David|title=Neurolinguistics and Linguistic Aphasiology|year=1987|publisher=New York: Cambridge University Press|pages=201–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that dyslexia is genetic and can be passed down through families, but it is important to note that, although a genetic disorder, there is no specific locus in the brain for reading and writing. The human brain does have language centers (for spoken and gestural communication), but written language is a cultural artifact, and a very complex one requiring brain regions designed to recognize and interpret written symbols as representations of language in rapid synchronization. The complexity of the system and the lack of genetic predisposition for it is one possible explanation for the difficulty in acquiring and understanding written language.&lt;ref name="wolf"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Wolf, Maryanne.

Furthermore, recent evidence has found that there are certain genes responsible for causing dyslexia.&lt;ref name="NDS"&gt;"[http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm Dyslexia Information Page"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727234247/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm |date=2016-07-27 }}. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. 12 May 2010. Retrieved 5 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests a clear genetic basis for developmental dyslexia with abnormalities in certain language areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Witelson"&gt;Witelson, Sandra. "Developmental Dyslexia: TwoRight Hemispheres and None Left." Science, New Series 195.4275(1977): 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there is also evidence that orthography, the correspondence between the language's phonemes (sound units) and its graphemes (characters, symbols, letters), plays a significant role in the type and frequency of dyslexia's manifestations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Paulesu, E, et al. "Dyslexia: Cultural Diversityand Biological Unity." Science 291.5511 (2001): 2165-2167.&lt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/291/5511/2165.full.pdf?sid=e7fcb20f-73c5-49a5-bbc4-f8efd0123b40&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some psycholinguists believe that the complexity of a language’s orthography (whether it has a high phoneme-grapheme correspondence or an irregular correspondence in which sounds don’t clearly map to symbols) affects the severity and occurrence of dyslexia, postulating that a more regular system would reduce the number of cases of dyslexia and/or the severity of symptoms.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

Unfortunately, little research has been done on [[Syllabary|syllabic]] writing systems, and "cross-linguistic studies of the acquired dyslexia and  [[dysgraphia]]s are scarce."&lt;ref name="karanth" /&gt;

==Dyslexia and orthographic features==

===Orthographic Dyslexia===
Orthographic dyslexia, a subtype of dyslexia, results in difficulty decoding and encoding skills due to slow and inaccurate rates of storing word and letter formations into memory. Orthographic dyslexics have difficulty in storing mental representation of words, especially phonetically irregular words such as word spellings that end in -ight ("light" and "sight"). The problems underlying this type of dyslexia are related directly to memory and coding skills that allow representation of printed letters and words, not to poor phonological processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhia|first=Roberts|title=Orthographic Dyslexia: The neglected subtype|year=1997|publisher=The Learning Disabilities Research &amp; Practice|pages=236–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of dyslexia is also termed surface dyslexia because people with this type have the inability to recognize words simply on a visual basis. Words that are misspelled cause the readers difficulty because they attempt to sound out the words by looking at each individual letter rather than the word as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, David. 1987. Disturbances of the sound system. In D. Caplan. Neurolinguistics and Linguistic Aphasiology: An Introduction, 201-232. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; So a reader might read the word "cat" and pronounce the "c" as a hard "c" but then read the word "ice" and pronounce the "c" as a hard "c" as well because they are sounding out each individual phoneme rather than just recognizing the word "ice" in its entirety.

Despite intervention, children suffering from orthographic dyslexia continually have lower achievement reading levels when compared to their peers. Additionally, children show a greater difficulty throughout schooling when spelling words with irregular or unusual orthographies when compared to their other children. Research also shows that dyslexic children have primary difficulties in phonological processing and secondary difficulties in orthographic processing, aiding to the distinction of two subtypes.&lt;ref name="Manis et al., 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manis|first=Franklin|first2=Rebecca|last2=Custodio|last3=Szeszulski|first3=Patricia A.|title=Development of phonological and orthographic skill: A 2-year longitudinal study of dyslexic children|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1993|volume=56|issue=1|pages=64–86|doi=10.1006/jecp.1993.1026|pmid=8366326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The effects of orthographic depth on dyslexia===
The complexity of a language's orthography is directly related to the difficulty of learning to read in that language.  Orthographic complexity also contributes to how dyslexia manifests in readers of different languages.&lt;ref name="Wolf1"&gt;[[Maryanne Wolf|Wolf, Maryanne]] (2007). Proust and the squid. Harper Collins. pp. 190-191. {{ISBN|978-0-06-018639-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deep orthographies]] are writing systems, such as those of [[English orthography|English]] and [[Arabic script|Arabic]], that do not have a one-to-one correspondence between sounds ([[phoneme]]s) and the letters ([[grapheme]]s) that represent them.

[[Shallow orthographies]], such as [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]], have a close relationship between [[grapheme]]s and [[phoneme]]s, and the spelling of words is very consistent. With shallow orthographies, new readers have few problems learning to decode words and as a result children learn to read relatively quickly. Most dyslexic readers of shallow orthographic systems learn to decode words with relative ease compared to dyslexics using deep orthographies, though they continue to have difficulty with reading fluency and comprehension.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The hallmark system of dyslexia in a shallow orthography is a comparatively slow speed of [[rapid automatized naming]].
[[File:Dislexia.jpg|thumb|198x198px|Writing and drawing performed by a child with dyslexia, displaying common behavioral symptoms.]]
For languages with relatively deep orthographies, such as [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], readers have greater difficulty learning to decode new words than languages with shallow orthographies. As a result, children's reading achievement levels are lower.&lt;ref name="goswami"&gt;Goswami, Usha (2005-09-06). "Chapter 28: Orthography, Phonology, and Reading Development: A Cross-Linguistic Perspective". in Malatesha, Joshi. Handbook of orthography and literacy. Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc Inc. pp. 463–464. {{ISBN|0-8058-4652-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that the hallmark symptoms of dyslexia in a deep orthography are a deficit in phonological awareness and difficulty reading words at grade level.&lt;ref name="snowling"&gt;Snowling, Margaret J. (2004). "Chapter 4: The science of dyslexia: a review of contemporary approaches. in Turner, Martin and John Rack. The study of dyslexia. Kluwer Academic/Plenum publishers. p. 80. {{ISBN|0-306-48535-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For these dyslexic readers, learning to decode words may take a long time—indeed, in the deepest orthographies a distinctive symptom of dyslexia is the inability to read at the word level—but many dyslexic readers have fewer problems with fluency and comprehension once some level of decoding has been mastered.

Studies between the English and German (which has a shallower orthography than English) languages have shown that the greater depth of the English orthography has a "marked adverse effect on reading skills" among children with dyslexia, though the dyslexics in these studies still mostly underperformed compared to control groups.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landerl |date= 1997 |title=The impact of orthographic consistency on dyslexia: A German-English comparison |journal=Cognition |volume=63 |issue= 3|pages=315–334  |url=  |doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(97)00005-X |pmid=9265873 |first1=K |last2=Wimmer |first2=H |last3=Frith |first3=U }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frith |first=Uta |date= 1998 |title=Differences in Phonological Recoding in German- and English-Speaking Children |journal=Scientific Studies of Reading |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=31–54  |url=  |doi=10.1207/s1532799xssr0201_2 |last2=Wimmer |first2=Heinz |last3=Landerl |first3=Karin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research, however, has suggested that all children with dyslexia still suffer the same reading difficulties despite different orthographies, including reading speed deficit and slow decoding mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These findings suggest that orthographic differences do not significantly impact the main difficulties those with dyslexia experience.

==Dyslexia in different types of orthographies==
There are a number of different types of writing systems, or orthographies, and they do not necessarily depend on the same neurological skill sets.&lt;ref&gt;Cell Press (2009, October 13). Dyslexia Varies Across Languages. ScienceDaily. Retrieved July 26, 2013, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091012121333.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, certain dyslexic deficits may be more pronounced in some orthographies than in others. For example, in alphabetic languages, [[phonological awareness]] is highly predictive of reading ability. But in Chinese (a logographic system), orthographic awareness and [[Fine motor skill|motor programming]] are highly predictive of reading ability.&lt;ref name="pmid15939871"&gt;{{cite journal

===Dyslexia in alphabetic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Alphabet|Managing dyslexia: alphabetic orthography}}
Most of the current research on dyslexia focuses on alphabetic orthography.&lt;ref name="karanth" /&gt;

Alphabetic writing systems vary significantly in the depth of their orthography. [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] are considered deep orthographies in comparison to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] which are [[Orthography#Defectiveness|shallow orthographies]]. A deep orthography like English has letters or letter combinations that do not reliably map to specific phonemes/sound units, and so are ambiguous in terms of the sounds that they represent whereas a transparent or shallow orthography has symbols that (more) uniquely map to sounds, ideally in a one-to-one correspondence or at least with limited or clearly signified (as with accent marks or other distinguishing features) variation. Literacy studies have shown that even for children without reading difficulties like dyslexia, a more transparent orthography is learned more quickly and more easily; this is true across language systems (syllabic, alphabetic, and logographic), and between shallow and deep alphabetic languages.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In cross-language studies, Aro and Wimmer report differences in developmental reading skills across several alphabetic orthographies.  Among those tested, [[English language|English]] children achieved only 50% accuracy in [[pseudoword]] testing by the end of first grade and did not attain high accuracy until fourth grade. However, in the same test, [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] children all achieved scores approaching 85% and 90% in Grade 1 and Grade 4, respectively.&lt;ref name="Aro"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research provides evidence that orthographic irregularities, such as the "complex grapheme-phoneme relations" found in English, present significant difficulties in the reading development of children.&lt;ref name="Aro" /&gt;

However, there is little evidence that a more "regular" orthographic system would significantly diminish the amount of dyslexia cases. Because there is also a visual aspect to dyslexia, affected children often show symptoms such as mirror letter reversal (e.g. confusing "b" and "d"), which can manifest in any language regardless of orthographic depth.

===Dyslexia in logographic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Logogram}}
Logographic writing systems (such as [[Chinese character]]s and [[Cuneiform]]) are significantly different from alphabetic ones. The primary difference is that their basic [[grapheme]]s are [[logogram]]s, a representation based on meaning ([[morpheme]]s), rather than sounds ([[phoneme]]s). Chinese and Japanese Kanji, two languages with logographic orthographies, use sets of one or more characters to represent morphemes. In kanji, there are usually two ways to read a symbol, one that is similar to the original Chinese and one that is for the Japanese word. There are also a greater number of characters for logographic systems like kanji than for alphabetic and syllabic systems (generally): "The Japanese educational system explicitly teaches a set of 1,945 Joyo Kanji (kanji for daily use). However...most Japanese know many more than these and that 3,000 or more kanji are required to read a daily newspaper."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:XiaozhuanQinquan sized.jpg|thumb|190x190px|Archaic Chinese logograms]]

Development of reading and writing skills in logographic systems depends more heavily on visual memorization than for alphabetic systems.  Thus dyslexics, who often rely on grapheme memorization to cope with phonological awareness deficits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neural Systems in Dyslexics More Tuned to Memory than to Sound|url=http://dyslexia.yale.edu/PRNT_Research.html|work=The Yale Center for Dyslexia &amp; Creativity|publisher=Yale School of Medicine|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaywitz|first2= B.

====Chinese orthographies====
Chinese children can exhibit a more severe form of dyslexia as opposed to those learning literacy using an alphabetic script such as that used in writing English. Not only are they phonologically at a disadvantage, but their visuospatial processing is impaired. When children have a visuospatial disorder, their visual system when looking at Chinese characters will not activate the semantic information to understand what they are reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siok|last2=Spinks|first2=John A.|last3=Jin|first3=Zhen|last4=Tan|first4=Li Hai|date=13 October 2009|title=Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the co-existence of visuospatial and phonological disorders in Chinese children|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982209015498|journal=Current Biology|volume=19|issue=19|pages=R890|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.08.014|issn=0960-9822|pmid=19825347|access-date=|via=|accessdate=30 July 2013|first1=Wai Ting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In alphabetic languages, phonological awareness plays a central role in reading acquisition; in learning to read Chinese, phonological awareness is much less important. Rather, reading in Chinese is strongly related to a child's writing skills, which depend on orthographic awareness and on motor memory.  In handling alphabetic languages with [[deep orthography|deep orthographies]], the child must cope with having more than one spelling to represent a sound.  In spoken Chinese, a single syllable is used in many different words, and a Chinese child must cope with having many written characters that represent the same syllable.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Further complicating the Chinese writing system, the Chinese character is made up of strokes and sub-character components, substantially increasing visual complexity. Thus orthographic processing is an important aspect of reading. Deficient orthography-to-meaning mapping can lead to reading disability. A key strategy in teaching children to read is to have children repeatedly write samples of single characters, thus building the child's awareness of a character's internal structure (orthographic awareness).&lt;ref name="pmid15939871" /&gt;

Rapid naming is one of the best single predictors of dyslexia in all languages tested, including both alphabetic and character-based writing systems.&lt;ref name="pmid15939871" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolf2"&gt;Wolf, Maryanne (2007). Proust and the squid. Harper Collins. p. 178. {{ISBN|978-0-06-018639-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some evidence that the means of deciphering characters differs between logographic and alphabetic writing systems differ{{clarify|date=March 2016}} in the brain: logographic systems echo map-reading skills.

===Dyslexia in syllabic orthographies===
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
{{See also|Syllabary}}

In a syllabary,  written characters represent spoken syllables, whereas alphabetic systems use characters/letters to represent separate phonemes.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Nick |last2=Natsume |first2=Miwa |last3=Stavropoulou |first3=Katerina |last4=Hoxhallari |first4=Lorenc |last5=Van Daal |first5=Victor|last6=Polyzoe |first6=Nicoletta |last7=Tsipa |first7=Maria-Louisa |last8= Petalas |first8=Michalis |title=The effects of orthographic depth on learning to read alphabetic, syllabic, and logographic scripts|journal=Reading Research Quarterly|year=2004|volume=39|issue=4|pages=438–68 |doi=10.1598/RRQ.39.4.5 |jstor=4151742}}&lt;/ref&gt; A symbol in a syllabary typically has the canonical shape of a consonant-vowel (CV) combination. In the Japanese syllabaries, [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]], there is a nearly one-to-one correspondence between [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] and characters. The transparency of these syllabaries is the reason for their use in first teaching Japanese children to read before advancing to the complex logographic system of kanji, and by the age of five, prior to any official reading education, 89% of Japanese children can read the majority (60 or more out of 71) of hiragana characters.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Syllabary orthographies, like English orthography, can also be very irregular. {{clarify|reason=In which language?|date=May 2015|text=A symbol could mean "i" in one sentence but the same symbol could mean "e" in a different sentence if it is preceded by a different symbol,}}&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, M. (2009). The Psychology of Dyslexia a Handbook for Teachers with Case Studies. (2nd ed.). Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons. p. 141. {{ISBN|978-0-470-74096-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which can increase the difficulty of reading for people with dyslexia. However, little research has been done on how dyslexia presents in syllabic systems. One possible reason for this is that because of the different ways that dyslexia can present, {{clarify|date=May 2015|text=(i.e. how visuospatial systems are affected in Chinese dyslexics - or how the logographic system is affected by defects/abnormalities in the visuospatial processing regions, which is more likely since written language is a cultural artifact with no genetic predispositions, and so existing structures must be adapted to handle language)}} the disorder may go unnoticed or not be recognized. On the other hand, a Japanese psychologist {{who|date=May 2015}}  wrote that "while dyslexia, reading disability, reading disorder, reading retardation, or whatever you prefer to call it, comprises a formidable portion of psychiatric practice in Western countries, its incidence in Japan is so rare that specialists in Japan do not get any referrals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Harold W. |last1=Stevenson |first2=James W. |last2=Stigler |first3=G.

A literacy study on children without reading disabilities found that syllabic scripts like Japanese katakana and hiragana, which are very transparent orthographically, are learned more quickly and with better proficiency than more orthographically opaque languages, followed in ease of use and learning by shallow alphabetic scripts that also have many phonological cues, then by complex alphabetic scripts that have irregular orthography (like English), and then by logographic scripts like [[kanji]] which have no phonological cues.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World''''' ({{ISBN|978-0201483406}}) is a 1994 book by [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]]. (The book was also published as ''Out of control: the rise of neo-biological civilization''.)  Major themes in ''Out of Control'' are [[cybernetics]], [[emergence]], [[self-organization]], [[complex systems]], [[negentropy]] and [[chaos theory]] and it can be seen as a work of [[techno-utopianism]].

==Summary==
The central theme of the book is that several fields of contemporary science and philosophy point in the same direction: intelligence is not organized in a centralized structure but much more like a bee-hive of small simple components. Kelly applies this view to bureaucratic organizations, intelligent computers as well as to the human brain.

==Reception==
''Out of Control'' has been translated into five languages, including Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese and Chinese. Additionally, the United Kingdom editions have been adapted into British English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | people = Kevin Kelly( author) | title = "Kevin Kelly -- Out of Control."  | medium = Webpage  | publisher =   | location =   |date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book was not widely reviewed when first released in 1994, but got visibly reviewed and extensively cited during the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| last = Turner| first = Fred
| title = From counterculture to cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the rise of digital utopianism
| location = Chicago| date = 2006| page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews often discussed Kelly’s hive-mind analogy as a [[metaphor]] for the [[New Economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| last = Turner| first = Fred | title = From counterculture to cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the rise of digital utopianism
| location = Chicago| date = 2006| page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have called this book  a "mind-expanding exploration" (''Publishers Weekly'') and "the best of an important new genre" (''Forbes ASAP'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | people = Amazon webpage| title = "Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, &amp; the Economic World [Paperback]."| medium = Webpage  | publisher = Amazon.com, Inc.| location =   |date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the book have contended that its position leaves us without a critical approach to politics and social power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Palomar Observatory''' is an astronomical [[observatory]] located in [[San Diego County, California]], United States, {{convert|145|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of [[Los Angeles]], California, in the [[Palomar Mountain Range]].  It is owned and operated by the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) located in [[Pasadena, California]]. Research time is granted to Caltech and its research partners, which include the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornell University, [http://www.astro.cornell.edu Dept. of Astronomy]: [http://www.astro.cornell.edu/facilities/palomar.php  Palomar Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The observatory operates several telescopes, including the 200-inch ({{convert|200|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Hale Telescope]] and the 48-inch ({{convert|48|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Samuel Oschin Telescope]].  In addition, other instruments and projects have been hosted at the observatory, such as the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] and the historic 18-inch ({{convert|18|in|m|disp=output only}}) [[Schmidt telescope]], Palomar Observatory's first telescope, dating from 1936.

==History==

===Hale's vision for large telescopes and Palomar Observatory===

Astronomer [[George Ellery Hale]], whose vision created the Palomar Observatory, built the world's largest telescope four times. He published an article that was to become the 200-inch Palomar reflector; it was an invitation to the American public to learn about how large telescopes could help answer questions relating to the fundamental nature of the universe. Hale hoped that the American people would understand and support his project even though the country was in the depths of the Great Depression.

Hale followed this article with a letter to the International Education Board (later absorbed into the [[General Education Board]]) of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] dated April 16, 1928 in which he requested funding for this project. In his letter, Hale stated:

"No method of advancing science is so productive as the development of new and more powerful instruments and methods of research. A larger telescope would not only furnish the necessary gain in light space-penetration and photographic resolving power, but permit the application of ideas and devices derived chiefly from the recent fundamental advances in physics and chemistry."

===Hale Telescope===
{{Main|Hale telescope}}

The 200-inch telescope is named after astronomer and project manager [[George Hale]]. It was built by Caltech with a $6&amp;nbsp;million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, using a [[Pyrex]] blank manufactured by [[Corning Glass Works]] under the direction of George McCauley after several years of unsuccessful attempts by [[General Electric]] under Dr. A.L. Ellis. The first steps toward funding the construction of the 200 inch telescope were taken by Hale in 1928 and included a 23-ton glass block cast by [[José Antonio de Artigas Sanz]]. [[John August Anderson|Dr. J.A. Anderson]] was the initial project manager assigned in  the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TtcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 Super Camera of the Skies."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1942, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The telescope (the largest in the world at that time) saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] January 26, 1949 targeting [[NGC 2261]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://365daysofastronomy.org/2009/01/26/january-26-60th-anniversary-of-hale-telescope-first-light/  "60th Anniversary of Hale Telescope,"] ''[[365 Days of Astronomy]]'' (podcast). January 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The American astronomer [[Edwin Powell Hubble]] was the first astronomer to use the telescope.

The 200-inch telescope was the largest telescope in the world from 1949 until 1975, when the Russian [[BTA-6]] telescope saw [[first light (astronomy)|first light]]. Astronomers using the Hale Telescope have discovered distant objects at the edges of the known universe called [[quasar]]s and have given us the first direct evidence of stars in distant galaxies. They have studied the structure and chemistry of intergalactic clouds, leading to an understanding of the synthesis of elements in the universe, and have discovered thousands of [[asteroid]]s. A one-tenth-scale engineering model of the telescope at Corning Community College in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]], home of the Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated) was used to discover at least one minor planet, [[34419 Corning]].{{JPL|34419|†}}

===Architecture and design===
[[File:Palomar Observatory Dome - High Resolution.jpg|thumb|Hale Telescope Dome]]

According to the Observatory's Public Affairs Office, [[Russell W. Porter]] was primarily responsible for the [[Art Deco]] architecture of the Observatory's buildings, including the dome of the 200–inch Hale Telescope. Porter was also responsible for much of the technical design of the Hale Telescope and Schmidt Cameras, producing a series of cross-section engineering drawings. Porter worked on the designs in collaboration with many engineers and Caltech committee members.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

[[Max Mason]] directed the construction and [[Theodore von Karman]] was involved in the engineering.

===Palomar Observatory and light pollution===

Much of the surrounding region of Southern California has adopted shielded lighting to reduce the [[light pollution]] that would potentially affect the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=55060&amp;orgId=idsa International Dark-Sky Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101110647/http://www.darksky.org/mc/page.do?sitePageId=55060&amp;orgId=idsa |date=2008-01-01 }} (IDA): [http://data.nextrionet.com/site/idsa/is020.pdf  "Sky Glow Effect on Existing Large Telescopes"], IDA Info #20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Telescopes and instruments==
[[Image:P48 1994 Jean Large.jpg|thumb|right|Astronomer [[Jean Mueller]] posing with the [[Samuel Oschin telescope|Samuel Oschin Telescope (Schmidt Camera)]] ]]

* The 200-inch [[Hale Telescope]] was first proposed in 1928 and has been operational since 1948. It was the [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|largest telescope in the world]] for 45 years.&lt;ref name=HALE&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 200-inch Hale Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 60-inch reflecting telescope is located in the Oscar Mayer Building. It was dedicated in 1970 to take some of the load off of the Hale Telescope. This telescope was used to discover the first [[brown dwarf]] star.&lt;ref name=60IN&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 60-inch Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/60-inch.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 48-inch [[Samuel Oschin telescope|Samuel Oschin Telescope (Schmidt Camera)]] was started in 1938 and installed in 1948. It was initially called the 48–inch Schmidt, and was dedicated to [[Samuel Oschin]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=SOT&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Samuel Oschin Telescope |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] was discovered using this instrument.&lt;ref name=SOTD&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Discoveries from Palomar Observatory’s 48-inch Samuel Oschin Telescope  |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/oschin.html#science |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence of Eris triggered the discussions in the international astronomy community that led to [[Pluto]] being re-classified as a [[dwarf planet]].

===Former instruments===

* An 18-inch [[Schmidt camera]] became the first operational telescope at the Palomar in 1936.  In the 1930s, [[Fritz Zwicky]], a Caltech astronomer, discovered over 100 [[supernovae]] in other galaxies with this telescope and gathered the first evidence for dark matter.  [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] was discovered with this instrument in 1993.  It has since been retired and is on display at the small museum/visitor center.&lt;ref name=18IN&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - The 18-inch Schmidt Telescope  |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/decommissioned.html#p18 |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] was a multi-telescope instrument that permitted astronomers to make very high resolution measurements of the sizes and positions of objects in space. The shapes of some bright stars have been measured with the PTI.  It operated from 1995 to 2008.&lt;ref name=PTI&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Palomar Testbed Interferometer (PTI) |url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/decommissioned.html#pti |publisher=Caltech Astronomy |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Palomar Planet Search Telescope (PPST), aka ''Sleuth,'' was a {{Convert|0.1|m|in|abbr=on}} robotic telescope that operated from 2003 until 2008.  It was dedicated to the search for planets around other stars using the [[Astronomical transit|transit]] method.  It operated in conjunction with telescopes at [[Lowell Observatory]] and in the [[Canary Islands]] as part of the Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES).&lt;ref name=PPST&gt;{{cite web |title=Caltech Astronomy - Sleuth: The Palomar Planet Finder |url=http://palomarskies.blogspot.de/2009/10/goodbye-to-sleuth.html |publisher=Palomar Skies |accessdate=2014-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

The observatory has completed several [[astronomical survey]]s: the first in the 1950s, the second in the 1980s and 1990s, and a third in 2003.

===POSS-I===
The initial [[National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey|Palomar Observatory Sky Survey]] (POSS or POSS-I), sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] institute, was completed in 1958. The first plates were shot in November 1948 and the last in April 1958. This survey was performed using 14&amp;nbsp;inch&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (6 [[degree (angle)|degree]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or blue-sensitive (Kodak 103a-O) and red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt [[Reflecting telescope|reflecting]] telescope. The survey covered the sky from a [[declination]] of +90 degrees ([[Celestial pole|celestial north pole]]) to -27 degrees and all [[right ascension]]s and had a sensitivity to +22 [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]s (about 1 million times fainter than the limit of human vision). A southern extension extending the sky coverage of the POSS to -33 degrees [[declination]] was shot in 1957 - 1958. The final POSS I consisted of 937 plate pairs.

Fritz Zwicky was the first astronomer to observe on Mt. Palomar and was the father of the Sky Survey Technique.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech did recognize Fritz Zwicky's sky survey pioneering work; however, The Big Picture project failed to recognize his contribution to the sky survey technique in the introductory panel at the Griffith Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS) produced images which were based on the photographic data developed in the course of POSS-I.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Automated Plate Scanner (MAPS): [http://aps.umn.edu/ MAPS catalogue;] Mollise, Rod. (2006). {{Google books|Z0mvZk0s_TMC|''The Urban Astronomer's Guide: a Walking tour of the Cosmos for City Sky Watchers,'' p. 238.|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J.B. Whiteoak, an Australian radio astronomer, used the same instrument to broaden this POSS-I data further.  Whiteoaks observations extended south to about -45 degrees [[declination]], using the same field centers as the corresponding northern declination zones. Unlike POSS-I, the [[Whiteoak extension]] consisted only of red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates.

===POSS-II===
{{Redirect|Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey|POSS I|Palomar Sky Survey}}

The '''Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey''' ('''POSS II''', sometimes '''Second Palomar Sky Survey''') was performed in the 1980s and 1990s that made use of better, faster films and an upgraded telescope. The Oschin Schmidt was given an achromatic corrector and provisions for autoguiding. Images were recorded in three wavelengths: blue (IIIaJ), red (IIIaF) and near infrared (IVN) plates, respectively. Observers on POSS II included C. Brewer, D. Griffiths, W. McKinley, [[J. Dave Mendenhall]], K. Rykoski, [[Jeffrey L. Phinney]] and [[Jean Mueller]] (who discovered over 100 supernovae by comparing the POSS I and POSS II plates). Mueller also discovered several comets and minor planets during the course of POSS II and the bright Comet Wilson 1986 was discovered by then graduate student C. Wilson early in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516193335/http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html |date=2009-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the completion of the Two Micron All Sky Survey ([[2MASS]]), POSS II was the most extensive wide-field sky survey ever. When completed, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] will surpass ''POSS I'' and ''POSS II'' in depth, although the POSS covers almost 2.5 times more area on the sky.

POSS II also exists in digitized form (i.e., the photographic plates were scanned), both in photographic form as the [[Digitized Sky Survey]] (DSS)&lt;ref&gt;NASA/Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI).: [http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/  &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;ultimission &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;rchive at &lt;u&gt;ST&lt;/u&gt;ScI (MAST)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=this appears to be an incomplete sentence|date=March 2012}}

===QUEST===
The multi-year POSS projects were followed by the Palomar [[Quasar Equatorial Survey Team]] (QUEST) Variability survey.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech press release: [http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12417.html "New Sky Survey Begins at Palomar Observatory."] July 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This survey yielded results that were used by several projects, including the [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] project. Another program that used the QUEST results discovered [[90377 Sedna]] on 14 November 2003, and around 40 [[Kuiper belt]] objects. Other programs that share the camera are [[Shri Kulkarni]]'s search for [[Gamma ray burster|gamma-ray bursts]] (this takes advantage of the automated telescope's ability to react as soon as a burst is seen and take a series of snapshots of the fading burst), [[Richard Ellis (astronomer)|Richard Ellis]]' search for [[supernova]]e to test whether the [[universe's expansion]] is accelerating or not, and [[S. George Djorgovski]]'s [[quasar]] search.

The camera for the Palomar QUEST Survey was a mosaic of 112 [[Charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) covering the whole (4 degree by 4 degree) field of view of the Schmidt telescope, the largest CCD mosaic used in an astronomical camera when built. This instrument was used to produce The Big Picture, the largest astronomical photograph ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://bigpicture.caltech.edu/ "The Big Picture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204102050/http://bigpicture.caltech.edu/ |date=2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Big Picture is on display at [[Griffith Observatory]].

===Current research===
Current research programs on the 200-inch Hale Telescope cover the range of the observable universe including studies on near-Earth asteroids, outer solar system planets, Kuiper Belt Objects, star formation, exoplanets,&lt;ref&gt;JPL: [http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2009-090 "Planet-Hunting Method Succeeds at Last."] May 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; gamma-ray bursts, black holes, quasars and much more.&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.palomar.caltech.edu:8000/instruments/p200_calendar.tcl Hale Telescope Observing Runs] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121212205940/http://www.palomar.caltech.edu:8000/instruments/p200_calendar.tcl |date=2012-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt Telescope is actively working on a new sky survey, the [[Palomar Transient Factory]] (PTF).&lt;ref&gt;Caltech: [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ptf/ Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 60-inch telescope is used for a variety of projects including follow-up observations for the Palomar Transient Factory and is a rapid response telescope for [[gamma-ray bursts]].

===Clearest images===
In September 2007, a team of [[astronomer]]s from the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] released some of the clearest pictures ever taken of [[outer space]].  The pictures were obtained through the use of a new hybrid "[[Lucky imaging]]" and "[[adaptive optics]]" system that sharpens pictures taken from the Palomar Observatory.  The resolution attained exceeds that of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] by a factor of two.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Pallab. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6975961.stm "'Clearest' images taken of space,"] BBC.

==Visiting==

The Palomar Observatory is an active research facility. However, parts of it are open to the public during the day. Visitors can take self-guided tours of the 200-inch telescope daily from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The observatory is open 7 days a week, year round, except for December 24 and 25 and during times of inclement weather. Guided tours of the 200-inch Hale Telescope dome and observing area are available Saturdays and Sundays from April through October.  Details are available at the [http://palomar-observatory.org Observatory's web site].   There is a visitor's center and a gift shop on the grounds. Behind-the-scenes tours for the public are offered through the community support group, [http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/community/friends.html Friends of Palomar Observatory].  Periodic tours are also organized by the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]] in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;Reuben H. Fleet Science Center: [http://www.rhfleet.org/site/astronomy/palomar.html Palomar Observatory tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030411112150/http://rhfleet.org/site/astronomy/palomar.html |date=2003-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The observatory is located off [[California State Route 76|State Route 76]] in northern [[San Diego County, California]], is two hours' drive from downtown [[San Diego]], and three hours' drive from central [[Los Angeles]] ( [[UCLA]], [[LAX]] airport ).  Those staying at nearby Palomar Campground can visit Palomar Observatory by hiking {{convert|2.2|mi|km}} up Observatory Trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Observatory Trail in Cleveland National Forest | url=https://www.hikespeak.com/trails/observatory-trail-palomar-mountain/ | website=hikespeak.com | publisher=Hikespeak | accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

In the October 11 and 12, 1989, [[Calvin and Hobbes]] comic strips, Calvin has a dream where Stupendous Man takes the lens from the Palomar Observatory telescope (though really the telescope has a mirror and not a lens) and uses it to destroy his school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myingling.com/random/calvin_and_hobbes/search.php?phrase=stupendous+man]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian band [[The Rheostatics]]' 1992 release ''[[Whale Music (album)|Whale Music]]'' features a track entitled "Palomar." The song depicts a man named Palomar on the top of a mount, cleaning his lenses with saline waters, and assembling his kaleidoscope in his lonely observatory.  The song presents a visual characterization of a man on a mountain and his relationship with his best friend, a dog.

In 1994, Palomar is mentioned in the first episode of season 2 of ''[[The X-Files]]'', "[[Little Green Men (The X-Files)|Little Green Men]]". [[Fox Mulder]] refers to Hale's suggestion that an [[elf]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Hale.html Biography of George Ellery Hale] at scienceworld.wolfram.com&lt;/ref&gt; crawled through his window and told him to build the observatory.

The band [[Wellwater Conspiracy]]'s 1997 debut album, ''[[Declaration of Conformity]]'', contains an instrumental track entitled "Palomar Observatory."  Wellwater Conspiracy singer/drummer [[Matt Cameron]] grew up in [[San Diego]] near the observatory.

The '''Paul Ricard Oceanographic Institute''' is an [[Oceanography|oceanographic institute]] situated on the [[Île des Embiez]]. The island is in the [[Var (department)|Var]] [[Departments of France|department]] in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] region in South Western France. Founded by [[Paul Ricard]] and Alain Bombard, the institute receives 25,000 visitors annually, and produces films and exhibitions to highlight marine life and issues.&lt;ref name="RicardAware"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricard - Awareness-raising|url=http://www.ricard.fr/en/corporate-sponsorship-and-citizenship/paul-ricard-oceanographic-institute/awareness-raising.html|publisher=Ricard|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an early case of [[industrial pollution]] in the [[Mediterranean sea]], "[[red mud]]" was discharged at sea off the coast of the town of [[Cassis]] in Southern France.&lt;ref name="RicardFAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricard - Corporate sponsorship and citizenship FAQ|url=http://www.ricard.fr/en/home/faq/corporate-sponsorship-and-citizenship.html#irfaq_5_3c68f|publisher=Ricard|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrialist [[Paul Ricard]] campaigned against the pollution, and in 1966 founded the '''Observatoire de la Mer''', which later became the Paul Ricard Oceanographic Institute.&lt;ref name="RicardFAQ"/&gt;

The public aquarium at the institute was opened in 1973, it was the third aquarium on France’s Mediterranean coast.&lt;ref name="RicardBriefHist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricard - A brief history of the institute|url=http://www.ricard.fr/en/corporate-sponsorship-and-citizenship/paul-ricard-oceanographic-institute/a-brief-history-of-the-institute.html|publisher=Ricard|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research team was also created at the institute in 1973. An Urban Waste Treatment Plan for the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] coastline was inspired by a film made by the institute in 1980, ''Pollutions et nuisances sur le littoral méditerranéen''.&lt;ref name="RicardBriefHist"/&gt; The institute helped develop a product to treat [[oil slicks]] in 1981, this was used on beaches in Alaska in 1989, and in 1995 the institute was awarded the Grand prix de l’Académie des Sciences for its work.&lt;ref name="RicardBriefHist"/&gt;

The institute is currently studying the [[fin whale]] with the French branch of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], and researching the quality of coastal waters, with the monitoring of underwater ecosystems within the [[Natura 2000]] scheme.&lt;ref name="EmbiezInst"&gt;{{cite web|title=Embiez - Oceanographic Institute|url=http://www.les-embiez.com/uk/index.php#institut-oceanographique.php|publisher=Embiez Island|accessdate=27 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523165317/http://www.les-embiez.com/uk/index.php#institut-oceanographique.php|archivedate=23 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the institute also studies the reproduction of the [[sea horse]], the [[sea urchin]], the [[Pinnidae|Mediterranean pen shell]], and has studied the impact of [[desalination]] of sea water.&lt;ref name="EmbiezInst"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8959">The '''pragmatic theory of information''' is derived from [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s general theory of [[semeiotic|signs]] and [[inquiry]].  Peirce explored a number of ideas about information throughout his career.  One set of ideas is about the "laws of information" having to do with the ''[[logic of information|logical properties of information]]''.  Another set of ideas about "time and thought" have to do with the ''[[dynamics of inquiry|dynamic properties of inquiry]]''.  All of these ideas contribute to the pragmatic theory of inquiry. Peirce set forth many of these ideas very early in his career, periodically returning to them on scattered occasions until the end, and they appear to be implicit in much of his later work on the logic of science and the theory of signs, but he never developed their implications to the fullest extent. The 20th century thinker [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker|Ernst Ulrich]] and his wife Christine von Weizsäcker reviewed the pragmatics of information;&lt;ref name=weiszacker1972 &gt;{{cite book|last1=Weizsäcker, von|first1=Ernst Ulrich|last2=Weizsäcker, von|first2=Christine|title=Wiederaufnahme der begrifflichen Frage. Was ist Information|pages=25–555|year=}}&lt;/ref&gt; their work is reviewed by Gennert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gennert|first1=Dieter|title=Pragmatic Information: Historical Exposition and General Overview|journal=Mind &amp; Matter|volume=4|issue=2|pages=141–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The pragmatic information content is the information content received by a recipient; it is focused on the recipient and defined in contrast to [[Claude Shannon]]'s information definition, which focuses on the message. The pragmatic information measures the information received, not the information contained in the message. Pragmatic information theory requires not only a model of the sender and how it encodes information, but also a model of the receiver and how it acts on the information received. The determination of pragmatic information content is a precondition for the determination of the [[value of information]].

Claude Shannon and [[Warren Weaver]] completed the viewpoint on information encoding in  the seminal paper by Shannon ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]'',&lt;ref name=Shannon1948&gt;Claude E. Shannon: ''A Mathematical Theory of Communication'', Bell System Technical Journal, Vol. 27, pp.&amp;nbsp;379–423, 623–656, 1948. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6773024&amp;tag=1]&lt;/ref&gt;  with two additional viewpoints (B and C):&lt;ref&gt;Claude E. Shannon and Warren Weaver: ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication.'' The University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Illinois, 1949. {{ISBN|0-252-72548-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A. How accurately can the symbols that encode the message be transmitted ("the technical problem")?
* B. How precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning("the semantics problem")?
* C. How effective is the received message in changing conduct ("the effectiveness problem")? &lt;ref name=Weinberger2002&gt;Edward D. Weinberger: "A Theory of Pragmatic Information and Its Application to the Quasispecies Model of Biological Evolution", ''BioSystems'' 66 (3), 105–119, 2002.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/nlin.AO/0105030 Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatics of communication is the observable effect a communication act (here receiving a message) has on the actions of the recipient. The pragmatic information content of a message may be different for different recipients or the same message may have the same content. Weizsäcker used the concept of ''novelty'' and ''irrelevance'' to separate information which is pragmatically useful or not.&lt;ref name=weiszacker1972 /&gt; Algebraically, the pragmatic information content must satisfy three rules:
* EQ: Two messages are equivalent when  they lead to the same actions.
* SAME: Equivalent messages of different size can have the same pragmatic information content.
* DIFF: The same message has different pragmatic information content when used in different decision contexts.&lt;ref name=Frank2003&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pragmatic Information Content—How to Measure the Information in a Route Description|last=Frank|first=Andrew|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2003|isbn=0-415-30726-0|editors=M. Duckham, M. Goodchild, M. Worboys|volume=FOUNDATIONS OF  GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE|location=London|pages=47–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Edward D. Weinberger|Weinberger]]  formulated a quantitative theory of pragmatic information.  In contrast to standard information theory that says nothing about the semantic content of information, Weinberger's theory attempts to measure the amount of information actually used in making a decision.  Included in [[Edward D. Weinberger|Weinberger]]'s paper is a demonstration that his version of pragmatic information increases over the course of time in a simple model of evolution known as the ''[[quasispecies model]]''.  This is demonstrably ''not'' true for the standard measure of information.&lt;ref name="Weinberger2002" /&gt;

The acquisition of the information and the use of it in decision making can be separated. The use of acquired information to make a decision is, in the general case, an optimization in an uncertain situation (which is included in Weinberger's theory). For deterministc rule based decisions, the agent can be formalized as an [[algebra]] with a set of operations and the state changes when these operations are executed (no optimization applied). The pragmatic information such an agent picks up from a messages is the transformation of the tokens in the message into operations the recipient is capable of.

== Measuring the pragmatic information content with an agent-model of the receiver ==
[[Andrew U. Frank|Frank]] used [[agent-based models]] and the theory of autonomous agents with cognitive abilities (see [[multi-agent system]]) to operationalize measuring pragmatic information content. The transformation between the received message and the executed message is defined by the agents rules; the pragmatic information content is the information in the transformed message, measured by the methods given by Shannon. The general case can be split in (deterministic) actions to change the information the agent already has and the optimal decision using this information. To measure the pragmatic information content is relevant to assess the [[value of information]] received by an agent and influences the agents willingness to pay for information - not measured by Shannon communication information content, but by the received pragmatic information content.

The rules for the transformation of a received message to the pragmatic content drop information already available;

(1) information already known is ignored and

(2) elaborated messages can be reduced to the agents action, reducing the information content when the receiver understands and can execute actions more powerful than the encoding calls for.

The transformation achieves the three rules mentioned above (EQ, SAME, DIFF).&lt;ref name="Frank2003" /&gt;

The action of the agent can be taken as just 'updating its knowledge store" and the actual decision by the agent, optimizing the result, is modeled separately, as, for example, done in Weinberg's approach.

== Example: car navigation ==
A familiar application my clarify the approach:Different car navigation systems produce different instructions but if they manage to guide you to the same location, their pragmatic information content must be the same (despite different information content when measured with Shannon's measure (SAME). A novice in the area may need all instructions received - the pragmatic information content and the (minimally encoded) information content of the message is the same. An experienced driver will ignore all "follow the road" and "go straight" instructions, thus the pragmatic information content is lower; for an  driver with knowledge of the area, large parts of the instructions may be subsumed by simple instructions "drive to X"; typically, only the last part ("the last mile")  of the instructions are meaningful - the pragmatic information content is smaller, because much knowledge is already available (DIFF). Messages with more or less verbiage have for this user the same pragmatic content (SAME).&lt;ref name=Frank2003 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6138">The '''psychology of science''' is a branch of the studies of science that includes [[philosophy of science]], [[history of science]], and sociology of science or [[sociology of scientific knowledge]]. The psychology of science is defined most simply as the scientific study of scientific thought or behavior. The field first gained popularity in the 1960s, with [[Abraham Maslow]] publishing an influential text on the subject in 1966, but this popularity faded, only re-emerging in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=cUm4piWluecC|title=Scientific Genius: A Psychology of Science|last=Simonton|first=Dean Keith|date=1988-06-24|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=|isbn=9780521352871|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some key figures currently in the psychology of science are [[William Brewer (psychologist)|William Brewer]], Kevin Dunbar, Gregory Feist, [[Michael Gorman (academic)|Michael Gorman]], [[David Klahr]], Barbara Kosloswki, [[Deanna Kuhn]], Sofia Liberman, Dean Keith Simonton, Will Shadish, [[Frank Sulloway]], [[Paul Thagard]], Ryan Tweney, [[Ron Westrum]], and Wendy Parker.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The psychology of science applies methods and theory from psychology to the analysis of scientific thought and behavior, each of which is defined both narrowly and broadly. Narrowly defined, "science" refers to thought and behavior of professional scientists and technologists. More broadly defined, "science" refers to thought and behavior of any one (present or past) of any age engaged in theory construction, learning scientific or mathematical concepts, model building, hypothesis testing, scientific reasoning, problem finding or solving, or creating or working on technology. Indeed, mathematical, engineering, and invention activities are included in both the broader and narrower definitions as well. The methods of psychology that are applied to the study of scientific thought and behavior include psychohistorical, psychobiographical, observational, descriptive, correlational, and experimental techniques.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The psychology of science has well-established literature in most every subfield of [[psychology]], including but not limited to neuroscientific, developmental, cognitive, personality, motivational, social, industrial/organizational, and clinical. Feist's 2006 book ''The Psychology of Science and the Origins of the Scientific Mind''&lt;ref&gt;Feist, G.J. (2006). ''The Psychology of Science and the Origins of the Scientific Mind''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; reviews and integrates much of this literature. 

How scientific concepts are learned is a major topic for the psychology of [[science education]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

{{italic title}}
'''''Psychopathia Sexualis''''' (''Psychopathy of Sex''), by [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]], is one of the first texts about sexual pathology. First published in 1886 in [[German language|German]] with the subtitle "with Special Reference to the Antipathic Sexual Instinct: A Medico-Forensic Study", the book details a wide range of [[paraphilia]]s, with a special emphasis on male homosexuality (the "antipathic instinct" of the subtitle). Krafft-Ebing also coined the terms [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism and masochism]] in the book.

The ''Psychopathia Sexualis'' is notable for being one of the earliest works on [[homosexuality]]. Krafft-Ebing combined Karl Ulrichs' [[Urning]] theory with [[Bénédict Morel]]'s theory of disease and concluded that most homosexuals have a [[mental illness]] caused by degenerate heredity. The book was controversial at the time, arousing the anger of the church in particular.

The book had a considerable influence on continental European forensic psychiatry in the first part of the 20th century. It is regarded as the bible of psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Returned To Unit''' or '''RTU''' refers to a military member being returned to their home base or home unit, either due to their being medically unfit, their requesting to be withdrawn from training, or their being unfit for training or otherwise disorderly. As military members can only be [[court-martial]]ed at their home base or unit, being RTU'd for [[misconduct]] can often be a precursor to further judicial punishment.

RTU'ing is a concept used during a period of specialist training, whereby a service person has been extracted or detached from their home unit. For example, if a service person has been extracted to complete an instruction course run by a specialist unit within the armed forces such as a [[Physical Training Instructor|PTI]] or [[Shooting range|Range]] Control course. In the event of the service person wishing to withdraw from the course (e.g. for personal or medical reasons); or if the course [[supervisor]]s deem that the service person is unfit to complete the course, for either medical or disciplinary reasons, the service person may be returned to their home unit. If a candidate is RTU'd, the supervisor responsible for sending them home will supply a written report to the service person's [[Officer Commanding|OC]] detailing the reason why they have been RTU'd. If a service person is RTU'd on disciplinary grounds, their OC will decide if any further disciplinary action is needed, based on the RTU report from the course supervisor, and if necessary, by consultation with the course supervisors. The reason this is done is that, according to military law, disciplinary action such as a [[court-martial]] can only by issued against a service person by their home unit.

There are several reasons why a military member may be RTU'd. It can be for major or minor infractions of the rules, or disorderly behaviour. It may also be on compassionate grounds, such as RTU'ing an injured soldier (or other medical conditions).

The term ''Returned To Unit'' (''RTU'') is used in the [[Canadian Forces]] and the [[UK]].

'''Social simulation''' is a research field that applies [[computer|computational]] methods to study issues in the [[social sciences]].

Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.

In social simulation, computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as [[complex system|complex non-linear systems]], which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models. [[Robert Axelrod]] regards social simulation as a third way of doing science, differing from both the deductive and inductive approach; generating data that can be analysed inductively, but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world. Thus, simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating it—constructing artificial societies. These ambitious aims have encountered [[#Criticisms|several criticisms]].

The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by three regional associations, [[European Social Simulation Association|ESSA]] for Europe, North America (reorganizing under the new CSSS name), and PAAA [https://archive.is/20130413115754/http://www.paaa.econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ Pacific Asia].

==History and development==

The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Self-replicating machine|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself. The device [[von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then improved by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up&amp;mdash;creating the first of devices later termed [[cellular automata]].

Another improvement was brought by mathematician, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike the von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

The birth of the agent-based model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as the [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] developed the first large scale agent model, the [[Sugarscape]], to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, transmission of disease, and even culture.

[[Kathleen M. Carley]] published "Computational Organizational Science and Organizational Engineering" defining the movement of simulation into
organizations, established a journal for social simulation applied to organizations and complex socio-technical systems: [[Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory]], and was the founding president of the North American Association of Computational Social and Organizational Systems that morphed into the current CSSSA.

[[Nigel Gilbert]] published with [[Klaus G. Troitzsch]] the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the Social Scientist (1999) and established its most relevant journal: the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]].

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]] (see {{Harv|Sun|2006}})

==Topics==

Here are some sample topics that have been explored with social simulation:

* '''[[norm (social)|Social norms]]''': [[Robert Axelrod]] has used simulations to investigate the foundation of morality;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Axelrod (1986): [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~axe/Axelrod%20Norms%20APSR%201986%20(2).pdf An Evolutionary Approach to Norms]&lt;/ref&gt; others have modeled the emergence of norms using [[meme]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Felix Flentge, Daniel Polani and Thomas Uthmann (2001) [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/4/3.html Modelling the Emergence of Possession Norms using Memes]&lt;/ref&gt; or how social norms and emotions can regulate each other.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Staller and Paolo Petta (2001): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/1/2.html Introducing Emotions into the Computational Study of Social Norms: A First Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Neumann (2008): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/6.html Homo Socionicus: a Case Study of Simulation Models of Norms] for an overview of the recent (as of 2008) research.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Economics''': see [[computational economics]] and [[agent-based computational economics]].

==Types of simulation and modeling==
Social simulation can refer to a general class of strategies for understanding social dynamics using computers to simulate social systems. Social simulation allows for a more systematic way of viewing the possibilities of outcomes.

There are four major types of social simulation: 
#System level simulation.
#System level modeling.
#Agent-based simulation.
#Agent-based modeling.

A social simulation may fall within the rubric of [[computational sociology]] which is a recently developed branch of [[sociology]] that uses [[computation]] to analyze social phenomena. The basic premise of computational sociology is to take advantage of [[computer simulation]]s {{Harv|Polhill|Edmonds|2007}} in the construction of social theories. It involves the understanding of [[social agent]]s, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate.  Although the subject matter and methodologies in [[social science]] differ from those in [[natural science]] or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social [[simulation]] originated from fields such as [[physics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

===System level simulation===
System Level Simulation (SLS) is the oldest level of social simulation. System level simulation looks at the situation as a whole. This theoretical outlook on social situations uses a wide range of information to determine what should happen to society and its members if certain variables are present. Therefore, with specific variables presented, society and its members should have a certain response to the new situation. Navigating through this theoretical simulation will allow researchers to develop educated ideas of what will happen under some specific variables.

For example, if [[NASA]] were to conduct a system level simulation it would benefit the organization by providing a cost effective research method to navigate through the simulation. This allows the researcher to steer through the virtual possibilities of the given simulation and develop [[safety]] procedures, and to produce proven facts about how a certain situation will play out. {{Harv|National Research|2006}}

===System level modeling===

System level modeling (SLM) aims to specifically predict (unlike system level simulation's generalization in prediction) and convey any number of actions, behaviors, or other theoretical possibilities of nearly any person, object, construct et cetera within a system using a large set of mathematical equations and computer programming in the form of models.

A model is a representation of a specific thing ranging from objects and people to structures and products created through mathematical equations and are designed, using computers, in such a way that they are able to stand-in as the aforementioned things in a study. Models can be either simplistic or complex, depending on the need for either; however, models are intended to be simpler than what they are representing while remaining realistically similar in order to be used accurately. They are built using a collection of data that is translated into computing languages that allow them to represent the system in question. These models, much like simulations, are used to help us better understand specific roles and actions of different things so as to predict behavior and the like.

===Agent-based simulation===

[[Agent-based social simulation]] (ABSS) consists of modeling different societies after artificial agents, (varying on scale) and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents.  From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of non-artificial agents and simulations.  Three main fields in ABSS are agent-based computing, social science, and computer simulation.

Agent-based computing is the design of the model and agents, while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes.  The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model.  It is where the social phenomena is developed and theorized. The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agent-based simulation of social phenomena.  With ABSS we can explore different outcomes for phenomena where we might not be able to view the outcome in real life.  It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena.

===Agent-based modeling===

[[Agent-based modeling]] (ABM) is a system in which a collection of agents independently interact on networks. Each individual agent is responsible for different behaviors that result in collective behaviors. These behaviors as a whole help to define the workings of the network. ABM focuses on human social interactions and how people work together and communicate with one another without having one, single "group mind". This essentially means that it tends to focus on the consequences of interactions between people (the agents) in a population. Researchers are better able to understand this type of modeling by modeling these dynamics on a smaller, more localized level. Essentially, ABM helps to better understand interactions between people (agents) who, in turn, influence one another (in response to these influences). Simple individual rules or actions can result in coherent [[group behavior]]. Changes in these individual acts can affect the collective group in any given population.

Agent-based modeling is an experimental tool for theoretical research. It enables one to deal with more complex individual behaviors, such as adaptation. Overall, through this type of modeling, the creator, or researcher, aims to model behavior of agents and the communication between them in order to better understand how these individual interactions impact an entire population. In essence, ABM is a way of modeling and understanding different global patterns.

==Current research==

There are several current research projects that relate directly to modeling and agent-based simulation the following are listed below with a brief overview.

*"Generative e-Social Science for Socio-Spatial Simulation" or (GENESIS) is a research node of the UK National Centre for e-Social Science funded by the UK research council [http://www.esrc.ac.uk ESRC].

*"Network Models Governance and R&amp;D collaboration networks" or (N.E.M.O) is a research centre whose main focus is to identify ways to create and to assess desirable network structures for typical functions; (e.g. knowledge, creation, transfer, and distribution.) This research will ultimately aid [[policy-makers]] at all political levels in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of network-based policy instruments at promoting the knowledge economy in Europe.
*"Agent-based Simulations of Market and Consumer Behavior" is another research group that is funded by the Unilever Corporate Research. The current research that is being conducted is investigating the usefulness of agent-based simulations for modeling [[consumer behavior]] and to show the potential value and insights it can add to long-established marketing methods.
*"New and Emergent World Models Through Individual, Evolutionary and Social Learning" or (New Ties) is a three-year project that will ultimately create a virtual society developed by agent-based simulation. The project will develop a simulated society capable of exploring the environment and developing its own image of this environment and the society through interaction. The goal of the research project is for the simulated society to exhibit [[individual learning]], [[evolutionary learning]] and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]].
*Bruch and Mare's project on neighborhood [[Residential segregation|segregation]]: The purpose of the study is to figure out the reasoning for neighborhood segregation based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and to figure out the [[tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] or when people become uncomfortable with the integration levels into their neighborhood, and decide to flee from the neighborhood. They set up a model using flash cards, and put the agent's house in the middle and put houses of different races surrounding the agent's house. They asked people how comfortable they would feel with different situations; if they were okay with one situation, they asked another until the neighborhood was fully integrated. Bruch and Mare's results showed that the tipping point was at 50%. When a neighborhood became 50% minority and 50% white, people of both races began to become uncomfortable and [[white flight]] began to rise. The use of agent-based modeling showed how useful it can be in the world of sociology, people did not have to answer why they would become uncomfortable, just which situation they were uncomfortable with.
*The MAELIA Program (Multi-Agent Emergent Norms Assessment) is a project dealing with the relationships between the users and managers of a natural resource, in that case water, and the related norms and laws that are to be built within them (conventions) or are imposed to them by other actors (institutions). The purpose of the project is to build a generic multiscale platform which is planned to deal with [[water conflict]]-related issues.
*The [http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/mosi/ Mosi-Agil project] is a four-year program funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program MOSI-AGIL-CM (grant S2013/ICE-3019, co-funded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER). It aims at creating a body of knowledge and practical tools which are necessary to handle more effectively the behavior of occupants of large facilities. Therefore, the project studies the development of ambient intelligence and intelligent environments supported by the use of Agent-Based Social Simulation.

Agent-based modeling is most useful in providing a bridge between micro and macro levels, which is a large part of what sociology studies. Agent-based models are most appropriate for studying processes that lack central coordination, including the emergence of institutions that, once established, impose order from the top down. The models focus on how simple and predictable local interactions generate familiar but highly detailed global patterns, such as emergence of [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[participation (decision making)|participation]] of collective action. Michael W. Macy and Robert Willer researched a recent survey of applications and found that there were two main problems with agent-based modeling the [[self-organization]] of social structure and the [[emergence]] of [[social order]] {{Harv|Macy|Willer|2002}}. Below is a brief description of each problem Macy and Willer believe there to be;
#"''Emergent structure''. In these models, agents change location or behavior in response to [[social influences]] or selection pressures. Agents may start out undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to avoid becoming different or isolated (or in some cases, overcrowded). Rather than producing homogeneity, however, these conformist decisions aggregate to produce global patterns of cultural differentiation, stratification, and homophilic clustering in local networks. Other studies reverse the process, starting with a heterogeneous population and ending in convergence: the coordination, diffusion, and sudden collapse of norms, conventions, innovations, and technological standards."
#"''Emergent social order''. These studies show how [[egotism|egoistic]] adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either altruism or global (top down) imposition of control. A key finding across numerous studies is that the viability of trust, cooperation, and collective action depends decisively on the embeddedness of interaction."

These examples simply show the complexity of our environment and that agent-based models are designed to explore the minimal conditions, the simplest set of assumptions about human behavior, required for a given social phenomenon to emerge at a higher level of organization.

==Criticisms==
Since its creation, computerized social simulation has been the target of some criticism in regard to its practicality and accuracy. Social simulation's simplification of the complex to form models from which we can better understand the latter is sometimes seen as a draw back, as using fairly simple models to simulate real life with computers is not always the best way to predict behavior.

Most of the criticism seems to be aimed at agent-based models and simulation and how they work:

#Simulations, being man-made from mathematical interfaces, predict [[human behavior]] in a far too simple manner in regard to the complexities of humanity and our actions.
#Simulations cannot enlighten researchers as to how people interact or behave in ways not programmed into their models. For this reason, the scope of simulations are limited in that the researchers must already know what they are going to find (to a degree, for they cannot find anything they themselves did not place in the model) at least vaguely, possibly skewing the results.
#Due to the complexities of what is being measured, simulations must be analyzed in unbiased ways; however, with the model running on a pre-made set of instructions coded into it by a modeler, biases exist almost universally.
#It is highly difficult and often impractical to attempt to link the findings from the abstract world the simulation creates and our complex society and all of its variation.

Researchers working in social simulation might respond that the competing theories from the [[social sciences]] are far simpler than those achieved through simulation and therefore suffer the aforementioned drawbacks much more strongly.  Theories in some social science tend to be linear models that are not dynamic, and are generally inferred from small laboratory [[experiment]]s (laboratory tests are most common in psychology but rare in sociology, political science, economics and geography). The behavior of populations of agents under these models is rarely tested or verified against empirical observation.

The '''Socialist Unity Network''' was a small network of the [[far-left]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which was not affiliated with any single [[political party]]. It grew out of the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] (SA) in England, and was initiated by several non-aligned members of the SA executive in March 2004.

Members of the network were supporters of [[Respect - The Unity Coalition]] and other left electoral initiatives including the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]. The main aspect of the network was its now defunct website, which had regularly updated articles from a wide range of socialist  perspectives on issues including the possibilities of creating socialist unity.

==History==
The network was formed in March 2004 by several non-aligned members of the Socialist Alliance in England, and grew to include left-wing activists from a range of political parties and campaigning organisations, and those with no party affiliation. It was centrally involved in the debates around the winding down of the Socialist Alliance and the formation of Respect. It produced its own leaflets on occasions and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] some members of the network stood as "Socialist Unity" candidates, providing a banner under which independent socialists could choose to stand, as part of the [[Socialist Green Unity Coalition]], a coalition with the Socialist Party.

Socialist Unity candidates stood again in the 2006 council elections, gaining over 5% of the vote in Swindon, and over 10% in Hackney. The network also produced a 2005 election guide with ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]'' magazine.

Leading members included Jim Jepps (later a Green Party activist), Declan O'Neill, Andy Newman (later a Labour Party member),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andy-newman Andy Newman &amp;#124; The Guardian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420115503/http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andy-newman |date=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Caygill, John Nicholson, Martin Wicks (of Swindon Trades Council), Pete Green, Nick Bird, Salman Shaheen (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog), Reuben Rosenberg (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog) and Tawfiq Chahboune.

== Core beliefs ==
The "who we are" section on the socialist unity network webpage stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Socialist Unity Network originated in the Socialist Alliance. It is not a political group conceived to add to the competition between the many socialist organisations which already exist. It is a network of activists which campaigns for the widest practical collaboration of left groups and movements resisting the attacks of the Blair government.

In England the left has failed to make the break with the sectarian legacy that has dogged the "far left" for so long. Such divisions undermine our ability to build a fightback against the Blair government.

The Socialist Unity Network therefore believes that, in the interests of building resistance and striving to create the conditions in which a socialist alternative to New Labour can emerge, it is necessary to strive to develop [[collaborative method]]s of working as widely as possible. This is similar to the process that led to the formation of the SSP in Scotland, which was the result of a number of years of common work and discussion which enabled previously competing and sometimes hostile organisations to overcome old antagonisms and to develop greater political agreement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Sustainability measurement''' is the quantitative basis for the informed management of [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411231334/http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The metrics used for the measurement of sustainability (involving the sustainability of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are still evolving: they include [[Ecological indicator|indicator]]s, benchmarks, audits, indexes and accounting,  as well as assessment, appraisal&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton, Barry and Sadler, Barry 2009. ''Sustainability Appraisal. A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience.'' London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-357-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and other reporting systems. They are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T. et al. 2007. ''Sustainability Indicators'', SCOPE 67. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Simon  and Morse, Stephen 2008. ''Sustainability Indicators. Measuring the Immeasurable?'' 2nd edn. London: Earthscan. {{ISBN|978-1-84407-299-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate [[sustainability reporting]], [[Triple bottom line|Triple Bottom Line accounting]], and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the [[Environmental Sustainability Index]] and [[Environmental Performance Index]]. An alternative approach, used by the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme and explicitly critical of the triple-bottom-line approach is [[Circles of Sustainability]].

==Sustainability indicators and their function==
The principal objective of sustainability indicators is to inform public policy-making as part of the process of [[sustainability governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Boulanger, P. M. (2008) "Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue". '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sustainability indicators can provide information on any aspect of the interplay between the environment and socio-economic activities.&lt;ref&gt;Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Building strategic indicator sets generally deals with just a few simple questions: what is happening? (descriptive indicators), does it matter and are we reaching targets? (performance indicators), are we improving? (efficiency indicators), are measures working? (policy effectiveness indicators), and are we generally better off? (total welfare indicators). One popular general framework used by The [[European Environment Agency]] uses a slight modification of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] [[DPSIR]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Stanners, D. et al. 2007. ''Frameworks for environmental assessment and indicators at the EEA.'' In: Hak, T., Moldan, B. &amp; Dahl, A.L. 2007. SCOPE 67. ''Sustainability indicators''. Island Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; This breaks up environmental impact into five stages. Social and economic developments (consumption and production) ''(D)rive'' or initiate environmental ''(P)ressures'' which, in turn, produces a change in the ''(S)tate'' of the environment which leads to ''(I)mpacts'' of various kinds. Societal ''(R)esponses'' (policy guided by sustainability indicators) can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of events.

==Metrics at the global scale==

===United Nations Indicators===
The United Nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement  tools in relation to sustainable development &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/isd.htm] United Nations sustainable development indicators&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/envaccounting/seea.asp], [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] UN System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benchmarks, indicators, indexes, auditing etc.===
In the last couple of decades there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability — including measures of resource use like [[life cycle assessment]], measures of consumption like the [[ecological footprint]] and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the [[Environmental Performance Index]]. The following is a list of quantitative "tools" used by sustainability scientists - the different categories are for convenience only as defining criteria will intergrade. It would be too difficult to list all those methods available at different levels of organisation so those listed here are at for the global level only.

===Resource metrics===
Part of this process can relate to resource use such as [[energy accounting]] or to economic metrics or [[price system]] values as compared to [[non-market economics]] potential, for understanding resource use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Net_energy_analysis |title=Net energy analysis |publisher=Eoearth.org |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important task for resource theory ([[energy economics]]) is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision Making, Science, and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are described and analyzed by means of the methods of mathematics and the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - A Useful Concept.Intro |publisher=Exergy.se |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human factors, however, have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the [[Industrial Revolution]], and in particular have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality. A balanced view of these issues requires an understanding of the physical framework in which all human ideas, institutions, and aspirations must operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Energy_and_economic_myths_(historical) |title=Energy and economic myths (historical) |publisher=Eoearth.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economics, oil and energy====
[[Image:Oil imports.PNG|thumb|300px|Oil imports by country]]

===Energy return on energy investment===
When oil production first began in the mid-nineteenth century, the largest oil fields recovered fifty barrels of oil for every barrel used in the extraction, transportation and refining. This ratio is often referred to as the Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI or [[EROEI]]).  Currently, between one and five barrels of oil are recovered for each barrel-equivalent of energy used in the recovery process.  As the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the [[Net energy gain]] falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source.  This happens long before the resource is physically exhausted.

Note that it is important to understand the distinction between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a [[barrel of oil equivalent]] (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source.  Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using [[natural gas]] to fuel [[enhanced oil recovery]]. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most [[Athabasca Tar Sands]] plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to [[Ethanol fuel]] produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.

====Growth-based economic models====

Insofar as [[economic growth]] is driven by oil consumption growth, post-peak societies must adapt. [[M. King Hubbert]] believed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976/ |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our principal constraints are cultural.  During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture, a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of nongrowth.}}

Some economists describe the problem as [[uneconomic growth]] or a [[false economy]]. At the political right, [[Fred Ikle]] has warned about "conservatives addicted to the Utopia of Perpetual Growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dieoff.org/page68.htm |title=Our Perpetual Growth Utopia |publisher=Dieoff.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed - but did not stop - the growth of world [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/np/speeches/2006/pdf/050206.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed [[agriculture]] around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by [[fossil fuels]] in the form of [[fertilizers]] (natural gas), [[pesticides]] (oil), and [[hydrocarbon]] fueled [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html How peak oil could lead to starvation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818060558/http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html |date=2007-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and [[Mario Giampietro]], senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their study ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'' the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy [[world population]] will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Taggart |first=Adam |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |title=Eating Fossil Fuels |publisher=EnergyBulletin.net |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071544/http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html |archivedate=2007-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without population reduction, this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020, becoming critical c. 2050. The [[Peak oil|peaking of global oil]] along with the decline in regional [[natural gas]] production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected. [[Dale Allen Pfeiffer]] claims that coming decades could see spiraling [[food]] prices without relief and massive [[starvation]] on a global level such as never experienced before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil Peak Oil: the threat to our food security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714220834/http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil |date=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oil Drum: Europe |url=http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/2225 |title=Agriculture Meets Peak Oil |publisher=Europe.theoildrum.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hubbert peaks==
Although [[Hubbert peak theory]] receives most attention in relation to [[peak oil|peak oil production]], it has also been applied to other natural resources.

===Natural gas===
{{Main|Peak gas}}
Doug Reynolds predicted in 2005 that the North American peak would occur in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=White |url=http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |title=State's consultant says nation is primed for using Alaska gas |date=December 17, 2005 |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221153321/http://dwb.adn.com/money/industries/oil/v-printer/story/7296501p-7208184c.html |archivedate=February 21, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bentley (p.&amp;nbsp;189) predicted a world "decline in conventional gas production from about 2020".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Viewpoint - Global oil &amp; gas depletion: an overview
|first=R.W. |last=Bentley |journal=Energy Policy |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=189–205 |year=2002 |url=http://www.oilcrisis.com/bentley/depletionOverview.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1016/S0301-4215(01)00144-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
{{Main|Peak coal}}
Peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil, but we can observe the example of [[Anthracite coal|anthracite]] in the USA, a high grade coal whose production peaked in the 1920s.  Anthracite was studied by Hubbert, and matches a curve closely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html GEO 3005: Earth Resources] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725085800/http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/3005/resource.html |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pennsylvania's coal production also matches Hubbert's curve closely, but this does not mean that coal in Pennsylvania is exhausted—far from it.  If production in Pennsylvania returned at its all-time high, there are reserves for 190 years.  Hubbert had recoverable [[Coal#World coal reserves|coal reserves worldwide]] at 2500 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; metric tons and peaking around 2150(depending on usage).

More recent estimates suggest an earlier peak. ''Coal: Resources and Future Production'' (PDF 630KB &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |title=Startseite |publisher=Energy Watch Group |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911224731/http://www.energywatchgroup.org/files/Coalreport.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), published on April 5, 2007 by the Energy Watch Group (EWG), which reports to the German Parliament, found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamilton |first=Rosie |url=http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |title=Peak coal: sooner than you think |publisher=Energybulletin.net |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522155229/http://www.energybulletin.net/29919.html |archivedate=2008-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reporting on this Richard Heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal will likely come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal (tons  per year) extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richardheinberg.com/museletter/179 |title=Museletter |publisher=Richard Heinberg |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second study,
''The Future of Coal'' by B. Kavalov and S. D. Peteves of the Institute for Energy (IFE), prepared for European Commission Joint Research Centre, reaches similar conclusions and states that
""coal might not be so abundant, widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future".&lt;ref name="Httpwwwenergybulletinnethtml" /&gt;

Work by [[David Rutledge (engineer)|David Rutledge]] of [[Caltech]] predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 [[gigatonne]]s.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;"Coal: Bleak outlook for the black stuff", by David Strahan, [[New Scientist]], [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19726391.800-coal-bleak-outlook-for-the-black-stuff.html Jan. 19, 2008, pp. 38-41].
&lt;/ref&gt; This
implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed.

Finally, insofar as global [[peak oil]] and peak in natural gas are expected anywhere from imminently to within decades at most, any increase in coal production (mining) per annum to compensate for declines in oil or NG production, would necessarily translate to an earlier date of peak as compared with peak coal under a scenario in which annual production remains constant.

===Fissionable materials===
{{Main|Peak uranium}}
In a paper in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233843/http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/1956/1956.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  after a review of US fissionable reserves, Hubbert notes of nuclear power:

{{cquote|There is promise, however, provided mankind can solve its international problems and not destroy itself with nuclear weapons, and provided world population (which is now expanding at such a rate as to double in less than a century) can somehow be brought under control, that we may at last have found an energy supply adequate for our needs for at least the next few centuries of the "foreseeable future."}}

Technologies such as the [[thorium fuel cycle]], [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]] and [[Fast breeder reactor|fast breeders]] can, in theory, considerably extend the life of [[uranium]] reserves. [[Roscoe Bartlett]] claims &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025195932/http://www.bartlett.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5-2-06%20Oil%20Speech.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Our current throwaway nuclear cycle uses up the world reserve of low-cost uranium in about 20 years.}}

Caltech physics professor [[David Goodstein]] has stated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Tony|title=Professor Goodstein discusses lowering oil reserves|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2013|date=23 November 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509063107/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1249211.htm|archive-date=2013-05-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that

{{cquote|... you would have to build 10,000 of the largest power plants that are feasible by engineering standards in order to replace the 10 terawatts of fossil fuel we're burning today ... that's a staggering amount and if you did that, the known reserves of uranium would last for 10 to 20 years at that burn rate. So, it's at best a bridging technology ... You can use the rest of the uranium to breed plutonium 239 then we'd have at least 100 times as much fuel to use. But that means you're making plutonium, which is an extremely dangerous thing to do in the dangerous world that we live in.}}

===Metals===
{{Main|Peak copper}}
Hubbert applied his theory to "rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/hubbert/wwf1976 |title=Exponential Growth as a Transient Phenomenon in Human History |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as [[copper]], [[tin]], [[lead]], [[zinc]] and others would occur in the time frame of decades and [[iron]] in the time frame of two centuries like coal. The price of copper rose 500% between 2003 and 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/copper/mcs-2008-coppe.pdf Copper Statistics and Information, 2007].

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus]] supplies are essential to farming and depletion of reserves is estimated at somewhere from 60 to 130 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apda.pt/apda_resources/APDA.Biblioteca/eureau%5Cposition%20papers%5Cthe%20reuse%20of%20phosphorus.pdf |title=APDA |publisher=Apda.pt |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual countries supplies vary widely; without a recycling initiative America's supply &lt;ref&gt;http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/phosphate_rock/phospmcs06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is estimated around 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecosanres.org/PDF%20files/Fact_sheets/ESR4lowres.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805112847/http://ecosanres.org/PDF%20files/Fact_sheets/ESR4lowres.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phosphorus supplies affect total agricultural output which in turn limits alternative fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol.

===Peak water===
{{Main|Peak water}}
Hubbert's original analysis did not apply to renewable resources.  However [[over-exploitation]] often results in a Hubbert peak nonetheless.  A modified Hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For example, a reserve such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]] can be mined at a rate that far exceeds replenishment.  This turns much of the world's underground water &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcsupply/6worllarg2.html |title=WorldŐs largest acquifer going dry |publisher=Uswaternews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209034549/http://www.uswaternews.com/archives/arcsupply/6worllarg2.html |archivedate=2012-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lakes &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/2005/Update47_data.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720005108/http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/2005/Update47_data.htm |date=July 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil.  These debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/cleanrgy/water_resource.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive.  The term [[fossil water]] is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged.

===Renewable resources===
*'''Fisheries''': At least one researcher has attempted to perform Hubbert linearization ([[Hubbert curve]]) on the [[whaling]] industry, as well as charting the transparently dependent price of caviar on sturgeon depletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aspoitalia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=39 |title=How General is the Hubbert Curve? |publisher=Aspoitalia.net |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the [[cod]] of the North Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hubbertpeak.com/laherrere/multihub.htm |title=Laherrere: Multi-Hubbert Modeling |publisher=Hubbertpeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison of the cases of fisheries and of mineral extraction tells us that the human pressure on the environment is causing a wide range of resources to go through a depletion cycle which follows a Hubbert curve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11006">The ''''Two Layer' Hypothesis''', or '''immigration hypothesis''', is an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] theory that suggests the human occupation of mainland [[Southeast Asia]] occurred over two distinct periods by two separate racial groups, hence the term 'layer'.&lt;ref name="reich"&gt;Reich, D., Patterson, N., Kircher, M., Delfin, F., Nandineni, M.R., Pugach, I.,... Stoneking, M. (2011). Denisova admixture and the first modern human dispersals into Southeast Asia and Oceania. The American Journal of Human Genetics, 89(4), 516-528.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Two Layer Hypothesis, early indigenous [[Australo-Melanesian]] peoples comprised the first population of Southeast Asia before their genetic integration with a second wave of inhabitants from East Asia, including Southern China, during the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural expansion]] of the [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="matsu1"&gt;Matsumura, H., Oxenham, M.F., Dodo, Y., Domett, K. Thuy, N.K., Cuong, N.L.,... Yamagata, M. (2008). Morphometric affinity of the late Neolithic human remains from Man Bac, Ninh Binh Province, Vietnam: key skeletons with which to debate the 'two layer' hypothesis. Anthropological Science, 116(2), 135-148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="matsu2"&gt;Matsumura, H., Hudson, M.J. (2005). Dental perspectives on the population history of Southeast Asia. American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 127(2), 182-209.&lt;/ref&gt;
The majority of evidence for the Two Layer Hypothesis consists of dental and [[Morphometrics|morphometric]] analyses from archaeological sites throughout Southeast Asia, most prominently [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. The credibility of the Two Layer Hypothesis has been criticized due mainly to similarities between Southeast Asian and Chinese cranial and dental characteristics, excluding Australo-Melanesians.

== History ==

The first fossilized skeletal remains and indication of early 'Proto-Australian' Southeast Asian inhabitants surfaced in 1920 during an excavation by Dubois on the island of [[Java]].&lt;ref name="dubois"&gt;Dubois, E. (1921). The proto-Australian fossil man of Wadjak, Java. Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Weteschappen Proceedings Series B Physical Sciences, 23, 1013-1051.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, a formal connection to mainland Southeast Asia and the suggestion of an initial population of Australomelanesoids was not suggested until 1952 by Koenigswald in his response to Hooijer,&lt;ref name="koen"&gt;Koenigswald, G.H.R. (1952). Evidence of a prehistoric Australomelanesoid population in Malaya and Indonesia. Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 8(1), 92-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  who sharply criticized the attribution of 'big toothed' dental remains to early Australo-Melanesians.&lt;ref name="hooijer"&gt;Hooijer, D.A. (1950). Fossil Evidence of Austromelanesian Migrations in Malaysia? Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 6(4), 416-422.&lt;/ref&gt;
The immigration hypothesis proposed by Koenigswald was formally termed the 'Two Layer' model by Jacob Teuku. In 1967, Teuku analyzed the cranial and dental proportions of 152 adult skeletal samples recovered from prehistoric sites in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], the majority displaying robust jaws and teeth, prominent [[glabella]]e, and slender, elongated limbs. Teuku argued these characteristics correspond to the Australo-Melanesian population proposed by Koenigswald that predated the East Asian immigrants of the Neolithic; also suggesting the initial inhabitants were likely forced south of Southeast Asia's mainland by the second wave of migrants, due to resource competition or conflict.&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jacob"&gt;Jacob, T. (1967). Some problems pertaining to the racial history of the Indonesian region: a study of human skeletal and dental remains from several prehistoric sites in Indonesia and Malaysia.

== Archaeological evidence ==

=== Thailand ===

Excavations at Moh Khiew Cave resulted in the discovery of a [[Late Pleistocene]] female human skeleton, an [[Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS]] radiocarbon date on a charcoal sample that was gathered from the burial grave gave an age of 25,800 +/- 600 BP.&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt;  Measurements such as the bimaxillary breadth, upper facial height, bicondylar breadth, mandibular length, nasal breadth and height, palatal height, and mandibular angle were compared from the cranial and dental area to other female human specimens from [[East Asia]] and the Southwest Pacific regions. Twelve measurements were used in total for the statistical comparison in addition to 14 buccolingual crown diameters of the maxillary and mandibular teeth.&lt;ref name="matsu3"&gt;Matsumura, H., &amp; Pookajorn, S. (2005). A morphometric analysis of the Late Pleistocene human skeleton from the Moh Khiew Cave in Thailand. HOMO-Journal of Comparative Human Biology, 56(2), 93-118.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a comparison was completed the closest sample to the Moh Khiew Cave sample is the Late Pleistocene Coobool Creek from [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt; The next closest sample is the modern [[Australian Aborigines]].  However, those from [[Flores]], Vietnam, and Thailand are distant samples in comparison.  This discovery suggests that the Moh Khiew Cave skeleton may have shared a common ancestor with Australian Aborigines and [[Melanesians]] and also supports the ‘Two Layer’ hypothesis.

=== Vietnam ===

A study conducted in 2005, examined and compared permanent teeth from 4,002 individuals found in 42 prehistoric and historic samples throughout [[East Asia]], Southeast Asia, Australia, and [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt; Metric dental traits were denoted by [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|mesiodistal]] and buccolingual crown diameters.  Measurements were taken as maximum diameters and male individuals were primarily measured because males generally have larger teeth and therefore show more differences.  One culture that was prevalent during this time was the [[Đa Bút culture]] which occurred during 6000-5000 BP.&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt; The metric and nonmetric dental analyses of the Đa Bút resulted in one culture that are highly differentiated from the East Asians.  A cluster analysis of the transformed [[Probability plot correlation coefficient|Q-mode correlation coefficients]] of the dental crown measurements, showed a major cluster with Australo-Melanesians.  Da But also has similarities with Australo-Melanesians in tooth size proportions and nonmetric traits.&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt; These close traits indicates a likeness with Australo-Melanesians.

== Modern debates and controversies ==

The main controversy concerning the 'Two Layer' hypothesis is whether or not the evolutionary process truly involved the Australo-Melanesians. Archaeologists such as Matsumura suggest Southern Chinese people comprised the initial population of Southeast Asia, rather than Australo-Melanesians&lt;ref name="matsu1" /&gt; while researchers such as Turner argue that prehistoric Southeast Asians did not mix with either racial group.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, C. (1992). The Dental Bridge between Australia and Asia: Following Macintosh into the East Asian Hearth of Humanity. Archaeology in Oceania, 27(3), 143-152.&lt;/ref&gt;
Though the early prehistoric Vietnamese and Malaysians both resembled the Australo-Melanesian samples the most, the [[Mán Bạc]] people had a greater resemblance to the [[Dong Son culture|Đông Sơn]] samples dating back to the [[Iron Age]]. Analyzing cranial and dental remains, Matsumura concluded based on chronological differences that the Mán Bạc people were immigrants affiliated with peoples near the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] region in Southern China.&lt;ref name="matsu1" /&gt; Molecular anthropologists have used classical genetic markers and [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] to analyze the similarities between early Chinese and Southeast Asians. Such genetic markers suggest the genetic layout of Southern Chinese peoples is quite similar to that of Southeast Asians.

Other controversies completely reject the 'Two Layer' hypothesis. Using dental evidence, Turner’s [[Sinodonty and Sundadonty|Sundadont/Sinodont]] hypothesis suggests the “Sundadont” trait seen in present-day Southeast Asians is a result of long-standing continuity. Turner created a cluster analysis of MMD values in order to test existing hypotheses of origins,&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt; concluding that all Southeast Asians, Micronesians, [[Polynesians]], and Jomonese form their own branch and descend from a common ancestor. The Australians and Melanesians, however, are scattered over the African and European branch along with a side branch of [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|Tasmanians]] and [[Solomon Islands#Early history|Solomon Islanders]]. Howell analyzed crania of major racial branches worldwide, and linked Australian and Melanesian cranial morphology most closely with African cranials. Howell discovered, however, that the size and features of present-day Asian cranial morphology differed significantly from that of Australians, Melanesians, and Africans.&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt;

[[Image:Flock of sheep.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[sheep]] research flock at U.S. Sheep Experiment Station]]
The '''U.S. Sheep Experiment Station''' ('''USSES''') is an [[agricultural experiment station]] focusing on [[domestic sheep]] (''Ovis aries'') which is run by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s [[Agricultural Research Service]]. Its stated mission is "...to develop integrated methods for increasing production efficiency of sheep and to simultaneously improve the [[sustainability]] of [[rangeland]] ecosystems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/AboutUs/AboutUs.htm?modecode=53-64-00-00 |title=About Us |publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service |date=2008-07-17 |accessdate=2008-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and facilities==
The station is located roughly six miles north of [[Dubois, Idaho]], and its lands span both Idaho and [[Montana]]. Its headquarters are on {{convert|27930|acre|km2|1}} of land owned by the Agricultural Research Service, including research facilities, animal facilities (such as [[lambing]] pens and dry lots), as well as residential facilities. The station is surrounded by the [[Caribou-Targhee National Forest]], as well being within two hours of the [[Grand Teton National Park|Grand Teton]]  and [[Yellowstone National Park]]s.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=53-64-00-00 |title=Dubois, Idaho |publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also holds roughly {{convert|16600|acre|km2|1}} within Montana's [[Centennial Mountains]] and {{convert|1200|acre|km2|1}} near [[Kilgore, Idaho]], both of which are used largely for seasonal grazing and rangeland research. The USSES spans several diverse [[ecosystems]], including [[subalpine]] [[meadow]], foothill, [[sagebrush steppe]], and [[desert shrubland]]. The station is the second largest employer in [[Clark County, Idaho]].&lt;ref name="ars"/&gt;

==Research==
The U.S. Sheep Experiment Station conducts research in the areas of [[ovine]] reproductive efficiency, genetic improvement (especially of [[List of sheep breeds|breeds]]), nutrient intake and use, ovine growth and development, range/grazing management, and product quality (i.e. [[Lamb and mutton|meat]] and [[wool]]). In addition to lambs and other attendant sheep, the station has a base flock of 3,000 mature sheep.&lt;ref name="ars"/&gt; 

Breeds developed at the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station include: 
* The [[Columbia (sheep)|Columbia]], a [[Dual use|dual-purpose breed]] and one of the first originating in the U.S. Early crosses were made in [[Wyoming]], but the originating flock was moved to the USSES in 1918.
* The [[Polypay (sheep)|Polypay]], developed in the 1960s. Known for its white wool and a high lambing rate.
* The [[Targhee (sheep)|Targhee]], a dual-purpose [[rangeland]] breed, named after the adjacent national forest.

One of the few areas of conflict when it comes to the station's research is its overlap with [[grizzly bear]] habitat. In 2010, the station made efforts to limit grazing in bear habitats,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/article_6361a398-41cd-11df-be5f-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Idaho sheep station halts grazing in bear habitat |work=[[Billings Gazette]] |date=April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 2013 environmental groups sued, claiming that its research activities continue to threaten grizzlies in the greater [[Yellowstone]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/groups-sue-federal-agency-over-sheep-research-station-after-grizzly/article_7b390052-c004-11e2-9ccf-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Groups sue federal agency over sheep research station after grizzly deaths |work=[[The Missoulian]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}

The '''Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit''' is a counter-argument to modern versions of the &lt;!--[surplus here?: [[William Paley|Paley]]-style --&gt; [[Teleological argument|argument from design]] for the [[existence of God]]. It was introduced by [[Richard Dawkins]] in chapter 4 of his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', "Why there almost certainly is no God".

The argument is a play on the notion of a "[[Junkyard tornado|tornado sweeping through a junkyard to assemble a Boeing 747]]" employed to decry [[abiogenesis]] and [[evolution]] as vastly unlikely and better explained by the existence of a [[Creator deity|creator god]]. According to Dawkins, this logic is self-defeating as the [[Theism|theist]] must now account for the god's existence and explain whether or how the god was created. In his view, if the existence of highly complex life on Earth is the equivalent of the implausible junkyard Boeing 747, the existence of a highly complex god is the "ultimate Boeing 747" that truly does require the seemingly impossible to explain its existence.

== Context and history ==
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|The "ultimate Boeing 747 gambit" was originally proposed by [[Richard Dawkins]] in his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]''.]]
Richard Dawkins begins ''The God Delusion'' by making it clear that the God he talks about is the [[Abrahamic]] concept of a [[personal god]] who is susceptible to worship. He considers the existence of such an entity to be a scientific question, because a universe with such a god would be significantly different from a universe without one, and he says that the difference would be [[Empiricism|empirically]] discernible. Therefore, Dawkins concludes, the same kind of reasoning can be applied to the God hypothesis as to any other scientific question.

After discussing some of the most common arguments for the existence of God in chapter 3, Dawkins concludes that the [[argument from design]] is the most convincing. The extreme improbability of life and a universe capable of hosting it requires explanation, but Dawkins considers the God hypothesis inferior to [[evolution by natural selection]] as [[Evolution of biological complexity|an explanation for the complexity of life]]. As part of his efforts to refute [[intelligent design]], he redirects the [[Irreducible complexity|argument from complexity]] in order to show that God must have been designed by a superintelligent designer, then presents his argument for the improbability of God's existence.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Arguing for Atheism |author=Michael Shermer |journal=Science |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5811/463 |volume=315 |issue=5811 |date=2007-01-26 |accessdate=2007-03-15 |doi=10.1126/science.1138989 |pages=463 }} (also available via [http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/6988 the second review here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210162827/http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/6988 |date=10 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins's name for the statistical demonstration that God almost certainly does not exist is the "Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit". This is an allusion to the [[junkyard tornado]]. [[Astrophysics|Astrophysicist]] [[Fred Hoyle]], who was a [[Darwinist]], [[Atheism|atheist]], [[Antitheism|anti-theist]] and advocate of the [[panspermia]] theory of life,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Collisions of debris as the vehicle for the distribution of biological material across space.&lt;/ref&gt; is reported as having stated that the "probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard, would have the luck to assemble a [[Boeing 747]]."&lt;ref name="tgd113"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against empirically based theism date back at least as far as the eighteenth-century philosopher [[David Hume#Design argument|David Hume]], whose objection can be paraphrased as the question "[[Argument from design#Contradictory premises lead to an infinite regress|Who designed the designer?]]". According to philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]], however –&amp;nbsp;one of Dawkins's fellow "[[Brights movement|brights]]"&amp;nbsp;– the innovation in Dawkins's argument is twofold: to show that where design fails to explain complexity, evolution by natural selection succeeds as the only workable solution; and to argue how this should illuminate the confusion surrounding the [[anthropic principle]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The notion that "observations of the physical universe must be compatible with [[Consciousness|conscious]] and [[Sapience|sapient]] life that observes it" (see [[Anthropic principle]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dennett"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review of Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion |author=Daniel Dennett |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |journal=Free Inquiry |volume=27 |issue=1 |date=2006-10-16 |url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/dawkinsreview.pdf |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# One of the greatest challenges to the human intellect, over the centuries, has been to explain how the complex, improbable appearance of design in the universe arises.
# The natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself. In the case of a man-made [[wikt:artefact|artefact&lt;!--UK SPELLING: please don't change (Dawkins is British)--&gt;]] such as a watch, the designer really was an intelligent engineer. It is tempting to apply the same logic to an eye or a wing, a spider or a person.
# The temptation is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer. The whole problem we started out with was the problem of explaining statistical improbability. It is obviously no solution to postulate something even more improbable. We need a "crane", not a "skyhook"; for only a crane can do the business of working up gradually and plausibly from simplicity to otherwise improbable complexity.
# The most ingenious and powerful crane so far discovered is Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Darwin and his successors have shown how living creatures, with their spectacular statistical improbability and appearance of design, have evolved by slow, gradual degrees from simple beginnings. We can now safely say that the illusion of design in living creatures is just that{{spndash}}an illusion.
# We don't yet have an equivalent crane for physics. Some kind of multiverse theory could in principle do for physics the same explanatory work as Darwinism does for biology. This kind of explanation is superficially less satisfying than the biological version of Darwinism, because it makes heavier demands on luck. But the [[anthropic principle]] entitles us to postulate far more luck than our limited human intuition is comfortable with.
# We should not give up hope of a better crane arising in physics, something as powerful as Darwinism is for biology. But even in the absence of a strongly satisfying crane to match the biological one, the relatively weak cranes we have at present are, when abetted by the anthropic principle, self-evidently better than the self-defeating skyhook hypothesis of an intelligent designer.}}

A central thesis of the argument is that compared to supernatural abiogenesis, evolution by natural selection requires the supposition of fewer hypothetical processes; according to [[Occam's razor]], therefore, it is a better explanation. Dawkins cites a paragraph where [[Richard Swinburne]] agrees that a simpler explanation is better but reasons that theism is simpler because it only invokes a single &lt;!--[is "substance" sic?:]--&gt;substance (God) as a cause and maintainer of every other object. This cause is seen as [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]] and totally "free". Dawkins argues that an entity that monitors and controls every particle in the universe and listens to all thoughts and prayers cannot be simple. Its existence would require a "mammoth explanation" of its own. The theory of natural selection is much simpler –&amp;nbsp;and thus preferable&amp;nbsp;– than a theory of the existence of such a complex being.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 147–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins then turns to a discussion of [[Keith Ward]]'s views on [[divine simplicity]] to show the difficulty "the theological mind has in grasping where the complexity of life comes from." Dawkins writes that Ward is sc&lt;!--UK SPELLING (please don't change)--&gt;eptical of [[Arthur Peacocke]]'s ideas that evolution is directed by other forces than only natural selection and that these processes may have a propensity toward increasing complexity. Dawkins says that this sc&lt;!--UK SPELLING (please don't change)--&gt;epticism is justified, because complexity does not come from biased mutations. Dawkins writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Natural selection], as far as we know, is the only process ultimately capable of generating complexity out of simplicity. The theory of natural selection is genuinely simple. So is the origin from which it starts. That which it explains, on the other hand, is complex almost beyond telling: more complex than anything we can imagine, save a God capable of designing it.&lt;ref name="tgd151"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Assessment and criticism ==

Theist authors have presented extensive opposition, most notably by theologian [[Alister McGrath]] (in ''[[The Dawkins Delusion?]]'') and philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God Is Great, God Is Good |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX3tGSzi16AC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plantinga"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2007/002/1.21.html |title=The Dawkins Confusion — Naturalism ad absurdum |work=Books &amp; Culture, a Christian Review |author=[[Alvin Plantinga]] |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

 --&gt; Another negative review, by biologist [[H. Allen Orr]], sparked heated debate, prompting, for example, the mathematician [[Norman Levitt]] to ask why theologians are assumed to have the exclusive right to write about who "rules" the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What a Friend We Have in Dawkins |author=Norman Levitt |work=eSkeptic |url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-01-31.html |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] also took exception to Orr's review, leading to an exchange of open letters between himself and Orr.&lt;ref&gt;Full [http://www.edge.org/discourse/dennett_orr.html#dd exchange of open letters] at edge.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; The philosopher Sir [[Anthony Kenny]] also considers this argument to be flawed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]], 2007 Presidential [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] Annual Lecture (published in ''Philosophy'' Volume 82 number 321 (July 2007), pp. 381-397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
 --&gt; Cosmologist [[Stephen Barr]]&lt;ref name="Stephen M Barr 2003"&gt;Stephen M Barr (2003), ''Modern Physics and Ancient faith'' ({{ISBN|0-268-03471-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt; responded as follows: "[[William Paley|Paley]] finds a [[Watchmaker analogy|watch and asks how]] such a thing could have come to be there by chance. Dawkins finds an immense automated factory that blindly constructs watches, and feels that he has completely answered Paley's point."&lt;ref&gt;Modern Physics and Ancient Faith Paperback – February 15, 2006 by Stephen M Barr&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simplicity of God and materialist assumptions===
Both Alvin Plantinga and Richard Swinburne raise the objection that God is not complex. Swinburne gives two reasons why a God that controls every particle can be simple: first, a person, as indicated by phenomena such as [[split-brain]]s, is not the same as their highly complex brain but "is something simpler" that can "control" that brain; and second, simplicity is a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality that is intrinsic]] to a hypothesis, not related to its empirical consequences.&lt;ref name="swinburne"/&gt;

Plantinga writes:
{{Quote
 | So first, according to classical theology, God is simple, not complex. More remarkable, perhaps, is that according to Dawkins's own definition of complexity, God is not complex. According to his definition (set out in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''), something is complex if it has parts that are "arranged in a way that is unlikely to have arisen by chance alone." But of course God is a spirit, not a material object at all, and hence has no parts. ''A fortiori'' (as philosophers like to say) God doesn't have parts arranged in ways unlikely to have arisen by chance. Therefore, given the definition of complexity Dawkins himself proposes, God is not complex."
}}
He continues:
{{Quote
 | "But second, suppose we concede, at least for purposes of argument, that God is complex. Perhaps we think the more a being knows, the more complex it is; God, being [[omniscient]], would then be highly complex. Given [[materialism]] and the idea that the ultimate objects in our universe are the elementary particles of physics, perhaps a being that knew a great deal would be improbable{{spndash}}how could those particles get arranged in such a way as to constitute a being with all that knowledge? Of course we aren't given materialism.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt;
}}
In other words, Plantinga concludes that this argument, to be valid, would require materialism to be true; but, as materialism is not compatible with traditional theology,{{clarify|date=November 2014}} the argument [[Begging the question|begs the question]] by requiring its [[premise]] to assume God's non-existence.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt;

In an extensive analysis published in ''[[Science and Christian Belief]]'', Patrick Richmond suggests that "Dawkins is right to object to unexplained organised complexity in God" but that God is simply specified and lacks the sort of composition and limitations found in [physical] creatures; hence the theist can explain why nature exists without granting unexplained organised complexity or the extreme improbability of God.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Richmond, "Richard Dawkins's Darwinian Objection to Unexplained Complexity in God", ''[[Science and Christian Belief]]'' Vol. 19 No. 2 (2007), pp. 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some respondents, such as [[Stephen Law]], have suggested that God is or would indeed be complex if responsible [[Creator deity|for creating]] and [[God the Sustainer|sustaining the universe]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3fGJq04rUc ''The Strengths and Weaknesses of the God Delusion''] (YouTube).&lt;/ref&gt; God's omniscience would require the retention of and ability to use all knowledge. Concepts such as [[Kolmogorov complexity]] have also been used to argue that God is or would need to be complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omnisaffirmatioestnegatio.wordpress.com/2010/06/12/dawkins-and-the-ultimate-747-gambit/ ''Dawkins and the Ultimate Boeing 747 Gambit'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity of external explanations===
There are many variations on how to express this objection. [[William F. Vallicella]] holds that organized complexity as such does not need explanation, because when in search of an ultimate explanation, one must in the end accept an entity whose complexity has no external explanation.&lt;ref name="vallicella"&gt;[http://maverickphilosopher.powerblogs.com/posts/1167878240.shtml Vallicella's discussion with] [[Erik Wielenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins has stated that we should search for simple beginnings for explanations, like in evolution which moves from simple to complex, and so what we ultimately accept with no external explanation must be simple for it to be a good explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"&gt;[http://www.fixed-point.org/index.php/video/35-full-length/164-the-dawkins-lennox-debate The God Delusion Debate: Richard Dawkins vs John Lennox] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625134059/http://www.fixed-point.org/index.php/video/35-full-length/164-the-dawkins-lennox-debate |date=25 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And Plantinga writes that when ''not'' in search for an ultimate explanation of organized complexity, it is perfectly fine to explain one kind of complexity, that of terrestrial life, in terms of another kind of complexity, namely divine activity.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt; Dawkins addresses this point in his debate with John Lennox over ''The God Delusion'', saying that it would be perfectly reasonable to infer from artifacts on earth or another planet that an intelligence existed, but that you would still need to explain that intelligence, which evolution does, while for God's existence there is no such explanation.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"/&gt;

Alister McGrath suggests that the leap from the recognition of complexity to the assertion of improbability is problematic, as a [[theory of everything]] would be more complex than the theories it would replace, yet one would not conclude that it is less probable. Dawkins has responded to this point in his debate with Lennox and at other times, saying that while physics is hard to understand, fundamentally, unlike biology, it is simple.&lt;ref name="Dawkins-Lennox"/&gt; McGrath then argues that probability is not relevant to the question of existence: life on earth is highly improbable and yet we exist. The important question in his view is not whether God is ''probable'', but whether God is ''actual''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dawkins Delusion?'', pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; In interviewing McGrath for ''The Root of All Evil'', Dawkins responds that the existence of life on Earth is indeed highly improbable, but this is exactly why a theory such as evolution is required to explain that improbability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6474278760369344626# Root of All Evil? The Uncut Interviews] (Google Video).&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of God, Dawkins says, there is no such satisfactory explanation.

On the point of probability, Alvin Plantinga claims that if God is a [[Argument from contingency|necessary being]], as argued by classical theism, God is, by definition, maximally probable; thus an argument that there is no necessary being with the qualities attributed to God is required to demonstrate God's improbability.&lt;ref name="plantinga"/&gt; Eric MacDonald has pointed out that theists assume the coherence of their position when they make arguments for God when, by Plantinga's standards, they would have to present an argument that the concept of God is not logically incoherent before discussing other arguments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://choiceindying.com/2011/05/18/duking-it-out-over-the-god-delusion/ ''Duking it Out Over the God Delusion'']&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's objection would seem to apply to all atheist arguments that contend that God is improbable, such as evidential arguments about the [[problem of evil]] and the [[argument from nonbelief]]. But the reason why theists and atheists do not usually address this prior to making their arguments is because they want to go beyond merely discussing whether God is maximally probable or impossible.

===Dawkins's response to criticism in ''The God Delusion''===
Dawkins writes about his attendance at a conference in Cambridge sponsored by the [[John Templeton Foundation|Templeton Foundation]],&lt;ref name="tgd151"/&gt; where he challenged the theologians present to respond to the argument that a creator of a complex universe would have to be complex and improbable.&lt;ref&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; He reports the strongest response as the claim he was imposing a scientific [[epistemology]] on a question that lies beyond the realm of science. When theologians hold God to be simple, who is a scientist like Dawkins "to dictate to theologians that their God had to be complex?"&lt;ref name="tgd154"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins writes that he did not feel that those employing this "evasive" defence were being "wilfully dishonest", but that they were "defining themselves into an epistemological safe-zone where rational argument could not reach them because they had ''declared by fiat'' that it could not."&lt;ref name="tgd154"/&gt;

Theologians, Dawkins writes, demand that there be a [[Cosmological argument|first cause]] named "God". Dawkins responds that it must have been a simple cause and contends that unless "God" is divested of its normal associations, it is not an appropriate name. Postulating a prime mover that is capable of indulging in intelligent design is, in Dawkins's opinion, "a total abdication of the responsibility to find an explanation"; instead, he seeks a "self-bootstrapping crane" ([[#Dawkins's statement|see above]]) that can "lift" the universe into more complex states. This, he states, does not necessitate a {{clarify-span|narrowly scientific|date=November 2014}} explanation, but does require a "crane" rather than a "skyhook" (''[[#Dawkins's statement|ibid.]]'') if it is to account for the complexity of the natural world.&lt;ref name="tgd155"&gt;''The God Delusion'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point''' (also known as '''UW–Stevens Point''' or '''UWSP''') is a public university in [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin|Stevens Point]], [[Wisconsin]], United States. It is part of the [[University of Wisconsin System]]. It grants associate, baccalaureate and master's degrees, as well as doctoral degrees in audiology.

==History==
After securing land and funding from the City of Stevens Point and [[Portage County, Wisconsin|Portage County]] and winning the right to host the new [[normal school]], '''Stevens Point Normal School''' opened on September 17, 1894 with 201 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pchswi.org/archives/schools/uwsp/uwsp_main.htm "University of Wisconsin – Stevens Point"], Malcolm Rosholt Online Archives, Portage County Historical Society, retrieved June 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to teacher preparation, "domestic science" ([[home economics]]) and conservation education were offered; the latter formed the basis for the College of Natural Resources, nationally recognized{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} for undergraduate and graduate training in natural resources.

In 1927, Stevens Point Normal School became '''Central State Teachers College''' and began offering four-year teaching degrees. When post-[[World War II]] enrollment became less centered on teacher training and more focused on liberal arts education, the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] intervened, changing the school's name to '''Wisconsin State College–Stevens Point''' with the authority to grant bachelor's degrees in liberal arts.

Ever larger numbers of students in the 1950s and 1960s led to construction on campus throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. It was during this period, in 1964, that the college was elevated to university status as '''Wisconsin State University–Stevens Point''' and began offering graduate degrees. Seven years later, the Wisconsin State Universities merged into the University of Wisconsin system, and the school adopted its current name. UW-Stevens Point has more than 77,000 alumni. More than half of these alumni live in Wisconsin. In 1968, UW-Stevens Point formed the [[Northwoods battalion]], an ROTC unit for the United States army.

[[Lee S. Dreyfus]] became chancellor in 1974 before becoming Wisconsin's 40th governor. Governor Dreyfus was inaugurated on the lawn in front of Old Main on the UW-Stevens Point campus in 1979.

In 2007, a sustainability task force was created to help achieve the future goal of a carbon neutral campus.

In 2009, Chancellor Linda Bunnell resigned after a student vote of no-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Gatz, [http://www.waow.com/story/10236481/uwsp-chancellor-announces-resignation?clienttype=printable/ "UWSP chancellor announces resignation"], [[WAOW]], April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The vote in part was called because of an automobile accident she failed to report and allegations of drunken driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Polarizing-Chancellor-at/42799 "'Polarizing' Chancellor at U. of Wisconsin-Stevens Point Quits After Hit-and-Run Incident"], ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', April 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernie Patterson became chancellor in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Finkelmeyer, [http://host.madison.com/news/local/education/campus_connection/campus-connection-walker-s-plan-would-send-uwsp-back-to/article_8687beec-3f8e-11e0-9cdf-001cc4c002e0.html "Campus Connection: Walker's plan 'would send UWSP back to 19th century'"], ''The Capital Times'', February 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus hosted the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] of the [[National Football League]] for their first training camp in 1995. It was part of what then was known as the ''Cheese League'', a collection of teams that conducted training camp in Wisconsin. Since 1996, the Jaguars have conducted their training camp in [[Jacksonville]].

==Campus==
