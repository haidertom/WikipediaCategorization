}}The '''W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research''' ('''AIAR'''), is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] research institution located in East [[Jerusalem]]. It is the oldest American research center for ancient Near Eastern studies in the Middle East.  Founded in 1900 as the ''American School of Oriental Research'', it was renamed in 1970 after its most distinguished director and the father of [[Biblical archaeology]], [[William F. Albright]].  Its mission is to develop and disseminate scholarly knowledge of the literature, history, and culture of the Near East, as well as the study of civilization from pre-history to the early Islamic period.  
Today, the Albright Institute is one of three separately incorporated institutes affiliated with the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), the others being the American Center of Oriental Research –ACOR- in [[Amman]], Jordan, and the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute –CAARI- in [[Nicosia]], Cyprus.  
In 1948, the then [[American School of Oriental Research]], also known as  the Jerusalem School, played a significant role in the discovery and identification of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (see below). Between 1981 and 1996,  the Albright Institute, together with the Institute of Archaeology, [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], excavated at the ancient [[Philistine]] site of Tel Miqne-[[Ekron]], one of the five Philistine capital cities mentioned in the [[Bible]]. With the appointment of the new Director, Matthew J. Adams (2014), the Institute is now engaged in the Jezreel Valley Regional Project, a long-term, multi-disciplinary survey and excavation project investigating the history of human activity in the [[Jezreel Valley]] from the Paleolithic through the Ottoman period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jezreelvalleyregionalproject.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in an historic 1920s-period building, now a Jerusalem landmark, the Albright maintains residential and research facilities including a 35,000 volume library, publications offices, and archaeological laboratories.

==Fellowships==

The Institute’s unique international fellowship program fosters a culture of intellectual integrity and respect. It provides an opportunity for students and scholars from all over the world including Israelis and Palestinians to interact and exchange information and ideas in a friendly and convivial environment, which is not duplicated in any other such institution in the region. It also promotes working relationships with related institutions in Israel and the Palestinian Authority. 
	More than 3,000 persons participate in the Albright Institute’s annual wide range of programs including lectures, reports, workshops, field trips, and social events. The Institute also supports 31 ASOR-affiliated and Albright-assisted excavation, survey, and publications projects. 
	In the current academic year, the Albright awarded over $340,000 in grants, fellowships, and fees. This year’s 64 Fellows include 34 Fellows with stipends and fee awards, and 30 Associate Senior, Post-Doctoral, and Research Fellows with funding from other sources.  In the academic year 2012-13, the Institute initiated the Seymour Gitin Distinguished Professorship, which is open to internationally recognized senior scholars of all nationalities who have made significant contributions to their field of study.

==The Dead Sea Scrolls==

The Institute played a significant role in the discovery and preservation of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The Scrolls contain approximately eight hundred separate works written between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE. They include the only Jewish Bible manuscripts from that period, including a manuscript of Exodus that dates to c. 250 BCE.   Manuscripts or fragments of every book in the Hebrew Bible except the [[Book of Esther]] were unearthed, as well as many other Jewish religious texts, many previously unknown.  Most scholars believe that the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] were the property of the [[Essenes]] who lived at the site of Khirbet Qumran.  The Essenes were a Jewish sect active in the last century BCE and the first century CE, at the same time as the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducees]].

In the spring of 1948, the Institute was contacted by a representative of [[Mar Samuel]], the Metropolitan (Archbishop) of the Syrian Orthodox Church in Jerusalem, who wanted to authenticate four ancient scrolls that he had recently purchased from an antiquities dealer.
One of the younger scholars in residence at the Institute at that time, [[John C. Trever]] recognized the antiquity of the manuscripts and photographed three of the four scrolls in the basement of the Albright under very adverse conditions.  Trever was the first to photograph 1QIsaiah(a), a complete scroll of the book of Isaiah dating to approximately 100 BCE.   Trever sent copies of his photographs to his mentor—famed Near Eastern scholar and former Institute director [[William F. Albright]], who sent him a telegram congratulating him on the "greatest manuscript discovery of modern times!”

In early September 1948,  [[Mar Samuel]], contacted ASOR-currently the Albright Institute-in Jerusalem and the then Director Professor  [[Ovid R. Sellers]]. Samuel showed Sellers some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired. Sellers then focused on finding the cave in which the scrolls had been found. In late 1948, nearly two years after the discovery of the scrolls, scholars had yet to locate the cave where the fragments had been found. Conducting such a search was dangerous. When the British mandate in Palestine ended on May 15, 1948, war broke out immediately, and peace would not be restored until November. The cave was finally discovered on January 28, 1949, by a UN observer, and Sellers brought his box brownie camera to take the first photos of the cave, which were soon published in Life Magazine.

In 1952, [[Roland de Vaux]], the head of the French Biblical School in Jerusalem, organized a search of the caves in the cliffs above the Dead Sea near the site of [[Qumran]].  ASOR joined this expedition, and discovered Cave 3, the cave in which the famous [[Copper Scroll]] was found.  Cave 3 was the only Qumran cave to be completely excavated by professional archaeologists.

The Albright Institute continues to play a role in Scrolls scholarship to the present day.  In the 1990s, Board Chair Joy Ungerleider established a Dorot Dead Sea Scrolls fellowship at the Albright to enable young American scholars to work on the Scroll fragments in the nearby [[Rockefeller Museum]].  One of the first holders of this fellowship was Sidnie White Crawford, Board Chair and former president of the Institute, who lived and worked at the Albright from 1989-1991 on the editions of several Deuteronomy manuscripts from Cave 4, and the Reworked Pentateuch manuscripts, also from Cave 4.  The Albright has hosted many Scrolls scholars while they pursued their research, including Eugene C. Ulrich (University of Notre Dame), Mark Smith (New York University), and Eileen Schuller (McMaster University).  In addition, former fellow and trustee Jodi Magness (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill) has produced the seminal work on Qumran archaeology in the twenty-first century.

==The Ekron Royal Dedicatory Inscription==
{{main|Ekron inscription}}
The Albright’s excavations at Tel Miqne [[Ekron]]  is a joint project with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and was excavated from 1981 until 1996 under the direction of the Albright’s Dorot Director and Professor of Archaeology, Seymour Gitin, and Professor Trude Dothan of the Hebrew University. The excavations have  led to one of the most important archaeological discoveries in Israel in the 20th century, perhaps second only to that of the  [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].  In 1996, a significant artifact for the corpus of Biblical Archaeology was recovered, a monumental dedicatory inscription of the seventh-century king of Ekron Ikausu. The inscription not only securely identifies the site by mentioned the name Ekron, but it gives a king-list of the rulers of [[Ekron]], fathers to sons: Ya'ir, Ada, Yasid, Padi, and Ikausu, and the name of the goddess Patgayah to whom the temple is dedicated.

Both Padi and Ikausu are mentioned in the seventh century BCE Neo-Assyrian Royal Annals as Kings of Ekron, thus providing a basis for dating their reigns.  This makes the Ekron Inscription prime documentary evidence for establishing the chronology of events relating to the late biblical period, especially the history of the [[Philistines]].  The Goddess Patgayah refers to the Aegean mother goddess of Delphi, and Ikausu meaning the Achaean or the Greek may point to the Greek heritage of the Philistines or reflect contact between the [[Philistines]] and their ‘homeland’ Greece in the Archaic period of the 7th century, during which there was intensive economic and cultural exchange.

'''Applied mathematics''' is the application of [[mathematical model|mathematical method]]s by different fields such as [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], [[computer science]], and [[industry]]. Thus, applied mathematics is a combination of [[mathematical science]] and specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[profession|professional specialty]]  in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models. In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in [[pure mathematics]] where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake. The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics.

== History ==
[[File:Elmer-pump-heatequation.png|thumb|right|A numerical solution to the [[heat equation]] on a pump casing model using the [[finite element method]].]]

Historically, applied mathematics consisted principally of [[Mathematical analysis|applied analysis]], most notably [[differential equations]]; [[approximation theory]] (broadly construed, to include [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]]s, [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] methods, [[Calculus of variations|variational methods]], and [[numerical analysis]]); and applied [[probability]].  These areas of mathematics related directly to the development of [[Newtonian physics]], and in fact, the distinction between mathematicians and physicists was not sharply drawn before the mid-19th century.  This history left a pedagogical legacy in the United States: until the early 20th century, subjects such as [[classical mechanics]] were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American universities rather than in [[physics]] departments, and [[fluid mechanics]] may still be taught in applied mathematics departments.&lt;ref name="Stolz2002"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantitative finance]] is now taught in mathematics departments across universities and [[mathematical finance]] is considered a full branch of applied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thefinancialengineer.net/rankings/ Ranking of programs shows]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Engineering]] and [[computer science]] departments have traditionally made use of applied mathematics.

== Divisions ==
[[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|left|thumb|Fluid mechanics is often considered a branch of applied mathematics and mechanical engineering.]]

Today, the term "applied mathematics" is used in a broader sense. It includes the classical areas noted above as well as other areas that have become increasingly important in applications. Even fields such as [[number theory]] that are part of [[pure mathematics]] are now important in applications (such as [[cryptography]]), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics ''per se''. Sometimes, the term "[[applicable mathematics]]" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today.

There is no consensus as to what the various branches of applied mathematics are. Such categorizations are made difficult by the way mathematics and science change over time, and also by the way universities organize departments, courses, and degrees.

Many mathematicians distinguish between "applied mathematics," which is concerned with mathematical methods, and the "applications of mathematics" within science and engineering. A [[biology|biologist]] using a [[Matrix population models|population model]] and applying known mathematics would not be ''doing'' applied mathematics, but rather ''using'' it; however, mathematical biologists have posed problems that have stimulated the growth of pure mathematics. Mathematicians such as [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Vladimir Arnold|Arnold]] deny the existence of "applied mathematics" and claim that there are only "applications of mathematics."  Similarly, non-mathematicians blend applied mathematics and applications of mathematics. The use and development of mathematics to solve industrial problems is also called "industrial mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=University of Strathclyde | title=Industrial Mathematics | url=http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/applying/postgraduate/research_topics/industrial_mathematics | date=17 January 2008 | accessdate=8 January 2009 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804104748/http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/applying/postgraduate/research_topics/industrial_mathematics | archive-date=2012-08-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of modern numerical mathematical methods and software has led to the emergence of [[computational mathematics]], [[computational science]], and [[computational engineering]], which use [[supercomputer|high-performance computing]] for the [[simulation]] of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary.

[[File:Market Data Index NYA on 20050726 202628 UTC.png|right|thumb|[[Mathematical finance]] is concerned with the modelling of financial markets.]]

Historically, mathematics was most important in the [[natural sciences]] and [[engineering]]. However, since [[World War II]], fields outside the physical sciences have spawned the creation of new areas of mathematics, such as [[game theory]] and [[social choice theory]], which grew out of economic considerations.

The advent of the computer has enabled new applications: studying and using the new computer technology itself ([[computer science]]) to study problems arising in other areas of science (computational science) as well as the mathematics of computation (for example, [[theoretical computer science]], [[computer algebra]], [[numerical analysis]]).  [[Statistics]] is probably the most widespread [[mathematical science]] used in the [[social sciences]], but other areas of mathematics, most notably [[economics]], are proving increasingly useful in these disciplines.

== Status in academic departments ==

Academic institutions are not consistent in the way they group and label courses, programs, and degrees in applied mathematics.  At some schools, there is a single mathematics department, whereas others have separate departments for Applied Mathematics and (Pure) Mathematics.  It is very common for Statistics departments to be separated at schools with graduate programs, but many undergraduate-only institutions include statistics under the mathematics department.

Many applied mathematics programs (as opposed to departments) consist of primarily cross-listed courses and jointly appointed faculty in departments representing applications.  Some Ph.D. programs in applied mathematics require little or no coursework outside mathematics, while others require substantial coursework in a specific area of application.  In some respects this difference reflects the distinction between "application of mathematics" and "applied mathematics".

Some universities in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] host departments of ''Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics'',&lt;ref&gt;For example see, [http://www.tait.ac.uk/History.html The Tait Institute: History (2nd par.)]. Accessed Nov 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.am.qub.ac.uk Dept of Applied Mathematics &amp; Theoretical Physics.] [[Queen's University, Belfast]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Queens_University_Belfast/department/Department_of_Applied_Mathematics_Theoretical_Physics DAMTP Belfast ResearchGate page].&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now much less common to have separate departments of pure and applied mathematics. A notable exception to this is the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], housing the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] whose past holders include [[Isaac Newton]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[James Lighthill]], [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Stephen Hawking]].

Schools with separate applied mathematics departments range from [[Brown University]], which has a large Division of Applied Mathematics that offers degrees through the [[doctorate]], to [[Santa Clara University]], which offers only the [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in applied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Santa Clara University Dept of Applied Mathematics |url=http://www.scu.edu/academics/bulletins/undergraduate/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics.cfm |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504005925/http://www.scu.edu/academics/bulletins/undergraduate/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics.cfm |archivedate=2011-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research universities dividing their mathematics department into pure and applied sections include [[MIT]]. [[Brigham Young University]] also has an Applied and Computational Emphasis (ACME), a program that allows student to graduate with a Mathematics degree, with an emphasis in Applied Math. Students in this program also learn another skill (Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Pure Math, etc.) to supplement their applied math skills.

== Associated mathematical sciences ==
[[File:Oldfaithful3.png|thumb|right|Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with statistics.]]

Applied mathematics is closely related to other mathematical sciences.

===Scientific computing===
[[Scientific computing]] includes applied mathematics (especially [[numerical analysis]]), [[computing science]] (especially [[high-performance computing]]), and mathematical modelling in a scientific discipline.

===Computer science===
[[Computer science]] relies on [[logic]], [[algebra]], [[graph theory]], and [[combinatorics]].

===Operations research and management science===
[[Operations research]] and [[management science]] are often taught in faculties of engineering, business, and public policy.

===Statistics===
Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with the discipline of statistics. [[Statisticians|Statistical theorists]] study and improve statistical procedures with mathematics, and statistical research often raises mathematical questions. Statistical theory relies on [[Probability theory|probability]] and [[optimal decision|decision theory]], and makes extensive use of scientific computing, analysis, and [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]; for the [[design of experiments]], statisticians use [[algebraic statistics|algebra]] and [[combinatorial design]]. Applied mathematicians and [[statistician]]s often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities).

===Actuarial science===
[[Actuarial science]] applies probability, statistics, and economic theory to assess risk in insurance, finance and other industries and professions.

===Mathematical economics===
[[Mathematical economics]] is the application of  mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economics. The applied methods usually refer to nontrivial mathematical techniques or approaches. Mathematical economics is based on statistics, probability, mathematical programming (as well as other [[computational economics|computational methods]]), operations research, game theory, and some methods from mathematical analysis. In this regard, it resembles  (but is distinct from) [[financial mathematics]], another part of applied mathematics.

According to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC), mathematical economics falls into the [[Mathematics Subject Classification#Applied mathematics / other|Applied mathematics/other]] classification of category 91:
:Game theory, economics, social and behavioral sciences

with [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=MSC2010 MSC2010] classifications for '[[Game theory]]' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Axx 91Axx] and for 'Mathematical economics' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Bxx 91Bxx].

===Applicable mathematics===
'''Applicable mathematics''' is a subdiscipline of applied mathematics, although there is no consensus as to a precise definition.&lt;ref name=OtteEtAl/&gt; Sometimes the term "applicable mathematics" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today.

Mathematicians often distinguish between "applied mathematics" on the one hand, and the "applications of mathematics" or "applicable mathematics" both within and outside of science and engineering, on the other.&lt;ref name=OtteEtAl&gt;

Volume 2 of Mathematics Education Library; Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012. {{ISBN|9400945043}}, 9789400945043.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mathematicians emphasize the term applicable mathematics to separate or delineate the traditional applied areas from new applications arising from fields that were previously seen as pure mathematics.&lt;ref name=rektorys/&gt; For example, from this viewpoint, an ecologist or geographer using population models and applying known mathematics would not be doing applied, but rather applicable, mathematics. Even fields such as number theory that are part of pure mathematics are now important in applications (such as [[cryptography]]), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics ''per se''.

Other authors prefer describing ''applicable mathematics'' as a union of "new" mathematical applications with the traditional fields of applied mathematics.&lt;ref name=rektorys&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-sztCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=survey+of+applicable+mathematics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=applicable%20mathematics&amp;f=false Survey of Applicable Mathematics, pg xvii (Foreword). ] K. Rektorys; 2nd edition, illustrated. Springer, 2013. {{ISBN|9401583080}}, 9789401583084.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ust.hk/~mahsieh/APMATH.htm  THOUGHTS ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stellamariscollege.org/documents/icaml.pdf  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLICABLE MATHEMATICS (ICAM-2016).] The  Department  of  Mathematics,  Stella  Maris College.&lt;/ref&gt; With this outlook, the terms applied mathematics and applicable mathematics are thus interchangeable.

===Other disciplines===
The line between applied mathematics and specific areas of application is often blurred.  Many universities teach mathematical and statistical courses outside the respective departments, in departments and areas including business, [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[scientific computation]], and [[mathematical physics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3432">'''Axiomatic design''' is a [[systems design]] [[methodology]] using [[matrix methods]] to systematically analyze the transformation of customer needs into functional requirements, design parameters, and process variables.&lt;ref&gt;*Suh (1990), ''The Principles of Design'', Oxford University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-504345-6}}

*Stamatis, ''Six Sigma and Beyond: Design for Six Sigma, Volume VI'', CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57444-315-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, functional requirements (FRs) are related to design parameters (DPs):
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix} FR_1 \\ FR_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} A_{11} &amp; A_{12} \\ A_{21} &amp; A_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} DP_1 \\ DP_2 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The method gets its name from its use of design principles or design [[Axioms]] (i.e., given without proof) governing the analysis and [[decision making process]] in developing high quality product or system designs.  The two axioms used in Axiomatic Design (AD) are:

* Axiom 1: '''The Independence Axiom'''.  Maintain the independence of the functional requirements (FRs).
* Axiom 2: '''The Information Axiom'''.  Minimize the information content of the design.

Axiomatic design is considered to be a design method that addresses fundamental issues in [[Taguchi methods]].

The methodology was developed by Dr. [[Suh Nam Pyo]] at MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering since the 1990s. A series of academic conferences have been held to present current developments of the methodology. The most recent International Conference on Axiomatic Design (ICAD) was the 11th ICAD hosted in Romania in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icad.tcm.cmmi.tuiasi.ro/|title=11th ICAD|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Сreativ (painting)==
Aydar Akhatov paints pictures in different styles and genres ([[realism (arts)|realism]], [[Renaissance]], [[surrealism]], [[modernism]], [[expressionism]], [[cubism]], [[pop art]], etc.), using various techniques (oil painting, tempera, pastel, acrylic, drawing, watercolor, etc.).

In the early 21st century, Aydar Akhatov invented a new style of painting, which he called "art-sensualism" (from Lat. Sensus – perception, feeling, sensation), the meaning of which is that the result depends only on the creativity of impressions, feelings of the artist, and not by a so-called objective reality. Any particular item of reality any artist can paint their own way and this will be his only true reality at the time of the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlikor.com/page69.html Art-sensualism / Pushkin Gallery of Art Likor] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://akhatov-a.ru/index/aktualnoe_intervju/0-45 Interview with А.

The creator of the new language of painting Aydar Ahatov reveals in his paintings elusive, fleeting harmony of man and the environment.

Aydar Akhatov wrote more than 350 paintings, which are not only involved in exhibitions, but also purchased by private collectors and museums around the world (US, [[Switzerland]], Germany, Australia, Japan, Italy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://art-new.ru/ Maestro Aydar Akhatov.] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Biblical Archaeology Society''' is a non-denominational organization that supports and promotes [[biblical archaeology]]. It publishes ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''. Its past publications included ''[[Bible Review]]'' (1985–2005) and ''Archaeology Odyssey'' (1998–2006). The Biblical Archaeology Society also publishes books about biblical archaeology aimed at a general readership. The Society has, for more than 30 years, run seminars and tours offering an opportunity to learn directly from world-renowned archaeologists and scholars. It also produces videos (DVD) and CDs on archaeology and biblical archaeology.

The society was founded by [[Hershel Shanks]] in 1975 and he served as editor for 42 years, retiring at the end of 2017. Robert R. Cargill was selected to replace Shanks as editor of the Society and associated publications.

The Biblical Archaeology Society has been at the center of several controversies. 

In 1991, the Biblical Archaeology Society published ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', making the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] available to scholars around the world. Previously, access to the scrolls was limited to a small team of specialists who had been invited to translate them.

At a 2002 press conference co-hosted with the [[Discovery Channel]], the Biblical Archaeology Society announced the existence of the [[James Ossuary]]. Some critics have alleged that the ossuary, which may have once held the remains of [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], the brother of [[Jesus]], is a forgery. During the forgery trial, which lasted for several years, Shanks remained a staunch defender of the ossuary. On March 14, 2012, the defendants were acquitted of all charges of forgery because the ossuary's authenticity could not be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lorenzi, Rossella | title = Trial Does Not Settle 'Brother of Jesus' Controversy | work = Discovery News | date = March 14, 2012 | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/james-ossuary-120314.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Campus Bible Study''' (or '''CBS''') was established in 1975 at the [[University of New South Wales]] by the then [[Anglican]] chaplain [[Phillip Jensen]]. CBS celebrated its 40th Anniversary in 2015, and continues to officially operate out of UNSW's Anglican Chaplaincy (similarly, there are chaplaincy groups for Muslims, Buddhists, etc.). The current Anglican Chaplain is Carl Matthei. 

=== Overview ===
During a typical week, CBS runs large public Bible-teaching meetings, many small-group Bible studies, and other training sessions in theology and ministry for students. CBS also runs three conferences per year, the largest one being Mid-Year Conference (MYC), which typically attracts 500-750 students. While officially linked to the movement of [[Sydney Anglicans]], Campus Bible Study is [[non-denominational]] and welcomes everyone to their public meetings. CBS focuses on the [[Bible]] rather than particular denominations beliefs, and seeks to challenge individuals to consider the [[gospel]] of [[Jesus]]. 

Throughout its history, CBS has been the source of a number of innovative ministries, including the development of the [[Ministry Training Strategy]] (MTS) and the creation of [[Matthias Media]]. Campus Bible Study has also been influential in encouraging an increasing number of young people from [[Sydney]] into full-time Christian Ministry, and has been linked to the growth in enrolments at [[Moore Theological College]] through MTS.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} 

=== University Churches ===
CBS also runs five different university churches for various groups of students living in the residential colleges at UNSW. [http://www.unichurch.org.au/ Unichurch UNSW] is an English speaking congregation. The [http://www.focus-unsw.org/ Fellowship of Overseas University Students] (FOCUS) at UNSW runs four congregations for international students — Mandarin, Cantonese, Indonesian, and International. 

=== Affiliations ===
CBS should not be confused with the Christian Union (CU), which (as of 2006) was a student-run, Student-Guild-affiliated organisation. CBS and the CU work in concert to conduct ministry on campus. Most members of CU are also members of CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arcunsw.orgsync.com/org/christianunion/About|title=Christian Union UNSW|website=arcunsw.orgsync.com|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS is also affiliated with the [[Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://afes.org.au/campus/campus-bible-study-university-new-south-wales-kensington|title=Campus Bible Study &gt; University of New South Wales, Kensington {{!}} Australian Fellowship of Evangelical Students (AFES)|website=afes.org.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (AFES) but is not a member — the AFES group at UNSW is the Christian Union (CU).

'''Carolyn Ellis''' is an interdisciplinary scholar and qualitative researcher, widely regarded as an originator and developer of [[autoethnography]], a reflexive approach to research, writing, and storytelling that connects the autobiographical and personal to the cultural, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C., Adams, T., &amp; Bochner, A. (2010). Autoethnography: An Overview. Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung /Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 12(1), Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lcoastpress.com/books_author.php?id=43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holman Jones, S. (2004). Building Connections in Qualitative Research. Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner in Conversation With Stacy Holman Jones. Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung/Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 5(3), Online.&lt;/ref&gt; She is a [[Distinguished University Professor]] at the [[University of South Florida]] and an Honorary Professor at the [[Communication University of China]]. She served as President of the Society for the Study of [[Symbolic Interaction]] and is a founding member of the Ethnography Division in the [[National Communication Association]] and the Section on Emotions in the [[American Sociological Association]]. Among her publications are a documentary film, five monographs, six edited books, and more than 150 articles, book chapters, and essays on [[autoethnography]], [[ethnography]], compassionate and interactive interviewing, research ethics, death and dying, minor bodily stigmas, caregiving, intimate relationships, health and illness, and research with [[Holocaust]] survivors.&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://usf.academia.edu/CarolynEllis.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ellis was born and raised in [[Luray, Virginia]], a rural mountain community. Her mother, Katherine Ellis, was a homemaker and worked with her father, Arthur Ellis, Sr., who owned a construction company.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (2009). Revision: Autoethnographic Reflections on Life and Work. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis’s interest in ethnography began when she read [[Erving Goffman|Erving Goffman's]] (1959) Presentation of Self in Everyday Life as an undergraduate sociology major at the [[College of William and Mary]]. For her undergraduate honor’s thesis she carried out an ethnographic study of an isolated fishing community. She continued this fieldwork while she was a graduate student in sociology at [[State University of New York, Stony Brook]], where she received her Ph.D. in 1981. Her dissertation was a comparative study of two fishing villages, which was later published as Fisher Folk: Two Communities on [[Chesapeake Bay]], winning the [[Robert E. Park]] Award in 1988 for outstanding research monograph from the American Sociological Association section on Communities and [[Urban Sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Holman Jones, S. (2004). Building Connections in Qualitative Research. Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner in Conversation With Stacy Holman Jones. Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung/Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 5(3), Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;

Her childhood, hometown, and family are the focus of several of her autoethnographies, including articles about race relations in [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]],&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1995). The Other Side of the Fence: Seeing Black and White in a Small, Southern Town. Qualitative Inquiry, 1(2), 147-167.&lt;/ref&gt; caregiving for her mother,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1996). Maternal Connections. In C. Ellis &amp; A. Bochner (Eds.), Composing Ethnography: Alternative Forms of Qualitative Writing (pp. 240-243). Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (2001). With Mother/With Child: A True Story. Qualitative Inquiry, 7(5), 598-616.&lt;/ref&gt; coping with the sudden loss of her brother Rex who died in 1982 in a [[Air Florida Flight 90|commercial airplane crash]],&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (1993). ‘There Are Survivors': Telling a Story of Sudden Death. The Sociological Quarterly, 34(4), 711-730.&lt;/ref&gt; and a book chapter about long-term grief and continuing bonds with Rex.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. (2014). Seeking My Brother’s Voice: Holding onto Long-Term Grief through Photographs, Stories, and Reflections.” (Lead chapter) In Stories of Complicated Grief: A Critical Anthology, edited by Eric Miller. Washington, D. C.: NASW (National Association of Social Workers Press), pp. 3-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Ellis published Final Negotiations: A Story of Love, Loss, and Chronic Illness about a nine-year relationship with Eugene Weinstein, a sociologist who died in 1985.

== Research and Teaching ==
Ellis has established an international reputation for distinguished and continuous contributions to qualitative inquiry, particularly [[autoethnography]]. The innovative methodological approaches she has developed in the narrative study of [[subjectivity]] have been widely adopted by researchers across the human sciences and throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Holman Jones, S. (2004). Building Connections in Qualitative Research. Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner in Conversation With Stacy Holman Jones. Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung/Forum: Qualitative Social Research, 5(3). Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, K. (2008). Promise in Peril: Ellis and Pelias and the Subjective Dimensions of Ethnography, Review of Communication, 8(2), 154-173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Santoro, P., &amp; Boylorn, R. (2008). Imagining possibilities: Honoring the work of Carolyn Ellis and Art Bochner. Qualitative Inquiry, 14(2), 195-211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, C. (2013). Carolyn Ellis: Sharing a Voice through the Power of Story. In Conversations about Qualitative Communication Research: Behind the Scenes with Leading Scholars. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holman Jones, S., Adams, T., &amp; Ellis, C. (Eds.) (2013). Handbook of Autoethnography. Walnut Creek, CA: Left Coast.&lt;/ref&gt; Her research explores emotion, subjectivity, and embodiment, producing studies that encourage compassion and empathy from readers and help them understand how to cope with life’s stresses and struggles. She has organized two international conferences, participated in many panel and paper sessions, and given keynote presentations and workshops in sixteen countries. Numerous special issues of journals, review symposia, documentaries and conference sessions have featured her work, some of which has been translated into Chinese, Spanish, and Polish.&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis spent the first sixteen years of her academic career in the Department of Sociology at the University of South Florida before moving to the Department of Communication in 1996. In 1990, she became co-director of the Institute for Interpretive Human Studies at USF, a position she held until 2012. In 1996, she and [[Art Bochner]] co-edited Composing Ethnography: Alternative Forms of Qualitative Writing, a book widely recognized as the first volume to promote forms of autoethnographic inquiry designed to bridge humanities and social science research. Ellis and [[Art Bochner|Bochner]] teamed up as editors of two book series emphasizing [[autoethnography]] and personal narrative, which have yielded more than thirty books representing evocative and novel forms of representing lived experience, bringing conscious attention to emotions, subjectivity, embodiment, and personal storytelling.

In 2000, Ellis and [[Art Bochner|Bochner]] published the handbook chapter, “Autoethnography, Personal Narrative, Reflexivity: Researcher as Subject,” in The Handbook of Qualitative Research. The chapter has been cited in more than 3,000 academic texts.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10785170855687010850&amp;as_sdt=800005&amp;sciodt=1,15&amp;hl=en.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[National Communication Association|NCA]] awarded Ellis and Bochner the Charles H. Woolbert Award for this chapter, which has “stood the test of time.”

In 2002, “With Mother/With Child: A True Story” was awarded a Distinguished Publication Award by the NCA Ethnography Division. The article details a day of interaction with Ellis’s aging mother as Ellis assists her in the nightly routine of preparing for bed. The surrounding frame describes her reading this personal story to her mother and probes methodological and ethical issues in writing about intimate others.

In 2005, The Ethnographic I: A Methodological Novel about Autoethnography was awarded the Best Book Award by the NCA Ethnography Division. Ellis published Revision: Autoethnographic Reflections on Life and Work in 2009, which adds the component of meta-autoethnography, layering new interpretations, reflections, and vignettes to her older work. The book received the [[Charles H. Cooley]] Best Book Award from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction and the Best Book Award from the International Center for Qualitative Inquiry.

Ellis received the Lifetime Achievement Award in Qualitative Inquiry from the International Center for Qualitative Inquiry in 2012, and a Legacy Lifetime Award from the NCA Ethnography Division in 2013. The Handbook of Autoethnography, co-authored with Stacy Holman Jones and Tony Adams, received the Best Edited Collection award from the NCA Ethnography Division in 2013. That same year she chaired the Department of Communication at the University of South Florida and was named a Distinguished Professor at the university.&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis also has extended the autoethnographic approach to the study of Holocaust survivors and their testimonies, focusing on the healing power of personal storytelling, and the development of compassionate, collaborative approaches to research with survivors of trauma and genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. &amp; Rawicki, J. (2013). Collaborative Witnessing of Survival during the Holocaust: An Exemplar of Relational Autoethnography, Qualitative Inquiry, 19, 366-380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, C. &amp; Patti, C. (2014). With Heart: Compassionate Interviewing and Storytelling with Holocaust Survivors. Storytelling, Self, Society, 10, 389-414.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her numerous teaching honors include the University of South Florida Outstanding Undergraduate University Teaching Awards, the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction Feminist Mentor Award, and the McKnight Foundation’s William R. Jones Award for mentoring African American and Hispanic graduate students. Ellis has inaugurated and taught several undergraduate and graduate courses at the University of South Florida, including: Autoethnography; Writing Lives; Personal Storytelling; Communicating Illness, Grief, and Loss; Emotions, Trauma, and Intimate Interviewing; and Race, Class, and Emotions.&lt;ref&gt;http://communication.usf.edu/faculty/cellis/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[plant morphology]], a '''cataphyll''' (sometimes also called a '''''cataphyllum''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Stearn, W.T. |year=1992  |title=Botanical Latin: History, grammar, syntax, terminology and vocabulary |edition=4th |publisher=David and Charles |isbn=0-7153-0052-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''cataphyll leaf'''&lt;ref name="BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co.

Cataphylls include [[bract]]s, [[bracteole]]s, and [[bud]] scales, as well as any small leaves that resemble [[Scale (anatomy)|scales]], which are known as '''scale leaves'''.&lt;ref name=Hickey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beentje/&gt; Some cataphylls have a primary function other than photosynthesis. The functions of cataphylls such as bud scales may be short-lived and they are often shed after the need for them is past.

==Etymology==
From the Greek {{Lang-grc|κατά}}, down, {{Lang-grc|φύλλον}}, leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cataphyll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of cataphylls==
Some kinds of cataphylls perform a transient function, after which they die and may be shed. Those that are shed early are said to be [[Glossary of botanical terms#caducous|caducous]], but that term can apply to any organ that is shed early, not only leaves; for example, many ''[[Geranium]]s'' have caducous stamens. The [[sepal]]s of ''[[Papaver]]'' species are shed during the very opening of the petals, and as such they are a dramatic example of caducous leaves. Many other forms of cataphylls, such as some [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]], are [[Glossary of botanical terms#persistent|persistent]], but cannot perform their major function until they die, whether they physically get shed or not. Examples of various kinds of cataphylls include [[Bud|bud-scales]], [[Bulb|bulb-scales]], [[Corm|corm-scales]], [[Rhizome|rhizome-scales]], [[cotyledon]]s, scaly [[bract]]s, spines.&lt;ref name="BotGloss"/&gt; Each of these occurs in various forms and contexts; for example, bud-scales occur on various kinds of leaf or branch buds as well as on flower buds.

Protective masses of dead leaves encircle the stems of some species of [[Arecaceae|palm trees]] or ''[[aloe]]s'', but those are not usually regarded as cataphylls because their primary function while alive was photosynthesis, as is usual for true leaves.

===Cotyledons as cataphylls===
[[File:Acer pseudoplatanus cotyledons.JPG|left|thumb|''Acer pseudoplatanus'' seedling showing cotyledons that supplied the first photosynthetic function for the growing plant. They will soon drop off after the young leaves grow large enough to take over.]]

[[Cotyledon]]s are widely regarded as a class of cataphyll,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} though many kinds of cotyledon function as living tissue and remain alive till the end of their function at least, at which time they wither and may drop off. They begin as leaf rudiments and many kinds accumulate nutrient materials for storage, starting to give up their stored material as the plant begins to germinate. Some, such as the [[cotyledon]]s of many [[legume]]s, [[Pinophyta|conifers]], and [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbits]], even develop chlorophyll and perform the first photosynthesis for the germinating plant.

===[[Thorns, spines, and prickles|Spine]]s as cataphylls===
{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}
[[File:Opuntia compressa - close-up (aka).jpg|left|thumb|''Opuntia compressa'', showing a so-called spiny cactus. Each [[areole]] contains one or more fixed, large spines as well as a sheaf of glochidia. The spines are examples of cataphylls.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}]]
It also is a matter of context and preference whether one regards any particular kind of [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spine]] as a cataphyll or not.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The terminology for [[glochid]]s in particular is confusing, as they are variously and arbitrarily referred to as spines, bristles and more. Morphologically only ''[[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spine]]s'' could strictly speaking be cataphylls, because the others are not leaves, but in the current context the point is hardly worth pursuing.

===[[Corm]]-scales===
[[File:CrocosmiaCormTunic5601s.jpg|left|thumb|Crocosmia corm with tunic stripped partly off to show its constitution of the basal parts of leaves arising from nodes on the corm. Such leaves, especially early leaves that never performed much photosynthesis, amount to true cataphylls]]
[[File:CormAnatomy5686.jpg|thumb|Corm of Crocosmia, split to show tunic and leaves, as well as a new corm growing from a bud on the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] of the old corm]]
Like bulb-scales, corm-scales are largely the basal parts of the photosynthetic leaves that show above ground. Some species of cormous plants, such as some ''[[Lapeirousia]]s'' also produce cataphyllous leaves that act as practically nothing more than tunic leaves for the corm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Goldblatt, Peter |author2=Manning, John | title = The Iris Family | publisher = Timber Press | location = Portland | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-88192-897-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike bulb-scales however, the corm tunic has no significant storage function; that task is left to the [[parenchyma]] of the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] of the corm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24504">[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|right|Coexistence theory attempts to explain the [[paradox of the plankton]] -- how can ecologically similar species coexist without [[competitive exclusion|competitively excluding]] each other?]]

'''Coexistence theory''' is a framework to understand how competitor traits can maintain [[species diversity]] and stave-off [[competitive exclusion]] even among [[Guild (ecology)|similar species]] living in ecologically similar environments. Coexistence theory explains the stable coexistence of species as an interaction between two opposing forces: [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] differences between species, which should drive the best-adapted species to exclude others within a particular [[ecological niche]], and stabilizing mechanisms, which maintains diversity via [[niche differentiation]]. For many species to be stabilized in a community, population growth must be negative [[density-dependent inhibition|density-dependent]], i.e. all participating species have a tendency to increase in density as their populations decline. In such communities, any species that becomes rare will experience positive growth, pushing its population to recover and making local extinction unlikely. As the population of one species declines, individuals of that species tend to compete predominantly with individuals of other species. Thus, the tendency of a population to recover as it declines in density reflects reduced [[interspecific competition]] (between-species) relative to [[intraspecific competition]] (within-species), the signature of [[niche differentiation]] (see [[competitive Lotka-Volterra equations|Lotka-Volterra competition]]).

==Types of coexistence mechanisms==
Two qualitatively different processes can help species to coexist: a reduction in average [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] between species or an increase in [[niche differentiation]] between species. These two factors have been termed equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity|last = Chesson|first = Peter|journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|doi = 10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.31.1.343|pmid = |access-date = |issue = |year = 2000|volume = 31|pages = 343–366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Equalizing mechanisms'' reduce fitness differences between species, or relative competitive ability in the absence of niche differentiation. As its name implies, it works by making similar species more equal in their competitive ability. For example, when multiple species compete for the same resource, competitive ability is determined by the minimum level of resources a species needs to maintain itself (known as an R*, or [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] resource density).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Resources: A Graphical-Mechanistic Approach to Competition and Predation|journal = The American Naturalist|date = 1980-09-01|pages = 362–393|volume = 116|issue = 3|first = David|last = Tilman|doi=10.1086/283633|jstor=2463311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the species with the lowest R* is the best competitor and excludes all other species in the absence of any niche differentiation. Any factor that reduces R*s between species (like increased harvest of the dominant competitor) is classified as an equalizing mechanism. For species to coexist, fitness differences must be overcome by stabilizing mechanisms.
#''Stabilizing mechanisms'' promote coexistence by concentrating [[intraspecific competition]] relative to [[interspecific competition]]. There are large number of named stabilizing mechanisms including classical hypotheses of species coexistence. [[Resource partitioning]], whereby interspecific competition is reduced because species compete primarily through different resources, is a stabilizing mechanism. Similarly, if species are differently affected by environmental variation (e.g., soil type, rainfall timing, etc.), this can create a stabilizing mechanism (see [[Storage effect|the storage effect]]). Stabilizing mechanisms increase the low-density growth rate of all species.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A general way of measuring the effect of stabilizing mechanisms is by calculating the [[Population growth rate|growth rate]] of species ''i'' in a community as&lt;ref name="Chesson2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesson |first=Peter

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\hat{r_i} = b_i ( k_i - \hat{k} + A )&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:*&lt;math&gt;\hat{r_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the long-term average growth rate of the species ''i'' when at low density. Because species are limited from growing indefinitely, viable populations have an average long-term growth rate of zero. Therefore, species at low-density can increase in abundance when their long-term average growth rate is positive. 
:*&lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; is a species-specific factor that reflects how quickly species ''i'' responds to a change in competition. For example, species with faster generation times may respond more quickly to a change in resource density than longer lived species. In an extreme scenario, if ants and elephants were to compete for the same resources, elephant population sizes would change much more slowly to changes in resource density than would ant populations.
:*&lt;math&gt;k_i - \hat{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the fitness of species ''i'' when compared to the average fitness of the community excluding species ''i''. In the absence of any stabilizing mechanisms, species ''i'' will only have a positive growth rate if its fitness is above its average competitor, i.e. where this value is greater than zero.
:*&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; measures the effect of all stabilizing mechanisms acting within this community.

=== Example calculation: Species competing for resource ===
{{technical| section|date=June 2017}}  
In 2008 Chesson and Kuang showed how to calculate fitness differences and stabilizing mechanisms when species compete for shared resources and competitors. Each species ''j'' captures resource type ''l'' at a species-specific rate, ''c&lt;sub&gt;jl&lt;/sub&gt;.'' Each unit of resource captured contributes to species growth by value ''v&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;''. Each consumer requires resources for the metabolic maintenance at rate ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The interaction between predation and competition|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature07248|journal = Nature|date = 2008-01-01|volume = 456|issue = 7219|doi = 10.1038/nature07248|first = Peter|last = Chesson|first2 = Jessica J.|last2 = Kuang|pmid=19005554|pages=235–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction, consumer growth is decreased by attack from predators. Each predator species ''m'' attacks species ''j'' at rate ''a&lt;sub&gt;jm&lt;/sub&gt;.''

Given predation and resource capture, the density of species ''i'', ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,'' grows at rate

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{N_j}\frac{dN_j}{dt} = \sum_l c_{jl}v_lR_l - \sum_m a_{jm}P_m - \mu_j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''l'' sums over resource types and ''m'' sums over all predator species. Each resource type exhibits logistic growth with intrinsic rate of increase, ''r&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'', and carrying capacity, ''K&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/α&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'', such that growth rate of resource ''l'' is

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R_l}\frac{dR_l}{dt} = r^R_l \left( 1-\alpha^R_lR_l \right) - \sum_jc_{jl}N_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, each predator species ''m'' exhibits logistic growth in the absence of the prey of interest with intrinsic growth rate ''r&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' and carrying capacity ''K''&lt;sup&gt;''P''&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/α&lt;sup&gt;P&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.'' The growth rate of a predator species is also increased by consuming prey species where again the attack rate of predator species m on prey ''j'' is ''a&lt;sub&gt;jm&lt;/sub&gt;''. Each unit of prey has a value to predator growth rate of ''w.'' Given these two sources of predator growth, the density of predator ''m'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', has a per-capita growth rate

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{P_m}\frac{dP_m}{dt}=r^P_m(1-\alpha^P_mP_m) + \sum_j wN_ja_{jm}&lt;/math&gt;

where the summation terms is contributions to growth from consumption over all ''j'' focal species. The system of equations describes a model of trophic interactions between three sets of species: focal species, their resources, and their predators.

Given this model, the average fitness of a species ''j'' is

&lt;math&gt;k_j = \frac{1}{b_j}\left(\sum_{l=1} c_{jl} v_l K^R_l - \sum_m a_{jm}K^P_m - \mu_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the sensitivity to competition and predation is

&lt;math&gt;b_j = \sqrt{\left( \sum_l \frac{c^2_{jl}v_lK_l^R}{r^R_l} + \sum_m \frac{a^2_{jm}wK^P_m}{r^P_m} \right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The average fitness of a species takes into account growth based on resource capture and predation as well as how much resource and predator densities change from interactions with the focal species.

The amount of niche overlap between two competitors ''i'' and ''j'' is

&lt;math&gt;\rho = \left(\sum_l \frac{c_{il}v_lc_{jl}}{\alpha_l^Rr^R_l} + \sum_m \frac{a_{im}wa_{jm}}{\alpha_m^Pr^P_m}\right)/b_ib_j,&lt;/math&gt;

which represents the amount to which [[resource consumption]] and predator attack are linearly related between two competing species, ''i'' and ''j''.

This model  conditions for coexistence can be directly related to the general coexistence criterion: intraspecific competition, ''α&lt;sub&gt;jj&lt;/sub&gt;,'' must be greater than interspecific competition, ''α&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;.'' The direct expressions for intraspecific and interspecific competition coefficients from the interaction between shared predators and resources are

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{jj} = s_j/k_j&lt;/math&gt;

and

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{ij} = \rho s_j/k_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, when intraspecific competition is greater than interspecific competition,

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{jj} &gt; \alpha_{ij} = \frac{s_j}{k_j} &gt; \rho \frac{s_j}{k_i}&lt;/math&gt;

which, for two species leads to the coexistence criteria

&lt;math&gt;\rho &lt; \frac{k_1}{k_2} &lt; \frac{1}{\rho}.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that, in the absence of any niche differences (i.e. ''ρ'' = 1), species cannot coexist.

==Stabilizing mechanisms==
In 1994, Chesson proposed that all stabilizing mechanisms could be categorized into four categories.&lt;ref name="Chesson2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.2000.1486| title = General Theory of Competitive Coexistence in Spatially-Varying Environments| journal = Theoretical Population Biology| volume = 58| issue = 3| pages = 211–37| year = 2000| last1 = Chesson | first1 = P. | pmid=11120650}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesson1994&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|title=Multispecies Competition in Variable Environments|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=June 1994|volume=45|issue=3|pages=227–276|doi=10.1006/Tpbi.1994.1013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible for all four to operate in any environment at a given time.

# ''Variation-independent mechanisms'' (also called ''fluctuation-independent mechanisms'') are any stabilizing mechanism that functions within a local place and time.&lt;ref name=Chesson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesson1994 /&gt; [[Niche differentiation#Types of niche differentiation|Resource partitioning]], [[Niche differentiation#Types of niche differentiation|predator partitioning]], and [[prey switching|frequency-dependent predation]] are three classic examples of variation-independent mechanisms. When a species is at very low density, individuals gain an advantage, because they are less constrained by competition across the landscape. For example, under frequency-dependent predation, a species is less likely to be consumed by predators when they are very rare.
# The ''[[storage effect]]'' occurs when species are affected differently by environmental variation in space or time.&lt;ref name=Chesson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesson1994 /&gt; For example, coral reef fishes have different reproductive rates in different years, plants grow differently in different soil types, and desert annual plants germinate at different rates in different years. When a species is at low density, individuals gain an advantage because they experience less competition in times or locations that they grow best. For example, if annual plants germinate in different years, then when it is a good year to germinate, species will be competing predominately with members of the same species. Thus, if a species becomes rare, individuals will experience little competition when they germinate whereas they would experience high competition if they were abundant. For the storage effect to function, species must be able to "store" the benefits of a productive time period or area, and use it to survive during less productive times or areas.&lt;ref name=Chesson&amp;Warner1981&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter|last2=Warner|first2=Robert|title=Environmental Variability Promotes Coexistence in Lottery Competitive Systems|journal=The American Naturalist|date=1981|volume=117|issue=6|pages=923–943|doi=10.1086/283778}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur, for example, if species have a long-lived adult stage, a seed bank or diapause stage, or if they are spread out over the environment.
# A ''[[fitness-density covariance]]'' occurs when species are spread out non-uniformly across the landscape.&lt;ref name=Chesson2000 /&gt; Most often, it occurs when species are found in different areas. For example, mosquitoes often lay eggs in different locations, and plants who [[habitat partitioning|partition habitat]] are often found predominately where they grow best. Species can gain two possible advantages by becoming very rare. First, because they are physically separated from other species, they mainly compete with members of the same species (and thus experience less competition when they become very rare). Second, species are often more able to concentrate in favorable habitat as their densities decline. For example, if individuals are territorial, then members of an abundant species may not have access to ideal habitat; however, when that species becomes very rare, then there may be enough ideal habitat for all of the few remaining individuals.
# ''[[Relative nonlinearity]]'' occurs when species benefit in different ways from variation in competitive factors.&lt;ref name=Chesson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chesson1994 /&gt; For example, two species might coexist if one can grows better when resources are rare, and the other grows better when resources are abundant. Species will be able to coexist if the species which benefits from variation in resources tends to reduce variation in resources. For example, a species which can rapidly consume excess resources tends to quickly reduce the level of excess resources favoring the other species, whereas a species which grows better when resources are rare is more likely to cause fluctuations in resource density favoring the other species.&lt;ref name=Armstrong&amp;McGehee1980&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Robert A.|last2=McGehee|first2=Richard|title=Competitive Exclusion|journal=The American Naturalist|date=February 1980|volume=115|issue=2|pages=151–170|doi=10.1086/283553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical evidence==
A 2012 study&lt;ref name="HilleRisLambers2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110411-160411| title = Rethinking Community Assembly through the Lens of Coexistence Theory| journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics| volume = 43| pages = 227–248| year = 2012| last1 = HilleRisLambers | first1 = J.| last2 = Adler | first2 = P.

M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed different approaches which tested coexistence theory, and identified three main ways to separate the contributions of stabilizing niche and relative fitness differences within a community. These are:

# '''Experimental manipulations''', which involved determining the effect of relative fitness or stabilizing mechanisms by manipulating resources or competitive advantages.
# '''Trait-Phylogeny-Environment relationships''', in which the phylogeny of members of a set of communities can be tested for evidence of trait clustering, which would suggest that certain traits are important (and perhaps necessary) to thrive in that environment, or trait [[overdispersion]], which would suggest a high ability of species to exclude close relatives. Such tests have been widely used, although they have also been criticized as simplistic and flawed.&lt;ref name="Mayfield2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01509.x| title = Opposing effects of competitive exclusion on the phylogenetic structure of communities| journal = Ecology Letters| volume = 13| issue = 9| pages = 1085–93| year = 2010| last1 = Mayfield | first1 = M. M. | last2 = Levine | first2 = J. M. | pmid=20576030}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Demographic analyses''', which can be used to recognize frequency- or density-dependent processes simply by measuring the number and per-capita growth rates of species in natural communities over time. If such processes are operating, the per-capita growth rate would vary with the number of individuals in species comprising the community.

A 2010 review&lt;ref name=Seipielski&amp;McPeek2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seipielski|first1=Adam|last2=McPeek|first2=Mark|title=On the evidence for species coexistence: A critique of the coexistence program|journal=Ecology|date=2010|volume=91|issue=11|pages=3153–3164|doi = 10.1890/10-0154.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that an ''invasion analysis'' should be used as the critical test of coexistence. In an invasion analysis, one species (termed the "invader") is removed from the community, and then reintroduced at a very low density. If the invader shows positive population growth, then it cannot be excluded from the community. If every species has a positive growth rate as an invader, then those species can stably coexist. An invasion analysis could be performed using experimental manipulation, or by parameterizing a mathematical model. The authors argued that in the absence of a full-scale invasion analysis, studies could show some evidence for coexistence by showing that a trade-off produced negative density-dependence at the population level. The authors reviewed 323 papers (from 1972 to May 2009), and claimed that only 10 of them met the above criteria (7 performing an invasion analysis, and 3 showing some negative-density dependence).

However, an important caveat is that invasion analysis may not always be sufficient for identifying stable coexistence. For example, [[priority effect]]s or [[Allee effect]]s may prevent species from successfully invading a community from low density even if they could persist stably at a higher density. Conversely, high order interactions in communities with many species can lead to complex dynamics following an initially successful invasion, potentially preventing the invader from persisting stably in the long term.&lt;ref name=Levine2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=Jonathan|last2=Bascompte|first2=Jordi|last3=Adler|first3=Peter|last4=Allesina|first4=Stefano|title=Beyond pairwise mechanisms of species coexistence in complex communities|journal=Nature|date=2017|volume=546|issue=7656|pages=56–64|doi = 10.1038/nature22898}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an invader that can only persist when a particular resident species is present at high density could alter community structure following invasion such that that resident species' density declines or that it goes locally extinct, thereby preventing the invader from successfully establishing in the long term.

The 2008 [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|Neutral theory]] by [[Stephen Hubbell]]&lt;ref name=hubbell2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbell|first1=Stephen P.|title=The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and Biogeography (MPB-32)|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400837526}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to model biodiversity through a migration-speciation-extinction balance, rather through selection.&lt;ref name=vellend2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vellend|first1=Mark|title=Conceptual synthesis in community ecology|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|date=2010|volume=85|issue=2|pages=183–206|doi=10.1086/652373}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that all members within a [[Guild (ecology)|guild]] are inherently the same, and that changes in population density are a result of random births and deaths. Particular species are lost [[stochastic]]ally through a [[random walk]] process, but species richness is maintained via [[speciation]] or external migration. Neutral theory can be seen as a particular case of coexistence theory: it represents an environment where stabilizing mechanisms are absent (i.e., &lt;math&gt;A = 0&lt;/math&gt;), and there are no differences in average fitness (i.e., &lt;math&gt;k_i - \hat{k} = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all species).&lt;ref name=Adler_etal_2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=Peter B.|last2=HilleRisLambers|first2=Janneke|last3=Levine|first3=Jonathan M.|title=A niche for neutrality|journal=Ecology Letters|date=February 2007|volume=10|issue=2|pages=95–104|doi=10.1111/J.1461-0248.2006.00996.X|url=https://zenodo.org/record/851708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hotly debated how close real communities are to neutrality. Few studies have attempted to measure fitness differences and stabilizing mechanisms in plant communities, for example in 2009&lt;ref name=Levine_etal2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=HilleRisLambers|first2=Janneke|title=The importance of niches for the maintenance of species diversity|journal=Nature|date=12 August 2009|volume=461|issue=7261|pages=254–257|doi=10.1038/Nature08251}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in 2015 &lt;ref name=Chu_etal_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chu|first1=Chengjin|last2=Adler|first2=Peter B.|title=Large niche differences emerge at the recruitment stage to stabilize grassland coexistence|journal=Ecological Monographs|date=August 2015|volume=85|issue=3|pages=373–392|doi=10.1890/14-1741.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These communities appear to be far from neutral, and in some cases,stabilizing effects greatly outweigh fitness differences.

==Cultural coexistence theory==

Cultural Coexistence Theory (CCT), also called [[Socio-ecological system|Social-ecological]] Coexistence Theory, expands on coexistence theory to explain how groups of people with shared interests in natural resources (e.g., a fishery) can come to coexist sustainably.&lt;ref name=Loring2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loring|first1=Philip A.|title=Toward a Theory of Coexistence in Shared Social-ecological Systems: The Case of Cook Inlet Salmon Fisheries|journal=Human Ecology|date=23 January 2016|volume=44|issue=2|pages=153–165|doi=10.1007/s10745-016-9806-0|pmc=4832003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Coexistence Theory draws on work by anthropologists such as Frederik Barth and [[Environmental anthropology#Transformations|John Bennett]], both of whom studied the interactions among culture groups on shared landscapes. In addition to the core ecological concepts described above, which CCT summarizes as limited similarity, limited competition, and resilience, CCT argues the following features are essential for cultural coexistence:

# ''[[Adaptability]]'' describes the ability of people to respond to change or surprise. It is essential to CCT because it helps capture the importance of human agency.
# ''[[Cultural pluralism|Pluralism]]'' describes where people value cultural diversity and recognize the fundamental rights of people not like them to live in the same places and access shared resources.
# ''[[Equity (economics)|Equity]]'' as used in CCT describes whether social institutions exist that ensure that people's basic human rights, including the ability to meet basic needs, are protected, and whether people are protected from being marginalized in society.

Cultural Coexistence Theory fits in under the broader area of [[sustainability science]], [[common pool resources]] theory, and [[conflict theory]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; forming the [[inferior vena cava]].  They drain [[blood]] from the [[pelvis]] and lower limbs.

Both common iliac veins are accompanied along their course by [[common iliac artery|common iliac arteries]].

==Structure==
The [[external iliac vein]] and [[internal iliac vein]] unite in front of the sacroiliac joint to form the common iliac veins.&lt;ref name="Lasts2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ihGmxzamekC|title=Last's Anatomy: Regional and Applied|author=Sinnatamby|first=Chummy S.|publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier|year=2011|isbn=0-7020-4839-9|edition=12th|location=|pages=277|chapter=5|place=Great Britain|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both common iliac veins ascend to form the inferior vena cava behind the right common iliac artery at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozes|first1=Geza|last2=Gloviczki|first2=Peter|editor=John J. Bergan &amp; Nisha Bunke-Paquette|others=|title=The Vein Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0SeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|edition=2nd|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|place=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539963-9|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vena cava is to the right of the midline and therefore the left common iliac vein is longer than the right.&lt;ref name="Lasts2011"/&gt; The left common iliac vein occasionally travels upwards to the left of the [[aorta]] to the level of the [[kidney]], where it receives the left [[renal vein]] and crosses in front of the aorta to join the inferior vena cava.&lt;ref name=":Gray2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7FVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1228|title=Gray's Anatomy: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice|last=Delancey|first=John O.L.|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|isbn=978-0-7020-6851-5|editor=Standring|editor-first=Susan|edition=41st|location=|pages=1221–1236|chapter=73, True pelvis, pelvic floor and perineum|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right common iliac vein is virtually vertical and lies behind and then lateral to its artery. Each common iliac vein receives [[iliolumbar vein]]s, while the left also receives the [[median sacral vein]] which lies on the right of the corresponding artery.&lt;ref name="Lasts2011"/&gt;

==Clinical significance==
Overlying arterial structures may cause compression of the upper part of the left common iliac vein.&lt;ref name="BerganBunke-Paquette2014"/&gt;

Compression of the left common iliac vein against the fifth lumbar vertebral body by the right common iliac artery as the artery crosses in front of it traditionally happens in [[May-Thurner Syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Chaar2017"&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeRubertis|first1=Brian|last2=Patel|first2=Rhasheet|editor=Cassius Iyad Ochoa Chaar|title=Current Management of Venous Diseases|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G2dCDwAAQBAJ|accessdate=24 March 2018|year=2017|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-65226-9|pages=464–465|chapter=35, May-Thurner Syndrome: Diagnosis and Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuous [[pulse|pulsation]] of the common iliac artery may trigger an [[inflammatory response]] within the common iliac vein. The resulting intraluminal [[elastin]] and [[collagen]] deposition can cause intimal [[fibrosis]] and the formation of venous spurs and webs. This can lead to narrowing of the vein and cause persistent unilateral leg swelling, contributing to [[venous thromboembolism]].&lt;ref name="Chaar2017"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1737">'''Community development planning''' consists of a public participatory and usually interactive form of [[town]] or [[neighborhood]] planning and design in which diverse community members (often termed “stakeholders”) contribute toward formulation of the goals, objectives, planning, [[Funding|fund]]/[[resource]] identification and direction, planned project [[implementation]]s and re[[evaluation]] of documented local planning policy. It is a logical “bottom-up” evolution of (formerly “top-down”) [[region]]al, [[city]] and urban planning in an era of plateaued or diminishing public resources, increasing local burdens and responsibilities and [[public activism]]. It often promotes [[public/private partnership]] as a means to harness physical development activities in support of community-defined goals.&lt;ref&gt;The Practice of Local Government Planning, 2nd Edition (the "Green Book"). 1979. International City Management Association. Washington, DC. Pages 62 and 553-599.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, it seeks community consensus for proposed allocations of scarce resources among competing demands. In more vigorous application, community members access a full gamut of planning tools, shaping and being shaped by shared understanding of a complex community information base, directly informing and guiding local plan content, influencing resulting development budgets, projects and thus future [[infrastructure]] and land uses, as well as helping coordinate the work of overlapping [[jurisdiction]]s, levels of [[government]], internal and adjacent communities and various providers, such as [[Chamber of commerce|business associations]], [[utilities]] and [[school]]s.

'''Condensed matter physics''' is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of matter. In particular it is concerned with the "condensed" phases that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong. The most familiar examples of condensed phases are solids and liquids, which arise from the electromagnetic forces between atoms. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using [[physical law]]s. In particular, they include the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[statistical mechanics]].

The most familiar condensed phases are [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s while more exotic condensed phases include the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by certain materials at low [[temperature]], the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice]]s of atoms, and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] found in [[ultracold atom]]ic systems. The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of [[theoretical physics]] to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.

The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics: one third of all [[People of the United States|American]] physicists self-identify as condensed matter physicists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327141400/http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-date= 2009-03-27 |website=Physics Today Jobs|title= Condensed Matter Physics Jobs: Careers in Condensed Matter Physics| access-date= 2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Division of Condensed Matter Physics is the largest division at the [[American Physical Society]].&lt;ref name=aps-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Condensed Matter Physics|url=http://www.aps.org/units/dcmp/history.cfm|publisher=American Physical Society|access-date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field overlaps with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], and [[nanotechnology]], and relates closely to [[atomic physics]] and [[biophysics]]. The [[theoretical physics]] of condensed matter shares important concepts and methods with that of [[particle physics]] and [[nuclear physics]].&lt;ref name=marvincohen2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Marvin L.|title=Essay: Fifty Years of Condensed Matter Physics|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=2008|volume=101|issue=25|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.250001|url=http://prl.aps.org/edannounce/PhysRevLett.101.250001|access-date=31 March 2012|bibcode= 2008PhRvL.101y0001C|pmid=19113681|page=250001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of topics in physics such as [[crystallography]], [[metallurgy]], [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[magnetism]], etc., were treated as distinct areas until the 1940s, when they were grouped together as ''[[solid state physics]]''. Around the 1960s, the study of physical properties of [[liquid]]s was added to this list, forming the basis for the new, related specialty of condensed matter physics.&lt;ref name=rmp /&gt; According to physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson]], the term was coined by him and [[Volker Heine]], when they changed the name of their group at the [[Cavendish Laboratories]], [[Cambridge]] from ''Solid state theory'' to ''Theory of Condensed Matter'' in 1967,&lt;ref name=pwa-princeton&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Anderson|url=http://www.princeton.edu/physics/people/display_person.xml?netid=pwa&amp;display=faculty|website=Department of Physics|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids, [[nuclear matter]], and so on.&lt;ref name=wsn&gt;{{cite journal|title=More and Different|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/newsletter/newsletter/nov11n33p02.shtml|journal=World Scientific Newsletter|date=November 2011|volume=33 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Anderson and Heine helped popularize the name "condensed matter", it had been present in Europe for some years, most prominently in the form of a journal published in English, French, and German by Springer-Verlag titled ''Physics of Condensed Matter'', which was launched in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTsgAAAAIAAJ|title=''Physics of Condensed Matter''|volume=1|access-date=20 April 2015|year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding environment and Cold War politics of the 1960s and 1970s were also factors that lead some physicists to prefer the name "condensed matter physics", which emphasized the commonality of scientific problems encountered by physicists working on solids, liquids, plasmas, and other complex matter, over "solid state physics", which was often associated with the industrial applications of metals and semiconductors.&lt;ref name=martin-pip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change?

References to "condensed" state can be traced to earlier sources. For example, in the introduction to his 1947 book ''Kinetic Theory of Liquids'',&lt;ref name=Frenkel&gt;{{cite book|last=Frenkel|first=J.|title=Kinetic Theory of Liquids|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yakov Frenkel]] proposed that "The kinetic theory of liquids must accordingly be developed as a generalization and extension of the kinetic theory of solid bodies. As a matter of fact, it would be more correct to unify them under the title of 'condensed bodies'".

One of the first studies of condensed states of matter was by [[People of England|English]] [[chemist]] [[Humphry Davy]], in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Davy observed that of the forty [[chemical element]]s known at the time, twenty-six had [[metal]]lic properties such as [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]], [[ductility]] and high electrical and thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name=goodstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodstein|first=David|author1-link=David Goodstein|last2=Goodstein|first2=Judith|author2-link=Judith R.

Davy further claimed that elements that were then believed to be gases, such as [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] could be liquefied under the right conditions and would then behave as metals.&lt;ref name=davy-1839&gt;{{cite book|last=Davy|first=John (ed.)|title=The collected works of Sir Humphry Davy: Vol. II|year=1839|publisher=Smith Elder &amp; Co., Cornhill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6WNKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Both hydrogen and nitrogen have since been liquified, however ordinary liquid nitrogen and hydrogen do not possess metallic properties.

In 1823, [[Michael Faraday]], then an assistant in Davy's lab, successfully liquefied [[chlorine]] and went on to liquefy all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, hydrogen, and [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt; Shortly after, in 1869, [[People of Ireland|Irish]] chemist [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]] studied the [[phase transition]] from a liquid to a gas and coined the term [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases,&lt;ref name=thomasandrews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowlinson|first=J.

===Advent of quantum mechanics===
Drude's classical model was augmented by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], [[Felix Bloch]] and other physicists.  Pauli realized that the free electrons in metal must obey the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].  Using this idea, he developed the theory of [[paramagnetism]] in 1926.  Shortly after, Sommerfeld incorporated the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] into the free electron model and made it better able to explain the heat capacity.  Two years later, Bloch used [[quantum mechanics]] to describe the motion of a quantum electron in a periodic lattice.&lt;ref name=Kragh2002/&gt;{{rp|366–368}} The mathematics of crystal structures developed by [[Auguste Bravais]], [[Yevgraf Fyodorov]] and others was used to classify crystals by their [[symmetry group]], and tables of crystal structures were the basis for the series ''International Tables of Crystallography'', first published in 1935.&lt;ref name=Aroyo-2006&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aroyo|first=Mois, I. |author2=Müller, Ulrich |author3=Wondratschek, Hans |title=Historical introduction|year=2006|volume=A|pages=2–5|doi=10.1107/97809553602060000537|series=International Tables for Crystallography|isbn=978-1-4020-2355-2|url=http://www.european-arachnology.org/proceedings/19th/Lourenco.PDF|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.4170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Band theory|Band structure calculations]] was first used in 1930 to predict the properties of new materials, and in 1947 [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]] and [[William Shockley]] developed the first [[semiconductor]]-based [[transistor]], heralding a revolution in electronics.&lt;ref name=marvincohen2008 /&gt;

The Sommerfeld model and spin models for ferromagnetism illustrated the successful application of quantum mechanics to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of [[superconductivity]] and the [[Kondo effect]].&lt;ref name=Coleman-2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=Piers|title=Many-Body Physics: Unfinished Revolution|journal=Annales Henri Poincaré|year=2003|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s00023-003-0943-9|arxiv=cond-mat/0307004|bibcode= 2003AnHP....4..559C|pages=559–580|citeseerx=10.1.1.242.6214}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of [[collective excitation]] modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist [[Lev Landau]] used the idea for the [[Fermi liquid theory]] wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles.&lt;ref name=Coleman-2003/&gt; Landau also developed a [[mean field theory]] for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneous breakdown of symmetry]].

==Theoretical==
Theoretical condensed matter physics involves the use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the [[Drude model]], the [[Band structure]] and the [[density functional theory]]. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of [[phase transition]]s, such as the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], [[critical exponent]]s and the use of mathematical methods of [[quantum field theory]] and the [[renormalization group]]. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of [[numerical computation]] of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as [[high-temperature superconductivity]], [[topological phase]]s, and [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]].

Only the free electron gas case can be solved exactly.&lt;ref name="AshcroftMermin1976"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neil W. Ashcroft|author2=N. David Mermin|title=Solid state physics|year=1976|publisher=Saunders College|isbn=978-0-03-049346-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|330–337}} Finally in 1964–65, [[Walter Kohn]], [[Pierre Hohenberg]] and [[Lu Jeu Sham]] proposed the [[density functional theory]] which gave realistic descriptions for bulk and surface properties of metals. The density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used since the 1970s for band structure calculations of variety of solids.&lt;ref name=perdew-2010 /&gt;

===Symmetry breaking===
{{main|Symmetry breaking}}
Some states of matter exhibit symmetry breaking, where the relevant laws of physics possess some [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] that is broken. A common example is crystalline solids, which break continuous [[translational symmetry]]. Other examples include magnetized [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], which break [[rotational symmetry]], and more exotic states such as the ground state of a [[BCS theory|BCS]] [[superconductor]], that breaks [[U(1)]] phase rotational symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/nambu-lecture.html |title= Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Particle Physics: a Case of Cross Fertilization |last= Nambu |first= Yoichiro |date= 8 December 2008 |website= Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greiter |first=Martin |arxiv=cond-mat/0503400 |title=Is electromagnetic gauge invariance spontaneously violated in superconductors? |date=16 March 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2005.03.008 |volume=319 |issue=2005 |journal=Annals of Physics |pages=217–249|bibcode=2005AnPhy.319..217G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goldstone's theorem]] in [[quantum field theory]] states that in a system with broken continuous symmetry, there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone [[boson]]s. For example, in crystalline solids, these correspond to [[phonon]]s, which are quantized versions of lattice vibrations.&lt;ref name=goldstone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leutwyler|first=H.|title=Phonons as Goldstone bosons|journal= Helv.phys.acta )|volume=70|issue=1997|year=1996|arxiv=hep-ph/9609466|bibcode= 1996hep.ph....9466L|pages=275–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase transition===
{{main|Phase transition}}
Phase transition refers to the change of phase of a system, which is brought about by change in an external parameter such as [[temperature]].  Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when the order of the system was destroyed.  For example, when ice melts and becomes water, the ordered crystal structure is destroyed.  In [[quantum phase transition]]s,  the temperature is set to absolute zero, and the non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field,  causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations originating from the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct [[ground state]]s of the [[Hamiltonian matrix|Hamiltonian]].  Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare-earth magnetic insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and other substances.&lt;ref name=Vojta2003/&gt;

Two classes of phase transitions occur: first-order transitions and continuous transitions.  For the later, the two phases involved do not co-exist at the transition temperature, also called critical point.  Near the critical point, systems undergo critical behavior, wherein several of their properties such as [[correlation length]], [[specific heat]], and [[magnetic susceptibility]] diverge exponentially.&lt;ref name=Vojta2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vojta |first=Matthia |arxiv= cond-mat/0309604|title=Quantum phase transitions |year=2069 |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/66/12/R01 |volume=66 |issue=12 |journal=Reports on Progress in Physics |pages=2069–2110|bibcode=2003RPPh...66.2069V |citeseerx=10.1.1.305.3880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These critical phenomena possess serious challenges to physicists because normal macroscopic laws are no longer valid in the region and novel ideas and methods must be invented to find the new laws that can describe the system.&lt;ref name=NRC1986&gt;{{cite book |title=Condensed-Matter Physics, Physics Through the 1990s|publisher=National Research Council|year=1986|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/626/an-overview-physics-through-the-1990s|isbn=978-0-309-03577-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75ff}}

The simplest theory that can describe continuous phase transitions is the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], which works in the so-called [[mean field approximation]].  However, it can only roughly explain continuous phase transition for ferroelectrics and type I superconductors which involves long range microscopic interactions.  For other types of systems that involves short range interactions near the critical point, a better theory is needed.&lt;ref name="University1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm F. Collins Professor of Physics McMaster University|title=Magnetic Critical Scattering|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-536440-8|date=1989-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–11}}

Near the critical point, the fluctuations happen over broad range of size scales while the feature of the whole system is scale invariant.  [[Renormalization group]] methods successively average out the shortest wavelength fluctuations in stages while retaining their effects into the next stage.  Thus, the changes of a physical system as viewed at different size scales can be investigated systematically.  The methods, together with powerful computer simulation, contribute greatly to the explanation of the critical phenomena associated with continuous phase transition.&lt;ref name=NRC1986/&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Experimental==
Experimental condensed matter physics involves the use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. Such probes include effects of electric and [[magnetic field]]s, measuring [[response function]]s, [[transport theory (statistical physics)|transport properties]] and [[thermometry]].&lt;ref name=exptcm&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Robert C.|title=Experimental methods in Condensed Matter Physics at Low Temperatures|year=1988|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-201-15002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly used experimental methods include [[spectroscopy]], with probes such as [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-rays]], [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared light]] and [[inelastic neutron scattering]]; study of thermal response, such as [[specific heat]] and measuring transport via thermal and heat [[conduction (heat)|conduction]].
[[File:Lysozym diffraction.png|thumb|upright|Image of X-ray diffraction pattern from a [[protein]] crystal.]]

===Scattering===
{{Further|Scattering}}
Several condensed matter experiments involve scattering of an experimental probe, such as [[X-ray]], optical [[photon]]s, [[neutron]]s, etc., on constituents of a material. The choice of scattering probe depends on the observation energy scale of interest. [[Visible light]] has energy on the scale of 1 [[electron volt]] (eV) and is used as a scattering probe to measure variations in material properties such as [[dielectric constant]] and [[refractive index]]. X-rays have energies of the order of 10 [[electron volt|keV]] and hence are able to probe atomic length scales, and are used to measure variations in electron charge density.&lt;ref name=chaikin-lubensky&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaikin|first=P. M.|last2=Lubensky|first2=T. C.|title=Principles of condensed matter physics|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43224-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33–34}}

[[Neutron]]s can also probe atomic length scales and are used to study scattering off nuclei and electron [[Spin (physics)|spins]] and magnetization (as neutrons have spin but no charge). Coulomb and [[Mott scattering]] measurements can be made by using electron beams as scattering probes.&lt;ref name=chaikin-lubensky/&gt;{{rp|33–34}}&lt;ref name="Zhang2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wentao Zhang|title=Photoemission Spectroscopy on High Temperature Superconductor: A Study of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission|date=22 August 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-32472-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–43}}  Similarly, [[positron]] annihilation can be used as an indirect measurement of local electron density.&lt;ref name=siegel-1980&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=R.

===External magnetic fields===
In experimental condensed matter physics, external [[magnetic field]]s act as [[thermodynamic variable]]s that control the state, phase transitions and properties of material systems.&lt;ref name=iupap-report&gt;{{cite web|last=Committee on Facilities for Condensed Matter Physics|title=Report of the IUPAP working group on Facilities for Condensed Matter Physics : High Magnetic Fields|url=http://archive.iupap.org/wg/wg3/hmff/file_50963.pdf|publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|year= 2004|quote=The magnetic field is not simply a spectroscopic tool but is a thermodynamic variable which, along with temperature and pressure, controls the state, the phase transitions and the properties of materials.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) is a method by which external magnetic fields are used to find resonance modes of individual electrons, thus giving information about the atomic, molecular, and bond structure of their neighborhood. NMR experiments can be made in magnetic fields with strengths up to 60 [[Tesla (unit)|Tesla]].  Higher magnetic fields can improve the quality of NMR measurement data.&lt;ref name="StatesAstronomy2013"/&gt;{{rp|69}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=High Magnetic Fields|chapter=Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in Solids at very high magnetic fields|author1=Moulton, W.

===Cold atomic gases===
[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|thumb|left|The first [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] observed in a gas of ultracold [[rubidium]] atoms. The blue and white areas represent higher density.]]
{{main|Optical lattice}}
[[Ultracold atom]] trapping in optical lattices is an experimental tool commonly used in condensed matter physics, and in [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]. The method involves using optical lasers to form an [[interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]], which acts as a ''lattice'', in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures. Cold atoms in optical lattices are used as ''quantum simulators'', that is, they act as controllable systems that can model behavior of more complicated systems, such as [[Geometrical frustration|frustrated magnets]].&lt;ref name=buluta-science2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buluta|first=Iulia|author2=Nori, Franco |title=Quantum Simulators|journal=Science|year=2009|volume=326|issue=5949|doi=10.1126/science.1177838|bibcode= 2009Sci...326..108B|pages=108–11|pmid=19797653}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they are used to engineer one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices for a [[Hubbard model]] with pre-specified parameters, and to study phase transitions for [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] and [[spin liquid]] ordering.&lt;ref name=greiner-nature2008&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greiner |first=Markus |author2=Fölling, Simon |title=Condensed-matter physics: Optical lattices |journal=Nature|year=2008|volume=453|pages=736–738|doi=10.1038/453736a|bibcode= 2008Natur.453..736G|issue=7196|pmid=18528388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jaksch-aop2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaksch|first=D.|author2=Zoller, P. |title=The cold atom Hubbard toolbox|journal=Annals of Physics|year=2005|volume=315|issue=1|pages=52–79|doi=10.1016/j.aop.2004.09.010|arxiv= cond-mat/0410614 |bibcode= 2005AnPhy.315...52J|citeseerx=10.1.1.305.9031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms cooled down to a temperature of 170 [[Kelvin|nK]] was used to experimentally realize the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]], a novel state of matter originally predicted by [[S. N. Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]], wherein a large number of atoms occupy one [[quantum state]].&lt;ref name=nytimes-BEC&gt;{{cite news|last=Glanz|first=James|title=3 Researchers Based in U.S. Win Nobel Prize in Physics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/10/us/3-researchers-based-in-us-win-nobel-prize-in-physics.html|access-date=23 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum computation]], information is represented by quantum bits, or [[qubit]]s.  The qubits may [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] quickly before useful computation is completed.  This serious problem must be solved before quantum computing may be realized.  To solve this problem, several promising approaches are proposed in condensed matter physics, including [[Josephson junction]] qubits, [[spintronic]] qubits using the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] orientation of magnetic materials, or the topological non-Abelian [[anyon]]s from [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] states.&lt;ref name=yeh-perspective /&gt;

Condensed matter physics also has important uses for [[biophysics]], for example, the experimental method of [[magnetic resonance imaging]], which is widely used in medical diagnosis.&lt;ref name=yeh-perspective /&gt;

In [[urban design]] and [[urban planning]], '''daylighting''' is the redirection of a [[stream]] into an above-ground channel. Typically, the rationale behind daylighting is to revert a stream of water to a more natural state, for the purposes of runoff reduction, habitat creation for species in need of it, or for  aesthetic purposes. Daylighting is intended to revitalize the [[riparian]] environment for a stream which had been previously diverted into a [[culvert]], pipe, or a [[drainage]] system. In the UK, the practice is also known as '''deculverting'''.&lt;ref&gt;

===Natural drainage systems===
Natural drainage systems help [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|manage stormwater]] by [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrating]] and slowing the flow of [[Storm water|stormwater]], filtering and [[bioremediation|bioremediating]] pollutants by soils and plants, reducing [[impervious surface]]s, using porous paving, increasing vegetation, and improving related pedestrian amenities. Natural features &amp;mdash; open, vegetated [[Swale (geographical feature)|swale]]s, stormwater cascades, and small wetland ponds &amp;mdash; mimic the functions of nature lost to urbanization. At the heart are plants, trees, and the deep, healthy soils that support them. All three combine to form a "living [[infrastructure]]" that, unlike pipes and vaults, increase in functional value over time.

Some efforts to blend urban development with natural systems use innovative drainage design and landscaping instead of traditional curbs and gutters, pipes and vaults. One such [[Daylighting (streams)#Urban Seattle|demonstration project]] in the [[Pipers Creek (Seattle)|Pipers Creek]] watershed reduced imperviousness by more than 18 percent. The project built bioswales, landscape elements intended to remove silt and pollution from surface runoff water and planted 100 evergreen trees and 1,100 shrubs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fema.gov/mitigationbp/brief.do?mitssId=5246&lt;/ref&gt; From 2001 to 2003, the project reduced the volume of stormwater leaving the street in a 2-year storm event by 98%.&lt;!-- Consolidated 2 citations into 1 --&gt;&lt;ref name=NDS_SEA&gt;(1)

&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reduction can reduce storm damage to water quality and habitats for species such as the iconic salmon. Unfortunately, the engineering alternatives have a relatively expensive [[Total cost of ownership|initial price]], since they are usually replacing existing structures, albeit life-limited ones. Further, conventional systems generally do not consider [[full cost accounting]]. The NDS alternatives can also provide [[Rate of return|returns on investment]] by improving urban environments.

The Street Edge Alternatives Street breaks most of the conventions of 150 years of standard American street design. Narrow, curved streets, open drainage swales, and an abundance of diverse plants and trees welcome pedestrians as well as diverse species. Adjacent residents maintain city infrastructure in the form of street "gardens" in front of their homes, visually integrating the neighborhood along the street. The Natural Drainage System united the community visually, environmentally, and socially. The 110th Cascades SEA (2002–2003) are a creek-like cascade of stair-stepped natural, seasonal pools that intercept, infiltrate, slow and filter over {{convert|21|acre|m2}} of stormwater draining through the project.&lt;ref name="Streams in the Urban Landscape"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jone|first=Scott|title=Streams in the Urban Landscape|url=https://www.maida.com.au/plumbing/seattle-public-utilities/|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; With impervious surfaces having replaced most of the natural ground cover in urban environments, habitat for wildlife is dramatically reduced compared to historic baselines. Hydrologic changes have resulted, and impervious waterways directly carry non-point pollution through urban creeks. One effective solution is to restore streams and riparian habitat. This improves the entire urban watershed, far beyond the riparian channel itself.

====Vancouver, British Columbia====
[[File:Vancouver old streams.jpg|thumb|left|The historic stream network in Vancouver, B.C.]]
In the 1880s there were over 50 wild salmon streams in [[Vancouver]] alone.&lt;ref name="Lost Streams of Vancouver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lost Streams of Vancouver|url=http://vancouverstreetstories.com/lost-streams-of-vancouver/|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, as Vancouver grew, these streams were lost to urbanization.  They were covered by roads, homes, and businesses.  They were also lost when they were buried beneath sewers or culverts. &lt;br /&gt;
The City of Vancouver and its residents are now making an effort to uncover these lost streams and restore them back to their natural state.

=====Hastings Creek=====
[[File:Hastings Creek.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings Creek Restored at Creekway Park.  Vancouver, B.C.]] 

The Hastings Creek Stream Daylighting Project was originally proposed in 1994 as a way to manage storm water and for aesthetic purposes.  The idea was to bring the stream back to its once natural formation which would improve the surrounding habitat for wildlife as well as the originally proposed purposes.&lt;ref name="Vancouver Stream Daylighting Projects"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jone|first=Scott|title=Planning for Wildlife: Evaluating Creek Daylighting as a means of Urban Conservation|url=http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/ftp05/MQ63529.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project's plan was finalized in 1997, and work began the same year.&lt;ref name="PNE Master Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hastings Park PNE Master Plan|url=http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/hastings-park-pne-master-plan.aspx|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stream had existed in [[Hastings Park]] until 1935 when the Park became focused on entertainment rather than its original purpose when it was given to the city in 1889, which was to be a retreat for those with a passion for the outdoors. As the [[Pacific Nation Exhibition|Pacific Nation Exhibition (PNE)]] grounds continued to expand there was a continued loss of natural woodlands, greenery and waterways.  It was not until the 1980s when the surrounding community began to look at continuing to uphold its original purpose.&lt;ref name="Vancouver Stream Daylighting Projects"/&gt;

The daylighting project made major progress in 2013 in the area located in the Creekway Park, which was originally a parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=parking lot transformed into lush new urban park and restored creek|url=http://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/parking-lot-transformed-into-lush-new-urban-park-and-restored-creek.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The daylighted stream will one day connect the Sanctuary in [[Hastings Park]] to the [[Burrard Inlet]].  The progress made in Creekway Park is a major step towards this goal. This daylighting project also improved pedestrian and bikeway transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transforming Hastings Park and the PNE|url=http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/hastings-park-pne-master-plan.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stream is now able to obtain the stormwater from the surrounding area, which reduces the load that is felt by the municipality's storm sewers. It is the storms in early autumn which provide the water flow for the creek, meaning that there is variable flow throughout the year.  During the late summer months the moist soil is relied upon to maintain the vegetation of the area.  This variation in flow does not allow for [[salmon]] migration through the creek; however it does house [[trout]] as well as vegetation which aid in the filtration of the storm water entering the creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=open house board on pne june 16|url=http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/open-house-board-pne-june-16-ecology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Spanish Banks=====
[[File:Restored Stream Spanish Banks.jpeg|thumb|right|Daylighted Stream at Spanish Banks, Vancouver, B.C.]]
Located upstream from [[Spanish Banks]] waterfront, one of the highest profile creeks in Vancouver Metro became open to salmon in 2000. In a collaborative project between Spanish Banks Streamkeepers Association and the Department of [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]], barriers to fish passage were removed and habitat structure was added. [[Bodies of water in Vancouver#Spanish Banks Creek|Spanish Banks Creek]] was previously diverted through a culvert underneath a parking lot, but the lower reaches of this creek have been revitalized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urbanstreams.org/spanishbankscreek/&lt;/ref&gt; The banks were stabilized with [[riprap]], large woody debris was added for habitat cover, and spawning gravels were added in appropriate areas. Rigorous effectiveness monitoring has not been performed, but a few dozen [[coho salmon|coho]] and [[chum salmon|chum]] salmon are known to spawn there annually in a sustaining population.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/the-stream-that-spawned-a-comeback/article4182186/&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance to the creek is provided by Spanish Banks Streamkeepers Association, a local volunteer stewardship group.

=====St. George Rainway=====

The [[East Vancouver]] neighborhood of [[Mount Pleasant, Vancouver|Mount Pleasant]] has officially incorporated into its community plan a project to restore St. George Creek, a tributary to the False Creek watershed. St. George street is the site of this former stream, which now flows through the sewers and a culvert. This paved street will be converted into a shared-use  path, [[riparian]] habitat, and [[Urban open space|urban greenspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. George Rainway Street |url=http://www.lanefab.com/st-george-rainway-street-con/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142645/http://www.lanefab.com/st-george-rainway-street-con/ |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. George Creek once spawned [[salmon]] and [[trout]], and hosted a diverse [[riparian]] ecosystem. The restoration of this habitat using the rainway proposal would allow for salmon spawning, recreational and educational opportunities, and improve the community's access to nature and transportation alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://mtpleasantwatershed.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal would pass the following community centres: [[Great Northern Way Campus]], St. Francis Xavier School, Mt. Pleasant Elementary, Florence N. Elementary, Kivan Boys and Girls Club, Robson Park Family Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.falsecreekwatershed.org/uploads/2/0/5/0/20500086/st_george.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed landscape designs have been produced, and incorporated into the community plan of Mount Pleasant neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanefab.com/st-george-rainway-street-con/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413142645/http://www.lanefab.com/st-george-rainway-street-con/ |archivedate=2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Project leaders from the [[False Creek]] watershed Society and Vancouver Society of Storytelling have collaborated with Mount Pleasant Elementary students to create a street mural drawing attention to the belowground stream.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vancourier.com/news/east-side-group-aims-to-recreate-lost-stream-with-rainwater-runoff-1.681412&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the mural is the only physical progress on the project.

=====Tatlow Creek=====
This is a future project aiming to ultimately connect the gap in the Seaside Greenway in order to link it to the [[Burrard Bridge]]. The beginning of this project has been started by the [https://vancouver.ca/  City of Vancouver] in 2013, after its approval on July 29 of the same year. Volunteer Park is located in [[Kitsilano]] at the corner of Point Grey Road and Macdonald Street.  This is where the main daylighting project for this area is planned to occur.&lt;ref name="City of Vancouver Park Board Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Vancouver Park Board Report|url=http://cityhallwatch.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/park-board-report_seasidegreenwayimprovements-07-10-2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phase one'' is currently in progress.  Point Grey Road is currently closed to through motor traffic in order to turn the street into a greenway for cycling and walking.  This part of the project is expected to be complete by summer 2014.&lt;ref name="City of Vancouver Park Board Report" /&gt;

''Phase two'' of this project is looking to include the daylighting of Tatlow Creek which is located in Volunteer Park.  This phase must go through the City Council and the Park Board capital planning process for the 2015-2017 Capital Plan before any plans can be finalized.&lt;ref name="City of Vancouver Park Board Report" /&gt;

Tatlow Creek had been scheduled to be daylighted in 1996, and the project to start in 1997.  The project was deemed feasible and the storm water was to be diverted back into the natural creek bed and tunneled under Point Grey Road.  When it was not done, the project was proposed again by a [[University of British Columbia|UBC]] masters' student as the Tatlow Creek Revitalization Project.  If this project is completed as phase 2 of the new Park Board Project it would allow for [[salmon]] and [[trout]] spawning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=circle UBC|url=https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/14448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pipers Creek=====
'''[[Pipers Creek (Seattle)|Pipers Creek]]''' in the central to north [[Greenwood, Seattle, Washington|Greenwood]] area is joined by [[Venema Creek|Venema]] and [[Mohlendorph Creek]]s in [[Carkeek Park]] on Puget Sound. Pipers is one of the four largest streams in urban Seattle, together with Longfellow, Taylor, and Thornton creeks.  Pipers Creek drains a {{convert|1835|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} watershed into Puget Sound, from a residential upper plateau that is most of the watershed, through the steep ravines of the {{convert|216|acre|km2|1}} of Carkeek Park. The headwaters begin in the north Greenwood neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the park, the creek can be seen at N 90th Street between Greenwood and Palatine avenues N.

Years of hard work by neighbors and volunteers have brought salmon back to Pipers Creek, Venema, and Mohlendorph creeks in the mid-2000s after there were none for 50 years. The latter is named for the late Ted Mohlendorph, a biologist who spearheaded efforts to restore the watershed as salmon habitat.

Though still plagued by problems endemic to urban streams, Piper's Creek today is a scintillating example of the possible. Though augmented by hatchery fish, anywhere from 200 to 600 [[chum salmon]] return each November, along with a few [[Coho salmon|coho]] in the fall and fewer occasional winter [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]]. Inspirationally, several hundred small resident [[coastal cutthroat trout]] live in the watershed, believed to be native fish that survived decades of urban assault. An environmental learning center and programs are part of comprehensive restoration. More than four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) of trail are maintained by neighborhood volunteers who put in 4,000 hours of work in 2003, for example. The creek waters are pretty in their impressively restored settings, but the watershed is the surrounding neighborhoods and streets, laced with petrochemicals, pesticides, fertilizers, wandering pets, and such. Along with steeply high volume during storm runoff and resulting turbidity, water quality is the remaining big issue in restoring salmon.&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;Johnston&lt;/ref&gt;

The north fork of Pipers Creek is the site for the 110th Cascades, an S.E.A. (Street Edge Alternatives) street demonstration project (see [[Daylighting (streams)#Natural Drainage Systems and Street Edge Alternatives|above]]). The 110th Cascades are a creek-like cascade of stair-stepped natural, seasonal pools that intercept, infiltrate, slow and filter over {{convert|21|acre|m2}} of stormwater draining through the project. The cascades are a part of an NDS (Natural Drainage Systems) project; together these united the community visually, environmentally, and socially, toward integrating the neighborhood as a community.&lt;ref name=NDS_SEA /&gt;&lt;ref name=NDS_110&gt;(1)

=====Taylor Creek=====
* '''[[Taylor Creek (Seattle)|Taylor Creek]]''' flows from Deadhorse Canyon (west of Rainier Avenue S at 68th Avenue S and northwest of Skyway Park), through [[Lakeridge Park]] to Lake Washington. With volunteer effort and some city matching grants, restoration has been underway since 1971. Volunteers have planted thousands of indigenous trees and plants, removed tons of garbage, removed invasive plants, and had city help removing fish-blocking culverts and improving trails. A deer has been spotted and sightings of raccoons, opossum and birds are common. By about 2050, the area will be looking like a young version of what it looked like before being disrupted. Taylor is one of the four largest streams in urban Seattle.&lt;ref name=Dietrich&gt;Dietrich&lt;/ref&gt;

Coho salmon and cutthroat trout returned as soon as barriers were removed, after concerted effort and pressure by citizen groups of activist neighbors (1989–1998).

* [[Madrona Creek]], Seattle
** [[Madrona, Seattle, Washington|Madrona]] &lt;br /&gt;Citizens of neighborhoods initiated a daylighting project in 2001, encompassing from above 38th Avenue into Lake Washington. Daylighting will return the creek to a new bed and replace the sloping lawn between Lake Washington Boulevard and Lake Washington with native plantings, and with the mouth of the creek at a restored {{convert|48000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}} wetland cove on the lake.

&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent efforts began (1995) with informal removal of ivy smothering trees, then invasive species like holly, laurel and blackberries, and realization that effective restoration would require comprehensive stewardship.

:With a "Small and Simple" Department of Neighborhoods grant, the neighborhood started a formal effort. Neighborhood groups, planning with naturalists and landscape architects brought an effective early step rebuilding trails, promoting access and building constituency. Further priorities were protection for habitat, restoration of stream beds, rehabilitation as a natural area using native plants, and using the Madrona Woods as a setting for environmental education programs at local schools. A hired landscape architect became a team member, experimental plots were set up to test different methods for revegetating with native plants. (Plants adapt to microclimates; experimentation is required to jumpstart the otherwise very long natural processes.)

:Friends of Madrona Woods earned a much larger Department of Neighborhoods matching grant in 2000, funding the creation of a Master Action Plan, and major trail restoration work. The community match for the grant was nearly 2500 hours of volunteer labor by community members and school children from St. Therese and Epiphany schools. After many decades of urban use without formal maintenance, substantial trail engineering was required. EarthCorps was contracted to do the actual construction, which included 86 steps, two landings and a bridge.

:EarthCorps is a local program to foster environmental responsibility and global cooperation among young people around the world. Two thirds the Corps members come from King County and the U.S., one third are recruited from partner organizations around the world. They combine the best elements of the 1930s [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] with those of the [[Peace Corps]]. Participants learn resource management skills by completing restoration projects throughout King County. This work has included restoring stream banks and salmon habitat, reclaiming logging roads, and building trails. They completed 30,000 hours of work in 1999 alone.

:In the process of clearing, volunteers found substantial erosion in the wetland hillside, leading to a grant from a Parks Department fund to stabilize it with a water cascade of natural materials. Neighbors did a little trail-building of their own with Volunteers for Outdoor Washington and an all-day trail building workshop (February 2000). Local school children learn about restoration by working with Madrona Woods volunteers throughout the year. Work parties continue monthly through much of the year.&lt;!-- Consolidated 2 into 1 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1) Scott &lt;br /&gt;(2)

====Porter Brook, Sheffield, Yorkshire====
The '''[[Porter Brook]]''' flows from the west of [[Sheffield]] on the edge of the [[Peak District]] and flows into the [[River Sheaf]] at ''Sheaf Street'' near [[Sheffield station|Sheffield Railway Station]]. The Porter Brook is one of Sheffield's five well known rivers, along with the [[River Don, Yorkshire|Don]], [[River Sheaf|Sheaf]], [[River Loxley|Loxley]] and [[River Rivelin|Rivelin]]. The Porter has been deculverted at ''Matilda Street'' near the BBC Radio Sheffield studios. A feasibility study for the scheme was undertaken for South Yorkshire Forest Partnership by Sheffield City Council in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://deculverting.com/2016/04/29/deculverting-sheffields-porter-brook-city-centre/ |title=Deculverting Sheffield’s Porter Brook – City Centre (Article)}}&lt;/ref&gt; with funding from the Environment Agency and the EU via the Interreg North Sea Region Programme. The project was completed by Sheffield City Council with funding from the Environment Agency in 2016. Before and after pictures, taken from 2011 through to 2016, at [https://deculverting.com/ www.deculverting.com] show the scheme at the same location prior to commencement, during construction and completion. The site has been maintained since 2016 with the help of the Wild Trout Trust.

The Porter Brook daylighting scheme featured in a 2016 BBC Radio 4 documentary entitled A River of Steel, produced by sound recordist Chris Watson, ex-member of [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Caberet Voltaire]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07qbcbv |title=A River of Steel (Radio Programme)}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was also discussed in an article in The Guardian in 2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/29/river-runs-global-movement-daylight-urban-rivers |title=A river runs through it (Article)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====River Roch, Rochdale, Greater Manchester====
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[River Roch]] that runs through the town of [[Rochdale]] has recently been uncovered, revealing the medieval bridge in place. It was covered in 1904 to accommodate a tram network that has since closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-36520198|title=Hidden medieval bridge reopens|date=2016-06-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other countries ==
In [[Seoul]], which buried the [[Cheonggyecheon]] creek during the city's 1960s boom, an artificial waterway and adjoining parks have been built atop it. Mayor [[Lee Myung Bak]], formerly a construction magnate with the [[Hyundai]] [[chaebol]] that helped bury the river, ran for office promising to daylight it, and achieved in 2005 a {{convert|5.8|km|mi}} [[Open space reserve|greenspace]] in a city without very many parks or playgrounds.{{cn|date=May 2017}} The new park is hugely popular, alleviating fears that opening the river would cause nearby businesses to lose customers.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk (13 October 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decellularization''' (also spelt '''decellularisation''' in British English) is the process used in biomedical engineering to isolate the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) of a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] from its inhabiting cells, leaving an ECM [[Tissue scaffold|scaffold]] of the original tissue, which can be used in [[artificial organ]] and tissue regeneration. [[Organ (anatomy)|Organ]] and tissue transplantation treat a variety of medical problems, ranging from end organ failure to cosmetic surgery.  One of the greatest limitations to organ transplantation derives from organ rejection caused by [[antibodies]] of the transplant recipient reacting to [[donor]] [[antigens]] on cell surfaces within the donor organ.&lt;ref&gt;Colaco, M., &amp; Atala, A. (2014). The Future of Transplant Biology and Surgery. Interdisciplinary Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of unfavorable [[Immune system|immune]] responses, transplant patients suffer a lifetime taking immunosuppressing medication. Stephen F. Badylak pioneered the process of decellularization at the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Thomas W.|last2=Sellaro|first2=Tiffany L.|last3=Badylak|first3=Stephen F.|title=Decellularization of tissues and organs|journal=Biomaterials|date=14 February 2006|volume=27|pages=3675–3683|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.02.014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This process creates a natural [[biomaterial]] to act as a scaffold for cell growth, [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] and tissue development. By recellularizing an ECM scaffold with a patient’s own cells, the adverse immune response is eliminated. Nowadays, commercially available ECM scaffolds are available for a wide variety of [[tissue engineering]].  Using peracetic acid to decellularize ECM scaffolds have been found to be false and only disinfects the tissue.

With a wide variety of decellularization-inducing treatments available, combinations of physical, [[chemical]], and enzymatic treatments are carefully monitored to ensure that the ECM scaffold maintains the structural and chemical integrity of the original tissue.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt; Scientists can use the acquired ECM scaffold to reproduce a functional organ by introducing [[progenitor cell]]s, or [[adult stem cell]]s (ASCs), and allowing them to differentiate within the scaffold to develop into the desired tissue. The produced organ or tissue can be transplanted into a patient. In contrast to cell surface antibodies, the [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] components of the ECM are conserved between hosts, so the risk of a hostile immune response is minimized.&lt;ref name="Conserving ECM 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Exposito|first1=J.Y.|last2=D'Alessio|first2=M.|last3=Solursh|first3=M.|last4=Ramirez|first4=F.|title=Sea urchin collagen evolutionary homoogous to vertebrate pro-alpha|journal=J Biol Chem|date=1992|volume=267|pages=15559–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conserving ECM 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Constantinou|first1=C|title=Use of polymerase chain reaction and partially degenerate oligonucleotide for generation of novel cDNA clones.|journal=Matrix|date=1991|volume=11|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/s0934-8832(11)80221-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper conservation of ECM fibers, growth factors, and other proteins is imperative to the progenitor cells differentiating into the proper adult cells.

== Process overview ==
Researchers are able to take the tissue from a donor or [[cadaver]], [[Lysis|lyse]] and kill the cells within the tissue without damaging the extracellular components, and finish with a product that is the natural ECM scaffold that has the same physical and biochemical functions of the natural tissue.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;  After acquiring the ECM scaffold, scientists can recellularize the tissue with [[Cell potency|potent stem]] or progenitor cells that will differentiate into the original type of tissue.  By removing the cells from a donor tissue, the immunogenic antibodies from the donor will be removed.  The progenitor cells can be taken from the host, therefore they will not have an adverse response to the tissue.  This process of decellularizing tissues and organs is still being developed, but the exact process of taking a tissue from a donor and removing all the cellular components is considered to be the decellularization process. The steps to go from a decellularized ECM scaffold to a functional organ is under the umbrella of recellularization.  Because of the diverse applications of tissue in the human body, decellularization techniques have to be tailored to the specific tissue being exercised on. The researched methods of decellularization include physical, chemical, and enzymatic treatments.  Though some methods are more commonly used, the exact combination of treatments is variable based on the tissue’s origin and what it is needed for.&lt;ref name=Crapo /&gt;

As far as introducing the different liquidized chemicals and [[enzyme]]s to an organ or tissue, [[perfusion]] and immersion decellularization techniques have been used. Perfusion decellularization is applicable when an extensive vasculature system is present in the organ or tissue. It is crucial for the ECM scaffold to be decellularized at all levels, and evenly throughout the structure.&lt;ref name="Perfusion 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ott|first1=H.C|title=Perfusion-decellularized matrix: using nature's platform to engineer a bioartificial heart.|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2008|volume=14|pages=213–221|doi=10.1038/nm1684|pmid=18193059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guyette|first1=Jacques P|last2=Gilpin|first2=Sarah E|last3=Charest|first3=Jonathan M|last4=Tapias|first4=Luis F|last5=Ren|first5=Xi|last6=Ott|first6=Harald C|title=Perfusion decellularization of whole organs|journal=Nature Protocols|date=29 May 2014|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1451–1468|doi=10.1038/nprot.2014.097|url=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v9/n6/abs/nprot.2014.097.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this requirement, vascularized tissues can have chemicals and enzymes perfused through the present arteries, veins, and capillaries. Under this mechanism and proper physiological conditions, treatments can diffuse equally to all of the cells within the organ. The treatments can be removed through the veins at the end of the process. Cardiac and pulmonary decellularization often uses this process of decellularization to introduce the treatments because of their heavily vascularized networks. Immersion decellularization is accomplished through the submersion of a tissue in chemical and enzymatic treatments. This process is more easily accomplished than [[perfusion]], but is limited to thin tissues with a limited vascular system.

== Physical treatments ==
The most common physical methods used to lyse, kill, and remove cells from the matrix of a tissue through the use of temperature, force and pressure, and electrical disruption. Temperature methods are often used in a rapid freeze-thaw mechanism. By quickly freezing a tissue, microscopic ice crystals form around the plasma membrane and the cell is lysed.&lt;ref name="Freeze-Thaw 1 Flynn 50"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=L.E.|title=The use of decellularized adipose tissue to provide an inductive microenvironment for the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells.|journal=Biomaterials|date=2010|volume=31|pages=4715–4724|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.02.046|pmid=20304481}}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After lysing the cells, the tissue can be further exposed to liquidized chemicals that degrade and wash out the undesirable components. Temperature methods conserve the physical structure of the ECM scaffold, but are best handled by thick, strong tissues.

Direct force of pressure to a tissue will guarantee disruption of the ECM structure, so pressure is commonly used. Pressure decellularization involves the controlled use of [[hydrostatic pressure]] applied to a tissue or organ.  This is done best at high temperatures to avoid unmonitored ice crystal formation that could damage the scaffold. Electrical disruption of the plasma membrane is another option to lyse the cells housed in a tissue or organ.  By exposing a tissue to electrical pulses, micropores are formed at the plasma membrane. The cells eventually turn to death after their homeostatic electrical balance is ruined through the applied stimulus. This electrical process is documented as Non-thermal irreversible [[electroporation]] (NTIRE) and is limited to small tissues and the limited possibilities of inducing an electric current ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;

== Chemical treatments ==
The proper combination of chemicals is selected for decellularization depending on the thickness, extracellular matrix composition, and intended use of the tissue or organ.  For example, enzymes would not be used on a collagenous tissue because they disrupt the connective tissue fibers. However, when [[collagen]] is not present in a high concentration or needed in the tissue, enzymes can be a viable option for decellularization. The chemicals used to kill and remove the cells include acids, alkaline treatments, [[Ionic bonding|ionic]] [[detergent]]s, non-ionic detergents, and [[zwitterion]]ic detergents.

The ionic detergent, [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS), is commonly used because of its high efficacy for lysing cells without significant damage to the ECM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ott|first=Harald C.|last2=Matthiesen|first2=Thomas S.|last3=Goh|first3=Saik-Kia|last4=Black|first4=Lauren D.|last5=Kren|first5=Stefan M.|last6=Netoff|first6=Theoden I.|last7=Taylor|first7=Doris A.|date=February 2008|title=Perfusion-decellularized matrix: using nature's platform to engineer a bioartificial heart|journal=Nature Medicine|volume=14|issue=2|pages=213–221|doi=10.1038/nm1684|issn=1546-170X|pmid=18193059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guyette|first=Jacques P.|last2=Gilpin|first2=Sarah E.|last3=Charest|first3=Jonathan M.|last4=Tapias|first4=Luis F.|last5=Ren|first5=Xi|last6=Ott|first6=Harald C.|date=2014|title=Perfusion decellularization of whole organs|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1451–1468|doi=10.1038/nprot.2014.097|issn=1750-2799|pmid=24874812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilpin|first=Sarah Elizabeth|last2=Guyette|first2=Jacques P.|last3=Gonzalez|first3=Gabriel|last4=Ren|first4=Xi|last5=Asara|first5=John M.|last6=Mathisen|first6=Douglas J.|last7=Vacanti|first7=Joseph P.|last8=Ott|first8=Harald C.|date=March 2014|title=Perfusion decellularization of human and porcine lungs: bringing the matrix to clinical scale|journal=The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation: The Official Publication of the International Society for Heart Transplantation|volume=33|issue=3|pages=298–308|doi=10.1016/j.healun.2013.10.030|issn=1557-3117|pmid=24365767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detergents act effectively to lyse the cell membrane and expose the contents to further degradation. After SDS lyses the cell membrane, [[endonucleases]] and [[exonucleases]] degrade the genetic contents, while other components of the cell is solubilized and washed out of the matrix. SDS is commonly used even though it has a tendency to slightly disrupt the ECM structure. Akaline and acid treatments can be effective companions with an SDS treatment due to their ability to degrade [[nucleic acid]]s and solubilize [[cytoplasmic inclusion]]s.&lt;ref name=Crapo /&gt;

The most well known non-ionic detergent is [[Triton X-100]], which is popular because of its ability to disrupt the interactions between lipids and between [[lipid]]s and proteins. [[Triton X-100]] does not disrupt protein-protein interactions, which is beneficial to keeping the ECM intact. [[EDTA]] is a chelating agent that binds [[calcium]], which is a necessary component for proteins to interact with one another. By making calcium unavailable, [[EDTA]] prevents the integral proteins between cells from binding to one another.  EDTA is often used with trypsin, an enzyme that acts as a protease to cleave the already existing bonds between integral proteins of neighboring cells within a tissue.  Together, the EDTA-Trypsin combination make a good team for decellularizing tissues.

== Enzymatic treatments ==
Enzymes used in decellularization treatments are used to break the bonds and interactions between nucleic acids, interacting cells through neighboring proteins, and other cellular components. [[Lipase]]s, [[thermolysin]], [[galactosidase]], [[nucleases]], and [[trypsin]] have all been used in the removal of cells.  After a cell is lysed with a detergent, acid, physical pressure, etc., endonucleases and exonucleases can begin the degradation of the genetic material.  Endonucleases cleave DNA and RNA in the middle of sequences.  Benzoase, an endonuclease, produces multiple small nuclear fragments that can be further degraded and removed from the ECM scaffold.&lt;ref name=Benzoase&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petersen|first1=T.H.|last2=Calle|first2=E.A.|last3=Zhao|first3=L.|last4=Lee|first4=E.J.|last5=Gui|first5=L.|last6=Raredon|first6=M.B.|title=Tissue-engineered lungs for in vivo implantation|journal=Science|date=2010|volume=329|issue=5991|pages=538–541|doi=10.1126/science.1189345|pmc=3640463}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exonucleases act at the end of DNA sequences to cleave the phosphodiester bonds and further degrade the nucleic acid sequences.

Enzymes such as trypsin act as proteases that cleave the interactions between proteins. Although trypsin can have adverse effects of collagen and elastin fibers of the ECM, using it in a time-sensitive manner controls any potential damage it could cause on the extracellular fibers. Dispase is used to prevent undesired aggregation of cells, which is beneficial in promoting their separating from the ECM scaffold.  Experimentation has shown dispase to be most effective on the surface of a thin tissue, such as a lung in pulmonary tissue regeneration.  To successfully remove deep cells of a tissue with dispase, mechanical agitation is often included in the process.

[[Collagenase]] is only used when the ECM scaffold product does not require an intact collagen structure. Lipases are commonly used when decellularized skin grafts are needed.  Lipase acids function in decellularizing dermal tissues through delipidation and cleaving the interactions between heavily lipidized cells. The enzyme, α-galactosidase is a relevant treatment when removing the Gal epitope antigen from cell surfaces.&lt;ref name=Crapo /&gt;

A natural ECM scaffold provides the necessary physical and biochemical environment to facilitate the growth and specialization of potent progenitor and stem cells.  Acellular matrices have been isolated ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' in a number of different tissues and organs.&lt;ref name="Engineering Paper" /&gt; The most applicable success from decellularized tissues has come from symmetrical tissues that have less specialization, such as bone and dermal grafts; however, research and success is ongoing at the organ level.

Acellular dermal matrices have been successful in a number of different applications. For example, skin grafts are used in cosmetic surgery and burn care.  The decellularized skin graft provides mechanical support to the damaged area while supporting the development of host-derived connective tissue. Cardiac tissue has clinical success in developing human valves from natural ECM matrices.&lt;ref name="Myocardial tissue"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimmermann|first1=W.H.|title=Engineered heart tissue grafts improve systolic and diastolic function in infarcted rat hearts|journal=Nature Medicine|date=2004|volume=12|issue=4|pages=452–458|doi= 10.1038/nm1394|pmid=16582915}}&lt;/ref&gt; A technique known as the Ross procedure uses an acellular heart valve to replace a defective valve, allowing native cells to repopulate a newly functioning valve. Decellularized [[allografts]] have been critical in bone grafts that function in bone reconstruction and replacing of deformed bones in patients.

The limits to myocardial tissue engineering come from the ability to immediately perfuse and seed and implemented heart into a patient. Though the ECM scaffold maintains the [[protein]] and [[growth factor]]s of the natural tissue, the molecular level specialization has not yet been harnessed by researchers using decellularized heart scaffolds. Better success at using a whole organ from decellularization techniques has been found in pulmonary research. Scientists have been able to regenerate whole lungs ''in vitro'' from rat lungs using perfusion-decellularization. By seeding the matrix with [[Fetus|fetal]] rat lung cells, a functioning lung was produced.  The ''in vitro''-produced lung was successfully implemented into a rat, which attests to the possibilities of translating an ''in vitro'' produced organ into a patient.

Other success for decellularization has been found in small intestinal submucosa (SIS), renal, hepatic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazza|first1=Giuseppe|last2=Rombouts|first2=Krista|last3=Rennie Hall|first3=Andrew|last4=Urbani|first4=Luca|last5=Vinh Luong|first5=Tu|last6=Al-Akkad|first6=Walid|last7=Longato|first7=Lisa|last8=Brown|first8=David|last9=Maghsoudlou|first9=Panagiotis|last10=Dhillon|first10=Amar P.|last11=Fuller|first11=Barry|last12=Davidson|first12=Brian|last13=Moore|first13=Kevin|last14=Dhar|first14=Dipok|last15=De Coppi|first15=Paolo|last16=Malago|first16=Massimo|last17=Pinzani|first17=Massimo|title=Decellularized human liver as a natural 3D-scaffold for liver bioengineering and transplantation|journal=Scientific Reports|date=7 August 2015|volume=5|pages=13079|doi=10.1038/srep13079|pmid=26248878|pmc=4528226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pancreatic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goh|first1=Saik-Kia|last2=Bertera|first2=Suzanne|last3=Olsen|first3=Phillip|last4=Candiello|first4=Joseph E.|last5=Halfter|first5=Willi|last6=Uechi|first6=Guy|last7=Balasubramani|first7=Manimalha|last8=Johnson|first8=Scott A.|last9=Sicari|first9=Brian M.|last10=Kollar|first10=Elizabeth|last11=Badylak|first11=Stephen F.|last12=Banerjee|first12=Ipsita|title=Perfusion-decellularized pancreas as a natural 3D scaffold for pancreatic tissue and whole organ engineering|journal=Biomaterials|date=September 2013|volume=34|issue=28|pages=6760–6772|doi=10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.05.066|pmid=23787110|pmc=3748589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is a thin material, the SIS matrix can be decellularized through immersing the tissue in chemical and enzymatic treatments. Renal tissue engineering is still developing, but cadaveric kidney matrices have been able to support development of potent fetal kidney cells. Pancreatic engineering is a testament to the molecular specificity of organs. Scientists have not yet been able to produce an entirely functioning [[pancreas]], but they have had success in producing an organ that functions at specific segments. For example, diabetes in rats was shown to decrease by seeding a pancreatic matrix at specific sites.&lt;ref name="Engineering Paper" /&gt; The future applications of decellularized tissue matrix is still being discovered and is considered one of the most hopeful areas in regenerative research.

The study of '''[[neural development]] in humans''' draws on both [[neuroscience]] and [[developmental biology]] to describe the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which complex [[nervous system]]s emerge during [[morphogenesis|embryonic development]] and throughout life.

Some landmarks of [[embryo]]nic neural development include the birth and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of [[neuron]]s from [[stem cells|stem cell]] precursors, the [[cellular migration|migration]] of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions, outgrowth of [[axon]]s from neurons and [[axon guidance|guidance]] of the motile [[growth cone]] through the embryo towards postsynaptic partners, the generation of [[synapse]]s between these axons and their postsynaptic partners, the [[synaptic pruning|neuron pruning]] that occurs in [[adolescence]], and finally the lifelong [[synaptic plasticity|changes in synapses]] which are thought to underlie learning and memory.

Typically, these neurodevelopmental processes can be broadly divided into two classes: activity-independent mechanisms and activity-dependent mechanisms.  Activity-independent mechanisms are generally believed to occur as hardwired processes determined by genetic programs played out within individual neurons. These include [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], [[cellular migration|migration]] and [[axon guidance]] to their initial target areas.  These processes are thought of as being independent of neural activity and sensory experience.   Once [[axon]]s reach their target areas, activity-dependent mechanisms come into play.  Neural activity and sensory experience will mediate formation of new [[synapses]], as well as [[synaptic plasticity]], which will be responsible for refinement of the nascent neural circuits.

==Embryonic stage==

===Neurulation===
{{Main article|neurulation}}
:''See [[embryogenesis]] for understanding the animal development up to this stage.''
Neurulation is the formation of the [[neural tube]] from the [[ectoderm]] of the embryo.  It follows [[gastrulation]] in all vertebrates.

During gastrulation cells migrate to the interior of embryo, forming three [[germ layer]]s&amp;mdash; the endoderm (the deepest layer), mesoderm and ectoderm (the surface layer)&amp;mdash;from which all tissues and organs will arise. In a simplified way, it can be said that the ectoderm gives rise to [[skin]] and nervous system, the endoderm to the [[Gastrointestinal tract|guts]] and the mesoderm to the rest of the [[organ (biology)|organ]]s.

After gastrulation the [[notochord]]&amp;mdash;a flexible, rod-shaped body that runs along the back of the embryo&amp;mdash;has been formed from the mesoderm.  During the third week of gestation the notochord sends chemical signals to the overlying ectoderm, inducing it to become neuroectoderm.  This results in a strip of neuronal stem cells that runs along the back of the embryo.  This strip is called the [[neural plate]], and is the origin of the entire nervous system.  The neural plate folds outwards to form the [[neural groove]].  Beginning in the future neck region, the [[neural folds]] of this groove close to create the [[neural tube]] (this form of neurulation is called [[primary neurulation]]).  The ventral (front) part of the neural tube is called the [[basal plate (neural tube)|basal plate]]; the dorsal (rear) part is called the [[alar plate]].  The hollow interior is called the [[neural canal]].  By the end of the fourth week of gestation, the open ends of the neural tube (the '''neuropores''') close off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Estomih Mtui |author2=Gregory Gruener |title=Clinical Neuroanatomy and Neuroscience |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2006 |pages=1 |isbn=1-4160-3445-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of the spinal cord===

[[File:Gray640.png|thumb|Cross-section of a developing spinal cord at four weeks.]]The spinal cord forms from the lower part of the neural tube.  The wall of the neural tube consists of neuroepithelial cells, which differentiate into neuroblasts, forming the mantle layer (the gray matter).  Nerve fibers emerge from these neuroblasts to form the marginal layer (the white matter).

The ventral part of the mantle layer (the basal plates) forms the motor areas of the spinal cord, whilst the dorsal part (the alar plates) forms the sensory areas.  Between the basal and alar plates is an intermediate layer that contains neurons of the autonomic nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://embryo.chronolab.com/spinal.htm Atlas of Human Embryology, Chronolab].

===Formation of the brain===

[[File:4 week embryo brain.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The embryo's brain at four weeks.]]
Late in the fourth week, the superior part of the neural tube flexes at the level of the future midbrain&amp;mdash;the [[mesencephalon]].  Above the [[mesencephalon]] is the [[prosencephalon]] (future forebrain) and beneath it is the [[rhombencephalon]] (future hindbrain).  The [[optical vesicle]] (which will eventually become the optic nerve, retina and iris) forms at the basal plate of the prosencephalon.
{{Clear}}

[[File:6 week human embryo nervous system.svg|thumb|right|The embryo's nervous system at six weeks.]]
In the fifth week, the alar plate of the prosencephalon expands to form the cerebral hemispheres (the [[telencephalon]]).  The basal plate becomes the [[diencephalon]].

The diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon constitute the [[brain stem]] of the embryo.  It continues to flex at the mesencephalon.  The rhombencephalon folds posteriorly, which causes its alar plate to flare and form the fourth ventricle of the brain.  The [[pons]] and the [[cerebellum]] form in the upper part of the rhombencephalon, whilst the medulla oblongata forms in the lower part.

==Neuronal migration== &lt;!--Neuronal migration redirects here--&gt;
Neuronal [[Cellular migration|migration]] is the method by which neurons travel from their origin or birthplace to their final position in the brain. There most common means of migration are radial and tangential migration.  

===Radial migration===
Neuronal precursor cells proliferate in the ventricular zone of the developing [[neocortex]]. The first  [[mitosis|postmitotic]] cells to migrate from the preplate which are destined to become [[Cajal-Retzius cells]] and [[subplate]] neurons. These cells do so by somal translocation. Neurons migrating with this mode of locomotion are bipolar and attach the leading edge of the process to the [[Pia mater|pia]]. The [[soma (biology)|soma]] is then transported to the pial surface by nucleokenisis, a process by which a [[microtubules|microtubule]] "cage" around the nucleus elongates and contracts in association with the [[centrosome]] to guide the nucleus to its final destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Samuels BA, Tsai LH | title = Nucleokinesis illuminated | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 11 | pages = 1169–70 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15508010 | doi = 10.1038/nn1104-1169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radial fibres (also known as radial glia) can translocate to the cortical plate and differentiate either into [[astrocyte]]s or [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell K, Götz M | title = Radial glia: multi-purpose cells for vertebrate brain development | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 235–8 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11972958 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(02)02156-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Somal translocation can occur at any time during development.&lt;ref name=Nadar1&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nadarajah B, Brunstrom JE, Grutzendler J, Wong RO, Pearlman AL | title = Two modes of radial migration in early development of the cerebral cortex | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–50 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11175874 | doi = 10.1038/83967 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent waves of neurons split the preplate by migrating along [[radial glia]]l fibres to form the cortical plate. Each wave of migrating cells travel past their predecessors forming layers in an inside-out manner, meaning that the youngest neurons are the closest to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nadarajah B, Parnavelas JG | title = Modes of neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex | journal = Nature Reviews. Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = 423–32 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12042877 | doi = 10.1038/nrn845 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rakic P | title = Mode of cell migration to the superficial layers of fetal monkey neocortex | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 145 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–83 | date = May 1972 | pmid = 4624784 | doi = 10.1002/cne.901450105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that glial guided migration represents 80-90% of migrating neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/201/readings/03.08-NeuralMigration.pdf|title=Central Nervous System Neuronal Migration|last=Hatten|first=Mary|publisher=Annual Reviews in Neuroscience|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axophilic migration===
Many neurons migrating along the anterior-posterior axis of the body use existing axon tracts to migrate along in a process called axophilic migration. An example of this mode of migration is in [[GnRH Neuron|GnRH-expressing neurons]], which make a long journey from their birthplace in the nose, through the forebrain, and into the hypothalamus.&lt;ref name=Wray10&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wray S | title = From nose to brain: development of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-1 neurones | journal = Journal of Neuroendocrinology | volume = 22 | issue = 7 | pages = 743–53 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20646175 | pmc = 2919238 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2826.2010.02034.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the mechanisms of this migration have been worked out, starting with the extracellular guidance cues&lt;ref name=Giacobini07&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giacobini P, Messina A, Wray S, Giampietro C, Crepaldi T, Carmeliet P, Fasolo A | title = Hepatocyte growth factor acts as a motogen and guidance signal for gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone-1 neuronal migration | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 431–45 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17215404 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4979-06.2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that trigger intracellular signaling. These intracellular signals, such as [[calcium signaling]], lead to [[actin]] &lt;ref name=Hutchins13&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hutchins BI, Klenke U, Wray S | title = Calcium release-dependent actin flow in the leading process mediates axophilic migration | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 33 | issue = 28 | pages = 11361–71 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23843509 | pmc = 3724331 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3758-12.2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and microtubule &lt;ref name=Hutchins14&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hutchins BI, Wray S | title = Capture of microtubule plus-ends at the actin cortex promotes axophilic neuronal migration by enhancing microtubule tension in the leading process | journal = Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | volume = 8 | pages = 400 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25505874 | pmc = 4245908 | doi = 10.3389/fncel.2014.00400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; cytoskeletal dynamics, which produce cellular forces that interact with the extracellular environment through cell adhesion proteins &lt;ref name=Parkash12&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parkash J, Cimino I, Ferraris N, Casoni F, Wray S, Cappy H, Prevot V, Giacobini P | title = Suppression of β1-integrin in gonadotropin-releasing hormone cells disrupts migration and axonal extension resulting in severe reproductive alterations | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 32 | issue = 47 | pages = 16992–7002 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23175850 | pmc = 5238668 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3057-12.2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to cause the movement of these cells.

===Tangential migration===
Most interneurons migrate tangentially through multiple modes of migration to reach their appropriate location in the cortex. An example of tangential migration is the movement of [[Cajal–Retzius cell|Cajal-Retzius cells]] within the marginal zone of the cortical neuroepithelium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen JP, Zhang DW, Liu JM | title = Exotic skyrmion crystals in chiral magnets with compass anisotropy | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 29126 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27377149 | pmc = 4932608 | doi = 10.1038/srep29126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Others===
There is also a method of neuronal migration called '''multipolar migration'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabata H, Nakajima K | title = Multipolar migration: the third mode of radial neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 31 | pages = 9996–10001 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14602813 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/23/31/9996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nadarajah B, Alifragis P, Wong RO, Parnavelas JG | title = Neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex: observations based on real-time imaging | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 607–11 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12764035 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.6.607 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen in  multipolar cells, which are abundantly present in the [[cortical intermediate zone]]. They do not resemble the cells migrating by locomotion or somal translocation. Instead these multipolar cells express neuronal markers and extend multiple thin processes in various directions independently of the radial glial fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabata H, Nakajima K | title = Multipolar migration: the third mode of radial neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 31 | pages = 9996–10001 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14602813 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14602813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurotrophic factors==
[[Neurotrophic factor]]s are molecules which promote and regulate neuronal survival in the developing nervous system. They are distinguished from ubiquitous [[metabolite]]s necessary for cellular maintenance and growth by their specificity; each neurotrophic factor promotes the survival of only certain kinds of neurons during a particular stage of their development. In addition, it had been argued that neurotrophic factors are involved in many other aspects of [[neuronal development]] ranging from axonal guidance to regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Davies (1 May 1988)"Trends In Genetics", Volume 4-Issue 5; Department of Anatomy, St George's Hospital Medical School, Cranmer Terrace, Tooting, London SW17 0RE, UK&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult neurogenesis==
{{main article|Adult neurogenesis}}
Contrary to popular belief, [[neurogenesis]] also occurs in specific parts of the adult brain.

==Adult neural development==
{{Main article|Neuroregeneration}}
Neurodevelopment in the adult nervous system includes mechanisms such as [[remyelination]], generation of new [[neuron]]s, [[glia]], [[axon]]s, [[myelin]] or [[synapse]]s. Neuroregeneration differs between the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS) and the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) by the functional mechanisms and especially, the extent and speed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5343">'''Editio Critica Maior (ECM)''' is a critical edition of the Greek New Testament being produced by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (Eng. "Institute for New Testament Textual Research") -which is famous for [[Kurt Aland|Kurt Aland's]] [[Novum Testamentum Graece|'''Nestle-Aland - Novum Testament Graece''']] e.g.- in collaboration with other international institutes. The 'ECM' documents the history of the Greek text through the first millennium on the basis of Greek manuscripts, old translations, and New Testament citations in ancient Christian literature that are of significance to the history of transmission. On the basis of genealogical investigations of the material, first prepared with this completeness, the original text of the [[Greek New Testament]] is reconstructed.
The Editio Critica Maior project is supported by the [[Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities]]. It is to be completed by the year 2030.

== The beginnings ==
Since the founding of the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (INTF) in 1959 by Kurt Aland, manuscripts – some of which had previously been unknown or lost, were traced and photographed, and all known manuscripts were photographed and cataloged. The INTF thus acquired over 90% of the known material on microfilm or photo.

== First evaluation ==
In the mid-1980s, a text program was developed. Uniform texts, which, as is well known, constituted the main part in the transmission of the high-middle age – have been dropped out. After the elimination of these texts, the material that is relevant to the textual history of the first millennium is now available: in addition to the manuscripts of this period, the numerous among later manuscripts, which reflect the older textual history. 
The (still) very high number of relevant manuscripts is gradually transcribed and subjected to a complete text comparison (Vollkollation). The results are recorded in databases. For the first time this allows a computer-assisted exploration of the entire material. Above all, the acquisition of genealogical data is important, which illuminates the textual history and especially its beginnings. 

== The digitization ==
The institute uses digital methods at all levels of its philological work: handwriting is captured in the highest possible quality as digital photos. These photos are the basis for the transcriptions to be made on the computer. Additionally digitized material from other institutes is taken into consideration. The software Collate is then used to prepare the critical edition. 

== The result ==
In 1997 the first installment of this edition was published by [[Barbara Aland]]. The ''Catholic Letters'' and also ''The Acts of the Apostels'' are available printed and digitally (by using the [[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]]). In cooperation with the [[International Greek New Testament Project]], the ''Johannesevangelium'' is in preparation. In addition an edition, that has been published in printed form, a digital platform - the [[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]] has been developed, which allows online access to all data collected during the work on the ECM. This includes above all the diplomatic transcripts of all the manuscripts used in the ECM and the databases on which the ECM is based on. 
The recent editions of ''Nestle-Aland'' in the 28th edition and the 5th edition of the ''Greek New Testament'' of the ''United Bible Societies'' are in the text after the ECM, as far as it has been published so far.

==Current editions==
The ''Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior'' is published by [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]] (the German Bible Society).

'''Electroactive polymers''', or '''EAPs''', are [[polymer]]s that exhibit a change in size or shape when stimulated by an [[electric field]]. The most common applications of this type of material are in [[actuator]]s&lt;ref name=ArtificialMuscles&gt;{{cite web |url= https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/37602/05-1898.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |title=Bar-Cohen, Yoseph: "Artificial Muscles using Electroactive Polymers (EAP): Capabilities, Challenges and Potential}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sensor]]s.&lt;ref name=EAPsensing&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wang, T. |author2=Farajollahi, M. |author3=Choi, Y.S. |author4=Lin, I.T. |author5=Marshall, J.E. |author6=Thompson, N.M. |author7=Kar-Narayan, S. |author8=Madden, J.D.W. |author9= Smoukov, S.K. |title= Electroactive polymers for sensing |url= http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/20160026 |year=2016 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=1–19 |doi= 10.1098/rsfs.2016.0026 |pmc= 4918837}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical characteristic property of an EAP is that they will undergo a large amount of deformation while sustaining large [[force]]s.

The majority of historic actuators are made of [[ceramic]] [[piezoelectric]] materials. While these materials are able to withstand large forces, they commonly will only deform a fraction of a percent. In the late 1990s, it has been demonstrated that some EAPs can exhibit up to a 380% [[strain (mechanics) |strain]], which is much more than any ceramic actuator.&lt;ref name=ArtificialMuscles/&gt; One of the most common applications for EAPs is in the field of [[robotics]] in the development of artificial muscles; thus, an electroactive polymer is often referred to as an [[artificial muscle]].
{{toclimit|3}}

==History==
The field of EAPs emerged back in 1880, when [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] designed an experiment in which he tested the effect of an electrostatic field on the mechanical properties of a stripe of natural rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Keplinger |first=Christoph |last2= Kaltenbrunner |first2=Martin |last3=Arnold |first3=Nikita |last4=Bauer |first4= Siegfried |date= 2010-03-09 |title= Röntgen's electrode-free elastomer actuators without electromechanical pull-in instability |url= http://www.pnas.org/content/107/10/4505 |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=10 |pages=4505–4510 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0913461107 |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=2825178 |pmid= 20173097}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rubber stripe was fixed at one end and was attached to a [[mass]] at the other. Electric charges were then sprayed onto the rubber, and it was observed that the length changed. It was in 1925 that the first [[piezoelectric]] polymer was discovered ([[Electret]]). Electret was formed by combining [[carnauba wax]], [[rosin]] and [[beeswax]], and then cooling the solution while it is subject to an applied [[Direct Current|DC]] [[electrical bias]]. The mixture would then solidify into a polymeric material that exhibited a [[piezoelectric effect]].

Polymers that respond to environmental conditions, other than an applied [[electric current]], have also been a large part of this area of study. In 1949 Katchalsky ''et al.'' demonstrated that when [[collagen]] filaments are dipped in [[acid]] or [[alkali]] solutions, they would respond with a change in [[volume]].&lt;ref name="ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm |title=Electrochemistry Encyclopedia: Electroactive Polymers (EAP) |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212015419/http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm |archivedate= 2012-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collagen filaments were found to expand in an [[acidic]] solution and contract in an [[alkali]] solution. Although other stimuli (such as [[pH]]) have been investigated, due to its ease and practicality most research has been devoted to developing polymers that respond to electrical stimuli in order to mimic biological systems.

The next major breakthrough in EAPs took place in the late 1960s. In 1969 Kawai demonstrated that [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF) exhibits a large piezoelectric effect.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia /&gt; This sparked research interest in developing other polymers systems that would show a similar effect. In 1977 the first electrically [[conducting polymer]]s were discovered by [[Hideki Shirakawa]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name=EAPHistory&gt;{{cite journal |author= Finkenstadt, Victoria L. |title=Natural polysaccharides as electroactive polymers |journal=Appl Microbiol Biotechnol |year=2005 |volume=67 |pmid= 15724215 |issue=6 |pages= 735–745 |doi= 10.1007/s00253-005-1931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirakawa along with [[Alan MacDiarmid]] and [[Alan Heeger]] demonstrated that [[polyacetylene]] was electrically conductive, and that by doping it with [[iodine]] vapor, they could enhance its [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] by 8 orders of magnitude. Thus the [[electrical conductance|conductance]] was close to that of a metal. By the late 1980s a number of other polymers had been shown to exhibit a [[piezoelectric effect]] or were demonstrated to be conductive.

In the early 1990s, [[ionic polymer-metal composite]]s (IPMCs) were developed and shown to exhibit electroactive properties far superior to previous EAPs. The major advantage of IPMCs was that they were able to show activation (deformation) at [[voltage]]s as low as 1 or 2 [[volt]]s.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia /&gt; This is orders of magnitude less than any previous EAP. Not only was the activation energy for these materials much lower, but they could also undergo much larger deformations. IPMCs were shown to exhibit anywhere up to 380% strain, orders of magnitude larger than previously developed EAPs.&lt;ref name=ArtificialMuscles /&gt;

In 1999, [[Yoseph Bar-Cohen]] proposed the [[Armwrestling Match of EAP Robotic Arm Against Human]] Challenge.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia /&gt; This was a challenge in which research groups around the world competed to design a robotic arm consisting of EAP muscles that could defeat a human in an [[arm wrestling]] match. The first challenge was held at the Electroactive Polymer Actuators and Devices Conference in 2005.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia /&gt; Another major milestone of the field is that the first commercially developed device including EAPs as an artificial muscle was produced in 2002 by Eamex in Japan.&lt;ref name=ArtificialMuscles /&gt; This device was a fish that was able to swim on its own, moving its tail using an EAP muscle. But the progress in practical development has not been satisfactory.&lt;ref name=Mistakes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ali Eftekhari |title=Comment on "A Linear Actuation of Polymeric Nanofibrous Bundle for Artificial Muscles" |journal= Chemistry of Materials |year=2010 |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=2689 |doi= 10.1021/cm903343t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DARPA]]-funded research in the 1990s at [[SRI International]] and led by Ron Pelrine developed an electroactive polymer using silicone and acrylic polymers; the technology was spun off into the company [[Artificial Muscle (company)|Artificial Muscle]] in 2003, with industrial production beginning in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avsusergroups.org/tfug_pdfs/2008_2feldman.pdf|title=Electroactive Polymer Artificial Muscle - A Polymer Based Generator?|first=Randy|last=Feldman|work=Thin Film Users Group|publisher=Northern California Chapter of the American Vacuum Society|date=2008-02-20|accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Artificial Muscle became a subsidiary of [[Bayer MaterialScience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/engage/products-solutions/epam|title=Electroactive Polymer "Artificial Muscle"|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
EAP can have several configurations, but are generally divided in two principal classes: Dielectric and Ionic.

===Dielectric===
[[Dielectric elastomers|Dielectric EAPs]] are materials in which actuation is caused by [[electrostatic]] forces between two electrodes which squeeze the polymer. Dielectric elastomers are capable of very high strains and are fundamentally a capacitor that changes its capacitance when a voltage is applied by allowing the polymer to compress in thickness and expand in area due to the electric field. This type of EAP typically requires a large actuation voltage to produce high electric fields (hundreds to thousands of [[volt]]s), but very low [[electrical]] [[power (physics)|power]] consumption. Dielectric EAPs require no power to keep the actuator at a given position. Examples are electrostrictive polymers and dielectric elastomers.

====Ferroelectric polymers====
[[Ferroelectric polymers]] are a group of crystalline polar polymers that are also [[ferroelectric]], meaning that they maintain a permanent [[electric polarization]] that can be reversed, or switched, in an external [[electric field]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ferroelectric Properties of Vinylidene Fluoride Copolymers," by T. Furukawa, in ''Phase Transitions'', Vol. '''18''', pp. 143-211 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Polymers"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Nalwa |first1= H. |title= Ferroelectric Polymers |edition= First |year= 1995 |publisher= Marcel Dekker, INC. |location= New York |isbn= 0-8247-9468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferroelectric polymers, such as [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF), are used in acoustic transducers and electromechanical actuators because of their inherent [[piezoelectric]] response, and as heat sensors because of their inherent [[pyroelectric]] response.&lt;ref name=lovinger&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.220.4602.1115 | author=Lovinger, A.J. | title=Ferroelectric polymers. | journal=Science | year=1983 | volume=220 | issue=4602 | pages=1115–1121 | pmid=17818472}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Polyvinylidene fluoride.png|right|thumb|Figure 1: Structure of Poly(vinylidene fluoride)]]

====Electrostrictive graft polymers====
[[image:Electrostrictive Graft PolymerII.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Figure 2: Cartoon of an electrostrictive graft polymer.]]

Electrostrictive graft polymers consist of flexible backbone chains with branching side chains. The side chains on neighboring backbone polymers cross link and form crystal units. The backbone and side chain crystal units can then form polarized monomers, which contain atoms with partial charges and generate dipole moments, shown in Figure 2.&lt;ref name="Electrostrictive Graft"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Youqi|author2=Changjie Sun |author3=Eric Zhou |author4=Ji Su |year=2004|title=Deformation Mechanisms of Electrostrictive Graft Elastomers|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|volume=13|pages=1407–1413|issn=0964-1726 |doi=10.1088/0964-1726/13/6/011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an electrical field is applied, a force is applied to each partial charge and causes rotation of the whole polymer unit. This rotation causes electrostrictive strain and deformation of the polymer.

====Liquid crystalline polymers====
Main-chain liquid crystalline polymers have [[mesogen]]ic groups linked to each other by a flexible spacer. The mesogens within a backbone form the mesophase structure causing the polymer itself to adopt a conformation compatible with the structure of the mesophase. The direct coupling of the liquid crystalline order with the polymer conformation has given main-chain liquid crystalline elastomers a large amount of interest.&lt;ref name="LCpol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ishige|first=Ryohei|author2=Masatoshi Tokita |author3=Yu Naito |author4=Chun Ying Zhang |author5=Junji Watanabe |date=January 22, 2008|title=Unusual Formation of Smectic A Structure in Cross-Linked Monodomain Elastomer of Main-Chain LC Polyester with 3-Methylpentane Spacer|journal=Macromolecules|publisher=American Chemical Society|volume=41|issue=7|pages=2671–2676|doi=10.1021/ma702686c}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synthesis of highly oriented elastomers leads to have a large strain thermal actuation along the polymer chain direction with temperature variation resulting in unique mechanical properties and potential applications as mechanical actuators.

===Ionic===
*[[Ion]]ic EAPs, in which actuation is caused by the displacement of ions inside the polymer. Only a few volts are needed for actuation, but the ionic flow implies a higher electrical power needed for actuation, and energy is needed to keep the actuator at a given position. Examples of ionic EAPS are [[conductive polymer]]s, [[ionic polymer-metal composite]]s (IPMCs), and responsive gels. Yet another example is a Bucky gel actuator, which is a polymer-supported layer of [[polyelectrolyte]] material consisting of an [[ionic liquid]] sandwiched between two [[electrode]] layers consisting of a [[gel]] of ionic liquid containing single-wall [[carbon nanotube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1557/mrs2008.47|author1=Qu, L. |author2=Peng, Q. |author3=Dai, L. |author4=Spinks, G.M. |author5=Wallace, G.G. |author6=Baughman, R.H. |title=Carbon Nanotube Electroactive Polymer Materials: Opportunities and Challenges|journal=MRS Bulletin|year=2008|volume=33|issue=03|pages=215–224}}{{ ISSN|0883-7694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the similarity of the gel to the paper that can be made by filtering carbon nanotubes, the so-called [[buckypaper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110429473/ABSTRACT ''Fully Plastic Actuator through Layer-by-Layer Casting with Ionic-Liquid-Based Bucky Gel''] Takanori Fukushima, Kinji Asaka, Atsuko Kosaka, Takuzo Aida p. Angewandte Chemie International Edition Volume 44, Issue 16 2410 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Electrorheological fluid====
{{Main|Electrorheological Fluid}}

[[Image:EAP-composite.png|300px|thumb|Center| Figure 3: The cations in the ionic polymer-metal composite are randomly oriented in the absence of an electric field. Once a field is applied the cations gather to the side of the polymer in contact with the anode causing the polymer to bend.]]

Electrorheological fluids change the viscosity of a solution with the application of an electric field. The fluid is a suspension of polymers in a low dielectric-constant liquid.&lt;ref name="Polymer Rheology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glass|first=J. Edward|author2=Schulz, Donald N. |author3=Zukosi, C.F |title=Polymers as Rheology Modifiers|publisher=American Chemical Society|date=May 13, 1991|series=ACS Symposium Series|volume=462|pages=2–17|chapter=1|isbn=9780841220096}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the application of a large electric field the viscosity of the suspension increases. Potential applications of these fluids include shock absorbers, engine mounts and acoustic dampers.&lt;ref name="Polymer Rheology" /&gt;

====Ionic polymer-metal composite====
{{Main|Ionic polymer-metal composite}}

Ionic polymer-metal composites consist of a thin ionomeric membrane with noble metal electrodes plated on its surface. It also has cations to balance the charge of the anions fixed to the polymer backbone.&lt;ref name="IPM composites"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemat-Nasser|first=S.|author2=Thomas, C.|title=Electroactive Polymer (EAP) Actuators as Articifial Muscles-Reality, Potential and Challenges|editor=Yoseph Bar-Cohen|publisher=SPIE Press|year=2001|pages=139–191|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are very active [[actuator]]s that show very high deformation at low applied voltage and show low impedance. Ionic polymer-metal composites work through electrostatic attraction between the cationic counter ions and the cathode of the applied electric field, a schematic representation is shown in Figure 3. These types of polymers show the greatest promise for bio-mimetic uses as collagen fibers are essentially composed of natural charged ionic polymers.&lt;ref name="IPMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndeaa.jpl.nasa.gov/nasa-nde/papers/spie98/SPIE98-mo.PDF|title=Ionic Polymer-Metal Composties (IPMC) As Biomimetic Sensors and Actuators|last=Shahinpoor|first=M. |author2=Y. Bar-Cohen |author3=T. Xue |author4=J.O. Simpson |author5=J. Smith|date=5 March 1996|publisher=SPIE|pages=17|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nafion and Flemion are commonly used ionic polymer metal composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1557/mrs2008.44|author1=Park, I.S. |author2=Jung, K. |author3=Kim, D. |author4=Kim, S.M |author5=Kim, K.J. |title=Physical Principles of Ionic Polymer–Metal Composites as Electroactive Actuators and Sensors|journal=MRS Bulletin|year=2008|volume=33|issue=03|pages=190–195}}{{ ISSN|0883-7694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stimuli-responsive gels====
Stimuli-responsive gels (hydrogels, when the swelling agent is an aqueous solution) are a special kind of swellable polymer networks with volume phase transition behaviour. These materials change reversibly their volume, optical, mechanical and other properties by very small alterations of certain physical (e.g. electric field, light, temperature) or chemical (concentrations) stimuli. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last= Zolfagharian |first=Ali |author2= Abbas Z. Kouzani |author3= Sui Yang Khoo |author4= Akif Kaynak |year=2016 |title=3D printed hydrogel soft actuators |work=In Region 10 Conference (TENCON), 2016 IEEE |publisher=IEEE |doi= 10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848433}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume change of these materials occurs by swelling/shrinking and is diffusion-based. Gels provide the biggest change in volume of solid-state materials.&lt;ref name ="Hydrogel Sensors and Actuators"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gerlach |first1= G. |last2= Arndt |first2= K.-F. |title= Hydrogel Sensors and Actuators |edition= First |year= 2009 |publisher= Springer |location= Berlin |isbn= 978-3-540-75644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with an excellent compatibility with micro-fabrication technologies, especially stimuli-responsive hydrogels are of strong increasing interest for microsystems with sensors and actuators. Current fields of research and application are chemical sensor systems, microfluidics and multimodal imaging systems.

==Comparison of dielectric and ionic EAPs==
Dielectric polymers are able to hold their induced displacement while activated under a DC voltage.&lt;ref name="Editorial"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bar-Cohen |first=Yoseph |author2= Kwang J Kim |author3=Hyouk Ryeol Choi |author4=John D W Madden |year=2007 |title= Electroactive Polymer Materials |journal= Smart Materials and Structures |publisher= Institute of Physics Publishing |volume=16 |issue=2 |doi= 10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/E01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows dielectric polymers to be considered for robotic applications. These types of materials also have high mechanical energy density and can be operated in air without a major decrease in performance. However, dielectric polymers require very high activation fields (&gt;10&amp;nbsp;V/µm) that are close to the breakdown level.

The activation of ionic polymers, on the other hand, requires only 1-2&amp;nbsp;volts. They however need to maintain wetness, though some polymers have been developed as self-contained encapsulated activators which allows their use in dry environments.&lt;ref name=IPMC /&gt; Ionic polymers also have a low electromechanical coupling. They are however ideal for bio-mimetic devices.

==Characterization==
While there are many different ways electroactive polymers can be characterized, only three will be addressed here: stress–strain curve, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and dielectric thermal analysis.

===Stress–strain curve===
{{Main|Stress–strain curve}}
[[image:LCpolymersII.png|thumb|250px|right|Figure 4: The unstressed polymer spontaneously forms a folded structure, upon application of a stress the polymer regains its original length.]]
Stress strain curves provide information about the polymer's mechanical properties such as the brittleness, elasticity and yield strength of the polymer. This is done by providing a force to the polymer at a uniform rate and measuring the deformation that results.&lt;ref name="Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowie|first=J.M.G.|author2=Valerai Arrighi|title=Polymers: Chemistry and Physics of Modern Material|publisher=CRC Press|location=Florida|year=2008|edition=Third|pages=363–373|chapter=13|isbn=978-0-8493-9813-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this deformation is shown in Figure 4. This technique is useful for determining the type of material (brittle, tough, etc.), but it is a destructive technique as the stress is increased until the polymer fractures.

===Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA)===
{{Main|Dynamic mechanical analysis}}

Both dynamic mechanical analysis is a non destructive technique that is useful in understanding the mechanism of deformation at a molecular level. In DMTA a sinusoidal stress is applied to the polymer, and based on the polymer's deformation the [[elastic modulus]] and damping characteristics are obtained (assuming the polymer is a [[damped harmonic oscillator]]).&lt;ref name=Textbook /&gt; Elastic materials take the mechanical energy of the stress and convert it into potential energy which can later be recovered. An ideal spring will use all the potential energy to regain its original shape (no damping), while a liquid will use all the potential energy to flow, never returning to its original position or shape (high damping). A viscoeleastic polymer will exhibit a combination of both types of behavior.&lt;ref name=Textbook /&gt;

===Dielectric thermal analysis (DETA)===
{{Main|Dielectric thermal analysis}}

DETA is similar to DMTA, but instead of an alternating mechanical force an alternating electric field is applied. The applied field can lead to polarization of the sample, and if the polymer contains groups that have permanent dipoles (as in Figure 2), they will align with the electrical field.&lt;ref name= Textbook /&gt; The [[permittivity]] can be measured from the change in amplitude and resolved into dielectric storage and loss components. The [[electric displacement field]] can also be measured by following the current.&lt;ref name=Textbook /&gt; Once the field is removed, the dipoles will relax back into a random orientation.

==Applications==
[[Image:Artificial Muscle.png|300px|thumb|Figure 5: Cartoon drawing of an arm controlled by EAPs. When a voltage is applied (blue muscles) the polymer expands. When the voltage is removed (red muscles) the polymer returns to its original state.]]EAP materials can be easily manufactured into various shapes due to the ease in processing many polymeric materials, making them very versatile materials. One potential application for EAPs is that they can potentially be integrated into [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) to produce smart actuators.

===Artificial muscles===
As the most prospective practical research direction, EAPs have been used in artificial muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first= K.J.|author2=Tadokoro, S.|title=Electroactive Polymers for Robotic Applications, Artificial Muscles and Sensors|publisher=Springer|location=London|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84628-371-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zolfagharian|first=Ali|author2=Abbas Z.

===Tactile displays===
In recent years, "electro active polymers for refreshable [[Braille]] displays"&lt;ref name="Electroactive polymers for refreshable Braille displays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spie.org/x37076.xml?ArticleID=x37076|title=Electroactive polymers for refreshable Braille displays|last=Bar-Cohen|first=Yoseph|date=11 September 2009|publisher=SPIE}}&lt;/ref&gt; has emerged to aid the visually impaired in fast reading and computer assisted communication. This concept is based on using an EAP actuator configured in an array form. Rows of [[electrode]]s on one side of an EAP film and columns on the other activate individual elements in the array. Each element is mounted with a Braille dot and is lowered by applying a voltage across the thickness of the selected element, causing local thickness reduction. Under computer control, dots would be activated to create tactile patterns of highs and lows representing the information to be read.

[[File:Artificial skin.jpg|thumb|Figure 6: High resolution tactile display consisting of 4,320 (60x72) actuator pixels based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels. The integration density of the device is 297 components per cm². This display gives visual (monochromic) and physical (contours, relief, textures, softness) impressions of a virtual surface.]]Visual and tactile impressions of a virtual surface are displayed by a high resolution tactile display, a so-called "artificial skin" (Fig.6) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.200802737|author1=Richter, A. |author2=Paschew, G. |title=Optoelectrothermic Control of Highly Integrated Polymer-Based MEMS Applied in an Artificial Skin|journal=Advanced Materials|year=2009|volume=21|issue=9|pages=979–983}}&lt;/ref&gt; These monolithic devices consist of an array of thousands of multimodal modulators (actuator pixels) based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels. Each modulator is able to change individually their transmission, height and softness. Besides their possible use as graphic displays for visually impaired such displays are interesting as free programmable keys of touchpads and consoles.

===Microfluidics===
EAP materials have huge potential for microfluidics e.g. as [[drug delivery]] systems, [[microfluidic device]]s and [[lab-on-a-chip]]. A first microfluidic platform technology reported in literature is based on stimuli-responsive gels. To avoid the electrolysis of water hydrogel-based microfluidic devices are mainly based on temperature-responsive polymers with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) characteristics, which are controlled by an electrothermic interface. Two types of micropumps are known, a diffusion micropump and a displacement micropump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/B810256B |author1=Richter, A. |author2=Klatt, S. |author3=Paschew, G. |author4=Klenke, C. |title=Micropumps operated by swelling and shrinking of temperature-sensitive hydrogels|journal=Lab on a Chip|year=2009|volume=9| pages=613–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microvalves based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels show some advantageous properties such as particle tolerance, no leakage and outstanding pressure resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JMEMS.2003.817898|author1=Richter, A. |author2=Kuckling, D. |author3=Howitz, S. |author4=Gehring, T |author5=Arndt, K.-F. |title=Electronically controllable microvalves based on smart hydrogels: magnitudes and potential applications|journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems|year=2003|volume=12|issue=5|pages=748–753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ac026455j|author= Yu, C., Mutlu, S., Selvaganapathy, P.

Chemical transistors form the basis of microchemomechanical fluidic integrated circuits. "Chemical ICs" process exclusively chemical information, are energy-self-powered, operate automatically and are able for large-scale integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C2LC40617A|author= Greiner, R., Allerdißen, M., Voigt, A., Richter A.|title=Fluidic microchemomechanical integrated circuits processing chemical information|journal=Lab on a Chip|year=2012|volume=12|issue=23|pages=5034–5044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another microfluidic platform is based on [[ionomeric]] materials. Pumps made from that material could offer low voltage ([[battery (electricity)|battery]]) operation, extremely low noise signature, high system efficiency, and highly accurate control of flow rate.&lt;ref name="Electroactive Polymer Pumps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discover-technologies.com/applications.html|title=Electroactive Polymer Pumps|date=7 June 2009|publisher=Discover technologies Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technology that can benefit from the unique properties of EAP actuators is optical membranes. Due to their low modulus, the mechanical impedance of the actuators, they are well-matched to common optical [[membrane (selective barrier)|membrane]] materials. Also, a single EAP actuator is capable of generating displacements that range from micrometers to centimeters. For this reason, these materials can be used for static shape correction and jitter suppression. These actuators could also be used to correct for [[optical aberration]]s due to atmospheric interference.&lt;ref name="Adaptive Membrane Optics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discover-technologies.com/applications.html|title=Adaptive Membrane Optics|date=7 June 2009|publisher=Discover technologies Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these materials exhibit excellent electroactive character, EAP materials show potential in [[biomimetic]]-robot research, stress sensors and [[acoustics]] field, which will make EAPs become a more attractive study topic in the near future. They have been used for various actuators such as face muscles and arm muscles in humanoid robots.&lt;ref&gt;http://eap.jpl.nasa.gov/ NASA WorldWide Electroactive Polymer Actuators Webhub&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
The field of EAPs is far from mature, which leaves several issues that still need to be worked on.&lt;ref name="ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia"/&gt; The performance and long-term stability of the EAP should be improved by designing a water [[semipermeable membrane|impermeable]] surface. This will prevent the [[evaporation]] of water contained in the EAP, and also reduce the potential loss of the positive counter ions when the EAP is operating submerged in an [[aqueous]] environment. Improved surface conductivity should be explored using methods to produce a defect-free conductive surface. This could possibly be done using metal vapor deposition or other doping methods. It may also be possible to utilize conductive polymers to form a thick conductive layer. Heat resistant EAP would be desirable to allow operation at higher voltages without damaging the internal structure of the EAP due to the generation of heat in the EAP composite. Development of EAPs in different configurations (e.g., fibers and fiber bundles), would also be beneficial, in order to increase the range of possible modes of motion.

'''NCF-Envirothon''' is an annual [[environmental movement|environmentally themed]] [[academic]] competition for high school aged students organized by the NCF-Envirothon a program of the National Conservation Foundation. The competition is held by the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on a regional, state, and bi-national level. Envirothon combines in-class and hands-on environmental education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Forestry Association New Brunswick|url=http://www.cfanb.ca/the_envirothon_experience|publisher=CFANB|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in a competition setting which involves a problem-solving presentation as well as written field tests. The competition tests students on five core subjects- [[aquatic ecology]], [[forestry]], [[soils|soils and land use]], [[wildlife]]- along with a fifth annually-changing subtopic which focuses on relevant environmental issues. Currently, roughly 500,000 students from forty-five U.S. states and nine Canadian provinces/territories participate in the competition.&lt;ref name = "canon enviro"&gt;{{Citation

  | year = 2008
  | url = http://envirothon.vologon.com/index.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States and provinces across the United States and Canada each have their own local competitions from which the winning high school team earns the privilege of representing their state/province at the NCF-Envirothon competition, held each summer in a different U.S. state or Canadian province. In areas with a considerable number of teams, subdivisions such as county, regional, or district competitions are also held.  Teams must win these intermediary competitions in order to move on to the state/province levels.

==Organizers and Sponsors==
The NCF-Envirothon is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)3]] [[Nonprofit organization]] headquartered in Washington,D.C. Coordinating the delivery of the North American competition, the organization also relies heavily on volunteers across North America to advise individual teams from each participating state and province.&lt;ref name="Envirothon: About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Envirothon: About Us|url=http://www.envirothon.org/about-us.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governing the program is the National Conservation Foundation (NCF) Executive, along with a NCF-Evirothon Operating Committee which is made up of representatives from participating states and provinces.&lt;ref name="History of Envirothon" /&gt;

Envirothon is sponsored by the [[National Natural Resources Conservation Foundation|National Conservation Foundation]], the [[Conservation district|National Association of Conservation Districts]], the [[United States Forest Service]], and the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].&lt;ref name="Envirothon: Sponsors"&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Envirothon: Sponsors|url=http://www.envirothon.org/sponsors.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Individual teams are often sponsored by school clubs or classes, local businesses and governments, or [[4H]] and other such non-scholastic organizations.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

==Competition==

Competition participants are generally teams of five students with one to two team advisers. Home-schoolers can also take part as their own team.

States and provinces across the United States and Canada each have their own local competitions from which the winning high school team earns the privilege of representing their state/province at the North American Envirothon Competition, held each summer in a different U.S. state or Canadian province. In regions with a considerable number of teams, competitions on subdivision, county, regional, or district levels are also held.  Teams must win these intermediary competitions in order to move on to the state/province levels. At the North American Competition, teams that rank first through tenth receive prizes and scholarships of various values.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

Competition week at the NCF-Envirothon level includes various workshops, field trips, and seminars led by professionals and educators for both the students and their advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Forestry Association|url=http://www.canadianforestry.com/html/education/envirothon_e.html|publisher=CFA|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these outings are linked to the current issue topic and provide information on the area in which the competition is being held.

During the competition, each team must complete five written field tests, each dealing with a different topic. These tests consist of various question types, including identifications and hands-on assessments. Each team must also prepare an oral presentation on the current issue topic, which the team presents to a panel of judges. An important element of the competition is the understanding that each topic is interrelated, and understanding human effects on the environment and how human activities connect with ecosystem functions. Each test is scored out of 100 points, with the presentation being scored out of 200 points. The team with the highest cumulative total of points at the end of the scoring is the winning team. Recognition is also given to teams with the highest scoring in each of the five categories.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

===Competition locations===
The location of the North American competition is determined based on a regional map that separates North America into five general regions: Far West, Mid-West, Southeast, Northeast, and Far North. The host college or university is usually located in a different region than that of the year preceding it.&lt;ref name="Future Competitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Envirothon: Future Competitions|url=http://www.envirothon.org/the-competition/future-competitions.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a competition (2013) was held in at [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]] in the Far West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=MSU picked as site for 2014 NCF-Envirothon competition|url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/news/montana_state_university/article_1e391598-11ce-11e2-a7f7-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=Bozeman Daily Chronicle|accessdate=20 November 2012|date=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Competition===
The 2015 NCF-Envirothon competition will be held July 27-August 7, and hosted at [[Missouri State University]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. 45 states and 9 Canadian provinces and Territories will registered for the competition. The current Issue Topic for that year's competition is Urban/Community Forestry. This will be the second time that the state of [[Missouri]] Missouri Envirothon hosts the NCF-Envirothon Competition.&lt;ref name="Present Competition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Montana to Host North America’s Largest High School Natural Resource Competition|url=http://www.roundupweb.com/story/2012/09/26/news/montana-to-host-north-americas-largest-high-school-natural-resource-competition/1316.html|publisher=Roundup Web|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition Topics==
{{More references|section|date=January 2015}}

Each field test dealing with one of five competition topics requires both theoretical understandings and hand-on skills such as identification and chemical testing. Each topic also has a degree of relatedness to one another, which is sometimes considered in theoretical-based test questions.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

===Aquatic Ecology===
[[File:Envirothon Aquatic Ecology Test.jpg|thumb|Aquatic Ecology Testing at the 2011 Envirothon Competition.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;]]

===Current Issue===
*The fifth topic changes annually, and deals with issues affecting present-day society and environment.
*The Current Issue field test focuses on theoretical understandings of the issue in relation to the other four competition topics, as well as some hands-on activities.&lt;ref name="Current Competition"&gt;{{cite web|first=|title=Envirothon: Current Competition|url=http://www.envirothon.org/the-competition/current-competition.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current Issue Topics have included, Urban Forestry (2015), Sustainable Agriculture and Locally Grown (2014), Sustainable [[Rangeland Management]] (2013), [[Nonpoint source pollution]]/Low Impact Development (2012), Salt and Freshwater [[Estuary|Estuaries]] (2011), Protection of [[Groundwater]] Through Urban, Agricultural, and [[Environmental planning]] (2010) and Biodiversity in a Changing World (2009), among others in earlier years.&lt;ref name="Past Competitions"&gt;{{cite web|first=|title=Envirothon: Past Competitions|url=http://www.envirothon.org/the-competition/past-competitions.html|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1979 the Pennsylvania Soil and Water Conservation Districts set up the Environmental Olympics, later renamed Enviro-Olympics, to encourage interest in environmental issues through hands-on competition.&lt;ref name="History of Envirothon"&gt;{{cite web|title=History Of Envirothon|url=http://www.envirothon.org/pdf/history.pdf|publisher=North American Envirothon|accessdate=8 November 2012|author=April Smith|date=2 November 2010|year=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expanding rapidly to include forty conservation districts by 1987, it gained attention from other states, and in 1988, the program became the National Envirothon, with participation from Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Ohio. In 1992 Nova Scotia became the first Canadian province to join the competition. The competition was sponsored by various state, local, and provincial conservation programs and associations until 1997 when [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] began its support of the program, with local sponsors still supporting lower level competitions.&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt; In 1999 Canon became the title sponsor of the competition between the U.S. states and Canadian provinces, with the competition being renamed the "Canon Envirothon." It is currently referred to as the "NCF-Envirothon."&lt;ref name="canon enviro" /&gt;

'''Folk etymology''' or '''reanalysis''' – sometimes called '''pseudo-etymology''', '''popular etymology''', or '''analogical reformation''' – is a change in a word or phrase resulting from the replacement of an unfamiliar form by a more familiar one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |folk-etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sihler2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew|title=Language History: An introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXlAYlCSoZQC|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-8546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trask2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=Robert Lawrence|authorlink=Larry Trask|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-218-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reanalyzed as resembling more familiar words or [[morpheme]]s. [[Rebracketing]] is a form of folk etymology in which a word is broken down or "bracketed" into a new set of supposed elements. [[Back-formation]], creating a new word by removing or changing parts of an existing word, is often based on folk etymology.

The term ''folk etymology'' is a [[loan translation]] from [[German language|German]] '''''Volksetymologie''''', coined by  [[Ernst Förstemann]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Förstemann|first=Ernst|editor=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete des Deutschen, Griechischen und Lateinischen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kMNAAAAYAAJ|year=1852|publisher=F. Dümmler.|chapter=Ueber Deutsche volksetymologie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk etymology is a [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process in [[historical linguistics]], [[language change]], and [[social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/ENGINEERING.pdf ''''Etymythological''' Othering' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] in ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'' (2006), ed. by Tope Omoniyi &amp; [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–258.&lt;/ref&gt; Reanalysis of a word's history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to [[loanword]]s or words that have become archaic or obsolete.

Examples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form [[wikt:sparrowgrass|''sparrowgrass'']], originally from Greek {{lang|el|ἀσπάραγος}} ("[[asparagus]]") remade by analogy to the more familiar words ''sparrow'' and ''grass'',&lt;ref name="Anttila1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anttila|first=Raimo|title=Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2C25_9m7U-AC|year=1989|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-3556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the word ''[[hamburger|burger]]'', originally from ''[[Hamburg]]'' + ''-er'' ("thing connected with"), but understood as ''ham'' + ''burger''.&lt;ref name="Shukla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shukla|first1=Shaligram|last2=Connor-Linton|first2=Jeff|editor=R. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton|title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlzthEZGkmsC|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84768-1|chapter=Language change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productive force ==
The technical term "folk etymology" refers to a change in the form of a word caused by erroneous popular beliefs about its etymology. The English word is a translation of the [[German language|German]] term ''Volksetymologie'', coined by [[Ernst Förstemann]]. Förstemann noted that in addition to scientific etymology based on careful study in [[philology]], there exist scholarly but often unsystematic accounts, as well as popular accounts for the history of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"/&gt; Until academic linguists developed comparative philology and described the laws underlying [[sound changes]], the derivation of words was a matter mostly of guess-work. Speculation about the original form of words in turn feeds back into the development of the word and thus becomes a part of a new etymology.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Etymology|volume=9|pages=864-865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing a word to have a certain origin, people begin to pronounce, spell, or otherwise use the word in a manner appropriate to that perceived origin.  This popular etymologizing has had a powerful influence on the forms which words take. Examples in English include ''[[crayfish]]'' or ''crawfish'', which are not historically related to ''fish'' but come from [[Middle English]] ''crevis'', [[cognate]] with French ''écrevisse''. Likewise ''chaise lounge'', from the original French ''chaise longue'' ("long chair"), has come to be associated with the word ''lounge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pyles |first1=Thomas |last2=Algeo |first2=John |title=The Origins and Development of the English Language |edition=4th |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=0030970547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
{{further|Rebracketing|Back-formation}}
[[Rebracketing]] is a process of [[language change]] in which parts of a word that appear to be meaningful (such as *''ham'' in ''hamburger'') are mistaken as elements of the word's etymology (in this case, the word ''[[ham]]''). Rebracketing functions by reanalyzing the constituent parts of a word. For example, the [[Old French]] word ''orenge'' ("orange tree") comes from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|النرنج }} ''an nāranj'' ("the orange tree"), with the initial ''n'' of ''nāranj'' understood as part of the [[Article (grammar)|article]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2013 | title = orange ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''adj''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary online | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | url =http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132163 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[back-formation]] a new word is created, often by removing elements thought to be [[affix]]es. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pronuncia'' ("pronunciation; accent") is derived from the verb ''pronunciare'' ("to pronounce; to utter") and English ''edit'' derives from ''editor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5675-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.&lt;ref name="Shukla" /&gt;

== Examples in English ==
In linguistic change caused by folk etymology, the form of a word changes so that it better matches its popular rationalisation.  Typically this happens either to unanalyzable foreign words or to compounds where the word underlying one part of the compound becomes obsolete.

=== Loanwords ===
There are many examples of words borrowed from foreign languages, and subsequently changed by folk etymology.

The spelling of many borrowed words reflects folk etymology. For example, ''[[Wikt:andiron|andiron]]'' borrowed from Old French was variously spelled ''aundyre'' or ''aundiren'' in Middle English, but was altered by association with ''iron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|andiron, n.|year=1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Old French loans altered in a similar manner include ''[[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]'' (from ''berfrei'') by association with ''bell'', ''female'' (from ''femelle'') by ''male'', and ''penthouse'' (from ''apentis'') by ''house''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The variant spelling of ''licorice'' as ''[[wikt:liquorice|liquorice]]'' comes from the supposition that it has something to do with liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology |last=Barnhart |first=Robert K. |editor-link=[[Robert Barnhart]] |year=1988 |publisher=H.W. Wilson |isbn=978-0-8242-0745-8|page=593|quote=The development of Late Latin ''liquiritia'' was in part influenced by Latin ''liquēre'' 'to flow', in reference to the process of treating the root to obtain its extract.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Norman ''licoris'' (influenced by ''licor'' "liquor") and [[Late Latin]] ''liquirītia'' were respelled for similar reasons, though the ultimate origin of all three is Greek ''{{lang|he|γλυκύρριζα}}'' (glycyrrhiza) "sweet root".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1|liquorice licorice, n.|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of loan words can affect their spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. The word ''cockroach'', for example, was borrowed from Spanish ''cucaracha'' but was assimilated to the existing English words ''cock'' and ''[[Common Roach|roach]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|cockroach, n.|year=1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jerusalem artichoke]]'', from Italian ''girasole'', is a kind of sunflower; it is not related to [[artichoke]]s and does not come from Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Artichoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''forlorn hope'' originally meant "storming party, body of skirmishers"&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, Lesley (ed.). 2002. ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', vol. 1, A–M. 5th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 1600.&lt;/ref&gt; from Dutch ''verloren hoop'' "lost troop". But confusion with English ''hope'' has given the term an additional meaning of "hopeless venture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|forlorn hope, n.|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes imaginative stories are created to account for the link between a borrowed word and its popularly assumed sources. The names of the ''[[serviceberry]]'', ''service tree'', and related plants, for instance, come from the Latin name ''[[sorbus]]''. The plants were called ''syrfe'' in Old English, which eventually became ''service''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|serve, n1|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanciful stories suggest that the name comes from the fact that the trees bloom in spring, a time when circuit-riding preachers resume church services or when funeral services are carried out for people who died during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Small|first=Ernest|title=North American Cornucopia: Top 100 Indigenous Food Plants|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-8594-2|page=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seemingly plausible but no less speculative etymology accounts for the form of ''[[Welsh rarebit]]'', a dish made of cheese and toasted bread. The earliest known reference to the dish in 1725 called it ''Welsh rabbit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrom|first=John|title=The Private Journal and Literary Remains of John Byrom|year=1854|publisher=Chetham society|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of that name is unknown, but presumably humorous, since the dish contains no rabbit. In 1785 [[Francis Grose]] suggested in ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' that the dish is "a Welch rare bit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grose|first=Francis|title=A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|year=1785|publisher=S. Hooper|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyVKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the word ''rarebit'' was not common prior to Grose's dictionary. Both versions of the name are in current use; individuals sometimes express strong opinions concerning which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Welsh rabbit, Welsh rarebit|encyclopedia=Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|page=952|year=1994|isbn=978-0-87779-132-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obsolete forms ===
When a word or other form becomes obsolete, words or phrases containing the obsolete portion may be reanalyzed and changed.

Some [[compound word]]s from [[Old English]] were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English when one of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include ''[[wikt:bridegroom|bridegroom]]'' from Old English ''[[wikt:brydguma|brydguma]]'' "bride-man". The word ''[[wikt:gome|gome]]'' "man" from Old English ''[[wikt:guma|guma]]'' fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word ''[[wikt:groom|groom]]'' "male servant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Groom}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar reanalysis caused ''[[wikt:sandblind|sandblind]]'', from Old English ''sāmblind'' "half-blind" with a once-common prefix ''sām-'' "semi-", to be respelled as though it is related to ''sand''. The word ''island'' derives from Old English ''igland''. The modern spelling with the letter ''s'' is the result of comparison with the synonym ''[[wikt:isle|isle]]'' from Old French and ultimately Latin ''insula'', though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|title=A Dictionary of English Etymology: E - P|year=1862|publisher=Trübner|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the spelling of ''[[wikt:wormwood|wormwood]]'' was likely affected by comparison with ''wood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|wormwood|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smythe Palmer|first=Abram|title=Folk-etymology: A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy|year=1882|publisher=Johnson Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|449}}

The phrase ''[[wikt:curry favor|curry favour]]'', meaning to flatter, comes from Middle English ''curry favel'', "[[horse grooming|groom]] a [[chestnut horse]]". This was an [[allusion]] to a fourteenth century French morality poem, ''Roman de Fauvel'', about a chestnut-colored horse who corrupts men through duplicity. The phrase was reanalyzed in early Modern English by comparison to ''favour'' as early as 1510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|year=2017|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: 'Curry favour'|work=Phrase Finder|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/curry-favour.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words need not completely disappear before their compounds are reanalyzed. The word ''[[wikt:shamefaced|shamefaced]]'' was originally ''[[wikt:shamefast|shamefast]]''. The original meaning of ''fast'' "fixed in place" still exists but mainly in frozen expressions such as ''stuck fast'', ''hold fast'', and ''[[wikt:play fast and loose|play fast and loose]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The songbird ''[[wheatear]]'' or ''white-ear'' is a back-formation from Middle English ''whit-ers'' "white arse", referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=White-ear|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white%E2%80%93ear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both ''white'' and ''arse'' are common in Modern English, the folk etymology may be [[euphemism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Wheatear |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wheatear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of archaic or obsolete forms can lead to changes in meaning as well. The original meaning of ''[[hangnail]]'' referred to a [[Corn (medicine)|corn]] on the foot.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=hangnail|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangnail |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from Old English ''[[wikt:ang-|ang-]]'' + ''[[wikt:nægel|nægel]]'' ("anguished nail" or "compressed spike"), but the spelling and pronunciation were affected by folk etymology in the seventeenth century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hangnail|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the word came to be used for a tag of skin or torn [[cuticle]] near a [[fingernail]] or toenail.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail" /&gt;

== Other languages ==

Several words in [[Medieval Latin]] were subject to folk etymology. For example, the word ''widerdonum'' meaning "reward" was borrowed from [[Old High German]] ''widarlōn'' "repayment of a loan". The ''l{{nbsp}}→{{nbsp}}d'' alteration is due to confusion with Latin ''donum'' "gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |guerdon|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Similarly, the word ''baceler'' or ''bacheler'' (related to modern English [[Bachelor#Etymology and historical meanings|''bachelor'']]) referred to a junior knight. It is attested from the eleventh century, though its ultimate origin is uncertain. By the late Middle Ages its meaning was extended to the holder of a university degree inferior to master or doctor.  This was later re-spelled ''baccalaureus'', probably reflecting a false derivation from ''bacca laurea'' "laurel berry", alluding to the possible laurel crown of a poet or conqueror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brachet|first=Auguste|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the French Language: Crowned by the French Academy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA354|year=1882|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

In the fourteenth or fifteenth century French scholars began to spell the verb ''savoir'' ("to know") as ''sçavoir'' on the false belief it was derived from Latin ''scire'' "to know".  In fact it comes from ''sapere'' "to be wise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singleton|first=David|title=Language and the Lexicon: An Introduction|year=2016|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-83594-3|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian word ''liocorno'' "unicorn" derives from 13th century ''lunicorno'' (''lo'' "the" + ''unicorno'' "unicorn"). Folk etymology based on ''lione'' "lion" altered the spelling and pronunciation. Dialectal ''liofante'' "elephant" was likewise altered from ''elefante'' by association with ''lione''.&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|486}}

The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "[[hammock]]" is ''hangmat''. It was borrowed from Spanish ''hamaca'' (ultimately from [[Arawak language|Arawak]] ''amàca'') and altered by comparison with ''hangen'' and ''mat'', "hanging mat". German ''Hängematte'' shares this folk etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hängematte|work=Wörterbuch Deutsch|url=http://en.worterbuchdeutsch.com/de/hangematte |date=October 2016|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] compound word for "jealous" ''mustasukkainen'' literally means "black-socked" (''musta'' "black" and ''sukka'' "sock"). However, the word is a case of a misunderstood loan translation from Swedish ''svartsjuk'' "black-sick". The Finnish word ''sukka'' fit with a close phonological equivalent to the Swedish ''sjuk''

''[[Names of Istanbul#Islambol|Islambol]]'', a folk etymology meaning "full of Islam", is one of the names of [[Istanbul]] used after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Necdet Sakaoğlu|title=Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t51PAQAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Kültür Bakanlığı|language=tr|isbn=978-975-7306-04-7|pages=253–255|chapter=İstanbul'un adları}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|type=Turkish-language|date=February 2017}}

An example from [[Persian language|Persian]] is the word [[shatranj]] (chess), which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] [[chaturanga]] (2nd century BCE), and after losing the "u" to [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], becomes ''chatrang'' in [[Middle Persian]] (6th century CE). Today it is sometimes factorized as ''shat'' (hundred) + ''ranj'' (worry / mood), or "a hundred worries".{{citation needed|reason=is this analysis the reason for the segmental change, or is that just passage through Arabic?|date=October 2015}}

'''Ibn Zafar al Siqilli''', ({{lang-ar|ابن ظفر الصقلي}}), or ({{lang-ar|احجة الدين أبو عبد الله محمد بن أبي محمد بن محمد بن ظفر الصقلي}}), or '''Abū ‘Abd Allāh Muḥammad Ibn Abī Muḥammad Ibn Ẓafar al-Siqillī al-Makkī al-Mālikī''' (are among the several variants), was a [[philosopher]], [[polymath]] and Arab-Sicilian politician of the [[Normans|Norman]] period (1104 - 1170), and has come to be known in the West as "[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s Arab Precursor".

==Biography==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to be physically small and frail. His [[demonym]] 'al-Siqillī' indicates he was born in [[Sicily]], but the [[patronym]] 'al-Makkī' suggests his family origins were in [[Mecca]], where he is believed to have been raised and educated. Nicknamed 'The Wanderer', the precise chronology of his travels are uncertain.  He probably spent his youth in [[Fatimid Egypt]] and [[Mahdia]] in [[Tunisia]], but left there in 1148 when it fell to the Normans. After a period in Sicily, Ibn Ẓafar first went to Egypt, then to [[Aleppo]] in 1146, where he taught at the [[Madrasa]] Ibn Abī ‘Aṣrūn under the patronage of Ṣāfīal-Dīn. In 1154 he returned to Sicily under the patronage of Amīr Abū ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Abī al-Qāsim Ibn ‘Alī al-Qurashī, known as Ibn Hajar, a Sicilian Arab noble, who served as a general in the Norman army. Due to the civil unrest of the Muslim population some time later, Ibn Ẓafar left Sicily definitively and took refuge in [[Hamat]], in Syria, where he died in poverty in 1170, or 1172. The geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yāqūt al-Rūmī]] referred to him as a ‘refined [[philologist]]’, and both [[Al-Dhahabi|Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī]] and [[Ibn Khallikan|Ibn Khallikān]] praised his scholarship and thought.&lt;ref name="MAB"&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13530190020000493 R. Hrair Dekmejian  &amp;  Adel Fathy Thabit  ''Machiavelli’s Arab Precursor: Ibn Zafar al-Siqillī'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ia801900.us.archive.org/5/items/WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan/Vol4Of4WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan.pdf Khallikan, ''Obituaries of Eminent Men              '', Vol.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to have authored 32 books&lt;ref&gt;Arié, Miniatures pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solwan, or Waters of Comfort===
''Sulwān al-Muṭā fī Udwān al-Atbā'' ({{lang-ar|سلوان المطاع في عدوان الأتباع}}) (Consolation for the Ruler During the Hostility of his Subjects) is his magnum opus.&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt; When [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], the famous Florentine, dedicated his treatise, '[[The Prince]]', to [[Lorenzo di Medici]] four centuries later, Ibn Ẓafar was almost unknown to the [[Western world]].  He remained in relative obscurity even after [[Michele Amari]]'s [[Italian language|Italian]] translation appeared in 1851.  Amari's introduction had included a biographical account of Ibn Ẓafar and his manuscript's history, and Richard Bentley published an English version in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof01ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof02ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt;  At the beginning of the 20th century another Sicilian and political scientist philosopher, [[Gaetano Mosca]], wrote of the striking parallels between Ibn Ẓafar's treatise and Machiavelli's.  Ibn Ẓafar's name is rarely credited as the precursor to its famous successor.

The treatise is a form  of [[Wisdom literature]] with a long Arabian and Persian tradition, called '[[Mirrors for princes]]', which purported to be handbooks for princes and caliphs offering counsel on the proper use of power, good governance and the conduct of commerce and trade.   Ibn Ẓafar dedicated the first edition of 'Sulwan' to an unknown king facing revolt - possibly the ruler of [[Damascus]] expelled by [[Nur Eddin]] - and the second edition to his patron Abū al-Qāsim (Ibn Hajar).

The '''Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC)''' is an international centre for biological and [[biomedical research]] and graduate training based in Oeiras, Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=IGCiencia|title=IGC {{!}} A Special Place to Be|date=2014-05-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9y874pZeJw&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]] (FCG) in 1961, and still supported by the Foundation, the IGC is organised in small independent research groups that work in an environment designed to encourage interactions with minimal hierarchical structure.

The scientific programme covers a wide range of domains and is at the interface of different disciplines. These include cell and [[developmental biology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[immunology]] and [[host-pathogen interaction]], [[Botany|plant biology]], sociobiology, [[computational biology]] and [[biophysics]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/pages/facilities.php/A=213___collection=article|title=IGC {{!}} Research {{!}} About IGC Research|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC has state-of-the-art facilities and services, constantly updated and ready to explore new scientific ideas. All resources are at the disposal of all IGC scientists equally, and common services and equipment are also open to external users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/facilities/about|title=IGC {{!}} Serviços {{!}} Sobre Serviços IGC|last=|first=|date=|website=wwwpt.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC hosts a number of [[Postgraduate education|graduate education]] and training programmes. Since 1993 the IGC runs innovative [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD programmes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/phdprogrammes|title=IGC {{!}} Education and Training {{!}} PhD Programmes|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;, directed towards intellectual breadth, creativity and independent scientific thought. Also, the IGC has a strong tradition in promoting science in society with dedicated outreach programmes. 

Around 400 people, including 300 researchers (students, postdocs, technicians and group leaders), from 41 different countries work at the IGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/pages/facilities.php/A=121___collection=article|title=IGC {{!}} Facts and Figures|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, 88 research groups have already settled in the institute. Of these, 44 went to other institutions, mainly other research centres and universities in Portugal.

In 1998, under the Directorship of [[António Coutinho]], the IGC was restructured into the current set-up and mode of action. Jonathan Howard succeeded Coutinho as Director of the IGC from October 2012 until January 2018. Since 1 February 2018, [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias]] is the Director of the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência.   

==History==
The establishment of the IGC was initiated in 1961 when the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]’s board of trustees envisioned the creation of its own research centre to encourage multidisciplinary research, independent of universities, and without restrictions or prior interests. The original set up of the IGC included a Centre for Scientific Calculation (1962-1985), a Centre for Biology (1962), a centre for Pedagogical Innovation (1962-1980), a Centre for Agricultural Economy (1958-1986) and a Centre for Economy and Finances.  A new building alongside the Marquês de Pombal Palace, in Oeiras, was projected to make up the new campus planned with a set of infrastructures including laboratories, library, canteen and animal facility. In 1967, the Centre for Biology was officially inaugurated at the new Oeiras campus with four research groups in Cell Biology, Pharmacology, Microbiology and Physiology and around 20 researchers. From 1966 to 1969, four IGC leaders passed away: Delfim Santos (Pedagogical Innovation), António Gião (Scientific Calculation), Flávio Resende (Biology) and Luís Quartin Graça (Agricultural Economy).

In 1968 Luís Archer, jesuit priest and biologist, widely regarded as the ‘father' of molecular genetics in Portugal, returns to Portugal to set up the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the IGC, in the Department of Cell Biology. The year after, in 1969, it was set up the ''Estudos Avançados de Oeiras'' (Oeiras Advanced Studies) to provide workshops, summer schools and international seminars to scientists.

In 1984, the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]’s Board of Trustees decides that IGC will be a research centre exclusively dedicated to research and pos-graduated training in biology.

In 1989 the [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/ Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica] (ITQB) and the [http://www.ibet.pt/ Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnológica] (iBET) were created and hosted in the IGC campus. With IGC, they will later form the Oeiras Campus.

[[António Coutinho]], immunologist and Head of the Immunobiology Unit in [[Pasteur Institute|Institut Pasteur]], is appointed the Director of the Oeiras Advanced Studies in 1991. In 1993 Coutinho starts the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biology and Medicine (PGDBM), a pioneering programme in Portugal and one of the first of this kind in the world. In 1998, António Coutinho is designated Director of the IGC and starts a new phase of the institute as a ‘host institution' with the mission of identifying, educating and incubating new research leaders, providing access to facilities, and financial and intellectual autonomy to pursue research projects.

The Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme at the IGC is established in 2006 and the research groups of the newly formed [[Champalimaud Foundation]] are hosted at the IGC to carry out research in systems neuroscience until 2011, when they move to the Champalimaud Foundation’s new building in Lisbon.

In 2008, the IGC participates for the first time in the music festival [[NOS Alive]] under a partnership established between “Everything is New”, promoter of NOS Alive, and the IGC to support fellowships for young researchers.

In 2010 and 2011, the IGC was ranked amongst the '10 Best Places for Post-docs' outside the USA, by [http://www.the-scientist.com/ The Scientist].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/30743/title/Best-Places-to-Work-Postdocs--2011/|title=Best Places to Work Postdocs, 2011|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC celebrates its 50&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary in 2011 and was awarded an Honorary Membership of the Ordem de Sant'Iago da Espada by the [[President of Portugal|President of the Portuguese Republic]].

The [http://cedoc.unl.pt/ Centro de Estudos de Doenças Crónicas] (CEDOC), from N [http://www.fcm.unl.pt/main/index.php?lang=en&amp;Itemid=351 OVA Medical School | Faculdade de Ciências Médicas] (NMS|FCM), incubated in IGC, moved in 2014 to its new building in Lisbon.

Jonathan Howard, immunologist and Professor of Genetics at the [[University of Cologne]], is appointed Director of the IGC in 2012, succeeding António Coutinho. Since February 2018, [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias|Mónica Bettencourt Dias]] is the new Director of the IGC, succeeding Jonathan Howard.

==Research==

=== Main Accomplishments ===
- A study published in ''[[Nature Cell Biology]]'' in July 2018, coordinated by [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias]], helped to better understand diseases that involve cells antennae, called [[Ciliopathy|ciliopathies]]. The researchers found that while cells use the same building materials for their antennae, they use them in different proportions and moments, thus creating the structurally different functions.This explains how their mutations, which occur in genetic diseases associated with [[Cilium|cilia]] (e.g. diseases leading to infertility, loss of vision, obesity), usually affect only some antennae, not all of them, and some patients show all of the symptoms, while others may have only one type of defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jana|first=Swadhin Chandra|last2=Mendonça|first2=Susana|last3=Machado|first3=Pedro|last4=Werner|first4=Sascha|last5=Rocha|first5=Jaqueline|last6=Pereira|first6=António|last7=Maiato|first7=Helder|last8=Bettencourt-Dias|first8=Mónica|date=2018-07-16|title=Differential regulation of transition zone and centriole proteins contributes to ciliary base diversity|journal=Nature Cell Biology|language=En|volume=20|issue=8|pages=928–941|doi=10.1038/s41556-018-0132-1|pmid=30013109|issn=1465-7392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The research team led by Joana Gonçalves-Sá and Luís Rocha showed that there is a specific mood associated with religious celebrations, a "loving mood" that can influence human reproductive behaviour. Using worldwide data from [[Twitter]] and [[Google Trends]] they found that culture, and not only biology, drives human reproductive cycles. The study was published in ''[[Scientific Reports]]'' in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Ian B.|last2=Varela|first2=Pedro L.|last3=Bollen|first3=Johan|last4=Rocha|first4=Luis M.|last5=Gonçalves-Sá|first5=Joana|date=2017-12|title=Human Sexual Cycles are Driven by Culture and Match Collective Moods|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18262-5|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17973|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-18262-5|pmid=29269945|pmc=5740080|issn=2045-2322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Ana Domingos and her group devoted to the study of the biological causes underlying obesity published a breakthrough study in ''[[Nature Medicine]]'' in October 2017. They discovered an unforeseen population of immune cells ([[macrophage]]s) associated with [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic neurons]] in adipose tissue. These specialised macrophages are in direct contact with neurons and affect neuronal activation that is critical for fat mass reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171009123158.htm|title=Making fat mice lean: Novel immune cells control neurons responsible for fat breakdown|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pirzgalska|first=Roksana M|last2=Seixas|first2=Elsa|last3=Seidman|first3=Jason S|last4=Link|first4=Verena M|last5=Sánchez|first5=Noelia Martínez|last6=Mahú|first6=Inês|last7=Mendes|first7=Raquel|last8=Gres|first8=Vitka|last9=Kubasova|first9=Nadiya|date=2017-10-09|title=Sympathetic neuron–associated macrophages contribute to obesity by importing and metabolizing norepinephrine|journal=Nature Medicine|language=En|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1309–1318|doi=10.1038/nm.4422|pmid=29035364|issn=1078-8956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- For many years biologists have wondered why plants have so many genes coding for proteins that are known to be essential for the nervous system of animals, called [[glutamate receptor]]s. A team led by Jose Feijó discovered a new function of these proteins, showing that moss sperm uses them to navigate towards the female organs and ensure offspring. The study was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortiz-Ramírez|first=Carlos|last2=Michard|first2=Erwan|last3=Simon|first3=Alexander A.|last4=Damineli|first4=Daniel S.

- Using experimental models of [[sepsis]] in mice, a research team led by Miguel Soares discovered an unsuspected mechanism that is protective against sepsis. The study was published in the scientific journal ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'' in June 2017 and provided new avenues for therapeutic approaches against sepsis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weis|first=Sebastian|last2=Carlos|first2=Ana Rita|last3=Moita|first3=Maria Raquel|last4=Singh|first4=Sumnima|last5=Blankenhaus|first5=Birte|last6=Cardoso|first6=Silvia|last7=Larsen|first7=Rasmus|last8=Rebelo|first8=Sofia|last9=Schäuble|first9=Sascha|date=2017-06|title=Metabolic Adaptation Establishes Disease Tolerance to Sepsis|journal=Cell|volume=169|issue=7|pages=1263–1275.e14|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.031|issn=0092-8674|pmc=5480394|pmid=28622511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Moisés Mallo and his research group have discovered the key factor that regulates trunk [[Developmental biology|development]] in [[vertebrate]]s and explains why [[snake]]s have such a strikingly different body. These findings published in ''[[Developmental Cell]]'' in August 2016, contributed to understand the origin of the exceptionally long trunks that characterise the body of [[snake]]s and may open new avenues to the study of [[spinal cord]] [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aires|first=Rita|last2=Jurberg|first2=Arnon D.|last3=Leal|first3=Francisca|last4=Nóvoa|first4=Ana|last5=Cohn|first5=Martin J.|last6=Mallo|first6=Moisés|date=2016-08|title=Oct4 Is a Key Regulator of Vertebrate Trunk Length Diversity|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=38|issue=3|pages=262–274|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2016.06.021|pmid=27453501|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shylo|first=Natalia A.|last2=Weatherbee|first2=Scott D.|date=2016-08|title=Of Mice and Snakes: A Tail of Oct4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1534580716305135|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=38|issue=3|pages=224–226|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2016.07.020|pmid=27505413|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A research team led by [[Mónica Bettencourt-Dias|Mónica Bettencourt Dias]] shed light upon the critical mechanism of how [[oocyte]]s, the maternal gametes, lose [[centriole]]s and the importance of doing so for female fertility. The results published in the scientific journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] in May 2016 showed that [[centriole]]s normally have a coating that protects them which is lost inside the oocyte, eliminating therefore the centrioles. They further show that if the centrioles are not eliminated, those mothers are sterile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pimenta-Marques|first=A.|last2=Bento|first2=I.|last3=Lopes|first3=C. a.

- IGC scientists led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira found that certain organs, such as the gut, start to age before other tissues because its cells have a "timekeeper" with a faster pace. The results published in the journal [[PLOS Genetics|''PLoS Genetics'']] in January 2016 also showed that monitoring the pace of these timekeepers can be a good indicator for the aging of the whole organism since the appearance of local age-related lesions anticipates the onset of age-associated diseases, such as cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Madalena C.|last2=Henriques|first2=Catarina M.|last3=Nabais|first3=Joana|last4=Ferreira|first4=Tânia|last5=Carvalho|first5=Tânia|last6=Ferreira|first6=Miguel Godinho|date=2016-01-20|title=Short Telomeres in Key Tissues Initiate Local and Systemic Aging in Zebrafish|journal=PLOS Genetics|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=e1005798|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005798|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4720274|pmid=26789415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Research led by Raquel Oliveira, has elucidated how cells are almost blind to [[chromosome]] cohesion defects. The results published in ''[[Cell Reports]]'' in October 2015 uncovered how these defects, often associated with [[cancer]] development, [[congenital diseases]] and [[infertility]], evade the strict surveillance of the checkpoint mechanisms that ensure faithful [[genome]] segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirkovic|first=Mihailo|last2=Hutter|first2=Lukas H.|last3=Novák|first3=Béla|last4=Oliveira|first4=Raquel A.|date=2015-10|title=Premature Sister Chromatid Separation Is Poorly Detected by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint as a Result of System-Level Feedback|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124715010311|journal=Cell Reports|volume=13|issue=3|pages=469–478|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.020|pmid=26456822|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirkovic|first=Mihailo|last2=Hutter|first2=Lukas H.|last3=Novák|first3=Béla|last4=Oliveira|first4=Raquel A.|date=2015-10|title=Premature Sister Chromatid Separation Is Poorly Detected by the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint as a Result of System-Level Feedback|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124715010311|journal=Cell Reports|volume=13|issue=3|pages=469–478|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2015.09.020|pmid=26456822|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Ana Domingos and her group have shown that [[Adipose tissue|fat tissue]] is [[Nerve|innervated]] and that direct stimulation of [[neuron]]s in fat is sufficient to induce fat breakdown. These results published in September 2015 in the journal [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']], set up the stage for developing novel [[Anti-obesity medication|anti-obesity]] therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Wenwen|last2=Pirzgalska|first2=Roksana M.|last3=Pereira|first3=Mafalda M.A.|last4=Kubasova|first4=Nadiya|last5=Barateiro|first5=Andreia|last6=Seixas|first6=Elsa|last7=Lu|first7=Yi-Hsueh|last8=Kozlova|first8=Albina|last9=Voss|first9=Henning|date=2015-09|title=Sympathetic Neuro-adipose Connections Mediate Leptin-Driven Lipolysis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867415011071|journal=Cell|volume=163|issue=1|pages=84–94|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.08.055|pmid=26406372|issn=0092-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/44093/title/Neuronal-Connection-Between-Fat-and-the-Brain-Visualized/|title=Neuronal Connection Between Fat and the Brain Visualized|website=The Scientist Magazine®|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Studies on the [[bacteria]] ''[[Wolbachia]]'' conducted by Luis Teixeira and his research group revealed that a single genomic change can turn beneficial bacteria into [[pathogenic bacteria]], by boosting bacterial density inside the host. ''Wolbachia'' is a bacterium commonly present in [[insect]] species that can protect their hosts against [[virus]]es, including the [[dengue fever]] virus. These findings were published in the journal [[PLOS Biology|''PLoS Biology'']] in February 2015, in the first study linking genes and their functions in the ''Wolbachia'' bacterium and providing a starting point for the understanding of the widespread insect-''Wolbachia'' symbiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chrostek|first=Ewa|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luis|date=2015-02-10|title=Mutualism Breakdown by Amplification of Wolbachia Genes|journal=PLOS Biology|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=e1002065|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002065|issn=1545-7885|pmc=4323108|pmid=25668031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In a study published in the scientific journal [[Cell (journal)|''Cell'']] in December 2014, a research team at IGC led by Miguel Soares discovered that specific bacterial components in the human [[Gut flora|gut]] [[microbiota]] can trigger a natural defence mechanism that is highly protective against [[malaria]] transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=Bahtiyar|last2=Portugal|first2=Silvia|last3=Tran|first3=Tuan M.|last4=Gozzelino|first4=Raffaella|last5=Ramos|first5=Susana|last6=Gomes|first6=Joana|last7=Regalado|first7=Ana|last8=Cowan|first8=Peter J.|last9=d’Apice|first9=Anthony J.F.|date=2014-12|title=Gut Microbiota Elicits a Protective Immune Response against Malaria Transmission|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867414014251|journal=Cell|volume=159|issue=6|pages=1277–1289|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.053|issn=0092-8674|pmc=4261137|pmid=25480293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bordon|first=Yvonne|date=2015-01|title=Gut bacteria cross malaria|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nri3796|journal=Nature Reviews Immunology|language=En|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1038/nri3796|pmid=25534616|issn=1474-1733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=IGCiencia|title=How gut bacteria are protective against malaria - Video animation|date=2014-12-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnAhiECenPc&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- Three research groups at IGC lead by Jocelyne Demengeot, Karina Xavier and Isabel Gordo joint efforts to unveil how the [[bacteria]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''), one of the first species to colonize the [[Gut flora|human gut]] at birth, adapts and evolves in the [[mouse]] intestine. The study published in [[PLOS Genetics|''PLoS Genetics'']] in March 2014, showed that [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] with different advantageous [[mutation]]s rapidly emerge and, consequently, a large [[genetic variation]] in this species is generated over time demonstrating how rich the [[evolutionary dynamics]] of each bacteria is in a healthy animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barroso-Batista|first=João|last2=Sousa|first2=Ana|last3=Lourenço|first3=Marta|last4=Bergman|first4=Marie-Louise|last5=Sobral|first5=Daniel|last6=Demengeot|first6=Jocelyne|last7=Xavier|first7=Karina B.|last8=Gordo|first8=Isabel|date=2014-03-06|title=The First Steps of Adaptation of Escherichia coli to the Gut Are Dominated by Soft Sweeps|journal=PLOS Genetics|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e1004182|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004182|issn=1553-7404|pmc=3945185|pmid=24603313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The research team led by Henrique Teotónio in collaboration with Isabel Gordo, both from the IGC, has experimentally tested the [[Haldane's rule|Haldane's theory]] for the first time. The study was published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' in September 2013 and confirmed this theory for the introduction of a new beneficial [[allele]] in a population. The study contributes to a better comprehension of how a population can evolve, with implications for studies on how species adapt to changing environments or species conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chelo|first=Ivo M.|last2=Nédli|first2=Judit|last3=Gordo|first3=Isabel|last4=Teotónio|first4=Henrique|date=2013-09-13|title=An experimental test on the probability of extinction of new genetic variants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3417|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=2417|doi=10.1038/ncomms3417|issn=2041-1723|pmc=3778522|pmid=24030070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130913085804.htm|title=Fate of new genes cannot be predicted|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In August 2013, the research team led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira in collaboration with Isabel Gordo, showed for the first time that [[Chromosomal rearrangement|chromosomes rearrangements]] (such as inversions or translocations) can provide advantages to the cells that harbor them depending on the environment they are exposed. The study published in ''[[Nature Communications]]'' contributes to better understand different biological problems such as: how cancer cells that have chromosomal rearrangements can outgrow normal cells or how organisms may evolve in the same physical location to form distinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teresa Avelar|first=Ana|last2=Perfeito|first2=Lília|last3=Gordo|first3=Isabel|last4=Godinho Ferreira|first4=Miguel|date=2013-08-23|title=Genome architecture is a selectable trait that can be maintained by antagonistic pleiotropy|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3235|journal=Nature Communications|language=En|volume=4|issue=1|pages=2235|doi=10.1038/ncomms3235|pmid=23974178|issn=2041-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The researcher Miguel Soares co-authored a review in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']], in February 2012, on a largely overlooked strategy for treating [[infectious diseases]]. The [[immune system]] protects from infections by detecting and eliminating invading pathogens. The authors purposed a third strategy considering tolerance to infection, whereby the infected host protects itself from infection by reducing tissue damage and other negative effects caused by the pathogen or the immune response against the invader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medzhitov|first=Ruslan|last2=Schneider|first2=David S.|last3=Soares|first3=Miguel P.|date=2012-02-24|title=Disease Tolerance as a Defense Strategy|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6071/936|journal=Science|language=en|volume=335|issue=6071|pages=936–941|doi=10.1126/science.1214935|issn=0036-8075|pmc=3564547|pmid=22363001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- In December 2011 the study published in ''[[Developmental Cell]]'' by Lar Jansen and his team uncovered a very simple, neat mechanism whereby the cell couples DNA duplication, [[cell division]] and [[centromere]] assembly. By using the same machinery for all these steps but in opposite ways, the cells confirm that the right number of copies of both genes and centromeres are made by allowing each the appropriate time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silva|first=Mariana C.C.|last2=Bodor|first2=Dani L.|last3=Stellfox|first3=Madison E.|last4=Martins|first4=Nuno M.C.|last5=Hochegger|first5=Helfrid|last6=Foltz|first6=Daniel R.|last7=Jansen|first7=Lars E.T.|date=2012-01|title=Cdk Activity Couples Epigenetic Centromere Inheritance to Cell Cycle Progression|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1534580711004667|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=22|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2011.10.014|pmid=22169070|issn=1534-5807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The IGC has been part of the multinational team of researchers from 10 countries that sequenced the [[genome]] of the tiny spider mite in a study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', in November 2011. The sequence of the [[spider mite]] genome has revealed the genetic basis for its feeding flexibility and pesticide resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grbić|first=Miodrag|last2=Van Leeuwen|first2=Thomas|last3=Clark|first3=Richard M.|last4=Rombauts|first4=Stephane|last5=Rouzé|first5=Pierre|last6=Grbić|first6=Vojislava|last7=Osborne|first7=Edward J.|last8=Dermauw|first8=Wannes|last9=Thi Ngoc|first9=Phuong Cao|date=2011-11|title=The genome of Tetranychus urticae reveals herbivorous pest adaptations|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature10640|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=479|issue=7374|pages=487–492|doi=10.1038/nature10640|issn=0028-0836|pmc=4856440|pmid=22113690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A team led by Florence Janody have uncovered a surprising link between the cell's skeleton and organ size. It was shown in a study published in ''Development'', in April 2011, that one of the proteins that regulates the [[Cytoskeleton|skeleton]] of the cell also acts to blocks activation of genes that promote cell survival and proliferation. These findings add to the puzzle of understanding how proliferation genes are abnormally activated, often leading to tumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernández|first=Beatriz García|last2=Gaspar|first2=Pedro|last3=Brás-Pereira|first3=Catarina|last4=Jezowska|first4=Barbara|last5=Rebelo|first5=Sofia Raquel|last6=Janody|first6=Florence|date=2011-06-01|title=Actin-Capping Protein and the Hippo pathway regulate F-actin and tissue growth in Drosophila|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/138/11/2337|journal=Development|language=en|volume=138|issue=11|pages=2337–2346|doi=10.1242/dev.063545|issn=0950-1991|pmid=21525075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- An international team led by José Feijó published a study in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', in March 2011, revealing that [[pollen]], the organ that contains the plant male gametes, communicate with the [[pistil]], their female counterpart, using a mechanism commonly observed in the nervous system of animals. The study showed a new mechanism which underlies reproduction in plants and how cell-cell communication is conserved between animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michard|first=Erwan|last2=Lima|first2=Pedro T.|last3=Borges|first3=Filipe|last4=Silva|first4=Ana Catarina|last5=Portes|first5=Maria Teresa|last6=Carvalho|first6=João E.|last7=Gilliham|first7=Matthew|last8=Liu|first8=Lai-Hua|last9=Obermeyer|first9=Gerhard|date=2011-04-22|title=Glutamate Receptor–Like Genes Form Ca2+ Channels in Pollen Tubes and Are Regulated by Pistil d-Serine|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6028/434|journal=Science|language=en|volume=332|issue=6028|pages=434–437|doi=10.1126/science.1201101|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21415319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A research team led by Miguel Soares found that free [[heme]], released from red blood cells during infection, is the cause of organ failure, leading to the lethal outcome of severe [[sepsis]]. Moreover, the team found that the toxic effect of free heme can be overcome by hemopexin, a naturally occurring molecule that neutralises free heme. These findings were published in the ''[[Science Translational Medicine]]'' journal in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Rasmus|last2=Gozzelino|first2=Raffaella|last3=Jeney|first3=Viktória|last4=Tokaji|first4=László|last5=Bozza|first5=Fernando A.|last6=Japiassú|first6=André M.|last7=Bonaparte|first7=Dolores|last8=Cavalcante|first8=Moisés Marinho|last9=Chora|first9=Ângelo|date=2010-09-29|title=A Central Role for Free Heme in the Pathogenesis of Severe Sepsis|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/51/51ra71|journal=Science Translational Medicine|language=en|volume=2|issue=51|pages=51ra71|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3001118|issn=1946-6234|pmid=20881280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

- A study published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'',]] in September 2010, by a team of researchers led by Miguel Godinho Ferreira solved a paradox related to [[telomere]]s, the protective tips of [[chromosome]]s. The broken chromosome ends generated by DNA damage are quickly joined together. However, telomeres are never tied to each other, thus allowing for the correct segregation of the genetic material into all cells. The researchers found that one of the [[histone]]s neighbouring the telomeres lacks a chemical signal, thus rendering the DNA damage recognition machinery incapable of arresting the [[cell cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Tiago|last2=Khair|first2=Lyne|last3=Reis|first3=Clara C.|last4=Borges|first4=Vanessa|last5=Moser|first5=Bettina A.|last6=Nakamura|first6=Toru M.|last7=Ferreira|first7=Miguel Godinho|date=2010-09-09|title=Telomeres avoid end detection by severing the checkpoint signal transduction pathway|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=467|issue=7312|pages=228–232|doi=10.1038/nature09353|issn=0028-0836|pmc=3196630|pmid=20829797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== PhD Programmes ==
The IGC has started the postgraduate training with the format of a PhD programme in 1993 with the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biology and Medicine (PGDBM) followed by the Gulbenkian PhD Programme in Biomedicine (PGDB). In 2013, 20 years after the first structured PhD programme in Portugal, the [[Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia|Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia]] (FCT) started supporting the PhD Programme in Integrative Biomedical Sciences (PDIGC - PIBS) that has been continued as the [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/ibbprogramme PhD Programme in Integrative Biology and Biomedicine] (IBB), the current programme. In 2014, a new and ambitious [http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/education/pgcd PhD programme was launched, the Graduate Program Science for Development] (PGCD) that aims to educate a new generation of excellent scientists and university professors in life sciences in the African countries of Portuguese language (PALOP) and East Timor.

The IGC is also part of a joint [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/education/phdhostmicrointerface PhD Program Biology at the Host Microbe Interface] (INTERFACE) ran by the [http://www.itqb.unl.pt/ Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica] (ITQB NOVA), Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (IGC) and [https://imm.medicina.ulisboa.pt/en/ Instituto de Medicina Molecular] (iMM).

The IGC has also had two other PhD Programmes, the [http://pdbc.igc.gulbenkian.pt/index.php?menu=home PhD Programme in Computational Biology] (PDBC) the first doctoral programme in computational biology in Portugal launched in 2005, and the Programme for Advanced Medical Education (PGMFA), both important to fulfil gaps in research and training of these two fields.

== Science Outreach ==
The dialogue between scientists and society is crucial and the IGC is committed to promoting this interaction, both at the Institute and wider afield. Open Days, Researchers' Night, school's outreach and informal education programmes reach every year hundreds of students, teachers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igc.gulbenkian.pt/outreach|title=IGC {{!}} Outreach|website=www.igc.gulbenkian.pt|language=pt|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infrastructure ==
The IGC is resourced with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities, and run by highly qualified staff. Facilities include bio-computing services, animal SPF ([[Specific-pathogen-free|Specific Pathogen Free]]) facilities including a "germ-free" unit, transgenics unit, plant facility, high-speed cell sorting, [[Electron microscope|electron]] and advanced microscopy, next generation sequencing, monoclonal antibody preparation and histopathology. Other services include a library, a dedicated in-house data center and IT team, as well as a research funding office and project management team.

The outcome of this instruction may be directly observable and scientifically measured or completely hidden and assumed.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Forest: [http://educationaltechnology.net/instructional-design/ Instructional Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091647/http://educationaltechnology.net/instructional-design/ |date=2016-12-20 }}, Educational Technology&lt;/ref&gt; There are many instructional design models but many are based on the [[ADDIE model]] with the five phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. 

==History==

===Origins ===
As a field, instructional design is historically and traditionally rooted in [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral psychology]], though recently [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] has influenced thinking in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer|first1=Richard E|year=1992|title=Cognition and instruction: Their historic meeting within educational psychology|url=|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|volume=84|issue=4|pages=405–412|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.84.4.405}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, T. M., &amp; Cunningham, D. J. (1996). Constructivism: Implications for the design and delivery of instruction. In D. Jonassen (Ed.), Handbook of Research for Educational Communications and Technology (pp. 170-198). New York: Simon &amp; Schuster Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, T. M., &amp; Jonassen, D. H. (1992). Constructivism: New implications for instructional technology. In T. Duffy &amp; D. Jonassen (Eds.), Constructivism and the technology of instruction (pp. 1-16). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be attributed to the way it emerged during a period when the behaviorist paradigm was dominating American psychology. There are also those who cite that, aside from behaviorist psychology, the origin of the concept could be traced back to [[systems engineering]]. The impact of each of these fields is difficult to quantify, however, it is argued that the language and the "look and feel" of the early forms of instructional design and their progeny were derived from this engineering discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Instructional Design: International Perspectives. Theory, research, and models. Vol. 1|last=Tennyson|first=Robert|last2=Dijkstra|first2=S.|last3=Schott|first3=Frank|last4=Seel|first4=Norbert|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|year=1997|isbn=0805814000|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they were linked to the training development model used by the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]], which were based on systems approach and was explained as "the idea of viewing a problem or situation in its entirety with all its ramifications, with all its interior interactions, with all its exterior connections and with full cognizance of its place in its context."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Improving Performance in the Workplace, Instructional Design and Training Delivery|last=Silber|first=Kenneth|last2=Foshay|first2=Wellesley|publisher=Pfeiffer|year=2010|isbn=9780470190685|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

The role of systems engineering in the early development of instructional design was demonstrated during [[World War II]] when a considerable amount of training materials for the military were developed based on the principles of instruction, learning, and human behavior. Tests for assessing a learner’s abilities were used to screen candidates for the training programs. After the success of military training, psychologists began to view training as a system and developed various analysis, design, and evaluation procedures.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt; In 1946, [[Edgar Dale]] outlined a hierarchy of instructional methods, organized intuitively by their concreteness.&lt;ref name="slides"&gt;Clark, B.

===1950s===
B. F. Skinner's 1954 article “''The Science of Learning and the Art of Teaching''” suggested that effective instructional materials, called programmed instructional materials, should include small steps, frequent questions, and immediate feedback; and should allow self-pacing.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;
[[Robert F. Mager]] popularized the use of learning objectives with his 1962 article “''Preparing Objectives for Programmed Instruction”''. The article describes how to write objectives including desired behavior, learning condition, and assessment.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;
In 1956, a committee led by [[Benjamin Bloom]] published an influential [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives|taxonomy]] with three domains of learning: cognitive (what one knows or thinks), psychomotor (what one does, physically) and [[affective]] (what one feels, or what [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] one has). These taxonomies still influence the design of instruction.&lt;ref name="slides" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom's Taxonomy. Retrieved from Wikipedia on April 18, 2012 at [[Bloom's Taxonomy]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bloom_taxonomy.jpg|thumb|right|Bloom's Taxonomy]]

===1960s===
[[Robert Glaser]] introduced “criterion-referenced measures” in 1962. In contrast to norm-referenced tests in which an individual's performance is compared to group performance, a criterion-referenced test is designed to test an individual's behavior in relation to an objective standard. It can be used to assess the learners’ entry level behavior, and to what extent learners have developed mastery through an instructional program.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;

In 1965, Robert Gagne (see below for more information) described three domains of learning outcomes (cognitive, affective, psychomotor), five learning outcomes (Verbal Information, Intellectual Skills, Cognitive Strategy, Attitude, Motor Skills), and nine events of instruction in “''The Conditions of Learning''”, which remain foundations of instructional design practices.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt; Gagne’s work in learning hierarchies and hierarchical analysis led to an important notion in instruction – to ensure that learners acquire prerequisite skills before attempting superordinate ones.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;

In 1967, after analyzing the failure of training material, Michael Scriven suggested the need for formative assessment – e.g., to try out instructional materials with learners (and revise accordingly) before declaring them finalized.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt;

===1970s===
During the 1970s, the number of instructional design models greatly increased and prospered in different sectors in military, academia, and industry.&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues" /&gt; Many instructional design theorists began to adopt an information-processing-based approach to the design of instruction. David Merrill for instance developed Component Display Theory (CDT), which concentrates on the means of presenting instructional materials (presentation techniques).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/component-display.html Instructional Design Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004194825/http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/component-display.html |date=2011-10-04 }}.

In this process, an instructional design project is prototyped quickly and then vetted through a series of try and revise cycles.

==Robert Gagné==
Robert Gagné's work is widely used and cited in the design of instruction, as exemplified by more than 130 citations in prominent journals in the field during the period from 1985 through 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Anglin, G. J., &amp; Towers, R. L. (1992). Reference citations in selected instructional design and technology journals, 1985-1990. Educational Technology Research and Development, 40, 40-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Synthesizing ideas from behaviorism and cognitivism, he provided a clear template, which is easy to follow for designing instructional events. Instructional designers who follow Gagné's theory will likely have tightly focused, efficient instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, J. D. (2001). Learning and cognition. [On-Line]. Available: {{cite web |url=http://education.indiana.edu/~p540/webcourse/gagne.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109131426/http://education.indiana.edu/~p540/webcourse/gagne.html |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overview ===

==== Taxonomy ====
Robert Gagné classified the types of learning outcomes by asking how learning might be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Gagné, R. M. (1985). The conditions of learning (4th ed.). New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; His domains and outcomes of learning correspond to standard verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Gagné, R. M., &amp; Driscoll, M. P. (1988). Essentials of learning for instruction. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cognitive Domain
:Verbal information - is stated: state, recite, tell, declare
:Intellectual skills - label or classify the concepts
:Intellectual skills - apply the rules and principles
:Intellectual skills - problem solve by generating solutions or procedures
::Discrimination: discriminate, distinguish, differentiate
::Concrete Concept: identify, name, specify, label
::Defined Concept: classify, categorize, type, sort (by definition)
::Rule: demonstrate, show, solve (using one rule)
::Higher order rule: generate, develop, solve (using two or more rules)
:Cognitive strategies - are used for learning: adopt, create, originate
* Affective Domain
:Attitudes - are demonstrated by preferring options: choose, prefer, elect, favor
* Psychomotor Domain
:Motor skills - enable physical performance: execute, perform, carry out

==== Nine events ====
According to Gagné, learning occurs in a series of nine learning events, each of which is a condition for learning which must be accomplished before moving to the next in order. Similarly, instructional events should mirror the learning events:

# Gaining attention: To ensure reception of coming instruction, the teacher gives the learners a stimulus. Before the learners can start to process any new information, the instructor must gain the attention of the learners. This might entail using abrupt changes in the instruction.
# Informing learners of objectives: The teacher tells the learner what they will be able to do because of the instruction. The teacher communicates the desired outcome to the group.
# Stimulating recall of prior learning: The teacher asks for recall of existing relevant knowledge.
# Presenting the stimulus: The teacher gives emphasis to distinctive features.
# Providing learning guidance: The teacher helps the students in understanding (semantic encoding) by providing organization and relevance.
# Eliciting performance: The teacher asks the learners to respond, demonstrating learning.
# Providing feedback: The teacher gives informative feedback on the learners' performance.
# Assessing performance: The teacher requires more learner performance, and gives feedback, to reinforce learning.
# Enhancing retention and transfer: The teacher provides varied practice to generalize the capability.

Some educators believe that Gagné's taxonomy of learning outcomes and events of instruction oversimplify the learning process by over-prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, D. (1996). Gagné. [On-Line]. Available: {{cite web |url=http://education.indiana.edu/~educp540/haines1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109131428/http://education.indiana.edu/~educp540/haines1.html |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, using them as part of a complete instructional package can assist many educators in becoming more organized and staying focused on the instructional goals.&lt;ref&gt;Dowling, L.

====Influence ====
Robert Gagné’s work has been the foundation of instructional design since the beginning of the 1960s when he conducted research and developed training materials for the military.   Among the first to coin the term “instructional design”, Gagné developed some of the earliest instructional design models and ideas.  These models have laid the groundwork for more present-day instructional design models from theorists like Dick, Carey, and Carey (The Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model),&lt;ref&gt;Dick, W., &amp; Carey, L. (1996). The systematic design of instruction. 4th ed.

The figure below illustrates these five ideas.&lt;ref name="instructional.com"/&gt;

Gagné's main focus for instructional design was how instruction and learning could be systematically connected to the design of instruction.  He emphasized the design principles and procedures that need to take place for effective teaching and learning.  His initial ideas, along with the ideas of other early instructional designers were outlined in ''Psychological Principles in Systematic Development'', written by Roberts B. Miller and edited by Gagné.&lt;ref&gt;Psychological Principles in System Development-1962.

Prior to Robert Gagné, learning was often thought of as a single, uniform process.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"&gt;Wiburg, K. M. (2003). [Web log message]. Retrieved from http://www.internettime.com/itimegroup/Is it Time to Exchange Skinner's Teaching Machine for Dewey's.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  There was little or no distinction made between “learning to load a rifle and learning to solve a complex mathematical problem”.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;   Gagné  offered an alternative view which developed the idea that different learners required different learning strategies.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;  Understanding and designing instruction based on a learning style defined by the individual brought about new theories and approaches to teaching.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;
Gagné 's understanding and theories of human learning added significantly to understanding the stages in cognitive processing and instructions.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;  For example, Gagné  argued that instructional designers must understand the characteristics and functions of short-term and long-term memory to facilitate meaningful learning.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt; This idea encouraged instructional designers to include cognitive needs as a top-down instructional approach.&lt;ref name="internettime.com"/&gt;

Gagné (1966) defines curriculum as a sequence of content units arranged in such a way that the learning of each unit may be accomplished as a single act, provided the capabilities described by specified prior units (in the sequence) have already been mastered by the learner.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"&gt;Richey, R. C. (2000). The legacy of Robert M.Gagné . Syracuse, NY: ERIC Clearinghouse on Information &amp; Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

His definition of curriculum has been the basis of many important initiatives in schools and other educational environments.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"/&gt;  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gagné  had expressed and established an interest in applying theory to practice with particular interest in applications for teaching, training and learning.  Increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of practice was of particular concern.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"/&gt;  His ongoing attention to practice while developing theory continues to influence education and training.&lt;ref name="Richey, R. C. 2000"/&gt;

The concept of learning design arrived in the literature of technology for education in the late 1990s and early 2000s&lt;ref&gt;Conole G., and Fill K., "A learning design toolkit to create pedagogically effective learning activities". Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 2005 (08).&lt;/ref&gt; with the idea that "designers and instructors need to choose for themselves the best mixture of behaviourist and constructivist learning experiences for their online courses".&lt;ref&gt;Carr-Chellman A. and Duchastel P., "The ideal online course," British Journal of Educational Technology, 31(3), 229–241, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the concept of learning design is probably as old as the concept of teaching. Learning design might be defined as "the description of the teaching-learning process that takes place in a unit of learning (e.g., a course, a lesson or any other designed learning event)".&lt;ref&gt;Koper R., "Current Research in Learning Design," Educational Technology &amp; Society, 9 (1), 13–22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized  by Britain,&lt;ref&gt;Britain S., "A Review of Learning Design: Concept, Specifications and Tools" A report for the JISC E-learning Pedagogy Programme, May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; learning design may be associated with:
* The concept of learning design
* The implementation of the concept made by learning design specifications like PALO, [[IMS Learning Design]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imsglobal.org/learningdesign/index.html IMS Learning Design webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823173008/http://www.imsglobal.org/learningdesign/index.html |date=2006-08-23 }}. Imsglobal.org. Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt; LDL, [[Simple learning design 2.0|SLD 2.0]], etc.

==Models==

===ADDIE process===
Perhaps the most common model used for creating instructional materials is the [[ADDIE Model]]. This acronym stands for the 5 phases contained in the model (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate).

'''Brief History of ADDIE’s Development''' – The ADDIE model was initially developed by Florida State University to explain “the processes involved in the formulation of an instructional systems development (ISD) program for military interservice training that will adequately train individuals to do a particular job and which can also be applied to any interservice curriculum development activity.”&lt;ref name="ADDIE"&gt;Branson, R. K., Rayner, G. T., Cox, J. L., Furman, J. P., King, F. J., Hannum, W. H. (1975). Interservice procedures for instructional systems development. (5 vols.) (TRADOC Pam 350-30 NAVEDTRA 106A). Ft. Monroe, VA: U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, August 1975. (NTIS No. ADA 019 486 through ADA 019 490).&lt;/ref&gt;  The model originally contained several steps under its five original phases (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and [Evaluation and] Control),&lt;ref name="ADDIE" /&gt; whose completion was expected before movement to the next phase could occur.  Over the years, the steps were revised and eventually the model itself became more dynamic and interactive than its original hierarchical rendition, until its most popular version appeared in the mid-80s, as we understand it today.

The five phases are listed and explained below:&lt;ref name="TrendsIssues"&gt;Reiser, R. A., &amp; Dempsey, J. V. (2012). Trends and issues in instructional design and technology. Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADDIE Model of Design.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ADDIE Model]]

'''Analyze''' – The first phase of content development is Analysis. Analysis refers to the gathering of information about one’s audience, the tasks to be completed, how the learners will view the content, and the project’s overall goals.  The instructional designer then classifies the information to make the content more applicable and successful.

'''Design''' – The second phase is the Design phase. In this phase, instructional designers begin to create their project. Information gathered from the analysis phase, in conjunction with the theories and models of instructional design, is meant to explain how the learning will be acquired. For example, the design phase begins with writing a learning objective. Tasks are then identified and broken down to be more manageable for the designer. The final step determines the kind of activities required for the audience in order to meet the goals identified in the Analyze phase.

'''Develop''' – The third phase, Development, involves the creation of the activities that will be implemented. It is in this stage that the blueprints of the design phase are assembled.

'''Implement''' – After the content is developed, it is then Implemented. This stage allows the instructional designer to test all materials to determine if they are functional and appropriate for the intended audience.

'''Evaluate''' – The final phase, Evaluate, ensures the materials achieved the desired goals. The evaluation phase consists of two parts: formative and summative assessment. The ADDIE model is an iterative process of instructional design, which means that at each stage the designer can assess the project's elements and revise them if necessary.  This process incorporates [[formative assessment]], while the [[summative assessment]]s contain tests or evaluations created for the content being implemented. This final phase is vital for the instructional design team because it provides data used to alter and enhance the design.

Connecting all phases of the model are external and reciprocal revision opportunities.  As in the internal Evaluation phase, revisions should and can be made throughout the entire process.

Most of the current instructional design models are variations of the ADDIE model.&lt;ref name="Piskurich, G.M. 2006"&gt;Piskurich, G.M. (2006). Rapid Instructional Design: Learning ID fast and right.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapid prototyping===
An adaptation of the ADDIE model, which is used sometimes, is a practice known as [[rapid prototyping]].

Proponents suggest that through an iterative process the verification of the design documents saves time and money by catching problems while they are still easy to fix. This approach is not novel to the design of instruction, but appears in many design-related domains including software design, architecture, transportation planning, product development, message design, user experience design, etc.&lt;ref name="Piskurich, G.M. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saettler 1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Saettler, P. |year=1990 |title=The evolution of American educational technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stolovitch Keeps 1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stolovitch, H.D., &amp; Keeps, E. |title= Handbook of human performance technology |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some proponents of design prototyping assert that a sophisticated understanding of a problem is incomplete without creating and evaluating some type of prototype, regardless of the analysis rigor that may have been applied up front.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, T., &amp; Littman, J. (2005). The ten faces of innovation: IDEO's strategies for beating the devil's advocate &amp; driving creativity throughout your organization. New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, up-front analysis is rarely sufficient to allow one to confidently select an instructional model. For this reason many traditional methods of instructional design are beginning to be seen as incomplete, naive, and even counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Hokanson, B., &amp; Miller, C. (2009). Role-based design: A contemporary framework for innovation and creativity in instructional design. Educational Technology, 49(2), 21–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some consider rapid prototyping to be a somewhat simplistic type of model. As this argument goes, at the heart of Instructional Design is the analysis phase. After you thoroughly conduct the analysis—you can then choose a model based on your findings. That is the area where most people get snagged—they simply do not do a thorough-enough analysis.

===Dick and Carey===
Another well-known instructional design model is the Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model.&lt;ref name=DickCarey2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Dick, Walter, Lou Carey, and James O. Carey |year=2005 |title=The Systematic Design of Instruction |edition=6th |origyear=1978 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sYQCAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+systematic+design+of+instruction |pages=1–12 |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon |isbn=0-205-41274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was originally published in 1978 by Walter Dick and Lou Carey in their book entitled ''The Systematic Design of Instruction''.

[[File:Dick Carey.png|thumb|1000px|none|Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model]]

Dick and Carey made a significant contribution to the instructional design field by championing a systems view of instruction, in contrast to defining instruction as the sum of isolated parts. The model addresses instruction as an entire system, focusing on the interrelationship between context, content, learning and instruction.&lt;ref name="Forest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick and Carey Instructional Model|url=http://educationaltechnology.net/dick-and-carey-instructional-model/|author=Ed Forest|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124215130/http://educationaltechnology.net/dick-and-carey-instructional-model/|archivedate=2015-11-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dick and Carey, "Components such as the instructor, learners, materials, instructional activities, delivery system, and learning and performance environments interact with each other and work together to bring about the desired student learning outcomes".&lt;ref name=DickCarey2005/&gt; The components of the Systems Approach Model, also known as the Dick and Carey Model, are as follows:
* Identify Instructional Goal(s): A goal statement describes a skill, knowledge or attitude (SKA) that a learner will be expected to acquire
* Conduct Instructional Analysis: Identify what a learner must recall and identify what learner must be able to do to perform particular task
* Analyze Learners and Contexts: Identify general characteristics of the target audience, including prior skills, prior experience, and basic demographics; identify characteristics directly related to the skill to be taught; and perform analysis of the performance and learning settings.
* Write Performance Objectives: Objectives consists of a description of the behavior, the condition and criteria. The component of an objective that describes the criteria will be used to judge the learner's performance.
* Develop Assessment Instruments: Purpose of entry behavior testing, purpose of pretesting, purpose of post-testing, purpose of practive items/practive problems
* Develop Instructional Strategy: Pre-instructional activities, content presentation, Learner participation, assessment
* Develop and Select Instructional Materials
* Design and Conduct Formative Evaluation of Instruction: Designers try to identify areas of the instructional materials that need improvement.
* Revise Instruction: To identify poor test items and to identify poor instruction
* Design and Conduct Summative Evaluation

With this model, components are executed iteratively and in parallel, rather than linearly.&lt;ref name=DickCarey2005/&gt;

===Guaranteed Learning===
The instructional design model, Guaranteed Learning, was formerly known as the Instructional Development Learning System (IDLS).&lt;ref name="Esseff &amp; Esseff 1998"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Esseff, Peter J. |author2=Esseff, Mary Sullivan |year=1998 |title=Instructional Development Learning System (IDLS) |edition=8th |origyear=1970 |url=http://esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html |pages=1–12 |publisher=ESF Press |isbn=1-58283-037-1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119152404/http://www.esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html |archivedate=2008-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model was originally published in 1970 by Peter J. Esseff, PhD and Mary Sullivan Esseff, PhD in their book entitled ''IDLS—Pro Trainer 1: How to Design, Develop, and Validate Instructional Materials''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html ESF, Inc. – Train-the-Trainer – ESF ProTrainer Materials – 813.814.1192] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119152404/http://www.esf-protrainer.com/Materials.html |date=2008-11-19 }}. ESF-ProTrainer.com (2007-11-06). Retrieved on 2011-10-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter (1968) &amp; Mary (1972) Esseff both received their doctorates in Educational Technology from the Catholic University of America under the mentorship of Dr. Gabriel Ofiesh, a founding father of the Military Model mentioned above. Esseff and Esseff synthesized existing theories to develop their approach to systematic design, "Guaranteed Learning" aka "Instructional Development Learning System" (IDLS). In 2015, Peter and Mary Esseff created an eLearning course to enable participants to take the GL course online under the direction of Dr. Esseff.

The components of the Guaranteed Learning Model are the following:
* Design a task analysis
* Develop criterion tests and performance measures
* Develop interactive instructional materials
* Validate the interactive instructional materials
* Create simulations or performance activities (Case Studies, Role Plays, and Demonstrations)

==Motivational design==
Motivation is defined as an internal drive that activates behavior and gives it direction.  The term motivation theory is concerned with the process that describe why and how human behavior is activated and directed.

===Motivation concepts===
''Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation''
* Instrinsic: defined as the doing of an activity for its inherent satisfactions rather than for some separable consequence.  When intrinsically motivated a person is moved to act for the fun or challenge entailed rather than because of external rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivations|url=http://www.idealibrary.com|work=Contemporary Educational Psychology|accessdate=April 1, 2012|author=R. Ryan|author2=E. Deci|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109104815/http://www.idealibrary.com/|archivedate=January 9, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intrinsic motivation reflects the desire to do something because it is enjoyable.  If we are intrinsically motivated, we would not be worried about external rewards such as praise.
:''Examples:'' Writing short stories because you enjoy writing them, reading a book because you are curious about the topic, and playing chess because you enjoy effortful thinking
* Extrinsic: reflects the desire to do something because of external rewards such as awards, money and praise.  People who are extrinsically motivated may not enjoy certain activities.  They may only wish to engage in certain activities because they wish to receive some external reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intrinsic Motivation and Extrinsic Motivation with Examples of Each Types of Motivation|url=http://www.psychologyandsociety.com/motivation.html|publisher=Blue Fox Communications|accessdate=April 1, 2012|author=Brad Bell|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414050628/http://www.psychologyandsociety.com/motivation.html|archivedate=April 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Examples:'' The writer who only writes poems to be submitted to poetry contests, a person who dislikes sales but accepts a sales position because he/she desires to earn an above average salary, and a person selecting a major in college based on salary and prestige, rather than personal interest.

has devoted his career to researching and understanding motivation in instructional systems.  These decades of work constitute a major contribution to the instructional design field. First, by applying motivation theories systematically to design theory.  Second, in developing a unique problem-solving process he calls the ARCS Motivation....

=== ARCS MODEL ===
The ARCS Model of Motivational Design was created by John Keller while he was researching ways to supplement the learning process with motivation.  The model is based on Tolman's and Lewin's expectancy-value theory, which presumes that people are motivated to learn if there is value in the knowledge presented (i.e. it fulfills personal needs) and if there is an optimistic expectation for success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ely|first=Donald|title=Development and Use of the ARCS Model of Motivational Design|year=1983|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|pages=225–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model consists of four main areas: Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction.

Attention and relevance according to John Keller's ARCS motivational theory are essential to learning.  The first 2 of 4 key components for motivating learners, attention, and relevance can be considered the backbone of the ARCS theory, the latter components relying upon the former.

==== Components ====

=====Attention=====

The attention mentioned in this theory refers to the interest displayed by learners in taking in the concepts/ideas being taught.  This component is split into three categories: perceptual arousal, using surprise or uncertain situations; inquiry arousal, offering challenging questions and/or problems to answer/solve; and variability, using a variety of resources and methods of teaching.  Within each of these categories, John Keller has provided further sub-divisions of types of stimuli to grab attention. Grabbing attention is the most important part of the model because it initiates the motivation for the learners.  Once learners are interested in a topic, they are willing to invest their time, pay attention, and find out more.

=====Relevance=====

Relevance, according to Keller, must be established by using language and examples that the learners are familiar with.  The three major strategies Keller presents are goal-oriented, motive matching, and familiarity.  Like the Attention category, Keller divided the three major strategies into subcategories, which provide examples of how to make a lesson plan relevant to the learner. Learners will throw concepts to the wayside if their attention cannot be grabbed and sustained and if relevance is not conveyed.

=====Confidence=====

The confidence aspect of the ARCS model focuses on establishing positive expectations for achieving success among learners. The confidence level of learners is often correlated with motivation and the amount of effort put forth in reaching a performance objective. For this reason, it's important that learning design provides students with a method for estimating their probability of success. This can be achieved in the form of a syllabus and grading policy, rubrics, or a time estimate to complete tasks. Additionally, confidence is built when positive reinforcement for personal achievements is given through timely, relevant feedback.

=====Satisfaction=====

Finally, learners must obtain some type of satisfaction or reward from a learning experience. This satisfaction can be from a sense of achievement, praise from a higher-up, or mere entertainment. Feedback and reinforcement are important elements and when learners appreciate the results, they will be motivated to learn. Satisfaction is based upon motivation, which can be intrinsic or extrinsic. To keep learners satisfied, instruction should be designed to allow them to use their newly learned skills as soon as possible in as authentic a setting as possible.

==== Motivational Design Process ====
Along with the motivational components (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) the ARCS model provides a process that can address motivational problems. This process has 4 phases (Analysis, Design, Development, and Evaluation) with 10 steps within the phases:

'''Step 1: Obtain course information'''

Includes reviewing the description of the course, the instructor, and way of delivery the information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 2: Obtain audience information'''

Includes collecting the current skill level, attitudes towards the course, attitudes towards the teacher, attitudes towards the school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 3: Analyze audience'''

This should help identify the motivational problem that needs to be addressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 4: Analyze existing materials'''

Identifying positives of the current instructional material, as well as any problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 5:  List objectives and assessments'''

This allows the creation of assessment tools that align with the objectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 6: List potential tactics'''

Brainstorming possible tactics that could fill in the motivational gaps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 7: Select and design tactics'''

Integrates, enhances, and sustains tactics from the list that fit the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 8: Integrate with instruction'''

Integrate the tactic that was chosen from the list into the instruction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 9: Select and develop materials'''

Select materials, modify to fit the situation and develop new materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Step 10: Evaluate and revise'''

Obtain reactions from the learner and determine satisfaction level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Motivating opportunities===
Although Keller's ARCS model currently dominates instructional design with respect to learner motivation, in 2006 Hardré and Miller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardré|first=Patricia|author2=Miller, Raymond B.|title=Toward a current, comprehensive, integrative, and flexible model of motivation for instructional design|journal=Performance Improvement Quarterly|year=2006|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a need for a new design model that includes current research in human motivation, a comprehensive treatment of motivation, integrates various fields of psychology and provides designers the flexibility to be applied to a myriad of situations.

Hardré&lt;ref name="Hardré 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hardré|first=Patricia|title=The motivating opportunities model for Performance SUCCESS: Design, Development, and Instructional Implications|journal=Performance Improvement Quarterly|year=2009|volume=22|issue=1|doi=10.1002/piq.20043}}&lt;/ref&gt;  proposes an alternate model for designers called the Motivating Opportunities Model or MOM. Hardré's model incorporates cognitive, needs, and affective theories as well as social elements of learning to address learner motivation. MOM has seven key components spelling the acronym 'SUCCESS' – Situational, Utilization, Competence, Content, Emotional, Social, and Systemic.&lt;ref name="Hardré 2009"/&gt;

The '''International Association for Plant Taxonomy''' ('''IAPT''') promotes an understanding of [[plant]] [[biodiversity]], facilitates international communication of research between [[botany|botanists]], and oversees matters of uniformity and stability in plant names. The IAPT was founded on July 18, 1950 at the Seventh [[International Botanical Congress]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT|IAPT web site]].&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the IAPT headquarters is located in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]. Its current president, since 2017, is [[Patrick S. Herendeen]] of the [[Chicago Botanic Garden]]; vice-president is [[Gonzalo Nieto Feliner]] of the [[Real Jardín Botánico]], Madrid; and secretary-general is [[Karol Marhold]] of the Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.

Both the taxonomic journal '''''Taxon''''' and the series '''''Regnum Vegetabile''''' are published by the IAPT.  The latter series includes the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'', the ''Index Nominum Genericorum'', and ''Index Herbariorum''.

==Purpose==
The IAPT's primary purpose is the promotion and understanding of biodiversity—the discovery, naming, [[taxonomic classification|classification]], and [[systematics]] of plants—for both living and [[Paleobotany|fossil plants]]. Additionally, it promotes the study and [[conservation biology|conservation]] of plant biodiversity, and works to raise awareness of the general public to this issue. The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists working in the fields of plant systematics, [[plant taxonomy|taxonomy]], and [[botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]]. This is accomplished in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources, such as reference publications and journals.

{{cquote | IAPT was founded in 1950 as a not-for-profit organisation for the purposes of publication of a periodical (''Taxon'') dealing with activities of the association and with objects of general importance for plant taxonomy, the publication of books and indices of utility for plant taxonomists (''Regnum Vegetabile''), the establishment and maintenance of committees for specific taxonomic and nomenclatural purposes, and the organization of international symposia on problems of plant systematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT2004|''Taxon'' '''53''' (1): 2]].&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The IAPT also seeks to achieve uniformity and stability in [[Botanical name|plant names]].  It accomplishes this through the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'', previously known as the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'', and through the oversight of the International Bureau for Plant Taxonomy and Nomenclature.

==Publications and online resources==
===''Taxon''===
&lt;!-- [[Taxon (journal)]] redirects to this section. --&gt;
''Taxon''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0040-0262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the bi-monthly journal of the IAPT. The journal, which was initiated in 1951, publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in the broadest sense. Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification. ''Taxon'' also contains matters related to [[botanical nomenclature]], and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT2004|''Taxon'' '''53''' (1): 2]].&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals to amend the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (ICN). Publication of such matters in ''Taxon'' satisfies the required submission to the General Committee. The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant Biosystematics, reviews and notices of books and other publications, and news in the world of plant systematics.  Although the journal is "devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idTAXON|TAXON - Journal of the IAPT]].&lt;/ref&gt; it has been in the past criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idDavis1973|Davis &amp; Heywood 1973]], pp.33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Regnum Vegetabile''===
&lt;!-- [[Regnum Vegetabile]] redirects to this section. --&gt;
''Regnum Vegetabile''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0080-0694}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a published series of books on topics of interest to plant taxonomists. Many of the volumes are literature surveys or monographs in the area of plant systematics. There are several volumes of general use:
*''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (Vol. 159, 2018) The ''ICN'' is a set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal names that are given to plants. The current edition is known as the "Shenzhen Code", as it was drafted in 2017 at the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen, China.
*''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'', 8th edition (Vol. 151, 2010) Companion to the ''ICN'', this volume sets forth rules regarding the names of plant [[cultivar]]s.
*''Index Nominum Genericorum'' (Vols. 100-102 &amp; 113) An index of all published [[Genus|generic]] names covered by the ''ICN'', including the place of publication and information about the type species. The index is prepared in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution. An electronic version is available [http://botany.si.edu/ing/ online].
*''Index Herbariorum'', the first six editions (Vol. 15, 31, 86, 92, 93, 106, 109, 114, 117, 120) A directory and guide to the [[Herbarium|herbaria]] of the world, including contact information, abbreviation codes, and important collections located in each herbarium. ''Index Herbariorum'' is now an online database, managed by The New York Botanical Garden, and available for [http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/IndexHerbariorum.asp on-line searching].
*''International Directory of Botanical Gardens'' (Updated as Vol. 95, 1977) A directory to [[botanical garden]]s and [[Arboretum|arboreta]] around the world.

The series includes many additional volumes of interest to specialists in specific subdisciplines of botany, in addition to the ones listed above.

===Databases===
In addition to electronic versions of its print publications, the IAPT maintains the following:
* "Names in Current Use"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/ncu/default.htm Names in Current Use (NCU)]&lt;/ref&gt; - A database of scientific names of extant botanical genera.

== Awards ==

The IAPT established two Engler Medals in honour of [[Adolf Engler]] in 1986: the Engler Medal in Gold awarded every six years for outstanding lifetime contributions to plant taxonomy and presented since 1987 at each International Botanical Congress (IBC), and the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu lato) awarded from 1987 to 2001 for a monograph or other work in systematic botany and presented from 1990 to 2002 at various meetings, congresses, symposia, etc. In 2002 the latter medal was divided into three awards for outstanding publications in these areas: the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu stricto) awarded for monographic or floristic plant systematics; the Stafleu Medal awarded for historical, bibliographic, and/or nomenclatural aspects of plant systematics; and the Stebbins Medal awarded for phylogenetic plant systematics and/or plant evolution. The medals honor [[Adolf Engler]] (24 Mar. 1844-10 Oct. 1930), [[Frans Antonie Stafleu]] (8 Sep. 1921-16 Dec. 1997), and [[George Ledyard Stebbins, Jr.]] (6 Jan. 1906-19 Jan. 2000).{{sfn|IAPT|2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9919">'''Islamic graffiti''' is a [[genre]] of [[graffiti]] created by [[Islam]]ic people or by people inspired by the Islamic religion. Containing Islamic themes, this type of [[art]] finds expression in a variety of forms. The most common languages used are English and Arabic.   Like all other forms of art, graffiti can serve as a medium for instigating political or social change, or as a form of self-expression.

==Socio-political==
===Sticker art===
[[Sticker art]] refers to the practice of posting images or phrases to convey a message.[[File:Shop bamako posters marche fadjiguila.jpg|thumb|An example of Islamic sticker art in Mali]]
A collaborative project called "INSIDE OUT: Artocracy in Tunisia" uses sticker art to promote the spirit of democracy in post-revolutionary Tunisia. Prior to the revolution, only presidential photography could be found in the public space. A group of six photographers, along with a French graffiti artist called JR, replaced these pictures with black and white photographs of anonymous Tunisian people. Their goal is to inspire the people of Tunisia to see themselves in a new light. One of the photographers states: "If people want to tear them down, or write something on them, that's part of the project, that's okay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine|title=Art challenges Tunisian revolutionaries|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/03/201132223217876176.html|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=26 March 2011|agency=Al Jazeera|language=English, Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subvertising===
[[Subvertising]] refers to the practice of making spoofs or parodies of political advertisements. 
Princess Hijab, an anonymous street artist from Paris, paints Muslim veils on advertisements in the subway. She refers to this as "hijabisation." Since the enforcement of the "burqa ban," in which women are prohibited from wearing the burqa in public places, her art has sparked feminist and fundamentalist questions. It is not known if Princess Hijab is a Muslim or even a woman.  "The real identity behind Princess Hijab is of no importance," she has been quoted. Inspired by Naomi Klein's [[No Logo]], she drew her first veil in 2006 on the French rapper [[Diam's]], who subsequently happened to convert to Islam and now wears a veil. Graffiti on the subways in Paris is considered vandalism. Consequently, Princess Hijab has become highly selective and only paints four to five advertisements a year. She chooses to combine veils with advertisements because they are both "dogmas that can be questioned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|title=Cornered – Princess Hijab, Paris's elusive graffiti artist|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/11/princess-hijab-paris-graffiti-artist|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 November 2010|agency=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti as a form of communication in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] began in 1987 during the first Intifada. This was a period in which there were no Palestinian TV or Radio stations in the Gaza Strip. Murals commemorated martyrs as well as called protestors to action. Israeli military would force Palestinians to wash off graffiti from their homes. The Dome of the Rock was common among murals in Palestine. In 2006, [[Hamas]] took over the graffiti scene. Hamas would encourage people to perform the first of the day’s five prayers through street art.&lt;ref&gt;Gröndahl, Mia. ''Gaza Graffiti: Messages of Love and Politics''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, The [[West Bank]] wall is covered in graffiti. Numerous messages can be found including marriage proposals, notes to friends, and jokes. Also common are messages of peace. One reads: "Mirror, mirror on the wall. When will this senseless object fall?" "Trying to imagine a clear view between Palestine and Israel," is another. Messages such as these splatter across the wall, and some graffiti artists will paint your message for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Melissa|title=Palestinian graffiti spreads message of peace|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-16/world/palestinian.wall.graffiti_1_west-bank-five-palestinian-villages-barrier-cuts?_s=PM:WORLD|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=16 April 2009|agency=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable graffiti artists==
===Middle East===
''See also: [[Graffiti in Iran]].''

From [[Lebanon]], [[Yazan Halwani]] has developed his form of graffiti based on Arabic calligraphy, figures and culture. His style mixes portraiture and Arabic calligraphy on large walls in [[Beirut]]. Halwani thinks that graffiti in the Arab world and Beirut should not evolve into a form of vandalism and therefore he says that his murals try to adapt to their environment and not against it.&lt;ref&gt;Alabaster, Olivia. [http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Lifestyle/2013/Feb-09/205688-i-like-to-write-beirut-as-its-the-city-that-gave-us-everything.ashx#axzz3DCxf8Utr "I like to write Beirut as it’s the city that gave us everything"], ''[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]]'', Beirut, 09 February 2013. Retrieved on 13 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Tehran, graffiti artist [[A1one]] (a.k.a. Tanha) has been credited with starting the modern street art movement in [[Tehran]] and [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vandalog|title=A1one in Tehran IRAN|url=http://blog.vandalog.com/2011/05/from-a1one-in-tehran-iran/|accessdate=8 October 2012|newspaper=Vandalog|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career as an artist in the late 1990s with indoor painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title={{sic|Graffitti|hide=y}} in Tehran: Instigating Political Change |url=http://socialactive.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/graffitti-in-teheran-instigating-political-change/|work=the bohemian|publisher=Social Active|accessdate=9 June 2012|date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Now he is an international artist, known for his innovative Arabic and Persian calligraphic street art painted in various countries.
[[File:Tehranurbanartalone.jpg|thumb|A wall spraypainted by "[[A1one]]" in Tehran]] 

In 2003, he moved outdoors by spraying a 30x40cm stencil on university walls to express to the "uncommon pressure" at the university which was "endured in silence." However, the motivations behind his art are not protest. He states that his art is simply personal expression: "A drawing on the street is similar to a letter: It proves that there is a writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Uleshka |title=A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran |url=http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |accessdate=9 June 2012 |newspaper=PingMag |date=19 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |archivedate=12 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Arab World, three major areas of interest can be identified: Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and the Arab states that were involved in the Arab Spring. In these areas, graffiti has been perceived, both by the public and the media, as a barometer of the society. Lebanon’s religious and ethnic diversity and its position at the crossroad of the Mediterranean basin and the Arab World have contributed to the appearance and development of an active youth culture and graffiti is part of it. Secondly, the Palestinian Territories are a space where graffiti is one of the most powerful forms of protest against what its inhabitants perceive as a contemporary form of colonization. Last but not least, the social importance of graffiti and its militant functions have recently been reflected by the international media, within the coverage of the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria. The media coverage of the Arab Spring has drawn attention to a type of both artistic and political expression typical for the young people in the MENA region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicoarea|first=Georgiana|url=https://www.academia.edu/2219214/Cultural_Interactions_in_The_Graffiti_Subculture_of_The_Arab_World._Between_Globalization_and_Cosmopolitanism|title=Cultural Interactions in the Graffiti Subculture of the Arab World |publisher=Romano-Arabica Journal |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
After growing up in Paris during the late 80s and early 90s, graffiti artist eL Seed found himself inspired by hip-hop culture. With parents from Temoula, [[Tunisia]], he explored his North African origins by learning calligraphy. Before becoming an artist, he pursued degrees in marketing and business. After befriending a graffiti artist known as Hest1, he began to combine his love of graffiti and calligraphy. Today, he creates both personal exhibitions as well as murals for commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alwazir|first=Atiaf Z.|title=Garbage Collectors and the Struggle For Workers' Rights in Yemen|url=http://aslanmedia.com/arts-culture/324-from-elan/4175-el-seed-explores-identity-with-graffiti-art|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=Aslan Media|date=6 June 2012|agency=Aslan Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also combining calligraphy with graffiti, Niels Meulman (also known as SHOE) coined the phrase "[[calligraffiti]]." Born in Amsterdam, SHOE has worked for ad agencies such as BBDO and the television channel [[MTV]].  The Metropolitan Museum of Art called calligraffiti "a new explosive art form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calligraffiti: An Explosive New Art Form (17 pics)|url=http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/calligraffiti-an-explosive-new|work=My Modern Met|publisher=My Modern Met|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=alice|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lint Center for National Security Studies''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] created to provide [[Student financial aid (United States)|merit-based scholarships]] for [[counterintelligence]] and [[national security]] workers and scholars, and to advance the study of national security. The center is [[veteran]] and [[Ethnic minority|minority]] operated and managed, using an all-volunteer force to promote awareness of their scholarship opportunities through online media projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://intpolicydigest.org/2014/05/20/lint-center-launches-new-awareness-web-video/|title=Lint Center Launches New Awareness Web Video|last=Coleman|first=Timothy|website=International Policy Digest|access-date=2016-03-15}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lint Center utilizes three programs of [[mentorship]], publishing, and scholarship, and aims to fill a niche void in counterintelligence by recognizing new potential and providing practitioner guidance to those aspiring to advance national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lintcenter.org/about-us/|title=About Us|website=The Lint Center for National Security Studies|access-date=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lint Center was founded in 2007 by retired [[Special agent|Special Agent]] James Lint to develop emerging leaders in national security and [[intelligence assessment]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pointsoflight.org/blog/2014/09/11/911-made-counterterrorism-%25E2%2580%2598-more-pressing-priority%25E2%2580%2599-nation-and-these-volunteers|title=9/11 Made Counterterrorism ‘a More Pressing Priority’ for the Nation and for These Volunteers|date=11 September 2014|website=Points of Light|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lint Center's primary focus is to provide support for the next generation of America’s national security workforce by helping to achieve educational goals. Its mission statement is to provide a support system for those who serve freedom around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mclwestchester.org/news/viewarticle.asp?fn=Lint-Center-Announces-2012-Scholarship-Competition|title=Lint Center Announces 2012 Scholarship Competition|date=5 July 2012|website=MCLWestchester.org|publisher=Marine Corps League Westchester County Detachment|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center involves a scholarship and mentorship program, with more than 200 volunteer professionals mentoring students pursuing careers in national [[intelligence service]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As an all-volunteer force, the center has no administrative costs or overhead and all funds from donations go directly to scholarships.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hstoday.us/channels/dodnational-defense/single-article-page/points-of-light-foundation-recognize-lint-center-for-national-security-studies.html|title=Homeland Security Today: Points of Light Foundation Recognize Lint Center for National Security Studies|last=Vicinanzo|first=Amanda|date=1 October 2014|website=HSToday.us|publisher=Homeland Security Today|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mentorship program ==
The Lint Center's mentoring team consists of active and retired national security practitioners from the military, defense, intelligence and academic communities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.commdiginews.com/business-2/lint-center-for-national-security-studies-lauded-on-911-by-bushs-points-of-light-foundation-25623/|title=Lint Center for National Security Studies Lauded on 9/11 by Bush’s Points of Light Foundation|last=Ruth|first=Lisa M.|website=Communities Digital News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These volunteers provide mentees with the opportunity to ask for advice, seek guidance on career paths and options, and gain a better understanding of the protocols within their field of interest. Anna Hyonjoo Lint, Ph.D., the center's Vice Chairwoman, explained that “The purpose of the Center is to empower, enhance, and enable the next generation of America’s counterintelligence and national security workforce through scholarship initiatives.”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lint Center announces new national security scholarships|date=17 December 2012|website=Examiner.com|publisher=AXS Digital Group LLC|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mentoring program also serves to dispel myths about careers in intelligence and security, since the nature of intelligence work is secretive and known to the public primarily through movies and television.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pointsoflight.org/programs/recognition/dpol/awards/5303|title=Lint Center for National Security Studies|website=Points of Light|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship program ==
The Lint Center awards merit-based scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in programs focused on counterintelligence and national security studies as well as cultural understanding. Financial support for the scholarships include private and corporate sponsors, including global intelligence company [[Stratfor]], the [[OPSEC]] Professional Society, and the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Military Intelligence Corps]] Association.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Applicants to the Lint Center scholarships must write an essay demonstrating "their ability to think outside the box when it comes to national security."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Since 2007, the Lint Center has awarded 36 scholarships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recipients of the center's scholarships are connected with mentors within the students' field of interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2015, the Lint Center announced a partnership with a new corporate sponsor, [[Spies of Washington Tour]], which provides comprehensive tours featuring the [[history of espionage]] and intelligence operations in the United States. The sponsor donated tours to the winners of the 2015 Lint Center scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timothywcoleman.com/lint-center-announces-partnership-spies-washington-tour/|title=Lint Center Announces Partnership with Spies of Washington Tour|website=Timothy W.

An animal with the [[conservation status]] of '''lower risk''' is one with populations levels high enough to ensure its survival. Animals with this status do not qualify as being threatened or extinct, however, natural disasters or certain human activities would cause them to change to either of these classifications.

This classification is sub-divided into three types:
*[[Conservation dependent]] - where cessation of current conservation measures could result in it being classified at a higher risk level.
*[[Near threatened]] - close to becoming [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] but not meeting the criteria.
*[[Least concern]] - where neither of the two above apply.

'''Mock-heroic''', '''mock-epic''' or '''heroi-comic''' works are typically [[satire]]s or [[parodies]] that mock common Classical stereotypes of [[hero]]es and heroic literature.  Typically, mock-heroic works either put a fool in the role of the hero or exaggerate the heroic qualities to such a point that they become absurd.

==History==
Historically, the mock-heroic style was popular in 17th century Italy, and in the post-[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] and [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] periods in Great Britain.

The earliest example of the form is the ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' ascribed to [[Homer]] by the Romans and parodying his work, but believed by most modern scholars to be the work of an anonymous poet in the time of Alexander the Great &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.carmentablog.com/2016/12/27/batrachomyomachia-classical-parody/|title=Batrachomyomachia: A Classical Parody - Carmenta Language School Blog|date=2016-12-27|work=Carmenta Language School Blog|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

A longstanding assumption on the origin of the mock-heroic in the 17th century is that [[epic (genre)|epic]] and the [[pastoral]] genres had become used up and exhausted,&lt;ref name="Griffin1994p135"&gt;Griffin,Dustin H. (1994) ''Satire: A Critical Reintroduction'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=MLM2edymLtUC&amp;pg=PA135 p.135]&lt;/ref&gt; and so they got parodically [[reprise]]d. In the 17th century the epic genre was heavily criticized, because it was felt expressing the traditional values of the feudal society.
Among the new genres, closer to the modern feelings and proposing new ideals, the satirical literature was particularly effective in criticizing the old habits and values. Beside the Spanish [[picaresque novel]]s and the French [[burlesque]] novel, in Italy flourished the ''poema eroicomico''. &lt;br&gt;
In this country those who still wrote epic poems, following the rules set by [[Torquato Tasso]] in his work ''Discorsi del poema eroico'' (''Discussions about the Epic Poems'') and realized in his masterwork, the ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', were felt as antiquated.&lt;br&gt;
The new mock-heroic poem accepted the same metre, vocabulary, rhetoric of the epics. However, the new genre turned the old epic upside down about the meaning, setting the stories in more familiar situations, to ridiculize the traditional epics. In this context was created the parody of epic genre.

''Lo scherno degli dèi'' (''The Mockery of Gods'') by [[Francesco Bracciolini]], printed in 1618 is often regarded as the first Italian ''poema eroicomico''.

[[File:Houghton MS Typ 619 - Amelonghi.jpg|thumb|Girolamo Amelonghi, 1547]]
However, the best known of the form is ''[[La secchia rapita]]'' (''The rape of the Bucket'') by [[Alessandro Tassoni]] (1622). &lt;br&gt;Other Italian mock-heroic poems were ''La Gigantea'' by [[Girolamo Amelonghi]] (1566), the ''Viaggio di Colonia'' (''Travel to Cologne'') by [[Antonio Abbondanti]] (1625), ''L'asino'' (''The donkey'') by [[Carlo de' Dottori]] (1652), ''La Troja rapita'' by [[Loreto Vittori]] (1662), ''Il malmantile racquistato'' by [[Lorenzo Lippi]] (1688), ''La presa di San Miniato'' by [[Ippolito Neri]] (1764).

Also in Italian dialects were written mock-heroic poems. For example, in [[Neapolitan dialect]] the best known work of the form was ''La Vaiasseide'' by [[Giulio Cesare Cortese]] (1612).&lt;br&gt; While in [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] [[Giovanni Camillo Peresio]] wrote ''Il maggio romanesco'' (1688), [[Giuseppe Berneri]] published ''[[Meo Patacca]]'' in 1695, and, finally, [[Benedetto Micheli]] printed ''La libbertà romana acquistata e defesa'' in 1765.

After the translation of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', by [[Miguel de Cervantes]], English authors began to imitate the inflated language of [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]] poetry and narrative to describe misguided or common characters.  The most likely genesis for the mock-heroic, as distinct from the [[picaresque novel|picaresque]], [[burlesque (literature)|burlesque]], and [[satire|satirical]] poem is the comic poem ''[[Hudibras]]'' (1662–1674), by [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]].  Butler's poem describes a "trew blew" Puritan knight during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], in language that imitates Romance and [[epic poetry]].  After Butler, there was an explosion of poetry that described a despised subject in the elevated language of heroic poetry and plays.  

''Hudibras'' gave rise to a particular verse form, commonly called the "[[Hudibrastic]]."  The Hudibrastic is poetry in closed rhyming couplets in iambic tetrameter, where the rhymes are often [[feminine rhyme]]s or unexpected conjunctions.  For example, Butler describes the [[English Civil War]] as a time which "Made men fight like mad or drunk/ For dame religion as for punk/ Whose honesty all durst swear for/ Tho' not one knew why or wherefore" ("punk" meaning a prostitute).  The strained and unexpected rhymes increase the comic effect and heighten the parody.  This formal indication of satire proved to separate one form of mock-heroic from the others.  After Butler, [[Jonathan Swift]] is the most notable practitioner of the Hudibrastic, as he used that form for almost all of his poetry.

[[Poet Laureate]] [[John Dryden]] is responsible for some of the dominance among satirical genres of the mock-heroic in the later Restoration era.  While Dryden's own plays would themselves furnish later mock-heroics (specifically, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' is satirized in the mock-heroic ''[[The Author's Farce]]'' and ''[[Tom Thumb (play)|Tom Thumb]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]], as well as ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''), Dryden's ''[[Mac Flecknoe]]'' is perhaps the ''[[locus classicus]]'' of the mock-heroic form as it would be practiced for a century to come.  In that poem, Dryden indirectly compares [[Thomas Shadwell]] with [[Aeneas]] by using the language of ''[[Aeneid]]'' to describe the coronation of Shadwell on the throne of Dullness formerly held by King Flecknoe.  The [[parody]] of Virgil satirizes Shadwell.  Dryden's prosody is identical to regular [[heroic verse]]:  iambic pentameter closed couplets.  The parody is not formal, but merely contextual and ironic. (For an excellent overview of the history of the mock-heroic in the 17th and 18th centuries see "the English Mock-Heroic poem of the 18th Century" by Grazyna Bystydzienska, published by Polish Scientific Publishers, 1982.) 

After Dryden, the form continued to flourish, and there are countless minor mock-heroic poems from 1680 to 1780.  Additionally, there were a few attempts at a mock-heroic novel.  The most significant later mock-heroic poems were by [[Alexander Pope]].  Pope’s ''The Rape of the Lock'' is a noted example of the Mock-Heroic style; indeed, Pope never deviates from mimicking [[epic poetry]] such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' .   The overall form of the poem, written in [[canto]]s, follows the tradition of epics, along with the precursory “Invocation of the [[Muse]]”; in this case, Pope's [[Muse]] is literally the person who prodded him to write the poem, [[John Caryll the younger|John Caryll]]: “this verse to Caryll, Muse, is due!” (line 3).  Epics always include foreshadowing which is usually given by an otherworldly figure{{fact|date=November 2013 }}, and Pope mocks tradition through Ariel the sprite, who sees some “dread event” (line 109) impending on Belinda.  These epic introductory tendencies give way to the main portion of the story, usually involving a battle of some kind (such as in the ''Iliad'') that follows this pattern: dressing for battle (description of Achilles shield, preparation for battle), altar sacrifice/libation to the gods, some battle change (perhaps involving drugs), treachery (Achilles ankle is told to be his weak spot), a journey to the Underworld, and the final battle.  All of these elements are followed eloquently by Pope in that specific order: Belinda readies herself for the card game (which includes a description of her hair and beauty), the Baron makes a sacrifice for her hair (the altar built for love and the deal with Clarissa), the “mock” battle of cards changes in the Baron’s favor, Clarissa’s treachery to her supposed friend Belinda by slipping the Baron scissors, and finally the treatment of the card game as a battle and the Baron’s victory.  Pope’s [http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/rapeofthelock/analysis.html mastery of the Mock-Heroic] is clear in every instance.  Even the typical [[apotheosis]] found in the epics is mimicked in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', as “the stars inscribe Belinda’s name!” (line 150). He invokes the same Mock-heroic style in ''[[The Dunciad]]'' which also employs the language of heroic poetry to describe menial or trivial subjects.    In this mock-epic the progress of [[Dulness]] over the face of the earth, the coming of stupidity and tastelessness, is treated in the same way as the coming of civilization is in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (see also the metaphor of ''[[translatio studii]]'').  [[John Gay]]'s ''[[Trivia (poem)|Trivia]]'' and ''[[Beggar's Opera]]'' were mock-heroic (the latter in [[opera]]), and [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[London (Samuel Johnson poem)|London]]'' is a mock-heroic of a sort.

By the time of Pope, however, the mock-heroic was giving ground to narrative [[parody]], and authors such as Fielding led the mock-heroic novel into a more general novel of parody.  The ascension of the novel drew a slow end to the age of the mock-heroic, which had originated in Cervantes's novel.  After [[Romanticism]]'s flourishing, mock-heroics like Byron's ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' were uncommon.

Finally, the mock-heroic genre spread throughout Europe, in [[France]], in [[Scotland]], in [[Poland]], in [[Bohemia]], in [[Russia]]. The most noted mock-heroic poems in French were ''Le Vergile Travesti'' (''The disguised Vergil'') by [[Paul Scarron]] (1648–52) and ''[[The Maid of Orleans (poem)|The Maid of Orleans]]'' by [[Voltaire]] (1730). In [[macaronic Latin]] enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions [[William Drummond of Hawthornden]] wrote ''Polemo-Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam'' in 1684. The main author of mock-heroic poems in Polish was [[Ignacy Krasicki]], who wrote ''Myszeida'' (''Mouseiad'') in 1775 and ''Monacomachia'' (''The War of the Monks'') in 1778. In the same language [[Tomasz Kajetan Węgierski]] published ''Organy'' in 1775-77. The Bohemian poet [[Šebestiàn Hnĕvkovský]] in 1805 printed two mock-heroic poems: ''Dĕvin'' in Czech and ''Der böhmische Mägderkrieg'' in German. In 1791 the Russian poet [[N. P. Osipov]] published {{Interlanguage link multi|Eneida travestied|ru|3=Вергилиева Энеида, вывороченная наизнанку|lt=''Eneida travestied''}} ({{lang-ru|Вирги́лиева Энеи́да, вы́вороченная наизна́нку|italic=yes}}). [[Ivan Kotliarevsky]]'s mock-epic poem Eneyida (Ukrainian: Енеїда), written in 1798, is considered to be the first literary work published wholly in the [[modern Ukrainian language]].

== Summary ==
Municipal engineering is concerned with [[municipality|municipal]] [[infrastructure]]. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining [[street]]s, [[sidewalks]], [[water supply network]]s, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[cycling infrastructure]].  In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services.  It can also include the optimizing of [[municipal solid waste|garbage]] collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other [[civil engineering]] specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously (for a given street or development project), and managed by the same municipal authority.

== History ==

Modern municipal engineering finds its origins in the 19th-century [[United Kingdom]], following the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the growth of large industrial cities. The threat to urban populations from epidemics of waterborne diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[typhus]] lead to the development of a profession devoted to "sanitary science" that later became "municipal engineering".

A key figure of the so-called "public health movement" was [[Edwin Chadwick]], author of the parliamentary report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lzK5iitgFpUC&amp;dq=%22The+Sanitary+Condition+of+the+Labouring+Population%22&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c1PT6hM-0t&amp;sig=0X-fVS7mnsKicgP6oK50rEboxkE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rnPISs_uJ-WZjAeJ3uE6&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Report to Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department, from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry Into the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain: With Appendices|first=Great Britain Poor Law|last=Commissioners|date=16 June 2018|publisher=W. Clowes and sons|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;, published in 1842.

Early British legislation included:

*[[Police burgh#The 1833 act|Burgh Police Act 1833]] - powers of paving, lighting, cleansing, watching, supplying with water and improving their communities.
*[[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]
*[[Public Health Act 1866]] – formation of drainage boards
*[[Public Health Act 1875]] known at the time as the Great Public Health Act
This legislation provided local authorities with powers to undertake municipal engineering projects and to appoint borough surveyors (later known as "municipal engineers").

In the U.K, the Association of Municipal Engineers, (subsequently named Institution of Municipal Engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905230330/http://www.placecheck.info/municipal_engineering_archive.htm|title=Municipal Engineering Archive|date=5 September 2008|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;), was established in 1874 under the encouragement of the Institution of Civil Engineers, to address the issue of the application of sanitary science.  By the early 20th century, Municipal Engineering had become a broad discipline embracing many of the responsibilities undertaken by local authorities, including roads, drainage, flood control, coastal engineering, public health, waste management, street cleaning, water supply, sewers, waste water treatment, crematoria, public baths, [[slum clearance]], town planning, public housing, energy supply, parks, leisure facilities, libraries, town halls and other municipal buildings.

In the UK, the development of different strands of knowledge necessary for the management of municipal infrastructure led to the emergence of separate specialised institutions, including:
*For drainage: Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, 1895
*For town planning: Town Planning Institute 1914 ... subsequently becoming the Royal Town Planning Institute
*For street lighting: Association of Public Lighting Engineers, 1934...subsequently becoming the Institution of Lighting Engineers
*For highway engineering: Institution of Highways and Transportation, 1930
*For public housing: Institute of Housing, 1931

In 1984 the Institution of Municipal Engineers merged with the Institution of Civil Engineers.

Since the 1970s, there has been a global trend toward increasing privatisation and outsourcing of municipal engineering services.

In the UK in the 1990s a change in management philosophy brought the demise of the traditional organisational structure of boroughs where the three functions of town clerk, borough treasurer and borough engineer were replaced by an administrative structure with a larger number of specialised departments.

In the late 1990s and early 21st century there was increasing dissatisfaction over what was perceived to be fractured and dysfunctional public services designed along narrow specialties. A more holistic approach to urban engineering began to emerge as an alternative concept. Critics of the specialised approach included the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]] that complained that the specialised approach to management of the public realm focussed too much on the on efficient movement of vehicles rather than the more general interests of local communities....GANESH.One of the civil eng.

== Professional practice ==

In the United Kingdom there is no longer any formal professional qualification in municipal engineering although there are degree courses available in urban engineering.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

A professional certificate in Urban Engineering is available from through the Institution of Incorporated Engineers via the Public Realm Information and Advice Network.

The British [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) caters to practitioners employed in the public sector, private consultancy and academia through its Proceedings Journal Municipal Engineer.  The journal, first published in 1873, has a global scope and covers the whole life cycle of municipal services addressing technical, political and community issues.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkinson, Ian. “Municipal Engineer – the silver anniversary”. Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Municipal Engineer, Vol 162, ME2, June 2009, pp65-68&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition an
Expert Panel responds on behalf of ICE to Government consultations and is represented on the International Federation of Municipal Engineering.

== International organization ==
The International Federation of Municipal Engineering (IFME) is an organisation comprising professional municipal engineers from all round the world.  IFME's mission is to connect municipal engineers, public works professionals, public agencies, institutions and businesses around the world in order that they can share a global pool of knowledge and experience.  The aim is to foster continued improvement in the quality of public works and wider community services.

The inaugural meeting was held in 1960 at the [[UNESCO]] headquarters in Paris.  Membership has grown steadily and in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;Buchan, Neil.  “Briefing Note - International Federation of Municipal Engineering”. Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, Municipal Engineer, Vol 163, ME3, Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt; comprised representatives from national associations in:  Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Israel, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Southern Africa (South Africa, Botawana, Namibia &amp; Zimbabwe), Sweden, UK (England, Scotland, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland) and USA.   Belgium and San Marino are presently Corresponding Members.

== Related engineering disciplines ==
Municipal or urban engineering combines elements of [[environmental engineering]], [[water resources engineering]] and [[transport engineering]].

== Relationship to urban design or urban planning ==
Today, municipal engineering may be confused with [[urban design]] or [[urban planning]].  Whereas the urbanist or urban planner may design the general layout of streets and public places, the municipal engineer is concerned with the detailed design.  For example, in the case of the design of a new street, the urbanist may specify the general layout of the street, including landscaping, surface finishings and urban accessories, but the municipal engineer will prepare the detailed plans and specifications for the roads, sidewalks, municipal services and street lighting.

== Site civil works ==
In the case of large buildings or plants, facilities or campuses, site civil works may be required that are similar in scope or type as municipal infrastructure, namely, access roads, parking lots, potable water supply (including fire hydrants), on-site waste water treatment plants, site drainage including sedimentation and retention ponds or basins, etc.  In most engineering consulting firms, Structural Engineering and Municipal Infrastructure are typically separate departments.  On a large construction project, the civil engineering design will typically be divided into a structural portion, designed by structural engineers and typically focused on the buildings, and "civil" portion, designed by municipal engineers and focused on the site.[gani..CW]

'''''Nоva''''' (1968) is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Samuel R. Delany]]. Nominally [[space opera]], it explores the politics and culture of a future where [[cyborg]] technology is universal (the novel is one of the precursors to [[cyberpunk]]), yet making major decisions can involve using [[tarot]] cards. It has strong mythological overtones, relating to both the [[Holy Grail|Grail Quest]] and Jason's ''[[Argonautica]]'' for the golden fleece. ''Nova'' was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="WWE-1969"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2009-08-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Pringle]] lists it as one of the [[Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels|100 best science-fiction novels]] written since World War II.

After Delany completed ''Nova'' at the age of 25, his published output stopped for several years, although his writing continued. Delany completed the first draft of ''[[Equinox (novel)|Tides of Lust]]'' (author's title, ''Equinox'') in September 1968 (it appeared in 1973). He first completed ''[[Hogg (novel)|Hogg]]'' in June 1969 (though the novel itself would not appear until 1995). With the publication of his next major novel, ''[[Dhalgren]]'' (1975), however, his style had moved on in experimental directions notably different from that of his earlier work.

==Synopsis==
By the year 3172, political power in the galaxy is split between two factions: the older Earth-based Draco and the historically younger Pleiades Federation. Both have interests in the even newer Outer Colonies, where mines produce trace amounts of the prized power source Illyrion, the [[Super-heavy atom|superheavy]] material essential to starship travel and [[terraforming]] planets.

Caught in a feud between aristocratic and economically powerful families, a scarred and obsessed captain from the Pleiades, Lorq Von Ray, recruits a disparate crew of misfits to aid him in the race with his arch-enemy, Prince Red from Draco's Red Shift Ltd., to gain economic leadership by securing a vastly greater amount of Illyrion directly from the heart of a stellar [[nova]]. In doing so, Von Ray will shift the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] of the existing galactic order, which will bring about the downfall of the Red family as well as end [[Earth]]'s dominance over interstellar politics.

As the title indicates, the central [[metaphor]] for the novel is a nova: the destructive implosion/explosion of an entire sun, which, paradoxically, while it destroys most of a solar system, also creates new elements. In the book, at the eruption of a nova, not only do the laws of [[physics]] break down, but so do the laws of politics and [[psychology]]. This idea permeates the entire plot and storyline.

The characters follow a [[quest]] plot line, in which they visit several worlds to gain information necessary to achieve their goal, all the while pursued by the Red family.

Although the novel does not indulge the literary experimentation found in Delany's later books, it maintains a high level of innovation. Some chapters end or begin in mid-sentence. Also, the [[point of view (literature)|point of view]] regularly shifts between Lorq, Katin, and the Mouse. Each page in the book carries a header that gives the year and location of the scene on the page itself (e.g., "Draco, Earth, Paris, 3162"). This is useful because of the flashbacks in the long journey around the galaxy.

==Reception==
[[Algis Budrys]], describing Delany as "the best science-fiction writer in the world," praised ''Nova'' as "highly entertaining to read" and commended Delany's integration of his sociopolitical  extrapolation into his story, his accomplished characterization, and his "virtuosity" in presenting the novel's "classically posed scientific puzzle."&lt;ref&gt;"Galaxy Bookshelf", [[Galaxy Science Fiction]], January 1969, p.189-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* '''Lorq Von Ray'''. Lorq is the scion of the wealthy Von Ray family, the most powerful clan in the Pleiades Federation. Originally a carefree playboy, Lorq is drawn into his family's feud with the Reds and, as a result, becomes obsessed with finding Illyrion. When Prince Red attacks him at a fabulously opulent party in Paris, he scars Lorq's face badly; but Lorq refuses to remove the scarring and as a result carries an air of menace.&lt;br&gt;As the book unfolds, Lorq learns that his family was founded by [[pirates]], who killed members of the Red family in previous generations in order to keep the Pleiades free of Earth-based [[corporations]], although Lorq's ancestors did so with the support of the Pleiades' citizens. The Reds, however, still carry a grudge.&lt;br&gt;Although Lorq Von Ray is described as looking between forty-five and fifty years old, according to the dates in the book he is barely thirty. This may have been a mathematical mistake on Delany's part: in the book's first edition there are several such errors, such as the numbering of the centuries: the year 1850 is in the middle of the nineteenth century, not the eighteenth. The year 2375 is in the middle of the twenty-fourth century, not the twenty-third. But these mistakes have been corrected in more recent editions. A possible explanation for Lorq's age is the Mouse's speculation that Lorq is "aged, not old"; the disparity in Lorq's age and appearance is so wide, however, the Mouse's theory is sometimes hard to hold onto.
* '''The Mouse'''. This is the nickname for Pontichos Provechi, a young [[Romani people|Gypsy]] from Earth, who, by age 18, has led an extremely varied life, and is just beginning to work in a starship navigation crew. He also entertains people by creating illusions and music with his "sensory [[syrinx|syrynx]]" (a sound, scent, and [[hologram]] projector).
* '''Katin Crawford'''. Katin is an intellectual from Earth's [[moon]], who received a [[liberal arts]] education at [[Harvard University]] and who has worked till now at a series of unfulfilling [[clerk|clerical]] positions. Katin is a loner. His passion is to explore various moons across the [[Solar System]]. He also aspires to write a novel, for which he constantly records notes, although the form is obsolete by the time ''Nova'' takes place. The word "novel" is, incidentally, etymologically related to the word "nova." Both come from the Latin ''novum'', which means "something new." Sometimes Katin annoys his colleagues by going off on long lectures on any number of topics; in this capacity, he is sometimes comic, even while acting as the novel's expository voice.
* '''Sebastian and Tyÿ'''. This wandering, working couple consists of Sebastian, a powerful-looking man who is nonetheless gentle—he keeps a number of unusual pets with him, his "flapping black gillies"—and his companion, Tyÿ, a quiet mysterious woman and tarot-card reader. Like many of Delany's characters, Sebastian is racially mixed: Although he has [[Asian people|Asian]] features, his hair is naturally blond. Both are from the Pleiades and consider it an honor to work for the Von Ray family.
* '''Lynceos and Idas'''. These twin brothers are of African descent, but one is an albino. Eventually we learn they are two members of a set of triplets. Having been born and grown up in the Outer Colonies, all three brothers had a tendency to use drugs and make mischief. As a result of one of their pranks, they ended in a type of [[indentured servitude]] and were forced to work in the colonies' Illyrion mines. (Such arrangements are common at that time to "recruit" workers for the mines.) The two talk in tandem. Jokingly Katin calls them a pair of "glorified salt and pepper shakers." Their names come from the twins who were among Jason's crew in his ancient quest for the fleece. Lynceos means lynx-like, i.e., sharp-eyed. Idas suggests someone from the pleasant fields of Mt. Ida.
* '''Prince Red'''. The scion of the Earth-based Red family, Prince was born with only one arm. In place of the other, he wears an artificial limb, which has unnatural strength. Its grip can compress sand into [[quartz]] crystals, which he can throw with the force of bullets. A troublemaker from birth (in his youth, he was forced constantly to shift schools because of discipline problems), he detests Lorq for numerous reasons, some of which he is not consciously aware of.&lt;br&gt;Because of the power his artificial arm gives him, Prince can become extremely violent if anyone so much as mentions his deformity. As a little boy he sprains Lorq's mother's wrist when, innocently, she asks for his hand to take him home when he has gotten into mischief after dark with the other children.
* '''Ruby Red'''. Prince's younger sister, Ruby, is a quiet-spoken woman, who appears to be completely under Prince's control. As an adolescent, Lorq falls in love with her, but she rebuffs him because of their families' hostile histories.&lt;br&gt;Prince appears to have an unhealthy attachment to his sister—which, often, she seems to reciprocate. While their father, Aaron, is still alive at the time of the novel and in charge of the Red's vast industrial holdings, Prince and Ruby are the most visible members of the Red clan.
* '''Dan'''. An Australian drifter whom Lorq first meets while the man is hitchhiking, Dan is the first to suggest to Lorq how a nova might be a source for Illyrion. Unfortunately, by the beginning of the novel, an accident on the first mission has damaged his senses and probably his sanity. He kills himself soon into the book, and most of his appearances take place in flashbacks.

The book's third chapter (of seven) is basically a long [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] that shows Lorq and Prince's childhoods and the political background against which the story takes place. Lorq first meets Prince and Ruby when they are all youngsters, during an attempt by their parents to end the feud between the families. The meeting ends, however, in disaster and embarrassment, and the fundamentally cruel natures of both Prince and his father Aaron—as well as the senior Von Ray's innate love of violence—become clear.

==Motifs==
'''''Nova''''' has a number of character motifs in common with Delany's later literary and literary-pornographic works: the Mouse, a damaged artist who wears one shoe as does the Kid in the later ''[[Dhalgren]]''; Katin, an intellectual and writer who attempts to record the events around him; the twins Lynceos and Idas, one black, the other albino; and Dan, a barefoot derelict, with a rope holding up his pants.

The novel, storyline, and themes of ''Nova'' are multilayered and complex, and lend themselves to numerous interpretations. As the critic Judith Merrill wrote at the book's publication:

::''Here are (at least some of) the ways you can read ''Nova'': As fast-action far-flung interstellar adventure; as archetypal mystical/mythical allegory (in which the Tarot and the Grail both figure prominently); as modern myth told in the SF idiom . . . The reader observes, recollects, or participates in a range of personal human experience including violent pain and disfigurement, sensory deprivation and overload, man-machine communion, the drug experience, the creative experience – and interpersonal relationships which include incest and assassination, father-son, leader-follower, human-pet, and ''lots'' more.’’&lt;ref&gt;Judith Merril, "Books", F&amp;SF, November 1968, p. 43-46.&lt;/ref&gt;([[Judith Merril]], 1968).

===Space opera===
''Nova'' takes place in a standard [[space opera]] setting with many of the features and tropes peculiar to the genre. Conscientiously the novel emulates many earlier and popular science fiction works.

Delany makes an offhand reference to [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[The Foundation Series|Foundation]] trilogy (a random planet is named "[[Trantor]]"). Additionally, in one scene, a character has a false [[tooth]] with [[poison]] hidden in it, a classical trope from many espionage stories, which [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' had employed three years before. (Unlike in ''Dune'', in ''Nova'' it doesn't work.)

There is also a strong similarity in names between the scientist, Ashton Clark, who, in ''Nova'', has invented the cyborg plugs and sockets centuries before, which pervade the novel, and the name of the fantasy and science fiction writer from the 'thirties and 'forties, [[Clark Ashton Smith]].

Prince’s ability to squeeze sand into glass and quartz fragments strongly parallels the power of many action heroes (most notably [[Superman]]), and the idea of aristocratic families feuding in space is found in numerous other space opera novels. The character of Katin is partially written to resemble the classic "bore" in science fiction literature—a character who constantly gives lectures and explanations to describe the universe of the book.  In ''Nova'', however, Katin is constantly ridiculed for filling this role and on occasion is used for comic relief.

In keeping with this sort of game-playing, in a scene that takes place in a vast museum, the Alkane, in the city of Phoenix on the planet Vorpis, at one point Lorq and Katin hurry through the "FitzGerald Salon," clearly based on the actual "Rubens Salon" in the Louvre Museum in Paris—after the "Mona Lisa" and the "Raft of the Medusa," probably the Louvre's most impressive holdings.

The artist [[Russell FitzGerald]] was a good friend of Delany's and did a number of book and magazine covers for him (including the cover for the first edition of ''Nova'' and the cover for the ''Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' edition of "We, in Some Strange Power's Employ, Move on a Rigorous Line" [1968]) and the three covers for the English paperback edition of the three volumes of Delany's Fall of the Towers trilogy. He is thanked at the beginning of ''Nova'', along with their mutual friend, the poet Helen Adam, for helping with "Grail and Tarot lore." FitzGerald had a basement studio on East 2nd Street in New York City's East Village, modeled after a similar studio used by the Victorian artist and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley and known to FitzGerald's friends as "the Black Studio." There FitzGerald worked on a series of large canvases similar in size to the ones by Rubens that line the walls of the Rubens Salon. Delany often visited the Black Studio and even worked there on ''Nova'' in his notebook, while FitzGerald worked on his great hyperreal paintings, the two of them drinking white wine together.

The museum lamp in ''Nova'' that allows paintings to be viewed under the same order of light in which they were created grew out of their studio conversations. Eventually FitzGerald did an entire tarot deck, which his friends referred to as "the ''Nova'' tarot." FitzGerald and "the Black Studio" are the model for the character "Proctor" and ''his'' studio—and the art objects contained in it—in Delany's novel ''Equinox'' (1973). For many years Delany hoped that a FitzGerald painting called ''Götterdämarung'', which he'd painted over the same months as Delany wrote ''Nova'', would eventually make a color cover for the novel. Alas, it never happened. Those interested in FitzGerald's colorful bisexual life can learn more about him in the biography of the San Francisco poet Jack Spicer, ''Poet Be Like God'' (Weslyan University Press; Hanover: 1998), by Lewis Ellingham and Kevin Killian. By the time FitzGerald and his wife and family left New York for Vancouver, B.C., the building housing the Black Studio had been taken over by the New York chapter of the Hells Angels (with whom FitzGerald was on good terms), who stayed on there for many years afterward.

===The tarot and the grail===
Within the future society, reading the Tarot is considered both scientific and accurate. The Mouse is actually ridiculed as old-fashioned and uneducated for his skepticism about such things.

Much of the story revolves around a tarot reading Tyÿ gives Lorq at the beginning of the second mission, in which she rather successfully predicts the stakes and outcome. For example, ''The Tower'' appears, indicating that a powerful family (presumably the Reds or Von Rays) will fall, and the large number of pentacles indicates wealth. Prince and Ruby are represented by the ''King of Swords'' and the ''Queen of Swords'', respectively. An anomaly in the reading, however, occurs when Tyÿ drops ''The Sun''—which Lorq considered to represent a nova—and the Mouse pockets it, thus making it impossible for Tyÿ's reading to include this card.

Smaller Tarot readings dot the rest of the novel. As a young child, Lorq receives a reading indicating a death in his family: within a month, his Uncle Morgan is assassinated. Likewise, Lorq's Aunt Cyana (Morgan's [[widow]]) has Lorq choose a single Tarot card for insight: it is ''The Hanged Man'', reversed, indicating that Lorq will succeed in his quest, but at a very high price.

Delany makes it clear that the Tarot should not be used for outright prediction. As Katin tells the highly skeptical Mouse: "[T]he cards don't actually predict anything. They simply propagate an educated commentary on present situations[.]" (''Nova'', 112). "[Tarot cards] only become superstitious when they are abused, employed to direct rather than guide and suggest." (''Nova'', 113) But, as the plot develops, sometimes it's difficult to distinguish clearly between useful "guiding" and abusive (superstitious) "directing."

The story of scarred Captain Von Ray's obsessive quest for a nova with his crew of outcasts recalls [[Herman Melville|Melville]]'s tale of wounded Captain Ahab's search for the white whale in ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. (In a 1971 article about the current state of Science Fiction, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' writer R. Z. Shepherd wrote, "[''Nova''] suggests ''Moby-Dick'' at a strobe-light show.") In ''Nova'', the events are interpreted by Katin as a quest for the [[Holy Grail]], with Illyrion playing the part of the Grail itself. As in the Grail story, there is a failed attempt to gain it, and someone must make a major self-sacrifice (in ''Nova'', his sanity and senses) in order to succeed.

Katin is constantly trying to find a plot for his novel, and finally decides to use Lorq's adventures with Prince and Ruby—immediately noticing the correspondences with the Grail archetype. By the end of the novel, it becomes clear that ''Nova'' is the book Katin will eventually write.

===Creativity, art, change, and stagnation===
Although the novel takes place in the 32nd century, the society within it is described as highly stagnant, even taking into account the spread of interstellar travel and cyborging. Often, however, the book suggests that those minor characters who repeatedly make this judgment are simply looking for symptoms of change and vitality in the wrong parts of society—a theme ''Nova'' shares with [[Alfred Bester]]'s ''The Stars My Destination''.

Cyana Von Ray Morgan, who is Lorq’s aunt and a [[curator]] at humanity’s largest museum, remarks that one-fourth of the displays at her museum are devoted to the Twentieth century, much the way major museums in Europe and the United States for the last hundred or so years might seem—to some—to have devoted a disproportionate amount of their space to Greek and Roman artifacts. She justifies this by saying that, despite all the progress made by mankind, the Twentieth Century encompasses the greatest change in humanity's fundamental situation: "At the beginning of that amazing century, mankind was many societies living on one world; at its end, it was basically what we are now: an informatively unified society that lived on several worlds." (''Nova'', 156)

In short, within the fictional future of ''Nova'', humanity began to colonize space by the end of the Twentieth Century. A few centuries later, and cyborg implants were invented. The combination of increasingly cheaper Illyrion (the fuel of starships) and universally-adaptable implants has created, by the time of the novel, a highly-mobile and transient [[work force]] and population.

This mobile population has a drawback, however. In a pseudo-intellectual argument raised throughout the novel, characters make reference to a "lack of cultural solidarity" (a concept that vaguely resembles the idea of [[cultural capital]]). Because the population is constantly on the move, there is no shared culture, nor have there been any successful attempts to create new broad-based artistic and cultural movements since the end of the Twentieth Century.

Characters make frequent references to 20th century culture: at Prince’s party in Paris (which takes place in the year 3162), a group of entertainers start performing a song by [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]. Katin makes an offhand remark that indicates the [[board game]] [[Monopoly (board game)|Monopoly]] (which was invented during the early 20th century) is still in existence, and has even been adapted to the future society. When he needs to name a "Renaissance Man," Katin mentions [[Bertrand Russell]], despite the passage of more than a millennium since Russell died.

In Cyana Morgan's museum, in addition to the predominance of Twentieth Century-based exhibits, within a hall of paintings, Katin notices that many of the works share the same subjects—and, in many cases, the same names—even though the tags clearly indicate the paintings were created centuries apart, and on different planets. The most famous art collection in the museum is actually a forgery of an existing set of works, and the forgeries are considered more popular and valuable than the originals.

A main interest of the book—unusual for a science fiction novel—is the two approaches to art characterized by the Mouse and Katin. In playing on his sensory syrynx, the Mouse is spontaneous, improvisatory, highly personal and immediately emotional. While he uses whatever material is around him as the basis for his art, the Mouse's creations on his syrynx are, however beautiful, ephemeral and disposable. In [[Nietzsche]]'s terms, he is a [[Dionysian]] artist. Katin on the other hand is (again in Nietzsche's terms) an [[Apollonian]] artist. He is deeply intellectual, highly theoretical, largely impersonal, and concerned with the richness and complexity of the statement his artwork will make in terms of history. The irony of his approach is that, for all the hundreds of thousands of words he has dictated into his recorder about his theory of what the novel should be and do, he is still looking for a subject—a story—that is important enough in historical terms to stand up under all his theorizing.

When the Mouse's approach gets out of control, as the novel dramatizes in one climactic sequence, the instruments of art become murderous weapons. When Katin's approach gets out of hand, the result is paralysis and silence.

The conclusion the Mouse arrives at to Katin's problem—and for the reader appreciating the book on this level, it should be no surprise—is that Lorq's quest itself, which will revise the power structure of the entire galaxy, ''is'' the historically proper subject for Katin's novel, at the same time that Katin realizes he must learn how to employ some of the Mouse's immediacy, spontaneity, and energy. It does not hurt that, by the end of ''Nova'', Lorq's quest has achieved the shape of a [[classical tragedy]]: Lorq has had to sacrifice his senses in the same way that Dan—at the start of the book—has already lost his; and in the way that the Mouse has been so afraid might happen to him. In many ways the novel is about perception itself—its value, its pleasures, the information it allows us to access, the sense it allows us to make of the rich and colorful social universe.

The novel refers repeatedly to a historic "Vega Republic," presumably among the worlds circling the star [[Vega]], which flourished several centuries prior to the novel’s beginning. At one point, apparently, the Republic staged an uprising and attempted to declare both political and cultural autonomy from Earth. During those years the Vegans created a new and different style in furniture, fabrics, and architecture. Many of their artists, musicians, and writers produced highly distinctive work that, in later years, caught the imagination of intellectuals in both Draco and the Pleiades. Before ''Nova'' begins, however, the Vega Republic uprising was violently suppressed, and Katin claims that the ability to identify remnants of Vegan culture has become nothing but an intellectual "parlor game."

As the quest continues, soon Lorq drops the rationalizations for the Red/Von Ray vendetta, except for the fact that his actions, for better or worse, will produce a major cultural shift in humanity, even though nobody can tell what that change will be, or if it will be a positive or negative one.

===Race===
The story's main character, Lorq, is Afropean. His father is of [[Norway|Norwegian]] descent, and his Earth-born mother is [[Senegalese]].

The residents of the Pleiades Federation (and the Outer Colonies) overall are an extremely mixed [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] population. In addition to appearances, characters from the Pleiades sometimes have names that indicate a mixed racial heritage. For example, one of Lorq's childhood friends is named “Yorgos Satsumi,” which contains a clearly Japanese last name, but a first name that is decidedly [[Greece|Greek]].

This is in sharp contrast to the Earth-centered Draco society, where the leaders tend to be uniformly [[White people|Caucasian]]. Individuals from Earth also tend to have extremely "[[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]]ish" names. For example, a character named "Brian" is eventually revealed (at least, in the 2002 edition) to have the full name "Brian Anthony Sanders." Moreover, according to the Mouse, Earth still has problems with racism: he recalls seeing Gypsies [[lynched]] when he was younger.

Ironically, although this racial diversity is considered one of the novel's most innovative features, at the time of its first publication (1968), the inclusion of minority characters proved to be a liability due to the racism ingrained in American culture at the time (see ''Publishing Status'' below).

===Man and machine, society and alienation===
The society of ''Nova'' is in a pre-[[revolutionary]] state. Economic tensions have created a feud between the "new money" Von Ray family and the "old money" Red family, both of whom have a large stake in intergalactic transportation. Shortly before the novel's events (within the lifetime of Lorq's father), the Pleiades region achieved political autonomy from Earth/Draco, and is now an independent federation. At the time of the novel, citizens of the Outer Colonies are beginning to support the idea of independence as well.

In a passage in Chapter Three, the elder Von Ray interprets the tensions in terms of social class, with each major galactic region representing one of the three traditional social classes:
* The Draco Empire, centered on Earth, was the earliest area to be colonized. As such, this colonization was largely controlled and subsidized by large governments and corporations from Earth (most notably, Red Shift Ltd.). Because of this, Draco is largely controlled by the upper class, which retains strong cultural and economic ties to Earth.
* The Pleiades Federation was founded, according to Lorq's father, by a "comparatively middle class" movement, primarily individuals and small businesses that wished to cut ties from Earth and maintain their independence. The main reason for this was that, although the region ''as a whole'' was far from Draco, its many habitable planets are located relatively close to each other, resulting in much cheaper transportation costs. The citizens were so dedicated to keeping out Earth influence that they hired Lorq's great-great grandfather (the founder of the Von Ray clan) to kill any representative of Earth-based megacorporations who tried to stake a claim. As a result, the Pleiades remained distant from Draco, and eventually declared independence without much Earth-based interference.
* The Outer Colonies were colonized solely because of the prospects of Illyrion mining, as the worlds within the region are not particularly hospitable to human habitation. Because of this, large companies subsidized the migration of mine workers to the region, often using trickery, dubious legal measures, and false promises. As a result, the Outer Colonies are almost entirely populated by men and women from the working class and [[Underclass|lower classes]], who had few other prospects.

One thing all characters have in common is their cyborging. Individuals who cannot or will not accept these implants are effectively removed from society. The Mouse, for instance, mentions that his people (the Gypsies) refused the implants and, as a result, were treated with intolerance and even killed on Earth.

Prince’s anger over his artificial arm, while irrational on the surface, is eventually hypothesized to have been caused by its effect on his ability to cyborg. Generally, a person has a total of five implants, two of which are located in the wrists. Since Prince was born with only one arm, he cannot fully connect himself with a machine.

Although the society seems on the edge of a revolution (or some other unspecified major change), the future of the novel is optimistic. As Katin reveals in one of his expository monologues, the problem of [[Marx's theory of alienation|labor alienation]] has been overcome through the use of technology: practically all humans have cyborg socket implants that allow them to interface directly with the machines they use. These sockets are highly adaptable. Characters plug them into everything from small vacuum cleaners to the navigational systems of starships. By directly interfacing with the machines, workers are able to identify with their work, and the result is greater psychological wellbeing and less labor alienation.

===Sex and incest===
''Nova'' was written prior to Delany's turn to sexuality as a major focus of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel R. Delany#Themes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the novel suggests several sexual subtexts. In the same way that a homoerotic current informs the relationship [[Herman Melville|Melville]] describes between Captain Ahab and the cabin boy Pip in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', a similar undercurrent vibrates through the scenes between Captain Von Ray and the Mouse.

Throughout the novel, the intelligent and beautiful Ruby remains both loyal and subservient to her brother, Prince, even to the extent of going against her own feelings. Their relationship strongly suggests an [[incestuous]] nature. Prince refuses to allow her to interact with Lorq. In turn, Ruby maintains a close emotional attachment to Prince, one that, in a suggestive scene near the novel’s end, proves disastrous.

===Assassination, pain, and violence===
In ''Nova'', a culturally iconic political [[assassination]] has taken place. The advanced technology at the time allowed millions of people throughout the universe to experience the sensations and emotions of the victim (Secretary Morgan, the leader of the Pleiades Federation) as he died—and, directly afterwards, the emotions of his [[widow]] (and Lorq Von Ray’s aunt), Cyana Von Ray Morgan. The murder was brutal: Morgan was publicly [[garrote]]d at his second [[inauguration]], and almost [[decapitated]]. Although the assassination was eventually revealed to be the work of a single man, ("Underwood"), for a period of time afterwards, many popular [[conspiracy theories]] were developed. To deal with her [[grief]]—and that of Pleiades citizens—Cyana Morgan adopted an extremely [[Stoicism|stoic]] posture and slowly retreated from the public eye.

This death is clearly a dramatic rewriting of the November 1963 "televised" assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]] in Dallas, Texas, which had taken place only five years before ''Nova'' was published. Cyana Von Ray Morgan, the widow, strongly resembles Kennedy's wife [[Jackie Kennedy|Jacqueline Bauvier Kennedy]] in her responses, her appearance, and her interest in art.

Lorq, Prince, and Ruby—all heirs of wealthy clans who grew up in luxury—live what Lorq refers to as "meaningless" lives, indulging in sex, expensive hobbies (e.g. space-yacht racing), and partying. Lorq's transformation begins when, in a physical fight, Prince scars Lorq's face deeply with his artificial hand. Later in the novel, both Lorq and the Mouse attack Prince and Ruby, causing them great pain. As the novel nears completion, Ruby remarks that, prior to that event, neither she nor her brother had a true concept of what pain was really like; neither of them truly fathomed the importance of their actions and the feud until they were personally hit by it.

Practically all the socially powerful characters have violent natures, which often they try to hide or repress. Despite the elder Von Rays' attempts to end the feud, make peace with Aaron Red, and have their children become friends, the Von Rays cannot escape the fact that the family wealth and status were based on piracy and murder. Although outwardly Aaron Red appears harmless (he is described as bald, portly, and easily embarrassed) and he seems to be friends with members of the Von Ray family, events can bring out his natural violence and reveal him as an abusively indulgent father.

The novel hints at these buried emotions, when, for example, the Von Ray and Red families meet in the Outer Colonies at a reconciliatory reception. Seven-year-old Prince uses his artificial arm and its strength to kill Lorq's mother's pet bird in front of Lorq and Ruby. Later that night, the adults leave to watch the future equivalent of a [[cock fight]], but with winged reptiles rather than roosters. The novel's violence gathers force in an unexpected eruption from Prince against Lorq at his party in Paris; much of the novel tries to explain the origins of this rage.

Both rage and pain are eventually recognized by the mature characters to have been a necessary component of their lives. Lorq realizes that, without Prince's attack to 'wake him up,' he would have gone on with a carefree life; he maintains his scar as a reminder of this. The successful completion of Lorq's quest has an extremely painful outcome for Lorq personally. As well, now that the need for Illyrion mines is gone, we know, the Outer Colonies will collapse socially and economically. The Red heirs fought for the status quo; only near the end of the novel do they experience the pain that goes along with the realization of what Lorq is trying to do.

==''Nova'''s influence==
''Nova'' is considered one of the major forerunners of the [[cyberpunk]] movement. It prefigures, for instance, cyberpunk's staple [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of human interfacing with computers via implants.

While the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] of science fiction was concentrating on near-future science fiction stories and the highly subjective exploration of "inner space," in 1968, the year it was published, ''Nova'' seemed a deliberate throw-back to traditional space opera—and space opera at its grandest and most operatic.

While reviews in the American professional science fiction magazines, ''The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction'' and ''Galaxy'', by Judith Merril and [[A. J. Budrys]], respectively, were highly praiseful, the review in the New Wave outlet, England's ''New Worlds'', by [[M. John Harrison]], while acknowledging the skill and energy with which it had been written, called the book a "waste of time and talent."

The novel has always been popular with readers, many of whom have found it, for all its social subtleties, a roller-coaster of a read; but it took a decade-and-a-half for cyberpunk writers and readers to begin praising its handling of drugs, tarot cards, and its off-hand presentation of racial variety, its narrative energy and sense of historical sweep, and finally its exploration of the relationship between politics and art—indeed, for the cyberpunk writers it soon became an iconic text. Characters like the Mouse, Lynceos, Idas, Tyÿ, Sebastian, and even Katin can be seen as [[hippies]], with itinerant lifestyles and [[recreational drug use|drugs]]. As well, the design and effect of the Mouse's sensory syrynx has an overall feel of an expanded 1960s [[Laser lighting display|light show]], of the sort that had then begun to accompany traditional rock concerts.

Writer [[William Gibson]] claimed to be greatly influenced by Delany, and his novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' includes allusions to ''Nova.'' While Delany's vision of the future is optimistic, however, the cyberpunk movement has a distinctly [[dystopic]] outlook. Gibson's novel includes a character, Peter Riviera, introduced (like the Mouse) in [[Istanbul]], with the same holographic projection powers (although via implants) as the Mouse in ''Nova''; but Gibson's character is a [[psychopath]]. Likewise, Gibson includes a character who awkwardly wears only one shoe; this character (Ashpool) is an insane killer.

==Publishing status==
{{Original research inline|date=January 2010}}
[[Image:Nova-Delany.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover of 2002 paperback edition.]]
Despite its status, reputation, and influence on science-fiction as a genre, for a dozen years after 1990 (the date of [[Bantam Books]]' final 14th printing), ''Nova'' was [[Out-of-print book|out of print]]. Hardcover copies were highly prized. Not until 2002 did Vintage Books rerelease it.

Over the years before ''Nova'' appeared, Delany had already won the Nebula Award twice for best science fiction novel of the year: ''[[Babel-17]]'' had gained the award in 1967 (in a tie for best novel of 1966 with [[Daniel Keyes]]'s ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]'', a.k.a. ''Charly''). ''The Einstein Intersection'' won him the award the following year in 1968 (for best novel of 1967).

While awaiting publication by Doubleday, ''Nova'' was submitted to ''[[Analog (magazine)|Analog]]'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] for potential serialization. Campbell rejected the novel, saying in a telephone conversation with Delany's agent that, though he'd enjoyed the book, he did not feel his magazine's readership "would be able to relate to a black main character."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyrsf.com/racism-and-science-fiction-.html "Racism and Science Fiction"], Samuel R. Delany, [[The New York Review of Science Fiction]], August 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
Because there was no magazine serialization, however, in its first six months the novel did not get the initially wide exposure to readers that might have helped gain it a Hugo Award—though it was nominated and soon regularly referred to as "the perfect science fiction novel". In the pages of ''[[Galaxy Magazine]]'' (''Analog'''s rival), the August after it appeared, resident critic [[Algis Budrys]] would write, "Samuel R. Delany, right now, as of this book, ''Nova'', not as of some future book or some accumulated body of work, is the best science-fiction writer in the world, at a time when competition for that status is intense. I don't see how a writer can do more than wring your heart while explaining how it works. No writer can"—heady praise for the work of a young man completed before his twenty-sixth birthday.

The Vintage edition of the novel corrects some minor mistakes in the original version. It also adds an entire passage that does not appear in any of the older published versions.

In the Vintage edition, Delany includes a passage in which Prince Red brags about how he is responsible for the death of Brian, a character who disappears, in earlier editions, after a single chapter. In the Vintage edition, toward the end of the book Prince describes how, using his wealth and power, and with no more provocation than a careless comment Brian once made about Prince's arm, Prince systematically destroyed Brian's life, until Brian became [[homeless]] and died of exposure. Prince claims that he has killed some two dozen others in a similar manner for similar reasons.

This passage significantly alters Prince's [[characterization]]. In earlier editions, the worst that could be said of Prince is that he had been "spoiled" and had a violent temper. The new material  turns him into a remorseless [[murderer]] and adds a [[moral]] component to Lorq's quest absent in the earlier versions. If Prince defeats Lorq, the most powerful man in the galaxy will be a psychopathic killer.

The above passage is in the original typescript of ''Nova'', however. It is also in Delany's handwritten version of the novel in his notebooks from 1967. Both are in the Delany Holdings on store in the Howard Gottlieb Archives at the [[Mugar Memorial Library]] of [[Boston University]]. Initially the writer omitted it before publication of the first edition, when a friend who had read the manuscript found that section too extreme. In later years Delany decided to return it to the novel, because he felt readers needed to know what happened to Brian, after he seems to vanish from the book.

Additionally, in the first edition of ''Nova'' it is unclear whether or not Lorq's parents are still alive by the time the novel ends: When Lorq begins his quest, his mother is already dying of a degenerative disorder, but at the end he makes no mention of them, nor does he try to contact them. However, in another (much briefer) passage added in the Vintage Books edition, related to the above, Lorq has a memory that implies both of his parents and Aaron Red (as did Dan and Brian) died during the past ten years. This is in neither the original typescript nor in the notebook version, and is a true addition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15660">An '''obligate parasite''' or '''holoparasite''' is a [[parasite|parasitic]] [[organism]] that cannot complete its life-cycle without exploiting a suitable [[host (biology)|host]]. If an obligate parasite cannot obtain a host it will fail to [[reproduction|reproduce]]. This is opposed to a [[facultative parasite]], which can act as a parasite but does not rely on its host to continue its life-cycle. Obligate parasites have [[evolution|evolved]] a variety of parasitic strategies to exploit their hosts. Holoparasites and some hemiparasites are obligate.

It is advantageous for the parasite to preserve the health of their host when this is compatible with their nutritional and reproductive requirements, except when the death of the host is necessary for transmission.&lt;ref name="Combes, C. 1997"&gt;Combes, C. (1997) Fitness of Parasites: Pathology and Selection ''International Journal for Parasitology'' '''27''' (1): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species==
Obligate parasitism is exhibited in a range of organisms, with examples in [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[parasitic plant|plants]], and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref name="Balashov 2011"&gt;Balashov, Yu.S. (2011) Parasitism and Ecological Parasitology. ''Entomological Review'' '''91''' (9): 1216-1223.&lt;/ref&gt; They are unable to complete their development without passing through at least one parasitic stage which is necessary to their life-cycle.

Whether one regards [[virus]]es as living organisms or not, they cannot reproduce except by means of resources within living cells, and accordingly, it is convenient and customary to regard them as obligate [[intracellular parasite]]s.

Among the [[Vespidae]] family, ''[[Vespula austriaca]]'' is an example of an obligate parasite; its common host is ''[[Vespula acadica]]''.&lt;ref name= "venom"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25084514|title = Venoms of a Parasitic and Two Nonparasitic Species of Yellowjackets (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|last = Schmidt|first = J.O|date = 1984|journal = Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society|volume = 57|issue = 2|pages = 316–322|doi = |pmid = |last2 = Reed|first2 = H.C|last3 = Akre|first3 = R.D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the genus ''[[Bumblebee|Bombus]]'', ''[[Bombus bohemicus|B. bohemicus]]'' is an obligate parasite of  ''B. locurum'', ''B. cryptarum'', and ''B. terrestris.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Host-parasite interaction==

===Life-cycle===
[[Parasitic life cycle]]s involve the exploitation of at least one host. Parasites that infect a single species are said to have '''direct''' life-cycles.&lt;ref name="May, R.M. 1979"&gt;May, R.M. &amp; Anderson, R.M (1979) Population biology of infectious diseases. ''Nature'' '''280''': 455-461.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[hookworm]] species ''[[Necator americanus]]''. Parasites that infect more than one host are said to have a '''complex''' or '''indirect''' life-cycle.&lt;ref name="May, R.M. 1979"/&gt; For example, the [[Malaria]] plasmodium.

====Intermediate or final Host====
An '''[[Intermediate host|intermediate]]''' or '''secondary''' host is exploited by the parasite only for a short transition period. A '''final''' or '''primary''' host is exploited by the parasite and is the only location in which the parasite is able to reach maturity and if possible, reproduce sexually.
For example, ''[[Ribeiroia ondatrae]]'' uses [[Ramshorn snail]] as its first intermediate host, amphibians and fish as second intermediate hosts and birds as definitive hosts.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, B. A. &amp; Johnson, PTJ. (2011) Disease and extended phenotype: Parasites control host performance and survival through induced changes in body plan. ''PLoS ONE'' '''6'''(5):1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parasitic permanence===
Obligate parasites may not necessarily spend all of their time behaving as parasites. When a parasite is '''permanent''', a number of generations occur in or on the host of an infested individual. [[head louse|Head lice]] are an example of this. '''Temporary''' parasites are organisms whose parasitic mode of life is limited to a few or even one stage of development.&lt;ref name="Balashov 2011"/&gt; An example of this is the larval stage of [[harvest mite]]s, while the adult stage is non-parasitic.

===Location on host===
The parasite may live outside of the host '''[[Parasitism#types|ectoparasite]]'''; for example, a [[tick]]. Alternatively, the parasite may live within the host  '''[[Parasitism#types|endoparasite]]'''; for example, the [[Trematoda|fluke]]. 
An obligate parasite that does not live directly in or on the host, but rather acts at a distance {{ndash}} for example, a [[cuckoo]] which hatches and is raised by non-relatives {{ndash}} is known as a [[brood parasite]].

===Invasion strategies===
In order to establish infestation in a susceptible host, obligate parasites must evade defences before, during and after entry into the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 2069674| year = 1991| author1 = Hall| first1 = B. F.| title = Strategies of obligate intracellular parasites for evading host defences| journal = Immunology Today| volume = 12| issue = 3| pages = A22–7| last2 = Joiner| first2 = K. A.| doi = 10.1016/S0167-5699(05)80007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the wide range of obligate parasite types, it is impossible to identify a general invasion strategy.   [[Intracellular parasite]]s use various strategies to invade cells and subvert cellular signalling pathways. Most bacteria and viruses undergo passive uptake, where they rely on the host cell for uptake. However, [[apicomplexa]]ns engage in active entry.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, L. D. (2004) Parasite invasion strategies. ''Science'' '''304'''(5668): 284-253.&lt;/ref&gt; One obligate wasp parasite,'' [[Polistes atrimandibularis]]'', infiltrates their hosts' colony by modifying their chemical signature to match that of the hosts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anzf43/anzf43-531.pdf|title = Polistes Wasps and Their Social Parasites: An Overview|last = Cervo|first = Rita|date = December 2006|journal = Ann. Zool. Fennici|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This tricks the host wasps into thinking the parasite is one of their own.

====Evasion of host defences====
A number of [[intracellular parasite#obligate|obligate intracellular parasites]] have evolved mechanisms for evading their hosts cellular defences, including the ability to survive in distinct [[cellular compartment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hackstadt, T. (1998) The diverse habitats of obligate intracellular parasites. ''Current Opinion in Microbiology'' '''1''': 82-87.&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the mechanisms that hosts employ in their attempt to reduce the replication and spread of pathogens is [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death). Some obligate parasites have developed ways to suppress this phenomenon, for example ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'' although the mechanism is not yet fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;Laliberté, J. &amp; Carruthers, V.B. (2008) Host cell manipulation by the human pathogen ''toxoplasma gondii''. ''Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences'' '''65''': 1900-1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manipulation of host behaviour==
Changes in a host’s behaviour following infection with obligate parasites are extremely common.&lt;ref&gt;Poulin, R. (1995) “Adaptive” changes in the behaviour of parasitized animals: A critical review. ''International Journal for Parasitology'' ''' 5''' (12): 1371-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual behaviour observed in infected individuals is noted, and if its complexity suggests that this behaviour will benefit the transmission of the parasite, then this is said to be an example of [[adaptive behaviour|adaptive]] manipulation.&lt;ref name="Hughes, D. 2013"&gt;Hughes, D. (2013) Pathways to understanding the extended phenotype of parasites in their hosts. ''The Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''216''': 142-147.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a difficulty in demonstrating changes in behaviour are the result of a selective process favouring transmission of the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;Combes, C. (1991) Ethological aspects of parasite transmission. ''The American Naturalist'' '''138''' (4): 866-880.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that these changes may merely be a side-effect of infection.&lt;ref&gt;McNair D. M. &amp; Timmons E. H. 1977. Effects of ''Aspiculuris tetraptera'' and ''Syphacia obvelata'' on exploratory behaviour of an inbred mouse strain. ''Laboratory Animal Science'' '''27''':38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most behaviour changes have not been demonstrated to lead to [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] gains in either the host or the parasite.&lt;ref&gt;Pullin, R. (1995) “Adaptive” changes in the behaviour of parasitized animals: A critical review. ''International Journal for Parasitology'' '''25''' (12): 1371-1383.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this behaviour is the attraction of rats to cat urine after infection with ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berdoy, M.F., Webster, J. P &amp; MacDonald, D. W.  (2000) Fatal Attraction in rats infected with ''Toxoplasma gondii''. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'' '''267''':1591-1594.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extended phenotype===

In some cases the behaviour we observe in an organism is not due to the expression of their genes, but rather to the genes of parasites infecting them. This behaviour is an [[The Extended Phenotype|extended phenotype]].&lt;ref name="Hughes, D. 2013"/&gt;

===Evolution of host behaviour manipulation===

Three main evolutionary routes have been suggested for the appearance of host behaviour manipulation by parasites. The first is a ''parasite driven'' scenario Of manipulation, while the second and third are ''host driven'' scenarios of manipulation.
#Manipulation ''sensu stricto'' (extended phenotype- abhorrent behaviour displayed by parasitised hosts results from the expression of the parasites genes) this capacity could have been the product of natural selection in an ancestral parasite with the trait.&lt;ref name="Adamo, S. A. 2012 pp.36-51"&gt;Adamo, S. A. (2012) The strings of the puppet master: How parasites change host behaviour in Hughes, D.P., Brodeur, J. &amp; Thomas, F. (Eds.), ''Host Manipulation by Parasites'' (pp.36-51).Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[mafia]]-like strategy- retaliation for non-compliance (eg.[[great spotted cuckoo]] and [[magpie]]) magpies that eject the cuckoos eggs from their nest suffer a much greater rate of cuckoo predation.&lt;ref name="Adamo, S. A. 2012 pp.36-51"/&gt;
#The exploitation of compensatory responses induce host compensatory responses since these may at least partially match with the transmission routes of parasites. E.g. the sexually transmitted ectoparasite ''Chrysomelobia labidomerae'', parasitizing the leaf beetle host ''[[Labidomera clivicollis]]''~ infected males exhibit increased sexual behaviour and as a result enhance inter- and intra- sexual contacts (copulation and competition) which provide more opportunities for parasite transmission.&lt;ref name="Abbot, P. 2001"&gt;Abbot, P. &amp; Dll, L. M. (2001). Sexually transmitted parasites and sexual selection in the milkweed leaf beetle, ''Labidomera clivicollis''. ''Oikos'' '''92''': 91-100&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been suggested that  [[The Extended Phenotype|extended phenotype]] behaviours are not adaptive, but are [[exaptation|Exaptative]].&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. &amp; Vrba, E.S. (1982) Exaptation: a missing term in the science form. ''Paleobiology.'' '''8''':4-15.&lt;/ref&gt; While they may have a benefit for the parasitic organism, they did not arise with the intention of this benefit.&lt;ref name="Abbot, P. 2001"/&gt;

==Parasitic mimicry in brood parasites==
The [[cowbird]] and [[cuckoo]] require the nests and parental care of other [[passerines]] in order for their young to [[fledge]]. These are known as [[brood parasite]]s. The parasitic bird species mimics egg patterns and colours of the host species, which reduces egg rejection.&lt;ref&gt;May, R. M., &amp; Robinson, S.K. (1984) Population dynamics of avian brood parasitism. ''The American Naturalist'' '''126'''(4):475-494.&lt;/ref&gt; The chicks of some species are able to manipulate host behaviour by making rapid calls that mimic the sound made by up to four of the host chicks.&lt;ref&gt;Kilner, R. M., &amp; Davies, N. B. (1999). How selfish is a cuckoo chick? ''Animal Behaviour'' '''58''':797-808.&lt;/ref&gt; Mimicry of the host species also occurs in the paper wasp species ''[[Polistes semenowi]]'' and ''[[Polistes sulcifer]]'' and the bumblebee species ''[[Bombus bohemicus]]'', with the parasite changing its proportions of cuticular hydrocarbons, species- and colony-specific identifying chemicals, to match that of the usurped host species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kreuter, Kirsten; Elfi Bunk (November 23, 2011). "How the social parasitic bumblebee Bombus bohemicus sneaks into power of reproduction". ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'' '''66''' (3): 475–486. doi:10.1007/s00265-011-1294-z. Retrieved 21 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sledge, M.F., Dani, F.R., Cervo, R., Dapporto, L., Turillazzi, S. (2001). “Recognition of social parasites as nestmates: adoption of colony-specific host cuticular odours by the paper wasp parasite Polistes sulcifer”. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 268: 2253–2260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cervo, R. (2006). ''Polistes'' wasps and their social parasites: an overview. ''Ann. Zool. Fennici'', 43, 531-549.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several butterfly species will also exhibit brood parasitic behavior. An example is ''Niphanda fusca,'' a butterfly that will released cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to trick the host ant, ''C. japonicus,'' into adopting the larva as their own in their own nest. The ant will then raise the larva of the butterfly, feeding it directly from mouth-to-mouth, until it pupates.&lt;ref&gt;Masaru K Hojo, Ayako Wada-Katsumata, Toshiharu Akino, Susumu Yamaguchi, Mamiko Ozaki, Ryohei Yamaoka (2009). Chemical disguise as particular caste of host ants in the ant inquiline parasite Niphanda fusca (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). Proceedings of the Royal Society B 2009 276 551-558; DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2008.1064.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is proposed that this mimicry has evolved through two processes: either as coevolutionary responses to host defences against brood parasites or modifying pre-existing host provisioning strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Langmore, N. E. &amp; Spottiswoode, C. N. (2012) Visual Trickery in avian brood parasites in Hughes, D.P., Brodeur, J. &amp; Thomas, F. (Eds.), ''Host Manipulation by Parasites'' (pp.36-51).Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between the parasite and host young for parental resources might lead to exaggeration of the aspects of the signal that most effectively exploit host parents.&lt;ref&gt;Hauber, M. E. &amp; Kilner, R. M. (2007) Coevolution, communication and host-chick mimicry in parasitic finches: who mimics whom? ''Behavioural Ecology and Sociobiology'' '''61''': 497-503.&lt;/ref&gt; The parasitic young are likely to experience stronger selection for exaggerated signals than host young, because they are unrelated to the other chicks in the nest and therefore under selection to behave more selfishly.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtensten, G. (2001). Low success of shiny cowbird chicks parasitizing rufous-bellied thrushes: chick-chick competition or parental discrimination? ''Animal Behaviour'' '''61''':401-413.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of obligate parasitism==
Current theory in [[evolutionary biology]] indicates that host-parasite relationships may evolve towards equilibrial states of severe disease.&lt;ref&gt;Ewald, P.W. (1983). Host-parasite relations, vectors, and the evolution of disease severity. ''Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics'' '''14''':465-485.&lt;/ref&gt;  This differs from the conventional belief that [[commensalism]] is the ideal equilibrium for both the host and parasite.&lt;ref name="Combes, C. 1997"/&gt;

'''Online consultations''' or e-consultations refer to an exchange between government and citizens using the [[Internet]].  They are one form of [[online deliberation]]. Further, online consultation consists in using the Internet to ask a group of people their opinion on one or more specific topics, allowing for trade-offs between participants.  Generally, an agency consults a group of people to get their thoughts on an issue when a project or a [[policy]] is being developed or implemented, e.g. to identify or access options, or to evaluate ongoing activities.  This enables governments to draft more citizen-centered policy.

As the Internet gains popularity with the public for voicing opinion, citizen participation in policy development through cyberspace is changing the face of democracy.  The rise of the Internet has given way to buzzwords such as [[e-democracy]], referring to citizen participation in politics, government issues and policy development through electronic technologies and the Internet, and [[eGovernment]], pertaining to providing citizens with government information and services online.  Online consultation is an extension of these concepts.  Through online engagement, government is enabled to hold interactive dialogues with the public as they have a more direct route to citizen opinion via the Internet.

The [[California Report Card]] (CRC) facilitates online consultation, working to support collaboration between citizens and the government though the Internet. [[Gavin Newsom]], Lt. Governor of California, and the [[Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] jointly launched the CRC in January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Ken|last2=Newsom|first2=Gavin|title=Let's amplify California's collective intelligence|url=http://citris-uc.org/lets-amplify-californias-collective-intelligence-op-ed-ken-goldberg-gavin-newsom-california-report-card/|website=citris-uc.org|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRC allows for Californians to vote online on six timely issues. The site then redirects users to an electronic "cafe" using [[Principal Component Analysis]]. In the "cafe", participants can textually submit their own suggestions and assess the ideas of other users. The CRC offers a means of connecting the public to the California government. 

While this definition is framed in the [[Canada|Canadian]] context, other countries like the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Denmark]], [[Scotland]], and [[Australia]] can also be considered leaders in the field.  These and many other countries are integrating online consultations and engagement using various methods and for a range of purposes. The [[European Union]] also utilises online consultations. These complement face-to-face consultations and help to create greater transparency of the democratic process. Online consultations are also increasingly being used by the [[United Nations]] and its Specialized Agencies. [[FAO|The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN]] hosts online consultations to allow for more inclusive drafting processes of policy guidelines, reports and strategy papers. The Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition (FSN Forum) is tasked with carrying out many of these consultations.

==Channels==
Online consultations and engagement activities can utilize: 
*[[Website]]s, [[discussion board]]s, and [[electronic mailing list]]s, which have the ability to aid in policy development by providing the public with pertinent information and engaging them in order to extract feedback on issues. 
*[[Weblog]]s and real time [[online chat]] that can often put the public in direct contact with government officials, such as their MP, deputy or other political figure with whom they can share opinion and concerns

In '''packed pixel''' or '''chunky''' [[framebuffer]] organization, the bits defining each [[pixel]] are grouped together. For example, if there are 16 bits per pixel, each pixel is represented in two consecutive (contiguous) 8-bit bytes in the framebuffer (a.k.a. [[screen buffer]]).  If there are 4 bits per pixel (16 colors), each frame buffer byte defines two pixels, one in each [[nibble]].  The latter example is as opposed to storing perhaps half of the bits—2 bits—for each of four pixels in one byte and the other two bits for each of those four pixels in another byte or bytes.  It is also as opposed to interleaving the bits of the two pixels within the byte.  As this illustrates, packed pixel organization can be directly contrasted with [[Planar (computer graphics)|planar]] organization.

==Heartland Institute incident==

On February 20, 2012, Gleick announced he was responsible for the unauthorized distribution of [[The Heartland Institute#February 2012 document misappropriation|documents]] from [[The Heartland Institute]] in mid-February.

Gleick described his actions as "a serious lapse of my own and professional judgment and ethics" and said that he "deeply regret[ted his] own actions in this case" and "offer[ed his] personal apologies to all those affected". He stated that "My judgment was blinded by my frustration with the ongoing efforts – often anonymous, well-funded, and coordinated – to attack climate science and scientists and prevent this debate, and by the lack of transparency of the organizations involved."&lt;ref name=gleick120220/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/science/earth/activist-says-heartland-climate-papers-obtained-by-deceit.html "Activist Says He Lied to Obtain Climate Papers"], ''New York Times'', published February 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24 he wrote to the board of the Pacific Institute requesting a "temporary short-term leave of absence" from the Institute.&lt;ref name='PIleave'&gt;{{cite news | last = Goldenberg | first = Suzanne | title = Peter Gleick on leave from Pacific Institute over Heartland leak | date = 2012-02-25 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/25/peter-gleick-leave-pacific-institute-heartland-leak | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2012-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_20040326 "Peter Gleick requests short-term leave of absence from Oakland's Pacific Institute"], ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', Feb 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Directors stated it was "deeply concerned regarding recent events" involving Gleick and the Heartland documents, and appointed a new Acting Executive Director on February 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/statement.html Pacific Institute Board of Directors statement], Feb 27, 2012.

'''Prevention through design''' (PtD), also called '''safety by design''' usually in Europe, is the concept of applying methods to minimize [[occupational safety and health|occupational hazards]] early in the design process, with an emphasis on optimizing employee health and safety throughout the [[Product lifecycle|life cycle]] of materials and processes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-147/|title=General Safe Practices for Working with Engineered Nanomaterials in Research Laboratories|last=|first=|date=May 2012|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a concept and movement that encourages [[Construction management|construction]] or [[product design]]ers to "design out" health and safety risks during design development. The concept supports the view that along with quality, programme and cost; safety is determined during the design stage.&lt;ref&gt;Behm M, 2005, Linking Construction Fatalities to the Design for Construction Safety Concept, Safety Science, Number 43, Pages 589-611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churcher D W, Alwani-Starr G M,Incorporating construction health and safety into the design process”, Implementation of Health and Safety in Construction Sites, Alvels, Dias &amp; Coble (eds), {{ISBN|90-5410-847-9}}, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ECI 2000 Designing for Safety and Health, Proceedings of the ECI/CIB/HSE international Conference, London, European Construction Institute, Loughborough, ed A G F Gibb, June 245pp ECI, Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA,  Hinze J and Haas C, Tool to Design for Construction Worker Safety, Journal of Architectural Engineering, Volume 3, Part 1, Pages 32-42, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA, 2003, Safety in design: A Proactive Approach to Construction Worker Safety and Health, Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene, Vol 18 (5): pp 339-342&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gambatese JA, Hinze J, Addressing Construction Worker Safety in the Design Phase&amp;nbsp;– Designing for worker Safety, Automation in Construction, Volume 8, Issue 6, Pages 643-649, August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hecker S, Gambatese J, Weinstein M, Designing for Worker Safety- Moving the Construction Safety Process Upstream, Professional Safety, Pages 32-44, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;   It increases the cost-effectiveness of enhancements to occupational safety and health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This method for reducing workplace safety risks lessens workers' reliance on [[personal protective equipment]], which is the least effective of the [[hierarchy of hazard control]].&lt;ref name="niosh"&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

== Background ==
Each year in the U.S., 55,000 people die from work-related injuries and diseases, 294,000 are made sick, and 3.8 million are injured. The annual direct and indirect costs have been estimated to range from $128 billion to $155 billion. Recent studies in [[Australia]] indicate that design is a significant contributor in 37% of work-related fatalities; therefore, the successful implementation of prevention through design concepts can have substantial impacts on worker health and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Heidel, Donna S., Paul Schulte. [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/blog/nsb060208_ptd.html Making the Business Case for Prevention through Design]. NIOSH Science Blog, 6/2/08. Accessed 9/23/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) in the United States is a major contributor and promoter of PtD policy and guidelines. NIOSH considers PtD to be "the most effective and reliable type" of prevention of [[Occupational injury|occupational injuries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2015-198/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Supporting Prevention through Design (PtD) Using Business Value Concepts (2015-198)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A core tenet of PtD philosophy the concept of addressing workplace hazards using methods at the top of the [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|Hierarch of Controls]], namely elimination and substitution.

Within Europe, construction designers are legally bound to design out risks during design development to reduce [[Construction site safety#Hazards to construction workers|hazards]] in the construction and end use phases via the Mobile Worksite Directive (also known as CDM regulations in the UK). The concept supports this legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/cdm/2015/index.htm|title=Construction Design and Management Regulations 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=www.hse.gov.uk|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[Notified Body|Notified Bodies]] provide testing and design verification services to ensure [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] with the safety standards defined in [[regulation codes]] such as the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tuv.com/en/corporate/business_customers/plants_machinery_1/pressure_equipment_2/asme_1/asme.html|title=Pressure Vessel Inspection According to ASME|last=|first=|date=|website=TÜV Rheinland|language=de|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[non-governmental organization]]s have been established to support this aim, principally in the UK, Australia and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saferdesign.org/Pages/default.aspx|title=Expired Registration Recovery Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saferdesign.org|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415184534/http://www.saferdesign.org/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2013-04-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/swa/HealthSafety/SafeDesign/|title=Safe Work Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe Work Australia|language=en-AU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091214053507/http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/swa/HealthSafety/SafeDesign/|archive-date=2009-12-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure.sph.harvard.edu/ccpe/programs.cfm?CSID=SDC0210&amp;pg=cluster&amp;CLID=1|title=Executive and Continuing Professional Education|last=|first=|date=|website=Harvard University School of Public Health|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816172545/https://secure.sph.harvard.edu/ccpe/programs.cfm?CSID%3DSDC0210%26pg%3Dcluster%26CLID%3D1|archive-date=2010-08-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While engineering as a rule factors human safety into the design process, a modern appraisal of specific links to design and workers' safety can be seen in efforts beginning in the 1800s.  Trends included the widespread implementation of guards for machinery, controls for [[elevator]]s, and [[boiler]] safety practices. This was followed by enhanced design for [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], enclosures, system monitors, [[Lockout-Tagout|lockout/tagout]] controls, and hearing protectors. More recently, there has been the development of chemical [[process safety]], [[ergonomics|ergonomically]] engineered tools, chairs, and work stations, lifting devices, retractable needles, latex-free gloves, and a parade of other safety devices and processes.&lt;ref name=schulte&gt;Schulte, Paul A., Richard Rinehart, Andrea Okun, Charles L. Geraci, Donna S. Heidel. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V6F-4S3G8HX-2/2/b4749f31e38e327949d99b974a9705f8 ''National Prevention through Design (PtD) Initiative''], ''Journal of Safety Research'', Volume 39, Issue 2. Prevention through Design, 2008, Pages 115-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety]] began its National Initiative on Prevention through Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-123/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - The State of the National Initiative on Prevention through Design (2014-123)|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of promoting prevention through design philosophy, practice, and policy.

==Integration==
Prevention through design represents a shift in approach for on-the-job safety. It involves evaluating potential risks associated with processes, structures, equipment, and tools. It takes into consideration the construction, maintenance, decommissioning, and disposal or recycling of waste material.&lt;ref name=schulte /&gt;
 
The idea of redesigning job tasks and work environments has begun to gain momentum in business and government as a cost-effective means to enhance occupational safety and health. Many U.S. companies openly support PtD concepts and have developed management practices to implement them. Other countries are actively promoting PtD concepts as well. The [[United Kingdom]] began requiring construction companies, project owners, and architects to address safety and health during the design phase of projects in 1994. Australia developed the Australian National OHS Strategy 2002–2012, which set "eliminating hazards at the design stage" as one of five national priorities. As a result, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (ASCC) developed the Safe Design National Strategy and Action Plans for Australia encompassing a wide range of design areas.&lt;ref name=niosh /&gt;

== In the US ==

=== Government ===
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] is a large contributor to prevention through design efforts in the United States. Several NIOSH initiatives and guidelines directly or indirectly advocate for PtD practices. Through NIOSH efforts, the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] posted new PtD credits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ptd/greenjobs.html|title=CDC - Prevention Through Design: Green , Safe, and Healthy Jobs - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; available for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification]] for construction. Additionally, they provide a wide variety of educational and guidance materials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ptd/pubs.html|title=CDC - Prevention through Design - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the topic of PtD The NIOSH "[[Buy Quiet]]" initiative uses elements of prevention through design to encourage companies to buy quieter machinery, thereby reducing occupational hearing loss for their workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=CDC - Buy Quiet - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|author=|date=|website=www.CDC.gov|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arabic]] word ''qada'' (قُضِي) means literally "carrying out or fulfilling". In [[Islamic]] [[jurisprudence]] it refers to fulfilling or completing those duties that one may have missed due to some reason or other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.as-sidq.org/glossary.html | title=Islamic Glossary | work=As-Sidq Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also mean ''qadee'', a [[court]] judgement or the art of adjudication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.islaminme.com/articles/it_03.htm | title=Islamic terms | work=Islam in me}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''qadee'' is binding and enforceable, unlike a [[fatwa]], which is merely a legal opinion. Issued by a [[Qadi|Qaadee]] ([[judge]]) in response to a specific case and circumstances. The ''qaadee'' may request a ''fatwa'' to help determine the legal outcome of a specific case but is not bound to follow it. The decision is based on recognized legal precedent.

The project was launched in February 2012 as part of [[Jill Tarter]]'s 2009 [[TED (conference)|TED]] Prize Wish.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/seti-institute/seti-live_b_1310878.html |title=SETI Institute Teams Up With Zooniverse to Empower Citizen Scientists in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; SETILive uses data provided by the [[Allen Telescope Array]] and presents it visually so that the public can collectively search for radio signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About SETILive|url=http://setilive.org/about|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project focuses on radio frequencies that automated detection systems ignore due to the prevalence of man-made noise. Jill Tarter hopes that human analysts will be able to detect low [[signal-to-noise]] transmissions which confuse computers.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; The telescope scans the zone between a known star and a known planet where liquid water is possible. This is called the [[habitable zone]]. The website displays one to three different scans of an area of space. Its energy is measured and put into a [[waterfall chart|waterfall display]]. Users must identify the areas of high energy—signals—by making two points through which a line is drawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signals|url=http://setilive.org/gallery|publisher=SETILive|accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users classify signals as: broken, continuous, or parallel. Users then must classify the signal as: erratic, wide, or narrow. Many of the signals are just satellites that give off energy.

== Decoys ==
The makers of SETILive intentionally put some false positives in. Sometimes, When a user clicks "done", a red line will identify the simulated ETI signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simulations!

      <comment>There was absolutely a rigidly enforced division. Women in ancient Greece rarely held public or political roles. One exception may be Aspasia of Miletus, who was a courtesan.

Terms such as '''separate spheres''' and '''domestic–public dichotomy''' refer to a [[social phenomenon]], within [[modern society|modern societies]] that feature, to some degree, an [[empirical]] separation between a [[private sphere|domestic or private sphere]] and a [[Public sphere|public or social sphere]]. This observation may be  controversial, and is often also seen as supporting [[Patriarchy|patriarchal ideologies]] that seek to ''create or strengthen'', any such separation between spheres, and to confine women to the domestic/private sphere.

The patriarchal ideology of separate spheres, based primarily on notions of [[Biological determinism of human gender roles|biologically determined gender roles]]  and/or patriarchal religious doctrine, claims that women should avoid the public sphere &amp;ndash; the domain of politics, paid work, commerce and law. Women's "proper sphere", according to the ideology, is the realm of domestic life, focused on childcare, housekeeping, and religion.&lt;ref name="kuersten"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Ryle |first1= Robyn |title= Questioning gender: a sociological exploration |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CHHz_p-j9hMC&amp;pg=PA342 |edition= |year= 2012 |publisher= SAGE/Pine Forge Press |location= Thousand Oaks, Calif. |isbn= 978-1-4129-6594-1 |pages= 342&amp;ndash;43|chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As observable phenomena, however, the existence of separate spheres is much older.

==History==
The idea that women should inhabit a separate domestic sphere has been extant in [[Western thought]] for centuries, extending as far back as the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vickery |first1= Amanda | authorlink1 = Amanda Vickery | last2= |first2= |year= 1993 |title= Golden age to separate spheres?

Brendan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates over the "proper" roles of women and men continued throughout antiquity.

The modern ideology of separate spheres emerged in the wake of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of feminist literary theory|last1=Wells|first1=Christopher|publisher=[[Routledge]]|others=|year=2009|isbn=978-0-415-99802-4|editor1-last=Kowaleski-Wallace|editor1-first=Elizabeth|editor1-link=|location=London, New York|page=519|language=|chapter=Separate Spheres|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=blI0_52wIwYC&amp;pg=PA519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the industrialization of the Western world, family members worked side by side and the workplace was located mostly in and around the home. With the shift from home-based to factory production, men left the home to sell their labor for wages while women stayed home to perform unpaid domestic work. The separate spheres ideology reflected and fueled these changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The concise encyclopedia of sociology|last1=Adams|first1=Michele|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|others=|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-8353-6|editor1-last=Ritzer|editor1-first=George|editor1-link=|location=Chichester, West Sussex, U.K.; Malden, MA|pages=156&amp;ndash;57|chapter=Divisions of household labor|editor2-last=Ryan|editor2-first=J. Michael|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dz4wU64f_JYC&amp;pg=PA156}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the Enlightenment and the French Revolution helped spread the ideas of liberty, equality, and political rights, but in practice such rights were denied to women, who were seen as belonging to a different social sphere. Feminist writers like Olympe de Gouges, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Lucy Stone demanded political equality for women as well as men and provided searing criticisms of the "separate sphere" ideals that confined women exclusively to the domestic sphere. Theorists such as [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Karl Marx]] have argued that following the rise of capitalism, the home lost its control of the [[means of production]] and consequently became a private, separate sphere.

[[Betty Friedan]]'s ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' asserted that women were being forced to rely on their husbands and children as the sole sources of their identity by an historically constructed oppressive paradigm, not by any "intrinsic" predisposition. Drawing on Friedan, historian Barbara Welter identified a [[Cult of Domesticity|"Cult of True Womanhood"]], an ideal of [[femininity]] prevalent among the [[Upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]]es in the 19th century. "True women" were supposed to be pious, pure, submissive, and domestic. Domesticity, in particular, was regarded as a laudable virtue as the home was considered a woman's proper sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Welter |first1= Barbara |authorlink1=  |last2=  |first2=  |year= 1966 |title= The Cult of True Womanhood: 1820–1860 |journal= [[American Quarterly]] |volume= 18 |issue= 2 |pages= 151–174 |publisher= [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |doi= 10.2307/2711179 |url= https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |accessdate=  |jstor= 2711179 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111113113000/https://webstorage.worcester.edu/sites/thangen/web/Shared%20Documents/Welter.CultTrueWomanhood.pdf |archivedate= 2011-11-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Tocqueville, Welter and other 20th-century historians were critical of the separate spheres ideology, seeing it as a source of women's denigration.&lt;ref name="kerber1988"/&gt;

In [[Woman, Culture, and Society]] (1974), [[Michelle Rosaldo]] emphasizes the idea that these separate spheres can be explained in terms of a dichotomy, in the sense that these gender-oriented domains are viewed as so totally separate that it only reinforces the ideology of gender separation and inequality. Activities given to men, versus those assigned to women, were seen as having more value and contributing greatly to the society. Adversely, the woman's so-called simpler roles of housework and childrearing were held at a much lesser value. Rosaldo argues a "universal asymmetry" between the sexes that primarily caused these separations to arise. This model mainly focuses on the generational subordination of women in relation to men throughout history and across different cultures, defining the domestic and public spheres in very black and white terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no:00972854|title=Woman, culture, and society|last=Rosaldo|first=Michelle Zimbalist|last2=Lamphere|first2=Louise|last3=Bamberger|first3=Joan|date=1974|isbn=0804708509|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This earlier model, however, has since been challenged by researchers in the field, claiming the spheres cannot be outlined in such simplistic terms. Woman, Culture, and Society&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/gender-in-cross-cultural-perspective/oclc/951536398?referer=di&amp;ht=edition|title=Gender in cross-cultural perspective|last=Brettell|first=Caroline|last2=Sargent|first2=Carolyn F|date=2016|isbn=9780205247288|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-editor Louis Lamphere breaks down Rosaldo's model and discusses the spheres in different terms. Lamphere primarily dispels the concept of "universal asymmetry", looking toward various societies worldwide for proof. Even in some Middle Eastern cultures that place women in extreme positions of subordination, the model could not be so easily applied. This is because the domestic and public spheres are almost always overlapping in some way, regardless of a cultural female subservience or even egalitarianism. Women enter public spaces in order to fulfill certain duties that fall within their domestic responsibilities. Men must return to the private, or domestic, space eventually to bring home the spoils of his labor in the public sphere. In this sense, there are two separate spheres created and enforced by gender ideologies; but they are not dichotomous. They, instead, form an integrated system of life in society, varying only in levels of intensities from culture to culture.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

According to Cary Franklin, the women’s rights movements in the mid-1960s proposed that to achieve true equality between the sexes, it is necessary for the laws to be put in place to move past the simple separate spheres model and address the “interspherical impacts”. In 1966, the National Organization for Women (NOW) pushed for equality of women in society and in the workplace and in order to attain this equality, there would have to be changes in family regulation. NOW stressed the importance of focusing on structurally altering the family sphere in order to then create gender equality in the education and workplace spheres. The family sphere is acting as a catalyst seeing that without a change in it, women would simply lack access to the opportunities that men already have available to them. Franklin also pointed out that the gender inequality among the American population in the 60’s and 70’s was a major contributor to the civil rights statutes of the Second Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bi.galegroup.com/global/article/GALE%7CA376853033/165d132476e2721e8ea83c8ef676695a?u=txshracd2548|title=Redirect Page|website=bi.galegroup.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rotman|first=DeborahL.|date=2006|title=Separate Spheres?: Beyond the Dichotomies of Domesticity|jstor=506286|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=47|issue=4|pages=666–674|doi=10.1086/506286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Rotman, an anthropologist at Notre Dame, analyzed this concept of separate spheres specifically among the people of Deerfield, Massachusetts in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In this community, there was a clear divide between men and women by means of a “proper allocation” in which females were given the domestic residence or sphere and the men were given the “economically productive agricultural land”. Men would migrate away from the women if agriculture was depleting in their given agricultural space. As the men were moving to work outside the home, women began to acclimate to the economic atmosphere and gain more opportunities in the public sphere with all the men working elsewhere. These women soon had various roles in the public and private spheres in Deerfield. As equal rights began to become part of the ideological framework in Deerfield, women found themselves voting in school boards, working on municipal water projects and working in fundraisers as men had done before them. Despite the traditional understanding of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century of completely separate public and private spheres, the Deerfield community challenged these “dichotomies of domesticity” and paved the way for equal rights for men and women.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Influences==

===Biological determinism===
The separation between female and male spheres was heavily influenced by [[biological determinism]],&lt;ref name="roy"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Roy |first1= Anupama |title= Gendered citizenship: historical and conceptual explorations |chapter = | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ko4sVA2JRJUC&amp;pg=PA80|year= 2005 |publisher= [[Orient Longman]] |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-81-250-2797-3| page= 80&amp;ndash;81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Grana |first1= Sheryl J. |title= Women and justice |chapter = 'Nature' and Biology | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=5IKdJLjtbtoC&amp;pg=PA20 |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] |location= Lanham |isbn= 978-0-7425-7002-3| page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the notion that women and men are naturally suitable for different social roles due to their biological and genetic makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= O'Brien |first1= Jodi |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title= Encyclopedia of gender and society |volume= 2 | year= 2009 |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= Los Angeles |isbn= 978-1-4129-0916-7 |pages= 586, 602&amp;ndash;603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of biological determinism was popular during the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and among such thinkers as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] who argued that women were inherently different from men and should devote themselves to [[reproduction]] and domesticity.&lt;ref name="roy"/&gt; Women were considered passive, dependent on men, and, due to their reproductive capacity, ill-suited for life outside the domestic realm.&lt;ref name="kimmel"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Adams |first1= Michele | last2 = Coltrane | first2 = Scott | editor1-first= Michael S. |editor1-last= Kimmel |editor1-link= Michael Kimmel |editor2-first= Jeff | editor2-last= Hearn | editor3-last = Connell | editor3-first = Raewyn |title= Handbook of studies on men and masculinities |chapter = The Cultural Ideal of Separate Spheres| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UvAZD45BMDoC&amp;pg=PA231 |year= 2005 |publisher= SAGE Publications |location= London |isbn= 978-0-7619-2369-5| pages= 231&amp;ndash;32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau described women's primary duties in ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'', stating that "women's entire education should be planned in relation to men. To please men, to be useful to them, to win their love and respect, to raise them as children, to care for them as adults, correct and console them, make their lives sweet and pleasant; these are women's duties in all ages and these are what they should be taught from childhood."&lt;ref name="roy"/&gt;

The popular beliefs about inherent sex differences remained deeply embedded in popular consciousness throughout the [[Progressive Era]].&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;{{cite book |title= Beyond separate spheres: intellectual roots of modern feminism |last= Rosenberg |first= Rosalind |authorlink= Rosalind Rosenberg |coauthors= |year= 1982 |publisher= [[Yale University Press]] |location= New Haven |isbn= 978-0-300-02695-5 |pages= 114, 207, 245&amp;ndash;46 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DpZ0Yzs_Cj8C&amp;pg=PA114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, however, [[dissident]] [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and other [[Social science|social scientists]] began to challenge the biological determination of human behavior, revealing great similarities between men and women and suggesting that many sex differences were socially constructed.&lt;ref name="rosenberg"/&gt; Despite these new insights and social and economic changes such as women's entry into the labor force, the separate spheres ideology did not disappear.&lt;ref name="kimmel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenberg"/&gt;

Women's confinement to the private sphere was reinforced by cultural and legal arrangements, such as the lack of [[women's suffrage]], legal prohibitions against women undertaking professions like medicine and law, and discouragement from obtaining higher education.&lt;ref name="kuersten"&gt;{{cite book | title= Women and the law: leaders, cases, and documents |chapter = Separate Spheres Doctrine |last= Kuersten |first= Ashlyn K. |authorlink=  |coauthors= |year= 2003 |publisher= [[ABC-CLIO]] |location= Santa Barbara, Calif. |isbn= 978-0-87436-878-9 |pages= 16&amp;ndash;17 |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=AnKGWlZG_ncC&amp;pg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong support for the separation of spheres came from [[antisuffragist]]s who relied on the notion of inherent sexual differences to argue that women were unfit for political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Marshall |first1= Susan E. | authorlink1 = | last2= |first2= |year= 1986 |title= In Defense of Separate Spheres: Class and Status Politics in the Antisuffrage Movement |journal= [[Social Forces]] |volume= 65 |issue= 2 |pages= 327&amp;ndash;51|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|doi= 10.1093/sf/65.2.327|url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hewitt |first1= Lyndi | last2 = McCammon | first2 = Holly J. | editor1-first= Hank |editor1-last= Johnston |editor1-link=  |editor2-first= John A. | editor2-last= Noakes |title= Frames of protest: social movements and the framing perspective |chapter = Explaining the suffrage mobilization: balance, neutralization, and range in collective action frames | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iUZe1lLP-FcC&amp;pg=PA39 |year= 2005 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location= Lanham |isbn= 978-0-7425-3806-1| page= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antifeminism|Antifeminist]] men's groups in late 19th and early 20th century United States responded to the societal changes and shift in gender relations by advocating a return to a strict separation of spheres that would keep women from competing with men in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Kimmel |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Kimmel |title= Men's responses to feminism at the turn of the century |journal= [[Gender &amp; Society]] |volume= 1 |issue= 3 |pages= 261&amp;ndash;283 |doi= 10.1177/089124387001003003|year= 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] supported the separate spheres ideology and opposed women's suffrage as well as other attempts to broaden women's influence in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter= Conservative Protestantism and the Separate Spheres | title= Ungodly women: gender and the first wave of American fundamentalism |last= DeBerg |first= Betty A.|year= 1990 |publisher= [[Augsburg Fortress]] |location= Minneapolis |isbn= 978-0-8006-2439-2 |pages= 43&amp;ndash;58 |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=bJkRgooQLV0C&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theological conservatism has been found to have a stable effect on the endorsement of separate spheres ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bartkowski |first1= John P. | last2 = Xu | first2 = Xiaohe | editor1-first= Christopher G. |editor1-last= Ellison |editor1-link=  |editor2-first= Robert A. | editor2-last= Hummer |title= Religion, families, and health: population-based research in the United States |chapter = Religion and Family Values Reconsidered: Gender Traditionalism among Conservative Protestants | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5rvZ4hnClO8C&amp;pg=PA106 |year= 2010 |publisher= [[Rutgers University Press]] |location= New Brunswick, N.J. |isbn= 978-0-8135-4945-3| pages= 106&amp;ndash;125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] propagated a view of womanhood which reinforced gendered division.&lt;ref name="ross"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ross |first1= Cathy | authorlink1 = | last2= |first2= |year= 2006 |title= Separate Spheres or Shared Dominions? |journal= [[Transformation (journal)|Transformation]] |volume= 23 |issue= 4 |pages= 228&amp;ndash;35|publisher= SAGE Publications |doi= 10.1177/026537880602300406 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Gisborne]]'s ''An Enquiry into the Duties of the Female Sex'' (1797) and [[Henry Venn (Clapham Sect)|Henry Venn]]'s ''The Complete Duty of Man'' (1763) were two popular evangelical texts which described proper behavior for men and women, arguing that a woman's primary duty was to care for those in her domestic circle and obey her husband.&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt;

==Effects==
In her paper "Separate Spheres or Shared Dominions", Cathy Ross suggests that the separate spheres ideology had ambiguous effects on women's lives.&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt; She argues that while it "was clear that women were supposed to be subordinate and that home and children were their sphere", the separation of spheres enabled women "to reach out to other women in sisterhood, in solidarity, on the common ground of domesticity".&lt;ref name="ross"/&gt;

The ideology of separate spheres contributed to resistance to [[coeducation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Together: A History of Coeducation in American Public Schools|first1=David|last1=Tyack|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hansot|isbn=978-0-87154-888-7|year=1992|publisher=[[Russell Sage Foundation]]|location=New York|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the emergence of gendered educational institutions such as the [[female seminary]] and [[women's college]] in [[higher education]], and the [[woman's club]] in [[continuing education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Women's club movement|first=Christine|last=Woyshner|page=477|title=Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States|editor-last=Eisenmann|editor-first=Linda|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=978-0-313-29323-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of [[teaching]] as a woman's profession was also closely linked to the ideology of separate spheres, as women came to be regarded as uniquely skilled at [[classroom management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning Together: A History of Coeducation in American Public Schools|first1=David|last1=Tyack|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hansot|isbn=978-0-87154-888-7|year=1992|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation|location=New York|pages=48, 68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In coeducational universities in the late 19th century, the separation of spheres contributed to the emergence of [[home economics]] as a field of advanced study for the woman's sphere,&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; and the [[dean of women]] as frequently the only high-ranking woman administrator in coeducational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=How Deans of Women Became Men | first=Robert Arthur  | last=Schwartz | journal=[[The Review of Higher Education]] | volume=20 | issue=4 | year=1997 | doi=10.1353/rhe.1997.0011 | page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it created a space for women's academic and professional advancement, the separation of spheres also provided an excuse for keeping women out of fields not specifically marked as female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Tolley | first= Kim | title= The Science Education of American Girls | year= 2003 | isbn=978-0-415-93472-5 | publisher= RoutledgeFalmer |location= New York| page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus many talented woman scientists were pushed into professorships in home economics rather than in their principal fields.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Melissa|title=Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States|editor-last=Eisenmann|editor-first=Linda|year=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=978-0-313-29323-8|chapter=Home Economics|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women educators resisted this typecasting even while working within the framework of separation. [[Frances Shimer]], founder of [[Shimer College]], which was a woman's school from 1866 to 1950, insisted that she was "in favor of the co-education of the sexes" and that the education at her school was equal to what was given to young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title='My whole ambition has ever been to do something smart': Frances Wood Shimer, Cinderella Gregory, and the 1853 Founding of Shimer College|first=Doris |last=Malkmus|journal=Journal of Illinois History|volume=6|issue=3|pages=212&amp;ndash;213|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent Commentary ==
A recent study by Jacqueline Henke explores the history of the separate spheres model in America. Henke points out that between 1820 and 1860 (a period sometimes called the dawn of separate spheres) three parenting models were common for two-parent, mother/father families:
&lt;br&gt;
1. Parenting duties are wholly the responsibility of mothers
&lt;br&gt;
2. Parenting duties are separated into fatherly responsibilities and motherly responsibilities
&lt;br&gt;
3. Parenting duties are shared equally among mothers and fathers.
&lt;br&gt;
According to Henke, many parenting books from this era suggested that mothers should take primary responsibility for their children. Yet, some parenting books argued that mothers and fathers should have separate childrearing duties or a completely equal distribution of childrearing responsibilities. Henke argues that, even during the height of domestic ideology and the dawn of separate spheres, parenting advice was not monolithic. Furthermore, the lived realities parents and families during this era were more diverse than the ideals of parenting books.

Stemettes was started in 2013 by British mathematics and computing child prodigy [[Anne-Marie Imafidon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Women in Science: Meet the Stemettes star inspiring more girls into STEM|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/women-science-meet-stemettes-star-inspiring-more-girls-into-stem-1543094|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Jacquelyn Guderley became co-founder of Stemettes alongside Imafidon.{{clarify|reason=makes no sense - if she joined 2 years after it was started then she cannot be co-founder|date=December 2017}}

Stemettes has partnered with organisations including [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Salesforce]], [[Accenture]], [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]], [[BP]] and [[Microsoft]]. The organisation is regularly called upon by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] and [[European Commission]] to consult on matters related to women in STEM.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Outbox Incubator==
For six weeks from July–August 2015, Stemettes ran Outbox Incubator in London. This residential business incubator for girls with STEM start-ups became known as the “X-men house for girls”&lt;ref&gt;Ravanona, Anna.

In February 2016, the Outbox Incubator spin-off app, OtotheB, was officially launched. The app is an online platform for girls interested in STEM and entrepreneurship. The app has been well received by some STEM figures such as academic and campaigner [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], who described the app as a “…fantastic new resource for young women interested in technology”.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, John.

{{styles}}

A '''style guide''' (or '''manual of style''') is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field.  (It is often called a '''style sheet''', though that term has other meanings.)

A style guide establishes and enforces [[wikt:style#Noun|style]] to improve [[communication]]. To do that, it ensures [[wikt:consistency#Noun|consistency]] within a document and across multiple documents and enforces [[best practice]] in [[usage]] and in [[Composition (language)|language composition]], [[Composition (visual arts)|visual composition]], [[orthography]] and [[typography]]. For [[Academic publishing|academic]] and [[Technical communication|technical]] documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in [[ethics]] (such as [[authorship]], [[research ethics]], and [[:wikt:disclosure|disclosure]]), [[pedagogy]] (such as [[expository writing|exposition]] and clarity), and compliance ([[Technical standard|technical]] and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]]).

Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[Academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and specific industries. '''House style''' refers to the internal style manual of a particular publisher or organization.

==Varieties==
Style guides vary widely in scope and size.

===Sizes===
This variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, in a way analogous to how styles cascade [[style sheet (web development)|in web development]] and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|in desktop publishing]] (e.g., how inline styles in [[HTML]] cascade over [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles).

A short style guide is often called a ''style sheet''. A comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a ''style manual'' or ''manual of style'' (''MOS'' or ''MoS'').  In many cases, a project such as one [[book]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[monograph]] series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a [[publishing]] company, whose content is usually called ''house style''. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an ''industry-wide or profession-wide style manual'' that is even more comprehensive. Some examples of these industry style guides include the following: 
* [[AP Stylebook|AP style]] for journalism and most forms of corporate communications
* [[United States Government Printing Office#GPO's Style Manual|USGPO style]] or [[Australian Government Publishing Service|AGPS style]] for government publications 
* [[Hart's Rules|Oxford style]] and [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago style]] for academic publishing and readership 
* [[APA style]] and [[ASA style]] for the social sciences 
* [[CSE style]] for various physical sciences 
* [[ACS style]] for chemistry 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] for medicine 
* [[Bluebook]] style for law

Finally, these reference works cascade over the [[orthography|orthographic]] norms of the language in use (for example, [[English orthography]] for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety such as [[comparison of American and British English|the different varieties of American English and British English]].

=== Topics ===
Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as [[graphic design]], including [[typography]]. Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects along with text.

Style guides that cover [[usage]] may suggest ways of describing people that avoid [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]]. Guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover [[nomenclature]], which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear, standardized, and [[ontology|ontologically]] sound (e.g., [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[chemical nomenclature]], and [[gene nomenclature]]).

==Updating==
Most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and [[usage]]. The frequency of updating and the [[revision control]] are determined by the subject matter. For style manuals in [[reference work]] format, new [[edition (book)|editions]] typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the [[AP Stylebook]] is revised annually, and the Chicago, APA, and ASA manuals are in their 17th, 6th, and 4th editions, respectively. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.

==Examples==
{{further|List of style guides}}

===International===
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. One example is [[ISO 215]] ''Documentation &amp;mdash; Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4086 |title=ISO 215:1986 - Documentation - Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[European Union]] publishes an ''Interinstitutional style guide''—encompassing [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|24 languages]] across the European Union. This manual is "obligatory" for all those employed by the institutions of the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-360400.htm|title= Interinstitutional Style Guide|author= Publications Office of the European Union|date= 24 July 2008|work= Europa|publisher= European Union12 May 2010|ref= Eur08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] of the [[European Commission]] publishes its own ''English Style Guide'', intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, but aiming to serve a wider readership as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/english-resources-english-style-guide_en|title= English Style Guide|author= Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|publisher= European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, most public-facing corporate communication and journalism writing is written with styles following ''[[The Associated Press Stylebook]]''.&lt;ref&gt;June Casagrande, ''Grammar Snobs Are Great Big Meanies: A Guide to Language for Fun and Spite'' (New York: Penguin, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Book publishers and authors of journals requiring reference sections generally choose the [[Chicago Manual of Style]], while scholarly writing often follows the ''[[The MLA Style Manual|MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/style "What Is MLA Style?"], ''[[Modern Language Association|mla.org]]'', [[Modern Language Association]], 2011, Web, 31 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;   One of the most popular grammar guides used in third-person writing is ''[[The Elements of Style]]''. The Associated Press Stylebook is written to be used together with The Elements of Style to provide a very complete grammar and English style reference with no conflicts.

Despite the near uniform use of the Bluebook, nearly every state has appellate court rules that specify citation methods and writing styles specific to that state  - and the Supreme Court of the United States has its own citation method.  However, in most cases these are derived from the Bluebook.

There are also several other citation manuals available to legal writers in wide usage in the United States.  Virtually all large law firms maintain their own citation manual and several major publishers of legal texts (West, Lexis-Nexis, Hein, ''et al.'') maintain their own systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">'''Temporary laws''', '''temporary legislation''' or '''sunset legislation''' are [[laws]] whose duration is limited at the time of enactment. Temporary laws are often used to adapt for unusual or peculiar situations. Clauses limiting the duration of such laws are often called "sunset" clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/t/temporary-statue/|title=Temporary Statue Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary laws are commonly given temporal validity by the inclusion of an expiration date at which the law ceases to be in effect unless it is extended. But a law can also acquire temporal status by stipulating that it only applies to a certain event. For example, only to the next election or only for victims of a named catastrophe.

Temporary laws are favored by adherents of "[[Experimentalist governance]]" because it allows policy makers to conduct experiments and evaluate the effects of introducing legislation.

Temporary laws are often easier to pass since they last for a shorter time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2159549|title=Law and the Limits of Government: Temporary versus Permanent Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary law should not be confused with ''ratione temporis'' or ''temporal jurisdiction'' which refers to the jurisdiction of a ''court'' of law in relation to the passage of time. 

== Examples ==
Some examples of temporary laws:
* [[May Laws]], enacted in [[Russia]] in 1882. Originally intended to expire after one year but were extended indefinitely.
* [[Tehcir Law]], enacted by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1915 authorized the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the empire's [[Armenians|Armenian]] population. 
* [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] passed in 1994 contained several provisions that were temporary in nature.
* [[Patriot Act]], enacted in the [[United States]] in 2001.
* [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]], enacted in [[Israel]] in 2003.

'''Vortextuality''' is a concept developed in the work of Garry Whannel, an academic thinker working in the area of the cultural analysis of media sport. Whannel uses this concept in his work to analyse and account for the ways in which some news stories acquire a rapid momentum, briefly dominating the mediascape and the [[blogosphere]].

In his book, ''Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Whannel, G|year=2002|title=Media Sport Stars, Masculinities and Moralities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xh4THME06t0C&amp;pg=PT213|isbn=0-415-17038-9|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; he explained this term, noting:"The growth in the range of media outlets, and the vastly increased speed of circulation of information have combined to create the phenomenon of a "vortex" effect".

The vortextual effect produces a compression of the media agenda, in which other news items disappear from the agenda or have to be connected in some way to the dominant event. Developing this idea, Whannel observed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Various media constantly feed off each other and, in an era of electronic and digital information exchange, the speed at which this happens has become very rapid.  Certain super-major events come to dominate the headlines to such an extent that it becomes temporarily difficult for columnists and commentators to discuss anything else.  They are drawn in, as if by a vortex."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whannel gives the example of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] as an example of Vortextuality as this story dominated the media for days, to the extent that it removed most other items from the news agenda. Likewise, during global sporting events, such as the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] or the [[Olympic Games]], journalists and columnists with no expertise or pre-existing interest in sport comment on the event as Marshal et al. (2010) point out. Recent examples, of media vortextuality include the [[election of Barack Obama]] and the [[death of Michael Jackson]].&lt;!-- NOT PUBLISHED YET &lt;ref name=cp65&gt;Whannel, G.
