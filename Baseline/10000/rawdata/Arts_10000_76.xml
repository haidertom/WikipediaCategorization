      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23797">The following is a partial '''list of unproduced Alfred Hitchcock projects''', in roughly chronological order. During a career that spanned more than half a century, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] [[Alfred Hitchcock filmography|directed over fifty films]], and worked on a number of others which never made it beyond the [[pre-production]] stage.

== ''Number 13'' (1922) ==
{{Main|Number 13 (film)}}
This was to be Hitchcock's directorial debut, after working in the art department on twelve films previously, but budgetary problems canceled the production after only a few scenes were shot. Studio records indicate that its title was to be ''Mrs. Peabody''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

== ''Forbidden Territory'' (1933–1934) ==
British thriller writer [[Dennis Wheatley]] had been a guest on the set of many of the early Hitchcock movies, and when ''The Forbidden Territory'' was published in January 1933, he presented the director with a copy.  Hitchcock so enjoyed the book that he wanted to make a film of it, but he was just in the process of moving to Gaumont-British studios to work for Michael Balcon; he asked Wheatley to hold onto the rights until he could persuade his new employer to purchase them.   When the time came, however, Balcon wasn't interested and instead insisted that Hitchcock direct the musical ''[[Waltzes from Vienna]]''.   Hitchcock then approached Richard Wainwright, a distinguished producer who had been head of UFA films in Germany, and had recently relocated to Britain.   Wainwright was keen to pick up a promising subject for his first British film, and immediately bought the rights.  Although there was a verbal understanding that Hitchcock was to direct, Balcon refused to release him, and instead began production of ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''.  Wainwright, committed to studio space, technicians and actors, had no alternative but to proceed without him, and placed [[Forbidden Territory|the film]] into the hands of American director Phil Rosen. In 1936, at Hitchcock's instigation, Wheatley wrote a screenplay ''The Bombing of London'', but the controversial project could find no backer and was shelved.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== ''Greenmantle'' (1939–1942) ==
Hitchcock very much wanted to direct a follow-up to ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'', and he felt that ''[[Greenmantle]]'' by [[John Buchan]] was a superior book. He proposed that the film would star [[Cary Grant]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]], but the rights from the Buchan estate proved too expensive.&lt;ref name="ordinaryleastsquare.typepad.com"&gt;[http://ordinaryleastsquare.typepad.com/dubi/2008/03/films-hitchco-1.html] from Ordinary Least Square&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unnamed ''Titanic'' project (1939) ==
Hitchcock remarked in a British film journal interview just before leaving for Hollywood that he hoped to make a film about the tragic loss of RMS ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', as the inherent drama of the ocean liner's sinking appealed to him.  He went on to make ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' instead.

== ''Escape'' (1940) ==
Hitchcock desperately wanted to direct [[Norma Shearer]], [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], and [[Conrad Veidt]] in one of the first [[World War II]] dramas, ''[[Escape (1940 film)|Escape]]''. Hitchcock, a long-time admirer of Shearer's acting, had sought for years to find a suitable project for her. However, Hitchcock was shut out of the project when the novel ''Escape'' by Ethel Vance (pen name of [[Grace Zaring Stone]]) was purchased by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Hitchcock knew he could never work for the notorious MGM studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]], who selected [[Mervyn LeRoy]] to produce [[Escape (1940 film)|the film]], which indeed starred Shearer and was released in late 1940. Years later, Hitchcock made the statement about the lack of true Hollywood leading ladies with the quote, "Where are the Norma Shearers?"

== Unmade Nazi documentary (1945) ==
{{Main|German Concentration Camps Factual Survey}}
In 1945, Hitchcock was brought in as a supervising director for a [[documentary film]] about Nazi crimes and Nazi [[Internment|concentration camps]]. The film was originally to include segments produced by military film units from the United Kingdom, United States, France, and the Soviet Union. [[Cold War]] developments meant that the USSR segment was withdrawn, and the film remained uncompleted, with some footage kept in the collection of the [[Imperial War Museum]]. 

However, a reconstruction of the film was aired as ''Memory of the Camps'' in 1984–1985 in the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States version was shown on the PBS series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' on May 7, 1985. In October 2014, a new documentary about the unfinished film, ''Night Will Fall'', premiered at the [[BFI London Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="BBC1945"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29249780 |title=Documentary tells of abandoned Hitchcock Nazi film |access-date=18 September 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Hamlet'' (late 1940s) ==
In the late 1940s, Hitchcock had plans to make a modernized version of the Shakespeare story. Hitchcock's Shakespearean vision was of a "psychological melodrama" (set in contemporary England, and starring Cary Grant in the title role[[Prince Hamlet|)]]. The project was scrapped when Hitchcock's studio caught wind of a potential lawsuit from a professor who had already written a modern-day version of Hamlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hitchcock's notebooks: an authorized and illustrated look inside the creative mind of Alfred Hitchcock|last = Aulier|first = Dan|publisher = Spike|year = 1999|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Bramble Bush'' (1951–1953) ==
''The Bramble Bush'' would have been an adaptation of a 1948 novel by [[David Duncan (writer)|David Duncan]] about a disaffected [[Communism|Communist]] agitator who, on the run from the police, is forced to adopt the identity of a murder suspect. The story would be adapted to take place in [[Mexico]] and [[San Francisco]]. 

The project, originally to come after ''[[I Confess (film)|I Confess]]'' (1953) as a [[Transatlantic Pictures]] production to be released by [[Warner Bros.]], had a high budget which made it a difficult project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bf5l0qtZabMC&amp;pg=PA456&amp;lpg=PA456&amp;dq=david+duncan+the+bramble+bush&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=U8psC0NI4c&amp;sig=3EM1D6BRMmJQou9rE3kkGA1GlmQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxC-TIfDDoyqsAPSpqD7DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20duncan%20the%20bramble%20bush&amp;f=false Patrick McGilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light'' (2002) via Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock did not feel that any of the scripts lifted the movie beyond an ordinary chase story, and Warner Brothers allowed him to kill the project and move on to ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954). 

The theme of the hero assuming a dangerous new identity would become the kernel of the script for ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959). [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s  film ''[[The Passenger (1975 film)|The Passenger]]'' (1975) tells a similar story, but is not based on Duncan's book.&lt;ref name="ordinaryleastsquare.typepad.com"/&gt; The 1960 film ''[[The Bramble Bush]]'', starring [[Richard Burton]] and [[Barbara Rush]], and released by Warner Bros., was based on a Charles Mergendahl novel, and had no relation to Duncan's book.

== ''Flamingo Feather'' (1956) ==
This was to be a big-budget adaptation of [[Laurens van der Post]]'s novel of political intrigue in [[Southern Africa]]. [[James Stewart]] was expected to take the lead role of an adventurer who discovers a concentration camp for Communist agents; Hitchcock wanted [[Grace Kelly]] to play the love interest. 

After a disappointing research trip to [[South Africa]] where he concluded that he would have difficulty filming, especially on a budget &amp;ndash; and with confusion of the story's politics and the impracticability of casting Kelly, Hitchcock deferred the project and instead cast Stewart in ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' ([[1956 in film|1956]]). Hitchcock travelled to Livingstone at The Victoria Falls and was a guest of Harry Sossen one of the prominent inhabitants of this pioneer town. Hitchcock and Sossen were photographed together at the newly opened Livingstone Airport and the event was recorded in the local papers. Sossen was also in communication with Laurens van der Post who gave him a signed copy of the book ''Flamingo Feather'' during a visit to the Falls (staying at the [[Victoria Falls Hotel]]). Sossen's daughter Marion is in possession of the book today and a number of letters between her father and van der Post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/books/beginnings/9908/making.of.psycho Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of ''Psycho''] from CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''No Bail for the Judge'' (1958–1961) ==
''No Bail for the Judge''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2007/43/hitchcock-thriller-no-bail-judge/ No Bail for the Judge] from sensesofcinema.com&lt;/ref&gt; was to be an adaptation of a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] novel by [[Henry Cecil Leon|Henry Cecil]] about a London [[barrister]] who, with the assistance of a gentleman thief, has to defend her father, a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judge, when he is accused of murdering a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. In a change of pace from his usual blonde actresses, [[Audrey Hepburn]] would have played the barrister, with [[Laurence Harvey]] as the thief, and [[John Williams (actor)|John Williams]] as the Hepburn character's father. Some sources, including ''Writing with Hitchcock'' author Steven DeRosa&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writingwithhitchcock/nobailforthejudge.html No Bail for the Judge]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from writingwithhitchcock.com&lt;/ref&gt; say that Hitchcock's interest in the novel started in the summer of 1954 while filming ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'', and that Hitchcock hoped to have [[John Michael Hayes]] write the screenplay. Hepburn was an admirer of Hitchcock's work and had long wanted to appear in one of his films.

[[Samuel A. Taylor]], scenarist for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', wrote the screenplay after [[Ernest Lehman]] rejected it. The Taylor screenplay included a scene, not in the original novel, where the heroine disguises herself as a prostitute and has to fend off a [[rape|rapist]]. Hepburn left the film, partly because of the near-rape scene, but primarily due to a pregnancy. (Hepburn suffered a miscarriage during the filming of the 1960 film ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' and then gave birth to son Sean Ferrer in July 1960.) Laurence Harvey still ended up working with Hitchcock in 1959, however, on an episode that Hitchcock directed of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]''.

Without Hepburn, the project didn't have the same appeal for Hitchcock. Changes in British law concerning prostitution and entrapment&amp;nbsp;— changes that took place after the novel was published&amp;nbsp;— made some aspects of the screenplay implausible. Hitchcock told [[Paramount Pictures]] it was better to write off $200,000 already spent on the film's development than to spend another $3 million for a film he no longer cared for. In the fall of 1959, a Paramount publicity brochure titled "Success in the Sixties!" had touted ''No Bail for the Judge'' as an upcoming feature film starring Hepburn, to be filmed in [[Technicolor]] and [[VistaVision]].

== ''The Wreck of the Mary Deare'' (1959) ==
The [[Hammond Innes]] [[The Wreck of the Mary Deare|novel]] was optioned by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] with the intention of having Hitchcock direct and [[Gary Cooper]] star. Hitchcock had long wanted to work with Cooper, but after developing the script with Ernest Lehman for several weeks, they concluded that it couldn't be done without turning the movie into "a boring courtroom drama". 

Hitchcock and Lehman made an appearance before MGM executives telling the story of ''[[North by Northwest]]'', and said that MGM would get two films out of Hitchcock under his contract with MGM. However, eventually Hitchcock abandoned the idea of ''Mary Deare'' and went ahead with ''North by Northwest'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick McGilligan, ''Alfred Hitchcock: A Life in Darkness and Light'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2003), pg. 543, 548-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Blind Man'' (1960) ==
Following ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', Hitchcock re-united with Ernest Lehman for an original screenplay idea: A blind pianist, Jimmy Shearing (a role for [[James Stewart]]), regains his sight after receiving the eyes of a dead man. Watching a [[American frontier|Wild West]] show at [[Disneyland]] with his family, Shearing would have visions of being shot and would come to realize that the dead man was in fact murdered and the image of the murderer is still imprinted on the retina of his eyes. The story would end with a chase around the ocean liner [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']]. [[Walt Disney]] reputedly barred Hitchcock from shooting at [[Disneyland]] after seeing ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Stewart left the project, Lehman argued with Hitchcock, and the script was never shot.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gore ''The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made'', New York: St. Martin's Press, 1999, p.36-39&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Village of Stars'' (1962) ==
Hitchcock bought the rights to the 1960 novel ''Village of Stars'' by [[Arthur David Beaty|David Beaty]] (written under the pen name Paul Stanton) after ''The Blind Man'' project was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Gore, ''The 50 Greatest Movies Never Made'' (New York: [[St. Martin's Press]], 1999), pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The book follows a [[Royal Air Force]] [[V bomber]] crew given an order to drop a nuclear bomb, only to have the order aborted. Unfortunately, the bomb is resisting attempts to defuse it and the plane can only stay in flight for a limited time.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Stanton (David Beaty) ''Village of Stars'', London: Michael Joseph, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Trap for a Solitary Man'' (1963) ==
''Trap for a Solitary Man'' was scheduled to be directed by Hitchcock in widescreen by [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century-Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Spoto, ''The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock'' (Boston: Little, Brown, 1983 {{ISBN|0-316-80723-0}}), pg. 445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Gottlieb, "Unknown Hitchcock: the Unrealized Projects;" featured in ''Hitchcock: Past and Future'' (London: Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0-415-27525-3}}), pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The story, based on the French play ''Piege Pour un Homme Seul'' by M. Robert Thomas, follows a young married couple on holiday in the Alps. The wife disappears, and after a prolonged search the police bring back someone they claim to be her; she even says she is the man's wife, but the man has never seen her before. The play was later adapted three times as [[television film]]s: ''[[Honeymoon With a Stranger]]'' ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], 1969), ''[[One of My Wives Is Missing]]'' (ABC, 1976) and ''[[Vanishing Act (1986 film)|Vanishing Act]]'' ([[CBS]], 1986).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064438/movieconnections Internet Movie Database]&lt;/ref&gt;  It had previously been broadly adapted (without attribution) as the 1958 [[Associated British Picture Corporation|Associated British-Pathé]] feature ''[[Chase a Crooked Shadow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.law.lsu.edu/ccorcos/lawctr/TOPTENMOVIES.htm "Top Ten Law-Related Movies"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Mary Rose'' (1964) ==
Hitchcock had long desired to turn [[J. M. Barrie]]'s 1920 play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' into a film. In 1964, after working together on ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'', Hitchcock asked [[Jay Presson Allen]] to adapt the play into a screenplay. Hitchcock would later tell interviewers that his contract with [[Universal Pictures]] allowed him to make any film, so long as the budget was under $3 million, and so long as it was not ''Mary Rose''. Whether or not this was actually true, [[Lew Wasserman]] was not keen on the project, though Hitchcock never gave up hope of one day filming it.&lt;ref name="Francois Truffaut 1985"&gt;François Truffaut, Hitchcock Revisited (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Three Hostages'' (1964) ==
In 1964, Hitchcock re-read another [[Richard Hannay]] novel by John Buchan, ''[[The Three Hostages]]'', with a mind to adapting it. As with ''Greenmantle'' a quarter of a century earlier, the rights were elusive. But also the story was dated, very much rooted in the 1930s, and the plot involved a villain whose blind mother [[hypnosis|hypnotizes]] the hero. Hitchcock, in interviews, said that he felt that the portrayal of hypnosis did not work on film, and that films that attempted this portrayal, in Hitchcock's opinion, turned out poorly.&lt;ref&gt;François Truffaut ''Hitchcock Revisited'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Frenzy'' (a.k.a. ''Kaleidoscope'') (1964–1967) ==
Although Hitchcock made a film called ''[[Frenzy]]'' in 1972, that film's title and some plot points came from an idea Hitchcock had a few years earlier for a [[prequel]] to ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stevenderosa.com/writingwithhitchcock/frenzy.html Frenzy] from stevenderosa.com&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchcock approached many writers including [[Samuel A. Taylor|Samuel Taylor]], [[Alec Coppel]], and ''Psycho'' writer [[Robert Bloch]], but in the end engaged an old friend, [[Benn Levy]] to flesh out his sketchy idea.

The story (inspired by English serial killers [[Neville Heath]] and [[John George Haigh]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barber |first1=Nicholas |title=Why Hitchcock’s Kaleidoscope was too shocking to be made |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180620-why-hitchcocks-kaleidoscope-was-too-shocking-to-be-made |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 June 2018 |language=en |date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; would have revolved around a young, handsome bodybuilder  who lures young women to their deaths, a version of the character known as 'Merry Widow Murderer' in ''Shadow of a Doubt''. The [[New York City Police Department|New York police]] set a trap for him, with a policewoman posing as a potential victim. The script was based around three [[set piece|crescendos]] dictated by Hitchcock: the first was a murder by a waterfall; the second murder would take place on a mothballed warship; and the finale, which would take place at an oil refinery with brightly colored drums.

Hitchcock showed his script to his friend [[François Truffaut]]. Though Truffaut admired the script, he felt uneasy about its relentless sex and violence. Unlike ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', these elements would not be hidden behind the respectable veneer of [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] and psychological [[suspense]], and the killer would be the main character, the hero, the eyes of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock'' by [[Donald Spoto]] (1983, {{ISBN|0-316-80723-0}}; 1999 paperback reprint {{ISBN|0-306-80932-X}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal vetoed the film, despite Hitchcock's assurances that he would make the film for under $1 million with a cast of unknowns, although [[David Hemmings]], [[Robert Redford]], and [[Michael Caine]] had all been suggested as leads. The film&amp;nbsp;— alternatively known as ''Frenzy'' or the more "sixties"-esque ''Kaleidoscope''&amp;nbsp;— was not made.

Test footage from this project can be viewed here [https://www.flickr.com/photos/49597617@N02/4629223639/] and is included in the 1999 TV documentaries ''Dial H For Hitchcock: The Genius Behind the Showman'' ([[Starz Encore|Encore]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=35173 1999 Universal TV press release]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Reputations: Alfred Hitchcock'' ([[A&amp;E Networks|A&amp;E]]/[[BBC Two]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The silent eloquence of the Master of Suspense," ''The Independent'', 6 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''R.R.R.R.'' (1965) ==
Hitchcock approached Italian comedy-thriller writers [[Agenore Incrocci]] and [[Furio Scarpelli]] ([[Age &amp; Scarpelli]]), writers of ''[[Big Deal on Madonna Street]]'', to write a screenplay around an original idea Hitchcock had carried in his head since the late 1930s. A [[New York City]] hotel is run by an Italian immigrant who is unaware that his family are using the hotel as cover for crimes, including the theft of a valuable coin from a guest of the hotel. (R.R.R.R. is the highest value of coin.)

The Italian screenwriters struggled with the story, and were not helped by the language barrier.  Universal Pictures were not keen on the idea and persuaded Hitchcock to move on to something else.&lt;ref name="Francois Truffaut 1985"/&gt;

== ''The Short Night'' (1976–1979) ==
{{Main|The Short Night}}
Hitchcock's last, unfinished project was ''[[The Short Night]]'', an adaptation of the spy thriller of the same name by [[Ronald Kirkbride]]. A British double agent (loosely based on [[George Blake]]) escapes from prison and flees to [[Moscow]] via [[Finland]], where his wife and children are waiting. An American agent &amp;ndash; whose brother was one of the traitor's victims &amp;ndash; heads to Finland to intercept him but ends up falling for the wife. It was Hitchcock's third attempt &amp;ndash; after ''[[Torn Curtain]]'' and ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'' &amp;ndash; to produce a "realistic [[James Bond|Bond]] film". [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Sean Connery]] were possible male leads. [[Liv Ullmann]] was asked to play the double agent's wife. [[Catherine Deneuve]] was also asked to star.  [[Walter Matthau]] was considered for the villain role.  [[Ed Lauter]] was also discussed for a role as one of Matthau's prison mates.  

The first writer assigned to the picture, [[James Costigan]], quarreled with the director, who asked for him to be paid off. Then [[Ernest Lehman]] agreed to work on the script. Lehman felt the story should focus on the American spy, and left out the double agent's jailbreak. Lehman left the film too, and Hitchcock asked old friend [[Norman Lloyd]] to help him write a long [[Film treatment|treatment]]. Lloyd, like Universal, was concerned that Hitchcock's failing health meant that the movie might not get made. When Hitchcock suggested moving straight on to the screenplay, Lloyd objected, saying they were unprepared. Hitchcock reacted angrily, fired Lloyd, and worked on the treatment alone.

After a while, Hitchcock accepted that he needed another writer to work with him, and Universal suggested [[David Freeman (screenwriter)|David Freeman]]. Freeman helped Hitchcock complete the treatment and wrote the screenplay. He wrote about his experiences in the 1999 book ''The Last Days of Alfred Hitchcock'', which includes his completed screenplay. The circumstances surrounding Hitchcock's retirement were given by producer [[Hilton A. Green]] during the documentary ''Plotting "Family Plot"''. According to Green, during [[pre-production]] for ''The Short Night'' Hitchcock met Green to tell him that his poor health would prevent him from making the film that was to be the follow-up to ''[[Family Plot]]''. After trying to talk Hitchcock out of his decision, Green agreed to Hitchcock's request to bring the news of his decision to retire to studio head [[Lew Wasserman]], a long-time friend of Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0455182|Plotting "Family Plot"}}. [[Hilton A. Green|Hilton Green]] tells the story about the circumstances that led to Hitchock's retirement, beginning at approximately 44 minutes and 12 seconds into the documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allan Bernard Temko''' (February 4, 1924 – January 25, 2006) was an architectural critic and writer based in San Francisco.

== History ==
Born in New York City and raised in [[Weehawken]], New Jersey, Temko served as a [[U.S. Navy]] officer in World War II, graduated from [[Columbia University]] in 1947, and continued his graduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris, France. He taught for several years in France and produced a landmark book about the Cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], ''Notre Dame of Paris,'' in 1955.&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt; He wrote architectural criticism for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' from 1961 to 1993.  He also taught [[city planning]] and the social sciences at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[California State University, Hayward]] (now California State University, East Bay).

Following Finnish-born architect [[Eero Saarinen]]'s death in 1961, Temko published ''[[Eero Saarinen]]'' (1962), a critical examination of Saarinen's most famous works from the [[General Motors Technical Center]] to the [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial]] and its [[Gateway Arch]] (still in the planning stages at the time), as a volume in [[George Braziller]]'s ''Makers of Contemporary Architecture'' series.

Temko was an activist critic who defended the urban character and texture of San Francisco from, in his words, "a variety of villains: real estate sharks, the construction industry and its unions, venal politicians, bureaucrats, brutal highway engineers, the automobile lobby, and – in some ways worst of all – incompetent architects and invertebrate planners who were wrecking the Bay Area before our eyes."  One of these villains, an architect named [[Sandy Walker]], famously sued Temko over his 1978 description of Walker's [[Pier 39]] project which began, "Corn. Kitsch. Schlock. Honky-tonk. Dreck. Schmaltz. Merde."&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt;

Temko was instrumental in the removal of the [[Embarcadero Freeway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iK4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e3oEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3258%2C1195153 |title=Chinatown Demands Highway Repair |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |agency=AP |date={{date|1990-04-17|dmy}} |newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |accessdate={{date|2015-02-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; and memorably described the 1971 [[Vaillancourt Fountain]] on the Embarcadero as a thing "deposited by a concrete dog with square intestines."&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt;

He described the [[City Center Building]] in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]] in the early 1970s, calling it a "toaster", due to its slightly elongated rectangular shape, which strongly influenced public opinion of the building.

Temko, who met [[Jack Kerouac]] when they were both undergraduates at Columbia, appears in Kerouac's novel ''[[On the Road]]'' as the model for the character "Roland Major".&lt;ref name=SFC-obit /&gt;  Temko also appeared in Kerouac's ''[[Book of Dreams (novel)|Book of Dreams]]'' as Irving Minko and in ''[[Visions of Cody]]'' as Allen Minko.

He called for an international design competition for the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|eastern span replacement]] of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]], saying that both the single-tower cable-stayed scheme (favored by [[T.Y. Lin]]) and the single-masted self-anchored suspension design ultimately chosen were incapable of being "a world-famous work of engineering art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/COMMENTARY-Hold-On-We-Can-Do-Better-by-the-3002571.php |title=COMMENTARY: Hold On — We Can Do Better by the Bridge |author=Temko, Allan |date={{date|1998-06-23|dmy}} |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate={{date|2015-02-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temko was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism]] in 1990. He died of apparent congestive heart failure at the Orinda Convalescent Hospital in [[Orinda, California]], in 2006.&lt;ref name=SFC-obit&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Allan-Temko-architecture-watchdog-2542550.php |title=Allan Temko - architecture watchdog |author1=Taylor, Michael |author2=King, John |date={{date|2006-01-26|dmy}} |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate={{date|2015-02-06|dmy}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''American Symphony''''' is a [[symphony]] for [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[Adam Schoenberg]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Kansas City Symphony]] and was completed in early 2011.  It was first performed by the Kansas City Symphony under the direction of [[Michael Stern (conductor)|Michael Stern]] at the [[Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Kansas City]] on March 4, 2011.

==Composition==

===Background===
Schoenberg was inspired to write the ''American Symphony'' by the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. Presidential election]], about which he wrote, "...both parties asked the people to embrace change and make a difference. I was both excited and honored about ushering in this new era in our nation's history, and for the first time, I truly understood what it meant to be American."  The composer cited [[Aaron Copland]]'s [[Symphony No. 3 (Copland)|Symphony No. 3]], which Schoenberg described as "the quintessential American symphony," as a musical influence on the work.  He wrote, "Quite serendipitously, I heard Copland's 3rd three nights after President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] was elected and, seeing that our country and world had needs similar to those of Copland's time, I was inspired to make a difference. I set out to write a modern American symphony that paid homage to our past and looked forward to a brighter future."

Despite this, Shoenberg described the ''American Symphony'' as "not a patriotic work," adding, "the symphony reflects a respect and responsibility for the great potential of our nation and a hunger to affect positive change. It is about our collective ability to restore hope within ourselves and our neighbors, both here and around the world."&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Adam Schoenberg|Schoenberg, Adam]] (2011). [http://adamschoenberg.com/works/american-symphony-2011/ Program Notes: ''American Symphony'']. Retrieved August 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
The symphony has a duration of approximately 24 minutes and is cast in five [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Fanfare
#White on Blue
#Rondo
#Prayer
#Stars, Stripes, and Celebration

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (third doubling [[piccolo]]), three [[oboe]]s (third doubling [[cor anglais]]), three [[clarinet]]s (third doubling [[bass clarinet]]), three [[bassoon]]s (third doubling [[contrabassoon]]), four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]] (doubling [[celesta]]), [[timpani]], four percussionists, and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the world premiere, the music critic Timothy McDonald of ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' highly praised the symphony, writing, "Schoenberg demonstrated a distinctive and exciting compositional voice. His ''American Symphony'' is bold and brilliant, and deserves to be a staple among orchestras in the U.S. and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McDonald |first=Timothy |title=Review: Kansas City Symphony with guest pianist Jonathan Biss |work=[[The Kansas City Star]] |date=March 5, 2011 |url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/article297955/Review--Kansas-City-Symphony-with-guest-pianist-Jonathan-Biss.html |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul Horsley of Kansas City-based journal ''The Independent'' called it an "agreeable new piece" and wrote, "If the finale felt prolix in proportion to the overall length of the symphony, the piece revealed the soul of a strong musician with a natural sense of melody, a playful knack for rhythm and a serious approach to orchestration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horsley |first=Paul |title=Kansas City Symphony Presents Premiere of Appealing New Work |work=The Independent |date=March 5, 2011 |url=http://www.kcindependent.com/a-night-at-the-symphony/ |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing a later performance of the piece with the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Symphony, George Day of ''[[The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier]]'' observed, "Its five movements are mostly brisk, sometimes noisy, but always engaging. The music speaks of the variety, vitality and optimism of the American spirit. Not exactly a patriotic work, it nevertheless conveys a respect, even a reverence, for the past and future of America."  He added, "Schoenberg clearly knows how to orchestrate, and I am sure we have not heard the last of him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Day |first=George |title=Review: Contemporary Music Focus of Skillfully Performed WCFSymphony's Sounds American Festival Conclusion |work=[[The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier]] |date=October 15, 2014 |url=http://wcfcourier.com/lifestyles/review-contemporary-music-focus-of-skillfully-performced-wcfsymphony-s-sounds/article_1d611696-906c-583e-8ea1-954c111bba12.html |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
A recording of the ''American Symphony'' featuring the Kansas City Symphony under the direction of Michael Stern was released through Reference Recordings on January 20, 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13638">The '''Art Directors Club Hall of Fame''' was established in 1971, by the [[Art Directors Club of New York]], a professional organization in the design and creative industries. The Art Directors Club selects its honorees from those "who have made significant contributions to art direction and visual communications, and whose lifetime achievements represent the highest standards of creative excellence." &lt;ref name="adcglobal.org"&gt;[http://adcglobal.org/awards/hall-of-fame/ Art Directors Club Hall of Fame awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to designers usually notable within the communities of design and advertising, the honorees include more popular artists who have affected the broader field of visual culture, including, for example, [[Issey Miyake]], [[Jim Henson]] and [[Andy Warhol]].

On its website,&lt;ref name="adcglobal.org"/&gt; the Art Directors Club maintains a biography of each of the Hall of Fame honorees.

In a video shown at the 2010 Hall of Fame gala, [[George Lois]] speaks a little bit about the award and its history.&lt;ref name="lois"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jaegersloan.com/project/george-lois-art-directors-club/|title=The Design of Fame|accessdate=2012-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, Lois calls the Hall of Fame honors "the Oscars of the advertising business."&lt;ref name="lois"/&gt;

The journal was established by [[James Rodger Brandon|James R. Brandon]] ([[University of Hawaii]]) in 1984 and serves as the official journal of the [[Association for Asian Performance]], an affiliate of the [[Association for Theatre in Higher Education]]. It is published by the [[University of Hawaii Press]]. In 1992, the [[editor in chief|editorship]] passed to [[Samuel L. Leiter]] ([[Brooklyn College]]), who began the practice of included a translated play in each issue. In 2005, the editorship passed to [[Kathy Foley]] ([[University of California, Santa Cruz]]).

The term "'''capitalist realism'''" has been used, particularly in [[Germany]], to describe commodity-based art, from [[Pop Art]] in the 1950s and 1960s to the commodity art of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it has been used to describe the ideological-aesthetic aspect of contemporary [[corporate capitalism]] in the West. When used in this way, it is a play on the term "[[socialist realism]]".

==In art==
Although attested earlier,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. by [[Abraham Polonsky]] of [[Edward Dmytryk|Edward Dmytryk's]] ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'': William Pechter and Abraham Polonsky, 'Abraham Polonsky and "Force of Evil"', ''Film Quarterly'', 15.3 [Special Issue on Hollywood] (Spring, 1962), 47-54 (p. 53); https://www.jstor.org/stable/1210628.&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase "capitalist realism" was first used in the title of the 1963 [[art exhibition]] in [[Düsseldorf, Germany|Düsseldorf]], ''Demonstration for Capitalist Realism'', which featured the work of [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Sigmar Polke]], [[Wolf Vostell]], and [[:de:Konrad Fischer (Maler)|Konrad Lueg]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, Hugh. ''A World History of Art'', Laurence King Publishing, p847. {{ISBN|1-85669-451-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition's participants focused upon depictions of Germany's growing consumer culture and media-saturated society with strategies, in part, influenced by those of their American Pop&lt;ref name="Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://observer.com/2014/07/living-with-pop-a-reproduction-of-capitalist-realism-at-artists-space/ | title=Living With Pop: A Reproduction of Capitalist Realism' at Artists Space | publisher=The New York Observer | date=23 July 2014 | accessdate=20 November 2014 | author=Pollack,  Maika | quote=It was a reaction to Pop from a postwar Germany divided between East and West.}}&lt;/ref&gt; counterparts. The recent rise in [[Pop art|Pop Art]] in German culture was coupled by a fascination with America, which served as a stimulation for the piece. They were inspired primarily by the iconography depicted in newspapers and magazines.

==Sigmar Polke==
{{main|Sigmar Polke}}

Capitalist realism is a German art movement co-founded in 1963 by artist [[Sigmar Polke]].&lt;ref name="German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/12/AR2010061203694.html | title=German artist Sigmar Polke, creator of 'Higher Beings Command,' dies at 69 | publisher=The Washington Post | date=13 June 2010 | accessdate=17 November 2014 | author=Schudel, Matt | quote=In the 1960s, Mr. Polke was at the vanguard of a German artistic movement called capitalist realism, along with fellow painter Gerhard Richter -- who later expressed reservations about his colleague's work, saying "he refuses to accept any borders, any limits."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polke embraced the advertising and publicity commonly found in the popular press in renderings of everyday consumer items. Often ironic and with critical overtones of society and politics the Capitalist Realism movement is considered more explicitly political than conventional Pop Art.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, Thomas. ''The Rise of the Sixties: American and European Art in the age of Dissent'' {{ISBN|1856694267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Schudson==
{{main|Michael Schudson}}

In the mid-1980s, [[Michael Schudson]] used the term "capitalist realism" to describe mainstream practices in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter seven of Schudson's ''Advertising: The Uneasy Persuasion'' compares the messages and appeals of advertising to those found in the Socialist Realism of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, 'Advertising as Capitalist Realism', in ''Advertising, The Uneasy Persuasion: Its Dubious Impact on American Society'' (New York: Basic Books, 1984), pp. 209-33 (repr. in ''
Advertising &amp; Society Review'', vol. 1, issue 1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In his account, the realism of advertising promotes a way of life based on private consumption, rather than social, public achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Harry; MacRury, Isin; Botterill, Jackie. ''The Dynamics of Advertising'', Routledge, 2000, p99. {{ISBN|90-5823-085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mark Fisher==
{{main|Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?}}

The term next appeared in 2009 with the publication of Mark Fisher's book ''[[Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009); {{ISBN|978-1-84694-317-1}} (pbk.); 1846943175 (pbk.).&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher argues that the term "capitalist realism" best describes the current global political situation, which lacks visible alternatives to the capitalist system which became dominant following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His argument is a response to, and critique of, [[neo-liberalism]] and new forms of government which apply the logic of [[capitalism]] and the market to all aspects of governance.

His ideology refers to a perceived "widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2010|isbn=|location=Winchester, UK|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a philosophical concept, capitalist realism is influenced by the [[Althusserian]] conception of ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=Zero Books|year=2009|isbn=978-1846943171|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher proposes that within a capitalist framework there is no space to conceive of alternative forms of social structures, adding that younger generations are not even concerned with recognizing alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalist Realism. Is There No Alternative?|last=Fisher|first=Mark|publisher=O Books|year=2009|isbn=9781846943171|location=|pages=8|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He proposes that the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; compounded this position. Rather than catalyzing a desire to seek alternatives for the existing model, the crisis reinforced the notion that modifications must be made within the existing system. The crash confirmed within the populace the necessity of capitalism rather than shake it loose from its foundations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Capitalist realism as I understand it cannot be confined to art or to the quasi-propagandistic way in which advertising functions. It is more like a pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action.''&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is there no Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fisher argues that capitalist realism has propagated a 'business [[ontology]]' which concludes that everything should be run as a business including education and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Fisher, ''Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?'' (Winchester, UK; Washington [D.C.]: Zero, 2009, pg15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the publication of Fisher's work, the term has been picked up by other literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;Prominently Mark Fisher and Jeremy Gilbert, 'Capitalist Realism and Neoliberal Hegemony: A Dialogue', ''New Formations'', 80--81 (2013), 89--101 DOI:10.3898/NEWF.80/81.05.2013; ''Reading Capitalist Realism'', ed. by Alison Shonkwiler and Leigh Claire La Berge (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The term '''Context art''' ({{lang-de|Kontext Kunst}}) was introduced through the seminal exhibition and an accompanying publication ''Kontext Kunst. The Art of the 90s''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuegalerie-archiv.at/93/kunst/cover.html Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; curated by [[Peter Weibel]] at the Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Graz (Austria) in 1993 (02.10.–07.11.1993).

== Exhibition and publication ==

Both exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early 1990s. The presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production, whether these were formal, social, or ideologically defined. Institutional critique, feminist positions, later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization, all closely related to social and political changes, became relevant subjects of artistic production.

“It is no longer purely about critiquing the art system, but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes. In the ’90s, non-art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse. Artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes, partisans of the real. The interaction between artists and social situations, between art and non-art contexts has led to a new art form, where both are folded together: Context art. The aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiftyparadigms.org/false_economies.htm Peter Weibel, Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre (Köln: DuMont Verlag, 1994), p. 57, translated by Barnaby Drabble / resource: Rebecca Gordon Nesbitt, ''False Economies: Time to Take Stock'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

It might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the German translation ''[[KontextKunst]]'' instead of ''Context Art'' or its likewise politically tended orientation (see Maria Lind’s reference&lt;ref&gt;[http://eipcp.net/transversal/1204/lind/en/#_ftn16 Actualisation of Space: The Case of Oda Projesi]''Kontextkunst'' is, if you wish a German parallel to the so-called 'relational aesthetics' but more programmatically political and academic. Both imply a more dynamic notion of art, which actively takes the context into consideration and which often goes beyond the exhibition space. Some of the artists used as 'good' examples by Christian Kravagna have been associated with Kontextkunst. See Peter Weibel: ''Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre'', Cologne, DuMont Verlag 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;), but it never spread far beyond Europe’s language based barriers. Instead vaguely similar strategies were labeled as ''Models of Participatory Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://republicart.net/disc/aap/kravagna01_en.htm Working on the Community Models of Participatory Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 by Christian Kravagna’s attempt to define the field or the later appearing and quite moderate [[Relational Art]] based on the 2002 book ''[[Relational Aesthetics]]'' by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]].  

The accompanying catalog is described to document ”a wide-ranging exhibition designed to illustrate the emergence over the past decade of a new international art movement, .. “ featuring “… an anthology of 22 substantial essays (some reprinted) discussing from diverse perspectives the artistic issues and social and political themes that distinguish ''Context Art'' from related forms of conceptual and installation art…. “.

A '''costume designer''' is a person who designs [[costume]]s for a [[film]], [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] production or television. The role of the costume designer is to create the characters' outfits/costumes and balance the scenes with texture and colour, etc.&lt;ref name="Landis"&gt;{{cite book | title=Filmcraft: Costume Design: Costume Design | publisher=Elsevier Science | author=Landis, Deborah Nadoolman | date=2012-03-16 | pages=Introduction | isbn=9780240818672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costume designer works alongside the [[Theatre director|director]], [[scenic design|scenic]], [[lighting designer]], sound designer, and other creative personnel. The costume designer may also collaborate with hair stylist, wig master, or makeup artist. In European theatre, the role is different, as the theatre designer usually designs both costume and scenic elements.

Designers typically  seek to enhance a character's personality, and to create an evolving plot of colour, changing social status, or period through the visual design of garments and accessories. They may distort or enhance the body—within the boundaries of the director's vision. The designer must ensure that the designs let the actor move as the role requires. The actor must execute the director's blocking of the production without damaging the garments. Garments must be durable and washable, especially for plays with extended runs or films with near-[[Real time (media)|real time]] [[Pace (speed)|pacing]] (meaning that most costumes will not change between scenes) but whose [[principal photography]] phase may stretch across several weeks. The designer must consult not only with the director, but the set and lighting designers to ensure that all elements of the overall production design work together. The designer must possess strong artistic capabilities and a thorough knowledge of pattern development, draping, drafting, textiles and fashion history. The designer must understand historical costuming, and the movement style and poise that period dress may require. 

==History==
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}

During the late-19th century, [[Theatrical company management|company managers]] in the US usually selected costumes for a show. Many were pulled from a rental house; few were designed. Though designers in other theatrical disciplines were recognized, few who specialized in costumes were. The few that were included [[Caroline Siedle]], [[William Charles John Pitcher|C. Wilhelm]], [[Percy Anderson]], and Mrs. John Alexander. They sometimes even received credit on the title page of a [[Programme (booklet)|playbill]] rather than in the back.&lt;ref&gt;King, Kimball. ''Western Drama through the Ages: A Student Reference Guide''. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007. 534. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, film costume designers like [[Edith Head]] and [[Adrian (costume designer)|Adrian]] became well known. Later, those working in television like [[Nolan Miller]] (''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''), [[Janie Bryant]] (''[[Mad Men]]''), and [[Patricia Field]] (''[[Sex and the City]]'') became more prominent, some becoming authors and having their own clothing and jewelry lines.&lt;ref name="meltzer20130919"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/fashion/costume-designers-for-tv-have-a-big-impact-on-fashion.html |title=Get Me Wardrobe! |last=Meltzer |first=Marisa |date=2013-09-19 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of costume designers==
{{Costume}}

Professional costume designers generally fall into three types: freelance, residential, and academic.

*Freelance designers are hired for a specific production by a theatre, dance or opera company, and may or may not actually be local to the theatre they design for.  A freelancer is traditionally paid in three instalments: Upon hire, on delivery of final renderings, and opening night of the production.  Freelancers are not obligated to any exclusivity in what projects they work on, and may design for several productions concurrently.
*A residential designer is hired by a specific theatre, dance or opera company for an extended series of productions.  This can be as short as a summer stock contract, or may be for many years.  A residential designer's contract may limit the amounts of freelance work they are allowed to accept.  Unlike the freelancer, a residential designer is consistently "on location" at the theater—at hand to work with costume studio and other collaborators.  Residential designers tend to be more established than strict freelancers, but this is not always the case.
*An academic designer is one who holds professorship at a school.  The designer is primarily an instructor, but may also act as a residential designer to varying degrees.  They are often free to freelance, as their schedule allows.  In the past, professors of costume design were mostly experienced professionals that may or may not have had formal post-graduate education, but it has now become increasingly common to require a professor to have at least a [[Master of Fine Arts]] in order to teach.

Both residential and academic designers are generally also required to act as Shop Master or Mistress of an onsite costume shop, in addition to designing productions. In a resident theatre, there is almost always a shop staff of stitchers, drapers, cutters and craft artisans. In an academic environment the shop "staff" is generally students, who are learning about costume design and construction. Most universities require costume design students to work a specified number of hours in the shop as part of their course work.

==Unions==
There are two unions that costume designers can belong to:

Costume Designers Guild, Local 892 is one union that represents Costume Designers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.CostumeDesignersGuild.com]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] and [[United Scenic Artists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usa829.org/ Local 829] usa829.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Many costumers belong to the Motion Picture Costumers Union, Local 705 and represent every position within the costume department (except the costume designer).  Local 705 represents Costume Supervisors, Key Costumers, Costumers, Tailor/Seamstress, Ager/Dyer, Cutter/Fitters, Costume House Employees and Commercial Costumers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motionpicturecostumers.org/local705/ Local 705] motionpicturecostumers.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical precedents==
[[File:LindaPaulsen.jpg|thumb|Linda Paulsen demonstrates making seed art at the Minnesota State Fair]]
[[File:TOR New Orleans float.jpg|thumb|Rose Bowl Parade, Tournament of Roses, New Orleans float]]
One [[folk art]] version of crop art is called '''seed art''', a [[Visual arts|visual art]] form created in [[mosaic]]-style, similar to the technique of  [[pointillism]] in painting, or [[needlepoint]] textiles. Seed mosaic images are created by fixing [[Plant|vegetable matter]], especially [[seed]]s, to a background. Coleen Sheehy,&lt;ref&gt;''Seed Queen'' by  Coleen Sheehy, Minnesota Historical Society Press: St. Paul, MN, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Seed Queen'' quotes a classic text on the subject: ''Decorating with Seed mosaics, Chipped Glass and Plant materials'' (first pub.1960)  by Elenor Van Rennslaer&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Van Rennslaer ''Decorating with Seed mosaics, Chipped Glass and Plant materials'' Kessinger Publishing, LLC (July 23, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; "...mosaics are tiles, glass, or stones set in mortar. Instead of these you can create a different kind of mosaic using such plant materials as seeds, tiny pods, and flowers" (Sheehy 49).
An example is the [[Corn Palace]] of Mitchell, South Dakota, that was first built for the  1892 Corn Exposition. Outer walls of the building were -and still are-  covered in murals made from multi-colored ears of corn (Sheehy 24)  The seed mosaic portraits by [[Lillian Colton]] are also examples. Her seed portraits of celebrities were exhibited in the strictly defined "Crop art" category at the [[Minnesota State Fair]] beginning in 1966. Rules for entry of Crop art allow "only seeds from Minnesota-grown farm crops or cultivated garden flowers, fruits, and vegetables" with no wild plant seeds permitted. Colton continued to teach and make Crop art until her death at age 95 in 2007 (Sheehy 2). A new generation of Crop, or Seed artists, known as the  "Postmodern School of Minnesota Crop Art" (Sheehy 90) is continuing this folk tradition. Some of these artists are "Cathy Camper, Alan Carpenter, Kim Cope, Linda Koutsky, Nancy Loung, Suzy Mears, Laura Melnick, and David Steinlicht" (Sheehy 90). There is a custodial aspect and preservation ethic associated with this plant-based art form.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Making Crop art is not only a way preserving and rejuvenating a vibrant folk craft but its practice foregrounds the need to collect, store, and value the lore and varieties of seeds.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
In Los Angeles, the [[Tournament of Roses Parade|Rose Bowl Parade]] floats employ the flowers of plants in a similar collage or mosaic style.

==Crop circles==
The term Crop art might be used to describe formations known as [[crop circle]]s.&lt;ref name="Ency of Rel&amp;Spir"&gt;"Crop Circles." Encyclopedia of Religious and Spiritual Development. 2005.  SAGE Publications. 20 Nov. 2009. &lt;http://www.sage-ereference.com/religion/Article_n57.html&gt;. Eltjo H. Haselhoff&lt;/ref&gt; Crop Circles first came to mass media attention during  the 1980s after they were noticed in some agricultural fields in southern England (Ency Rel/Spir). Most often the images consist of very large and intricate series of rings and lines formed when standing crops, such as wheat and rye are flattened into patterns. Some attribute these designs to the marks left by landings of extra terrestrial craft because the images are usually very large, appear over a short period of time, and some do not show any visible tracks into or out of the design.  These same type of figures are found all over the world; though many do not attribute their manifestation to  visitations by alien beings. Crop Circles  are sometimes called crop formations, agroglyphs, or [[pictograms]]. Some are also created by recognized "landscape artists" for  commercial purposes.&lt;ref name="Ency of Rel&amp;Spir" /&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Deconstructivism''' is a movement of [[postmodern architecture]] which appeared in the 1980s, which gives the impression of the fragmentation of the constructed building.  It is characterized by an absence of harmony, continuity, or symmetry. {{Sfn|Taschen|Taschen|2016|page=148}}   Its name comes from the idea of "[[Deconstruction]]", a form of [[semiotic]] analysis developed by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]].  Architects whose work is often described as deconstructionism (though in many cases the architects themselves reject the label)  include [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Bernard Tschumi]], and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. {{Sfn|Taschen|Taschen|2016|page=148}}    

Besides fragmentation,  Deconstructivism often manipulates the structure's surface skin and creates by non-[[Rectilinear polygon|rectilinear]] shapes which appear to distort and dislocate [[Design principles and elements|elements of architecture]]. The finished visual appearance is characterized by unpredictability and controlled chaos.

==History, context and influences==

Deconstructivism came to public notice with the 1982 [[Parc de la Villette]] [[architectural design competition]], in particular the entry from [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Peter Eisenman]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman, ''Chora L Works'' (New York: Monacelli Press, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; and the winning entry by [[Bernard Tschumi]], as well as the [[Museum of Modern Art]]’s 1988 ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' exhibition in New York, organized by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Mark Wigley]]. Tschumi stated that calling the work of these architects a "movement" or a new "style" was out of context and showed a lack of understanding of their ideas, and believed that Deconstructivism was simply a move against the practice of [[Postmodernism]], which he said involved "making doric temple forms out of plywood".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tschumi.com/news/33/ Rem Koolhaas and Bernard Tschumi in Conversation, 18 May 2001, ETH Zürich.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential exhibitions include the 1989 opening of the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], designed by Peter Eisenman. The New York exhibition has featured works by [[Frank Gehry]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Since their exhibitions, some architects associated with Deconstructivism have distanced themselves from it; nonetheless, the term has stuck and has come to embrace a general trend within contemporary architecture.

===Modernism and postmodernism===
[[File:Seattle Central Library, Seattle, Washington - 20060418.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Seattle Central Library]] by [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture|OMA]]]]

The term "Deconstructivism" in [[contemporary architecture]] is opposed to the ordered rationality of [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] and [[postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]]. Though postmodernist and nascent deconstructivist architects both published in the journal ''[[Oppositions]]'' (between 1943 and 1954), that journal's contents mark a decisive break between the two movements. Deconstructivism took a confrontational stance to [[architectural history]], wanting to "disassemble" architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Tschumi, ''Architecture and Disjunction''&lt;/ref&gt; While postmodernism returned to embrace the historical references that modernism had shunned, possibly ironically, deconstructivism rejected the postmodern acceptance of such references, as well as the idea of ornament as an after-thought or decoration.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In addition to ''Oppositions'', a defining text for both deconstructivism and postmodernism was [[Robert Venturi]]'s ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' (1966). It argues against the purity, clarity and simplicity of modernism. With its publication, [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] and [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalism]], the two main branches of modernism, were overturned as paradigms. The reading of the postmodernist Venturi was that ornament and historical allusion added a richness to architecture that modernism had foregone. Some Postmodern architects endeavored to reapply ornament even to economical and minimal buildings, described by Venturi as "the decorated shed." Rationalism of design was dismissed but the functionalism of the building was still somewhat intact. This is close to the thesis of Venturi's next major work,&lt;ref&gt;Venturi, ''Learning From Las Vegas''&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and ornament can be applied to a pragmatic architecture, and instill the philosophic complexities of [[Semiotics|semiology]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The deconstructivist reading of ''Complexity and Contradiction'' is quite different. The basic building was the subject of problematics and intricacies in deconstructivism, with no detachment for ornament. Rather than separating ornament and function, like postmodernists such as Venturi, the functional aspects of buildings were called into question. Geometry was to deconstructivists what ornament was to postmodernists, the subject of complication, and this complication of geometry was in turn, applied to the functional, structural, and spatial aspects of deconstructivist buildings. One example of deconstructivist complexity is [[Frank Gehry]]'s [[Vitra Design Museum]] in Weil-am-Rhein, which takes the typical unadorned white cube of modernist [[art gallery|art galleries]] and deconstructs it, using geometries reminiscent of cubism and abstract expressionism. This subverts the functional aspects of modernist simplicity while taking modernism, particularly the international style, of which its white stucco skin is reminiscent, as a starting point. Another example of the deconstructivist reading of ''Complexity and Contradiction'' is [[Peter Eisenman]]'s [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. The Wexner Center takes the archetypal form of the [[castle]], which it then imbues with complexity in a series of cuts and fragmentations. A three-dimensional grid, runs somewhat arbitrarily through the building. The grid, as a reference to modernism, of which it is an accoutrement, collides with the medieval antiquity of a castle. Some of the grid's columns intentionally don't reach the ground, hovering over stairways creating a sense of neurotic unease and contradicting the structural purpose of the [[column]]. The Wexner Center deconstructs the archetype of the castle and renders its spaces and structure with conflict and difference.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Deconstructivist philosophy===
[[File:ImperialWarMuseumNorth01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Daniel Libeskind|Libeskind]]'s [[Imperial War Museum North]] in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]] (2002). An archetype of deconstructivist architecture, it comprises three fragmented, intersecting curved volumes, symbolizing the destruction of war.]]

Some Deconstructivist architects were influenced by the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]. Eisenman was a friend of Derrida, but even so his approach to architectural design was developed long before he became a Deconstructivist. For him Deconstructivism should be considered an extension of his interest in radical formalism. Some practitioners of deconstructivism were also influenced by the formal experimentation and geometric imbalances of Russian [[Constructivist architecture|constructivism]]. There are additional references in deconstructivism to 20th-century movements: the [[modernism]]/[[postmodernism]] interplay, [[Expressionist architecture|expressionism]], [[cubism]], [[minimalism]] and [[contemporary art]]. Deconstructivism attempts to move away from the supposedly constricting 'rules' of modernism such as "[[form follows function]]," "[[purism (arts)|purity of form]]," and "[[truth to materials]]."{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The main channel from deconstructivist philosophy to [[architectural theory]] was through the philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]]'s influence with [[Peter Eisenman]]. Eisenman drew some philosophical bases from the literary movement [[Deconstruction]], and collaborated directly with Derrida on projects including an entry for the [[Parc de la Villette]] competition, documented in ''Chora l Works''. Both Derrida and Eisenman, as well as [[Daniel Libeskind]]&lt;ref&gt;Libeskind, Daniel. [http://www.daniel-libeskind.com/projects/show-all/imperial-war-museum-north/ "Imperial War Museum North Earth Time"] quote ''"This project develops the realm of the in between, the inter-est.... Pointing to that which is absent"''. Retrieved April, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; were concerned with the "[[metaphysics of presence]]," and this is the main subject of deconstructivist philosophy in architecture theory. The presupposition is that architecture is a language capable of communicating meaning and of receiving treatments by methods of linguistic philosophy.&lt;ref name="Curl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curl|first=James Stevens|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|year=2006|type=Paperback|edition=Second|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dialectic of presence and absence, or solid and void occurs in much of Eisenman's projects, both built and unbuilt. Both Derrida and Eisenman believe that the locus, or place of presence, is architecture, and the same dialectic of presence and absence is found in construction and deconstructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman and Derrida, ''Choral Works''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Derrida, readings of texts are best carried out when working with classical narrative structures. Any architectural deconstructivism requires the existence of a particular archetypal ''con''struction, a strongly-established conventional expectation to play flexibly against.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, ''Of Grammatology''&lt;/ref&gt; The design of [[Frank Gehry]]’s own [[Santa Monica]] residence, (from 1978), has been cited as a prototypical deconstructivist building. His starting point was a prototypical suburban house embodied with a typical set of intended social meanings. Gehry altered its massing, spatial envelopes, planes and other expectations in a playful subversion, an act of "de"construction"&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, Robert (1994).[http://www.mindyourownweb.co.uk/hosted/index.php?view=mattaclarking&amp;pageid=85&amp;PHPSESSID=c5e9dc8f3f4a6cfd3bc3216856fe17d8 "Mattaclarking"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517013252/http://www.mindyourownweb.co.uk/hosted/index.php?view=mattaclarking&amp;pageid=85&amp;PHPSESSID=c5e9dc8f3f4a6cfd3bc3216856fe17d8 |date=2007-05-17 }} Dissertation Exploring the work of Gordon Matta-Clark. Retrieved April, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Derrida's concepts of the metaphysics of presence and deconstructivism, his notions of trace and erasure, embodied in his philosophy of writing and arche-writing&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, ''Of Grammatology'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; found their way into deconstructivist [[memorial]]s. Daniel Libeskind envisioned many of his early projects as a form of writing or discourse on writing and often works with a form of [[concrete poetry]]. He made architectural sculptures out of books and often coated the models in texts, openly making his architecture refer to writing. The notions of trace and erasure were taken up by Libeskind in essays and in his project for the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]]. The museum is conceived as a trace of the erasure of the [[Holocaust]], intended to make its subject legible and poignant. Memorials such as [[Maya Lin]]'s [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] and Peter Eisenman's [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]] are also said to reflect themes of trace and erasure.

===Constructivism and Russian Futurism===
Another major current in deconstructivist architecture takes inspiration from the Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] and [[Russian futurism|Futurist]] movements of the early twentieth century, both in their graphics and in their visionary architecture, little of which was actually constructed.

Artists [[Naum Gabo]], [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], and [[Alexander Rodchenko]], have influenced the graphic sense of geometric forms of deconstructivist architects such as [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]]. Both Deconstructivism and Constructivism have been concerned with the tectonics of making an abstract assemblage. Both were concerned with the radical simplicity of geometric forms as the primary artistic content, expressed in graphics, sculpture and architecture. The Constructivist tendency toward [[purism (arts)|purism]], though, is absent in Deconstructivism: form is often deformed when construction is deconstructed. Also lessened or absent is the advocacy of [[socialism|socialist]] and [[collectivism|collectivist]] causes.

The primary graphic motifs of constructivism were the rectangular bar and the triangular wedge, others were the more basic geometries of the square and the circle. In his series ''Prouns'', El Lizzitzky assembled collections of geometries at various angles floating free in space. They evoke basic structural units such as bars of steel or sawn lumber loosely attached, piled, or scattered. They were also often [[Technical drawing|drafted]] and share aspects with [[technical drawing]] and [[engineering drawing]]. Similar in composition is the deconstructivist series ''Micromegas'' by Daniel Libeskind.

{{Quotation|The symbolic breakdown of the wall effected by introducing the Constructivist motifs of tilted and crossed bars sets up a subversion of the walls that define the bar itself. ... This apparent chaos actually constructs the walls that define the bar; it is the structure. The internal disorder produces the bar while splitting it even as gashes open up along its length.|Phillip Johnson and Mark Wigley|Deconstructive Architecture|p. 34}}

===Contemporary art===
Two strains of modern art, [[minimalism]] and [[cubism]], have had an influence on deconstructivism. [[Analytical cubism]] had a sure effect on deconstructivism, as forms and content are dissected and viewed from different perspectives simultaneously. A synchronicity of disjoined space is evident in many of the works of [[Frank Gehry]] and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. [[Synthetic cubism]], with its application of [[found object]] art, is not as great an influence on deconstructivism as [[Analytical cubism]], but is still found in the earlier and more vernacular works of Frank Gehry. Deconstructivism also shares with minimalism a disconnection from cultural references. &lt;!---It also often shares with minimalism, notions of [[conceptual art]].{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} ---&gt;

With its tendency toward deformation and dislocation, there is also an aspect of [[expressionism]] and [[expressionist architecture]] associated with deconstructivism. At times deconstructivism mirrors varieties of expressionism, [[neo-expressionism]], and [[abstract expressionism]] as well. The angular forms of the Ufa Cinema Center by Coop Himmelb(l)au recall the abstract geometries of the numbered paintings of [[Franz Kline]], in their unadorned masses. The UFA Cinema Center also would make a likely setting for the angular figures depicted in urban German street scenes by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]. The work of [[Wassily Kandinsky]] also bears similarities to deconstructivist architecture. His movement into abstract expressionism and away from figurative work,&lt;ref&gt;Kandinsky, "Point and Line to Plane"&lt;/ref&gt; is in the same spirit as the deconstructivist rejection of ornament for geometries.

Several artists in the 1980s and 1990s contributed work that influenced or took part in deconstructivism. [[Maya Lin]] and [[Rachel Whiteread]] are two examples. Lin's 1982 project for the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], with its granite slabs severing the ground plane, is one. Its shard-like form and reduction of content to a minimalist text influenced deconstructivism, with its sense of fragmentation and emphasis on reading the monument. Lin also contributed work for Eisenman's Wexner Center. Rachel Whiteread's cast architectural spaces are another instance where [[contemporary art]] is confluent with architecture. ''Ghost'' (1990), an entire living space cast in plaster, solidifying the void, alludes to Derrida's notion of architectural presence. [[Gordon Matta-Clark]]'s ''Building cuts'' were deconstructed sections of buildings exhibited in art galleries.

===1988 MoMA exhibition===
[[Mark Wigley]] and [[Philip Johnson]] curated the 1988 [[Museum of Modern Art]] exhibition ''Deconstructivist architecture'', which crystallized the movement, and brought fame and notoriety to its key practitioners. The architects presented at the exhibition were [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Coop Himmelblau]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], and [[Bernard Tschumi]]. Mark Wigley wrote the accompanying essay and tried to show a common thread among the various architects whose work was usually more noted for their differences.

{{Quotation|The projects in this exhibition mark a different sensibility, one in which the dream of pure form has been disturbed.

It is the ability to disturb our thinking about form that makes these projects deconstructive.

The show examines an episode, a point of intersection between several architects where each constructs an unsettling building by exploiting the hidden potential of modernism.
|Phillip Johnson and Mark Wigley, excerpt from the MoMA ''Deconstructivist Architecture'' catalog}}

===Computer-aided design===
[[Computer aided design]] is now an essential tool in most aspects of contemporary architecture, but the particular nature of deconstructivism makes the use of computers especially pertinent. Three-dimensional modelling and animation (virtual and physical) assists in the conception of very complicated spaces, while the ability to link computer models to manufacturing jigs (CAM - [[Computer-aided manufacturing]]) allows the mass production of subtly different modular elements to be achieved at affordable costs. In retrospect many early deconstructivist works appear to have been conceived with the aid of a computer, but were not; [[Zaha Hadid]]'s sketches for instance. Also, Gehry is noted for producing many physical models as well as computer models as part of his design process. Though the computer has made the designing of complex shapes much easier, not everything that looks odd is "deconstructivist."

==Critical responses==
Since the publication of [[Kenneth Frampton]]'s ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History'' (first edition 1980) there has been a keen consciousness of the role of criticism within architectural theory. Whilst referencing Derrida as a philosophical influence, deconstructivism can also be seen as having as much a basis in [[critical theory]] as the other major offshoot of postmodernism, [[critical regionalism]]. The two aspects of critical theory, urgency and analysis, are found in deconstructivism. There is a tendency to re-examine and critique other works or precedents in deconstructivism, and also a tendency to set aesthetic issues in the foreground. An example of this is the [[Wexner Center]]. [[Critical Theory]], however, had at its core a critique of capitalism and its excess, and from that respect many of the works of the Deconstructivists would fail in that regard if only they are made for an elite and are, as objects, highly expensive, despite whatever critique they may claim to impart on the conventions of design.

The difference between criticality in deconstructivism and criticality in critical regionalism, is that critical regionalism ''reduces'' the overall level of complexity involved and maintains a clearer analysis while attempting to reconcile modernist architecture with local differences. In effect, this leads to a modernist "vernacular." Critical regionalism displays a lack of self-criticism and a [[utopia]]nism of place. Deconstructivism, meanwhile, maintains a level of self-criticism, as well as external criticism and tends towards maintaining a level of complexity. Some architects identified with the movement, notably [[Frank Gehry]], have actively rejected the classification of their work as deconstructivist.&lt;ref&gt;Said Frank Gehry of Eisenman's [[Aronoff Center]], "The best thing about Peter's buildings is the insane spaces he ends up with.... All that other stuff, the philosophy and all, is just bullshit as far as I'm concerned." Quoted in Peter Eisenman, ''Peter Eisenman: 1990-1997'', ed. Richard C. Levene and Fernando Márquez Cecilia (Madrid: El Croquis Editorial, 1997), 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of deconstructivism see it as a purely formal exercise with little social significance. [[Kenneth Frampton]] finds it "elitist and detached".&lt;ref&gt;Frampton, Kenneth. ''Modern Architecture: A Critical History''. Thames &amp; Hudson, 3rd edition, 1992, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikos Salingaros]] calls deconstructivism a "viral expression" that invades design thinking in order to build destroyed forms; while curiously similar to both Derrida's and Philip Johnson's descriptions, this is meant as a harsh condemnation of the entire movement.&lt;ref&gt;Salingaros, Nikos. "Anti-Architecture and Deconstruction", Umbau-Verlag, 3rd edition, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms are similar to those of deconstructivist philosophy—that since the act of deconstructivism is not an empirical process, it can result in whatever an architect wishes, and it thus suffers from a lack of consistency. Today there is a sense that the philosophical underpinnings of the beginning of the movement have been lost, and all that is left is the aesthetic of deconstructivism.&lt;ref&gt;Chakraborty, Judhajit; Deconstruction: From Philosophy to Design]. Arizona State University, retrieved June 2006. "Today, in the mid 90s the term 'deconstructivism' is used casually to label any work that favours complexity over simplicity and dramatises the formal possibilities of digital production."&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms reject the premise that architecture is a language capable of being the subject of linguistic philosophy, or, if it was a language in the past, critics claim it is no longer.&lt;ref name="Curl"/&gt; Others question the wisdom and impact on future generations of an architecture that rejects the past and presents no clear values as replacements and which often pursues strategies that are intentionally aggressive to human senses.&lt;ref name="Curl"/&gt;

'''Eflatun Pınar''' ({{lang-tr|Eflatunpınar}}, "Plato's Spring") is the name given to a spring, which rises up from the ground, and the stone-built pool monument built at the time of the [[Hittite Empire]]. The spring lies inside the [[Lake Beyşehir National Park]], {{convert|85|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Konya]], and drains into [[Lake Beyşehir]] in central [[Anatolia]] at ancient [[Pisidia]] region. During the [[Late Bronze Age]], a sacred pool monument was built here in [[trachyte]] ashlar masonry dedicated to the sacred spring cult of ancient [[Hittites|Hittite]]s. The monument was interpreted as a shrine to [[Plato]] during the medieval (Seljuk) period.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Overview==
Eflatun Pınar's location near the lake shore corresponds to an almost exact level with other important ruins on the opposite shore, those of [[Kubadabad Palace]], which were built by [[Seljuk Sultanate of Anatolia|Seljuk]]s.

Eflatun Pınar was briefly examined by the [[University of Oxford]] archaeologist Dr. Lucia Nixon in her paper on [[Çatalhöyük]], and she makes use of [[F.W.Hasluck]]'s early-20th century work. The site remains largely unexplored to date.

'''FRIKAR dance company''' (established May 2006 by Hallgrim Hansegård) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] dance company for contemporary and traditional dance specializing in the connection between dance and nature.

==History==
'''FRIKAR dance company''' was founded by choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård in 2006, and has toured 29 countries all over the world. The company is described by National Geographic as "wildly inventive" and is composed by 32 artists from 4 continents (India, Iran, Somalia, Brazil, Cape Verde, France, Sweden, Norway.) The artists from very diverse genres meet each other in the research of gravity and human nature.

With a background in Norwegian traditional dance choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård founded FRIKAR dance company to give acrobatic dancers living in Norway a creative environment. Together with the dancers he has been developing a new choreographical style for contemporary dance called "Down2Earth" including [[Hallingdans]]  [[Capoeira]] and [[break dance]]. He works in the formats of aerial dance, site specific ecosophical stage arts, indoor dance and interdiciplinary arts.

Hansegård made his international breakthrough with an animation film at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2003 (Tarantrance). In 2005 he won 3rd prize at Superdok. In 2007 he was awarded "Artist of the Year" at The Norwegian Folk Music Awards. In 2009 he won the "Award for best choreography" at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], among 43 countries in the most seen entertainment TV program in the world.

In 2010 he premiered "Jamsiis" at Bergen International Festival [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHSLBUOm9nc Youtube: Jamsiis]. This was a highly personal contribution to the Nordic contemporary dance scene, based on his roots in traditional dances. Jamsiis opened up a public discussion about the boundaries of contemporary dance in Norway. NRK (the Norwegian Broadcasting) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;JAMSIIS, Hallgrim Hansegårds new production, is the most exciting I have seen here. It’s very exciting to see traditional dance in dialogue with contemporary dance. Hansegård is branching out and opening up new territory here. He has come down a path that I think is very important to go. That Hansegård is a dancer with strong will to do his own thing and blessedly uninhibited as far as exceeding boundaries is concerned is something the Norwegian dance community should be happy about… At the same time that he approaches contemporary dance, he opens doors. If he succeeds in making contemporary dance accessible to a wider audience than today’s, the genre of contemporary dance should learn to endure a ‘halling-roundkick’ or two.&lt;ref&gt;Dance critic Karen Frøsland Nystøyl, NRK kulturnytt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009 Hansegård directed TidarÅ, an outdoor full night dance performance under a waterfall with 22 dancers and musicians from FRIKAR dance company. The production collected contemporary and traditional dancers in a research for a unique contemporary dance technique. "Tidarå" is part of FRIKARs ecosophical productions. Hansegård directed also Yr in 2009 together with violin virtous Ragnhild Hemsing, premiere at the [[Bergen International Festival]].

In 2008 FRIKAR was censored by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Naples]] for his non conventional interpretation of Peer Gynt, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsip8vvC7gY NRK: Bukkerittet]. In the years 2005 to 2007 Hansegård directed "Undergrunnsfargo", "Isolations", "Laus", "Kruk", "The snuff grinders" and "Bastard".

He also participated in ''[[Dansefeber]]'', the Norwegian version of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'', in 2006.&lt;ref name=hvem&gt;{{cite book |title=Hvem er hvem? |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2008 |editor=Knut Olav Åmås |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-03-23561-0 |language=Norwegian |page=211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, his dancing was digitalized for the [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) [[Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kul_und/spill/article2351271.ece|title=Et kast for Conan|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=6 April 2008|first=Per Kristian|last=Bjørkeng|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dans, estetikk og samfunn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dans, estetikk og samfunn? |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2010 |editor=Heidi Haraldsen |publisher=Tell Forlag |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-7522-351-5 |language=Norwegian |pages=10, 25, 26, 51, 52, 57, 58.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hargeysa International Book Fair''' ('''HIBF''') ({{lang-so|Bandhigga Caalamiga ah ee Buugaagta Hargeysa}}) is an annual cultural event in the northwestern [[Somaliland]] region of [[Somalia]]. It is one of the largest public [[book fair]]s in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Every summer, HIBF brings writers, poets, artists and thinkers from Somaliland and from all over the world gather to share and discuss their art and literary productions with a wider audience. The main goal of the festival is to promote a culture of reading and writing in the region by producing and publishing high quality [[Somali literature]] and translating international classical literature (including fiction, poetry and drama) into Somali. Organized by the Redsea Online Culture Foundation, the event aims to enable young people to access a range of cultural heritages, with the intention of stimulating the revival of all forms of art and human expression, including painting, poetry reciting, story-telling, drama composition and writing.

==History==
===Origins===
The Hargeysa International Book Fair was inaugurated in 2008 by [[Jama Musse Jama]], who serves as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement: 2010 Hargeysa International Book Fair (HIBF) 23rd of July to the 27th of July 2010 in Hargeysa|url=http://www.baadiya.com/View.aspx?ID=403|publisher=Baadiya|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew from 200 to 10,000 participants over the following six years.

===Significance===
HIBF targets not only a young audience, but wider sectors of society. It aims to help foster cultural understanding, tolerance, democracy, and an appreciation of the diversity of Somali culture and literature. In the past few years, the Redsea Online Culture Foundation's festivals have served to raise the profile of reading and writing in the Somaliland region, and also unite youth from different provinces in the area. The main goal of the book fair is to promote critically thinking cultural and creative writing, to facilitate the habit of reading, to display books, from both local and writers abroad, to encourage members in the public to browse, read, engage with authors, serve as an inspiration to young people, and the wider society.

===Parallel events and joint ventures===
''Somaliland Moving Library'': The Moving Library Tour is the Book Fair's flagship outreach event. An exciting initiative, it takes place a week before the opening of the festival in Hargeisa and is held across all regions of Somaliland. It aims to bring the ethos and principles of the Book Fair – of citizenship and creative freedoms – closer to aspiring writers and readers outside of the city.

The pseudo [[advertising]] campaign also examines our collective desire and expectation, that there is always room for improvement, and our doubts as to whether we are ever good enough, or have enough.&lt;ref name=PBS_20071113&gt;{{cite news| last = Wenner| first = Melinda| title = Art Tackles Big Pharma: A Few Creative-types Raise Awareness About Disease-Mongering | publisher = [[Wired Science]] | date = 2007-11-13 | url = https://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/story/81-art_tackles_big_pharma.html| accessdate = 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC_20071113&gt;{{cite news | last = Palan| first = Simon| title = Spoof drug exposes big pharma's 'disease mongering'| publisher = [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]| date = 2007-10-30| url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/30/2074586.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper stated she intended the exhibit to be humorous, but subtle. The campaign recreates the entire drug marketing process. It starts from the invention of a new disorder to the branding process of naming the drug, its pill and logo design, and promotional merchandise. The campaign was on display at the [[Daneyal Mahmood Art Gallery]] in [[New York City]] from February 8 to March 17, 2007 and included TV, print and billboard ads along with merchandise and branding material.&lt;ref name=Artinfo_20070226&gt;{{cite news | title = "Havidol" at NY's Daneyal Mahmood| publisher = Artinfo | date = 2007-02-26 | url = http://www.artinfo.com/articles/story/24396/havidol-at-nys-daneyal-mahmood| accessdate = 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooper had the initial idea while waiting for a flight at the [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. She viewed her first [[direct-to-consumer advertising|direct-to-consumer]] (DTC) pharmaceutical advertisements, promoting drugs for [[allergy|allergies]], [[insomnia]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[erectile dysfunction]], while watching the news on TV. DTC advertising is only allowed in the United States and New Zealand. She received funding from the [[Australia Council for the Arts]], the Greenwall Foundation in New York, and the [[New York State Council on the Arts]].&lt;ref name=PharmExec_20071015&gt;{{cite web| last = Donahue| first = Marylyn (Special Projects Editor)| title = When Branding Is Art| publisher = PharmExec.org| date = 2007-10-15| url = http://pharmexec.findpharma.com/pharmexec/Supplements/When-Branding-Is-Art/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/465558?contextCategoryId=43508| accessdate = 2008-01-06| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002949/http://pharmexec.findpharma.com/pharmexec/Supplements/When-Branding-Is-Art/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/465558?contextCategoryId=43508| archivedate = 2011-07-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Walrus - WGA07101.jpg|thumb|340px|''Head of a Walrus'', 1521. Pen drawing in Indian ink and watercolor on paper]]

'''''Head of a Walrus''''' (German: '''''Kopf eines Walrosses''''') is a 1521 pen [[drawing]] and [[watercolour]] by the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]]. At the time the [[walrus]]' main European population was around Scandinavia, and they were exotic to inland Europeans. As such the work reflects Dürer fascination with what he perceived as unusual animals, with similarly intentioned works including depictions of lions and [[Dürer's Rhinoceros|rhinoceros]].  The drawing created as part of a larger series of 167 drawings of [[quadruped]]s.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt; 

The drawing is generally considered as not successful;&lt;ref name="b90"&gt;Berger (1996), 90&lt;/ref&gt; and is viewed as curious attempted depiction that is neither aesthetically pleasing nor anatomically true to life. Art historians assume the artist drew it from memory having viewed a dead example during a 1520 visit to [[Zeeland]] to see a stranded [[whale]] which had decomposed before his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Stanska, Zuzanna. "[http://www.dailyartmagazine.com/images-durers-animals/ Images Of Dürer’s Animals That Are Better Than A Trip To The Zoo]". ''DailyArt Magazine'', 21  July 2016. Retrieved 22 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the depiction departure for nature, Durer's animal has been described as "amusing...it looks more like a hairless puppy with tusks. When Dürer drew from life his accuracy was unquestionable, but he had only briefly seen a walrus, and had only fleeting memory and an elaborate verbal description from which to reconstruct the image".&lt;ref&gt;Crowe; Laseau (1986), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawing is inscribed with the words "1521 / Das dosig thÿr van dem jch do das hawbt / contrefett hab ist gefangen worden / jn die niderlendischen see vnd / was XII ellen lang / brawendisch mit für fusse", which were for many years loosely translated to English as "1521, That stupid (or dozy) animal of which I have portrayed the head was caught in the Netherlands sea and was twelve brabant ells long with four feet", although the interpretation of "dosig thÿr" as ''stupid'' or ''dozy'' is no longer necessarily held, and it may have that the text instead should be inferred as "dasig" or "hiesig", as in "represented here".&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;

The original is in the [[British Museum]], London.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;"[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=720549&amp;partId=1&amp;images=true The Head of a Walrus]". [[British Museum]]. Retrieved 22 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The "AD" monograph and dating are later additions by another artist.&lt;ref name="b90" /&gt;

'''''Home of the Brave''''' is a 1949 [[war film]] based on a 1946 play by [[Arthur Laurents]]. It was directed by [[Mark Robson]], and stars [[Douglas Dick]], [[Jeff Corey]], [[Lloyd Bridges]], [[Frank Lovejoy]], [[James Edwards (actor)|James Edwards]], and [[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]]. The original play featured the [[protagonist]] being Jewish, rather than black.

The [[National Board of Review Awards 1949|National Board of Review]] named the film the eighth best of 1949.

''Home of the Brave'' utilizes the recurrent theme of a diverse group of men being subjected to the horror of war and their individual reactions, in this case, to the hell of jungle combat against the Japanese in World War II.

==Plot==
Undergoing [[psychoanalysis]] by an Army [[psychiatrist]] (Corey), paralyzed Black war veteran Private Peter Moss (Edwards) begins to walk again only when he confronts his fear of forever being an "outsider".

The film uses [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] techniques to show Moss, an [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer]] [[topography]] specialist assigned to a [[reconnaissance]] [[patrol]] who are [[clandestine operation|clandestinely]] landed from a [[PT boat]] on a Japanese-held island in the South Pacific to prepare the island for a major [[amphibious landing]]. The patrol is led by a young major (Dick), and includes Moss's lifelong white friend Finch (Bridges), whose death leaves him racked with guilt; redneck-bigot corporal T.J. (Brodie); and sturdy, but troubled, Sergeant Mingo (Lovejoy).

When the patrol is discovered, Finch is left behind, and captured by the Japanese, who force him to cry out to the patrol. The dying Finch escapes, and dies in Moss's arms. In a [[Battle|firefight]] with the Japanese, Mingo is wounded in the arm, and Moss is unable to walk. T.J. carries Moss to the returning PT boat that covers the men with its twin .50 calibre machine guns.

In the film's crucial scene, the doctor forces Moss to overcome his paralysis by yelling a racial slur. From this point on, Moss will never again kowtow to prejudice. Mingo and Moss decide to go into business together.

==Production==
[[Arthur Laurents]] spent World War II with the Army Pictorial Service based at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios|film studio]] in [[Astoria, Queens]], and rose to the rank of sergeant. After his discharge, he wrote a play called ''Home of the Brave'' in nine consecutive nights that was inspired by a photograph of [[GI (military)|GIs]] in a [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South Pacific]] [[jungle]]. The drama about [[anti-Semitism]] in the military opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on December 27, 1945, and ran for 69 performances.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 41-49 Laurents, Arthur, ''Original Story By''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

When Laurents sold the rights to Hollywood, he was told that the lead character would be turned from Jewish into black because "Jews have been done".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/aug/01/arthur-laurents-musicals-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

Producer [[Stanley Kramer]] filmed in secrecy under the [[working title]] of ''High Noon''. The film was completed in thirty days, for the cost of US$525,000, with Kramer using three different units at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;p. 22 Deane, Pamala S. ''James Edwards: African American Hollywood Icon'' 2009 McFarland&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the film was made on indoor sets, except for the climax that took place on [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] beach with a former navy PT boat. Associate Producer [[Robert Stillman]] financed the film with the help of his father, without the usual procedure of borrowing funds from banks.&lt;ref&gt;p. 463 Gevinson, Alan ''The American Film Institute Catalog'' 1997 University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;

''Home of the Brave'' managed to combine three of the top [[film genre]]s of 1949: the [[war film]], the psychological drama, and the problems of African-Americans.

Director Robson, who had begun his directing career with several [[Val Lewton]] [[RKO]] [[horror films]], brings a frighting feeling to the claustrophobic [[jungle]] set, with Dimitri Tiomkin providing an eerie choral rendition of ''[[Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child]]'' performed by the [[Jester Hairston]] choir as the patrol escapes their Japanese pursuers.

In the movie's final scene, Sergeant Mingo recites [[Eve Merriam]]'s 1943 poem ''The Coward'' to Private Moss in friendship: "Divided we fall, united we stand; coward, take my coward's hand." The ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' reported that a man named Herbert Tweedy imitated the sound of twelve different birds native to the South Pacific for the film.&lt;ref&gt;p. 23 Deane, Pamala S.

==Reception==

{{Empty section|date=January 2018}}

==Accolades==
The film gained the prize of the [[International Catholic Organization for Cinema]] (OCIC) at the  [[ Knokke Experimental Film Festival]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;"Get Belgium Oscars", p.10, in ''Showmen's Trade Review'', July 16, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; According to this jury, this was a film "most capable of contributing to the revival of moral and spiritual values of humanity". "We all know the definition of this award "for the production that has made the greatest contribution to the moral and spiritual betterment of humanity". it differs from the other awards, when are normally given for artistic merit. Art for Art's sake is not the object, but rather art for the sake of man, the whole of man, heart and soul. Pious dullness is not the aim (...).&lt;ref&gt;Johanes, "The Venice Film Festival", p.33, in ''International Film Review'', Brussels, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In a topical decision, President [[Harry S.Truman|Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9981]] had ordered the U.S. Armed Forces to be fully integrated in 1948.

'''Hugh Hope''' (1782–1822) was a [[civil servant]] for the [[East India Company]] and the third son of [[Sir Archibald Hope, 9th Baronet]] [[Hope Baronets#Hope baronets, of Craighall (1628)|Hope of Craighall]].  A portrait of Hugh Hope, painted by [[Sir Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823), currently hangs in [[The Cleveland Museum of Art]].

==Painting by Raeburn==
Commissioned by the subject's family, Sir Henry Raeburn painted his portrait of Hugh Hope around 1810.&lt;ref name="The Cleveland Museum of Art" /&gt;

An 1889 Scottish Art Review&lt;ref name="Scottish Art Review - Pinkie House" /&gt; described the painting as follows:

:''To our left of the portrait of Sir Thomas Hope hangs another admirable family picture, which indeed may rank as the most accomplished piece of art that Pinkie contains.  This is a bust portrait of Hugh Hope (b. 1782, d. 1822), of the East India Company's Service, second son of the ninth Baronet, by his second wife.  It is the work of Raeburn, and a masterly example of that painter, showing - in every touch that expresses the fair hair, the blue eyes, the full, fresh-coloured face and in the details of the crisp white ruffles, the dark brown coat, the yellow vest - that easy power of swift, unlaboured, expressive brush-work, for which Sir Henry is unrivalled among Scottish painters.''

The painting hung for over a hundred years at [[Pinkie House]],&lt;ref name="Scottish Art Review - Pinkie House"&gt;{{cite web|author1=E.

==Formation==
The society was initially incorporated as The Exhibition of International Art Ltd., but soon changed its name to the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. The prospectus issued by the new society read in part:&lt;ref name=post&gt;Quoted in ''The Morning Post'', 9 February 1898; cited by: Philip Athill (January 1985).

[[File:3D shapes in isometric projection.svg|thumb|Some 3D shapes are using the isometric drawing method. The black dimensions are the true lengths as found in an orthographic projection.  The red dimensions are used when drawing with the isometric drawing method. The same 3D shapes drawn in isometric projection would appear smaller; an isometric projection will show the object's sides foreshortened, by approximately 80%.]]
'''Isometric projection''' is a method for visually representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions in [[technical drawing|technical]] and [[engineering drawing]]s. It is an [[axonometric projection]] in which the three [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate axes]] appear equally foreshortened and the angle between any two of them is 120 degrees.

== Overview ==
{{double image|left|Perspective isometrique cube gris.svg|100|Isometric camera location 35.264 degrees color.png|100|Isometric drawing of a cube|Camera rotations needed to achieve this perspective||}}
The  term "isometric" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] for "equal measure", reflecting that the [[scale (measurement)|scale]] along each axis of the projection is the same (unlike some other forms of [[graphical projection]]).

An isometric view of an object can be obtained by choosing the viewing direction such that the angles between the projections of the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' [[coordinate axis|axes]] are all the same, or 120°. For example, with a cube, this is done by first looking straight towards one face. Next, the cube is rotated ±45° about the vertical axis, followed by a rotation of approximately 35.264° (precisely arcsin {{frac|1|{{sqrt|3}}}} or arctan {{frac|1|{{sqrt|2}}}}, which is related to the [[Magic angle]]) about the horizontal axis. Note that with the cube (see image) the perimeter of the resulting 2D drawing is a perfect regular hexagon: all the black lines have equal length and all the cube's faces are the same area. Isometric [[graph paper]] can be placed under a normal piece of drawing paper to help achieve the effect without calculation.

In a similar way, an ''isometric view'' can be obtained in a 3D scene. Starting with the camera aligned parallel to the floor and aligned to the coordinate axes, it is first rotated vertically (around the horizontal axis) by about 35.264° as above, then ±45° around the vertical axis.

Another way isometric projection can be visualized is by considering a view within a cubical room starting in an upper corner and looking towards the opposite, lower corner. The ''x''-axis extends diagonally down and right, the ''y''-axis extends diagonally down and left, and the ''z''-axis is straight up. Depth is also shown by height on the image. Lines drawn along the axes are at 120° to one another.

The term "isometric" is often mistakenly used to refer to [[axonometric projection]]s, generally. There are, however, actually three types of axonometric projections: ''isometric'', ''[[Dimetric projection|dimetric]]'' and ''[[Trimetric projection|trimetric]]''.

==Rotation angles==
From the two angles needed for an isometric projection, the value of the second may seem counterintuitive and deserves some further explanation. Let’s first imagine a cube with sides of length 2, and its center positioned at the axis origin. We can calculate the length of the line from its center to the middle of any edge as {{sqrt|2}} using [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagoras' theorem]] . By rotating the cube by 45° on the ''x''-axis, the point (1, 1, 1) will therefore become (1, 0, {{sqrt|2}}) as depicted in the diagram. The second rotation aims to bring the same point on the positive ''z''-axis and so needs to perform a rotation of value equal to the [[arctangent]] of {{frac|{{sqrt|2}}}} which is approximately  35.264°.

==Mathematics==
There are eight different orientations to obtain an isometric view, depending into which [[octant (solid geometry)|octant]] the viewer looks. The isometric transform from a point ''a''{{sub|''x'',''y'',''z''}} in 3D space to a point ''b''{{sub|''x'',''y''}} in 2D space looking into the first octant can be written mathematically with [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
   \mathbf{c}_x \\
   \mathbf{c}_y \\
   \mathbf{c}_z \\
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
   0 &amp; {\cos\alpha} &amp; {\sin\alpha}  \\
   0 &amp; { - \sin\alpha} &amp; {\cos\alpha}  \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
   {\cos\beta } &amp; 0 &amp; { - \sin\beta }  \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\
   {\sin\beta } &amp; 0 &amp; {\cos\beta }  \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
   \mathbf{a}_x \\
   \mathbf{a}_y \\
   \mathbf{a}_z \\
\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\begin{bmatrix}
   \sqrt{3} &amp; 0 &amp; -\sqrt{3}  \\
   1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1  \\
   \sqrt{2} &amp; -\sqrt{2} &amp; \sqrt{2}  \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
   \mathbf{a}_x \\
   \mathbf{a}_y \\
   \mathbf{a}_z \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' = arcsin(tan 30°) ≈ 35.264° and ''β'' = 45°. As explained above, this is a rotation around the vertical (here ''y'') axis by ''β'', followed by a rotation around the horizontal (here ''x'') axis by ''α''. This is then followed by an orthographic projection to the ''xy''-plane:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
   \mathbf{b}_x \\
   \mathbf{b}_y \\
   0 \\
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0  \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0  \\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
   \mathbf{c}_x \\
   \mathbf{c}_y \\
   \mathbf{c}_z \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The other 7 possibilities are obtained by either rotating to the opposite sides or not, and then inverting the view direction or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

First formalized by Professor [[William Farish (professor)|William Farish]] (1759–1837), the concept of [[isometry]] had existed in a rough empirical form for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Barclay G. Jones (1986). ''Protecting historic architecture and museum collections from natural disasters''. University of Michigan. {{ISBN|0-409-90035-4}}. p.243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Edmund Moorhouse (1974). ''Visual messages: graphic communication for senior students''.&lt;/ref&gt; From the middle of the 19th century, isometry became an "invaluable tool for engineers, and soon thereafter axonometry and isometry were incorporated in the curriculum of architectural training courses in Europe and the U.S."&lt;ref name="Kri96"&gt;J. Krikke (1996). "[http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn9/eastasia/krikke.html A Chinese perspective for cyberspace?]". In: ''International Institute for Asian Studies Newsletter'', 9, Summer 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jan Krikke (2000)&lt;ref name="Kri00"&gt;Jan Krikke (2000). "Axonometry: a matter of perspective". In: ''Computer Graphics and Applications, IEEE'' Jul/Aug 2000. Vol 20 (4), pp. 7–11.&lt;/ref&gt; however, "axonometry originated in [[China]]. Its function in Chinese art was similar to [[linear perspective]] in European art. Axonometry, and the pictorial grammar that goes with it, has taken on a new significance with the advent of visual computing".&lt;ref name="Kri00"/&gt;

As with all types of [[parallel projection]], objects drawn with isometric projection do not appear larger or smaller as they extend closer to or away from the viewer. While advantageous for [[architectural drawing]]s where measurements need to be taken directly, the result is a perceived distortion, as unlike [[perspective projection]], it is not how [[human vision]] or [[photography]] normally work. It also can easily result in situations where depth and altitude are difficult to gauge, as is shown in the illustration to the right. This can appear to create paradoxical or [[Impossible object|impossible shapes]], such as the [[Penrose stairs]].

==Usage in video games and pixel art==
{{main|Isometric computer graphics}}
Isometric graphics were regularly used in video games during the 1980s and 1990s, as the technique provided a limited 3D effect that could be achieved with the constrained resources of [[microcomputer]]s of the era. The style is also used for [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s and [[pixel art]], achieving a characteristic style still used in [[retrogaming]].

[[File:Folio from a Koran (8th-9th century).jpg|300px|thumbnail|Kufic script, 8th or 9th century (Surah 48: 27–28) [[Qur'an]].]]
'''Kufic''' is the oldest [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphic]] form of the various [[Arabic script]]s and consists of a modified form of the old [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean script]]. Kufic developed around the end of the 7th century in [[Kufa]], Iraq, from which it takes its name, and other centres.&lt;ref name=brmu&gt;{{cite web|title=Arabic scripts|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/museum_and_exhibition/arabic_script/arabic_scripts.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
[[File:Quran Kufic script.jpg|thumbnail|Kufic script used in a copy of the [[Qur'an]]]]
Kufic was prevalent in manuscripts from the 7th to 10th centuries.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Until about the 11th century it was the main script used to copy the Qur'an.&lt;ref name=brmu/&gt; Professional copyists employed a particular form of kufic for reproducing the earliest surviving copies of the Qur'an, which were written on parchment and date from the 8th to 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spirit of Islam: Experiencing Islam through Calligraphy|url=http://www.moa.ubc.ca/spiritofislam/unity/kufic.html|publisher=UBC Museum of Anthropology|accessdate=13 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021108152157/http://www.moa.ubc.ca/spiritofislam/unity/kufic.html|archivedate=8 November 2002|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ornamental use===
Kufic is commonly seen on [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] coins and monuments and on early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] coins.  Its decorative character led to its use as a decorative element in several public and domestic buildings constructed prior to the [[History of the Republic of Turkey|Republican period]] in [[Turkey]].

The current [[flag of Iraq]] (2008) includes a kufic rendition of the [[takbir]].
Similarly, the [[flag of Iran]] (1980) has the takbir  written in white square kufic script a total of 22 times on the fringe of both the green and red bands.

Square or geometric Kufic is a very simplified rectangular style of Kufic widely used for tiling. In Iran sometimes entire buildings are covered with tiles spelling sacred names like those of God, Muhammad and Ali in square Kufic, a technique known as ''[[banna'i]]''.&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan M. Bloom|author2=Sheila Blair|title=The Grove encyclopedia of Islamic art and architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=101, 131, 246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Pseudo-Kufic]]", also "Kufesque",{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} refers to imitations of the Kufic script, made in a non-Arabic context, during the [[Middle Ages]] or the [[Renaissance]]: "Imitations of Arabic in European art are often described as pseudo-Kufic, borrowing the term for an Arabic script that emphasizes straight and angular strokes, and is most commonly used in Islamic architectural decoration".&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the statue was completed on 22 September 1967 by Albert Mangonès.&lt;ref name="Alphonse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/105176/Le-Marron-inconnu-vandalise-et-la-flamme-eternelle-eteinte |title=Le Marron inconnu vandalisé et la flamme éternelle éteinte |editor=Alphonse, Roberson |date=15 May 2012 |work=Le Nouvelliste |accessdate=9 March 2016}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures at 3.60 metres long by 2.40 metres high.&lt;ref name="ISSUU"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://issuu.com/crrf-fcrr/docs/directions_vol_4_no_1 |title=Le Marron Inconnu (The Unknown Runaway Slave) |editor=Lorraine, Mangones |page=62 |work=Directions |volume=4| issue =  1 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bust depicts a bronze near-naked fugitive, kneeling on one knee, torso arched, opposite leg stretched back, a broken chain at its left ankle, while holding a [[conch|conch shell]] at its lips with its left hand, head tilted upward, while the other hand holds a [[machete]] at the ground to its right ankle.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RUuiYOx5yIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Fault Lines: Views across Haiti’s Divide |editor=Bell, Beverly |page=32 |year=2013 |isbn=9780801452123 |accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mukherjee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-joia-mukherjee/history-may-be-haitis-gre_b_440883.html |title=History May Be Haiti’s Greatest Resource |editor=Mukherjee, Jola Dr|date=20 March 2010 |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISSUU"/&gt;

Mangonès chose to use a passage from [[1 Maccabees]] 14:3-9 of the [[Jerusalem Bible]] in the background of his sculpture on one of the two concrete panels that protect the "eternal flame" of freedom on the square surrounding the statue set in [[copper]] letters.&lt;ref name="ISSUU"/&gt;

In 1989, the [[United Nations]] adopted the statue as a central icon on [[postage stamp]]s commemorating [[Human rights#Freedom from slavery|Article 4]] of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] that states, "No one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms."&lt;ref name="CNMHE"&gt;[http://www.esclavage-memoire.com/lieux-de-memoire/statue-du-marron-inconnu-27.html Comité National Pour La Mémoire et l'Histoire de l'Esclavage - Statue du Marron Inconnu] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="LA Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/ United Nations - The Universal Declaration of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/132915/Le-Marron-Inconnu-dAlbert-Mangones |title=Le Marron Inconnu d'Albert Mangonès |editor=Mangonès, Fréderick |date=8 July 2014 |work=Le Nouvelliste |accessdate=9 March 2016}} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Les Grandes Baigneuses''''', or '''''The Large Bathers''''', is a painting by [[Auguste Renoir]] made between 1884 and 1887. The painting is in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-large-bathers/2wE1mqTuUoBmtA?hl=en|title=The Large Bathers - Pierre-Auguste Renoir, French, 1841 - 1919 - Google Cultural Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/59196.html|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Collections Object : The Large Bathers|author=Philadelphia Museum of Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a scene of nude women bathing. In the foreground, two women are seated beside the water, and a third is standing in the water near them. In the background, two others are bathing. The one standing in the water in the foreground appears to be about to splash one of the women seated on the shore with water. That woman leans back to avoid the expected splash of water. 

The figures have a sculptural quality, while the landscape behind them shimmers with impressionistic light. With this new style, Renoir's intention was to reconcile the modern forms of painting with the painting traditions of the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly those of [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] and [[Raphael]]. Renoir also admired [[Rubens]] and [[Titian]]'s works, and he tried to find a compromise between the styles of these old masters and the new [[Impressionism|impressionist style]].

==Painting==
It is inspired at least in part by a sculpture by [[François Girardon]], ''The Bath of the Nymphs'' (1672), a low lead relief realized for a fountain park of Versailles. It also reflects the influence of the works of Ingres, and particularly the frescoes of Raphael, whose style he had absorbed during his trip to Italy. These two great artists influenced Renoir's entire way of painting and drawing: he began to paint in a more disciplined and more conventional manner, gave up painting outdoors, and made the female nude&amp;nbsp;– until then only an occasional subject– his main focus.

Renoir worked on ''The Bathers'' for three years until he was content with its [[composition (visual arts)|composition]]. During that time, he made numerous studies and sketches, including at least two full-sized figure drawings of the theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/65814|title=Splashing Figure (Study for "The Large Bathers") - The Art Institute of Chicago|publisher=[[The Art Institute of Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bathers'' may also be regarded as Renoir's pictorial testament. The models for the three bathers included two of his favorites: [[Aline Charigot]], the blonde sitting behind, whom Renoir married in 1890, and [[Suzanne Valadon]], herself a painter and the mother of [[Maurice Utrillo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=DS19551105-02.2.17 |title=Maurice Utrillo, Famous Artist, Taken by Death |location=Dax, France |newspaper=[[The Desert Sun]] |number=33 |date=5 November 1955 |page=1 |edition=02 |accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After completing ''The Large Bathers'', Renoir received severe criticism because of his new style. Tired and disillusioned, he never again created paintings of this caliber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/becoming-modern/avant-garde-france/impressionism/v/pierre-auguste-renoir-the-large-bathers-1884-87|title=Renoir, The Large Bathers|work=Khan Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/r/renoir/3/3renoi27.html|title=Large Bathers (Les Grandes Baigneuses) by RENOIR, Pierre-Auguste|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artble.com/artists/pierre-auguste_renoir|title=Pierre-Auguste Renoir|work=Artble}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar subject later appeared in [[The Bathers (Cézanne)|a series of paintings]] by [[Paul Cezanne]].

{{Culture of New Zealand}}

'''New Zealand art''' consists of the [[visual arts|visual]] and [[plastic arts]] (including architecture, woodwork, textiles, and ceramics) originating from [[New Zealand]]. It comes from different traditions: indigenous [[Māori art]], that of the early European (or [[Pākehā]]) settlers, and later immigrants from Pacific, Asian, and European countries. Owing to New Zealand's geographic isolation, in the past many artists had to leave home in order to make a living. The visual arts flourished in the latter decades of the 20th century as many [[New Zealanders]] became more culturally sophisticated.

==Prehistoric art==
[[File:Opihi rock drawing2.jpeg|thumb|Charcoal rock drawing at Carters rockpool on the Opihi River]]
Charcoal drawings can be found on limestone rock shelters in the centre of the South Island, with over 500 sites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.net.nz/index/museum-new-zealand/maori-cave-art/maori-cave-art.htm|title=Very Old Maori Rock Drawings|publisher=Natural Heritage Collection|accessdate=2009-02-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224214113/http://nhc.net.nz/index/museum-new-zealand/maori-cave-art/maori-cave-art.htm|archivedate=2009-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stretching from [[Kaikoura]] to [[North Otago]]. The drawings are estimated to be between 500 and 800 years old, and portray animals, people and fantastic creatures, possibly stylised reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoria.ac.nz/SRARNZ/logo.html|title=The SRARNZ Logo|publisher=Society for Research on Amphibians and Reptiles in New Zealand|accessdate=2009-02-15}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the birds pictured are extinct, including [[moa]] and [[Haast's eagle]]s. They were drawn by early Māori, but by the time Europeans arrived, local inhabitants did not know the origins of the drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Big Picture: A history of New Zealand art from 1642 | last=Keith | first=Hamish|isbn=978-1-86962-132-2|year=2007|pages=11–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KupeWheke.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Late twentieth century carved house post depicting the navigator [[Kupe]]. Although in an essentially traditional style, this carving was created using metal tools and uses modern paints, creating a form distinct from that of pre-European times.]]{{Further|Māori culture}}
Māori visual art consists primarily of four forms: carving, tattooing (''[[ta moko]]''), weaving, and painting. It was rare for any of these to be purely decorative; traditional Māori art was highly spiritual and in a pre-literate society conveyed information about spiritual matters, ancestry, and other culturally important topics. The creation of art was governed by the rules of [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]]. Styles varied from region to region: the style now sometimes seen as 'typical' in fact originates from [[Te Arawa]], who maintained a strong continuity in their artistic traditions thanks partly to early engagement with the tourist industry. Most traditional Māori art was highly stylised and featured motifs such as the spiral, the [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] and the [[koru]]. The colours black, white and red dominated.

===Carving===
{{Main|Whakairo}}
Carving was done in three media: wood, bone, and stone. Arguably ta moko was another form of carving. Wood carvings were used to decorate houses, fencepoles, containers, [[taiaha]] and other objects. The most popular type of stone used in carving was [[pounamu]] (greenstone), a form of [[jade]], but other kinds were also used, especially in the [[North Island]], where pounamu was not widely available. Both stone and bone were used to create jewellery such as the [[hei-tiki]]. Large scale stone face carvings were also sometimes created. The introduction of metal tools by Europeans allowed more intricacy and delicacy, and caused stone and bone fish hooks and other tools to become purely decorative. Carving is traditionally a tapu activity performed by men only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10759246 |title=Janet McAllister: Sacred practice of creating art |work=nzherald.co.nz |accessdate=16 October 2011 |date=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ta moko===
{{Main|Ta moko}}
Ta moko is the art of traditional Māori [[tattooing]], done with a chisel. Men were tattooed on many parts of their bodies, including faces, buttocks and thighs. Women were usually tattooed only on the lips and chin. Moko conveyed a person's ancestry. The art declined in the 19th century following the introduction of Christianity, but in recent decades has undergone a revival. Although modern moko are in traditional styles, most are carried out using modern equipment. Body parts such as the arms, legs and back are popular locations for modern moko, although some are still on the face.

===Weaving===
{{Main|Māori traditional textiles}}
Weaving was used to create numerous things, including wall panels in meeting houses and other important buildings, as well as clothing and bags (kete). While many of these were purely functional, others were true works of art taking hundreds of hours to complete, and often given as gifts to important people. Cloaks in particular could be decorated with feathers and were the mark of an important chief. In pre-European times the main medium for weaving was flax, but following the arrival of Europeans cotton, wool and other textiles were also used, especially in clothing. The extinction and endangerment of many New Zealand birds has made the feather cloak a more difficult item to produce. Weaving was primarily done by women.

===Painting===
Although the oldest forms of Māori art are rock paintings, in 'classical' Māori art, painting was not an important art form. It was mainly used as a minor decoration in meeting houses, in stylised forms such as the [[koru]]. Europeans introduced Māori to their more [[Figurative art|figurative]] style of art, and in the 19th century less stylised depictions of people and plants began to appear on the walls of meeting houses in place of traditional carvings and woven panels. The introduction of European paints also allowed traditional painting to flourish, as brighter and more distinct colours could be produced.

==Explorer art==
[[File:Gilsemans 1642.jpg|thumb|''A view of the Murderers' Bay, as you are at anchor here in 15 fathom'', Isaac Gilsemans, 1642]]
Europeans began producing art in New Zealand as soon as they arrived, with many exploration ships including an artist to record newly discovered places, people, flora and fauna. The first European work of art made in New Zealand was a drawing by [[Isaac Gilsemans]], the artist on [[Abel Tasman]]'s expedition of 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealandInBrief/History/2/ENZ-Resources/Standard/1/en|title=A view of the Murderers’ Bay|encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, pp 16-23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MaoriChief1784.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a New Zealand man'', Sydney Parkinson, 1784, probably from a sketch made in 1769.]]
[[Sir Joseph Banks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bea01Bank.html|title=The Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks 1768–1771 (Volume One)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Bea02Bank.html|title=The Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks 1768–1771 (Volume Two)|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sydney Parkinson]] of Captain [[James Cook]]'s ship [[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]] produced the first realistic depictions of Māori people, New Zealand landscapes, and indigenous flora and fauna in 1769. [[William Hodges]] was the artist on [[HMS Resolution (1771)|HMS Resolution]] in 1773, and [[John Webber]] on HMS Resolution in 1777. Their works captured the imagination of Europeans and were an influence in the 19th century movement of art towards [[naturalism (arts)|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, pp 23-28&lt;/ref&gt;

Cook's artists' paintings and descriptions of [[Tā moko|moko]] sparked an interest in the subject in Europe, and led to the [[tattoo]] becoming a tradition of the British Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, p 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th century Pākehā art==
Early 19th-century artists were for the most part visitors to New Zealand, not residents. Some, such as James Barry, who painted the [[Ngare Raumati]] chief Rua in 1818, and [[Thomas Kendall]] with the chiefs [[Hongi Hika]] and [[Waikato (chief)|Waikato]] in 1820, did not visit New Zealand at all, instead painting his subjects when they visited Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, pp 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/logicrouter/servlet/LogicRouter?PAGE=object&amp;OUTPUTXSL=object.xsl&amp;pm_RC=REPO03DB&amp;pm_OI=294&amp;pm_GT=Y&amp;pm_IAC=Y&amp;api_1=GET_OBJECT_XML|title=The Rev Thomas Kendall and the Maori chiefs Hongi and Waikato 1820|publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]]|accessdate=2009-03-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014105557/http://discover.natlib.govt.nz/logicrouter/servlet/LogicRouter?PAGE=object&amp;OUTPUTXSL=object.xsl&amp;pm_RC=REPO03DB&amp;pm_OI=294&amp;pm_GT=Y&amp;pm_IAC=Y&amp;api_1=GET_OBJECT_XML|archivedate=2008-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Landscape art]] was popular with early colonisers, and prints were widely used to promote settlement in New Zealand. Notable landscape artists included [[Augustus Earle]], who visited New Zealand in 1827-28,&lt;ref&gt;Keith, 2007, pp 52-56, 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.enzb.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?action=null&amp;wid=295|title=A narrative of a nine months' residence in New Zealand in 1827: together with a journal of a residence in Tristan D'Acunha, an island situated between South America and the Cape of Good Hope|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, Green &amp; Longman|year=1832|last=Earle|first=Augustus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]], who later became [[Premier of New Zealand|Premier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natlib.govt.nz/collections/highlighted-items/william-fox|title=William Fox - Painter and Premier|publisher=[[National Library of New Zealand]]|accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first oil portraits of Māori Chiefs with full [[Tā moko]]  in New Zealand were painted by the portrait artist [[William Beetham]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzportraitgallery.org.nz/whats-on/te-rū-movers-shakers-early-new-zealand-portraits-by-william-beetham&lt;/ref&gt; As colonisation developed a small but derivative art scene began based mostly on landscapes. However the most successful artists of this period, [[C. F. Goldie|Charles Goldie]] and [[Gottfried Lindauer]] were noted primarily for their portraits of Māori. Most notable [[Pākehā]] artists of their period worked in two dimensions; although there was some sculpture this was of limited notability.

[[Photography in New Zealand]] also began at this time and, like painting, initially concentrated mostly on landscape and Māori subjects.

==20th century==
[[Image:Rita Angus, Cass (1936).jpg|thumb|right|''Cass'', painted in 1936, is one of [[Rita Angus]]' best-known landscapes.]]

===Creation of a distinct New Zealand art===
Beginning in the 1930s, many [[Pākehā]] (New Zealanders not of Maori origin, usually of European ancestry) attempted to create a distinctive New Zealand style of art. Many, such as [[Rita Angus]], continued to work on landscapes, with attempts made to depict New Zealand's harsh light. Others appropriate Māori artistic styles; for example [[Gordon Walters]] created many paintings and prints based on the koru. New Zealand's most highly regarded 20th-century artist was [[Colin McCahon]], who attempted to use international styles such as [[cubism]] in New Zealand contexts. His paintings depicted such things as the [[Archangel Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] in the New Zealand countryside. Later works such as the [[Urewera triptych]] engaged with the contemporary [[Māori protest movement]].

===Māori cultural renaissance===
From the early 20th century, politician [[Āpirana Ngata]] fostered a renewal of traditional Māori art forms, for example establishing a school of Māori arts in [[Rotorua]].

===Late 20th and early 21st centuries===
The visual arts flourished in the later decades of the 20th century, with the increased cultural sophistication of many New Zealanders. Many Māori artists became highly successful blending elements of Māori culture with European modernism. [[Ralph Hotere]] was New Zealand's highest selling living artist, but other such as [[Shane Cotton]] and [[Michael Parekowhai]] are also very successful. Many contemporary Maori artists reference ancient myths and cultural practices in their work such as [[Derek Lardelli]], [[Lisa Reihana]], [[Sofia Minson]], [[Te Rongo Kirkwood]], [[Robyn Kahukiwa]], [[Aaron Kereopa]], [[Rangi Kipa]], John Miller, [[Kura Te Waru Rewiri]], [[Tracey Tawhiao]], [[Roi Toia]], [[Shane Hansen]], [[John Bevan Ford]], [[Jennifer Rendall]], [[Todd Couper]], [[Manos Nathan]], [[Wayne Youle]], [[Lyonel Grant]], [[Wi Taepa]] and [[David Teata]].

==Art organisations and museums==
[[Creative New Zealand]] is the national agency for the development of the arts in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/ |title=Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa homepage |work= Creative New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Art Gallery of New Zealand]] was established in 1936, and was amalgamated into the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa]] in 1992. The [[Auckland Art Gallery]] is New Zealand's largest art institution with a collection numbering over 15,000 works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Auckland Art Gallery|title=Collection overview and policies|url=http://www.aucklandartgallery.com/the-collection/overview-and-policies|work=Auckland Art Gallery website|publisher=Auckland Art Gallery|accessdate=04/07/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including major holdings of New Zealand historic, modern and contemporary art, and outstanding works by Māori and Pacific Island artists.

==Art schools==
New Zealand has three university-based fine art schools: [[Elam School of Fine Arts]] at the [[University of Auckland]] was founded in 1890, the [[University of Canterbury]] school of fine arts founded in 1950 and Massey School of Fine Arts founded in 1885, but was not officially a university institution until 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/1966/A/ArtSchools/en|title=Art Schools - Elam School of Fine Arts|last=A.

The '''North Sea Magical Realists''' are a collective of artists resident on the [[North Sea]] coast whose art is loosely influenced by the aesthetics of [[Magical Realism]]. Its leading members include the artists [[Peter Rodulfo]] (b. 1958) and [[Mark Burrell]] (b. 1957). &lt;ref&gt; http://trippgallery.co.uk/exhibition/north-sea-magical-realists &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/mark-burrell-north-sea-magical-realist.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/as-elephant-laughed-and-norfolk.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; http://aquariumofvulcan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/rodulfos-mandala-of-loving-kindness.html &lt;/ref&gt; 

Aware of each other's work for a number of years, Burrell and Rudolfo first met in New York USA, when exhibiting at the New York Expo of 1998.

In 2016 Burrell and Rodulfo elected [[Sir Thomas Browne]] as honorary 'Grand-father' of the movement, and simultaneously painted items found in Browne's [[Musaeum Clausum]] (section ''Rarities in Pictures''); Rodulfo painting item number 3 in the medium of oils on canvas (157 x 143&amp;nbsp;cm) with a title of ''Dr. Browne goes Submarining''; Burrell painting item 12 in the medium of alkyd resins on board (50 x 49&amp;nbsp;cm) with a title of ''Silent Presence''. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/groups/NorthSeaMagicalRealism/ &lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 the North Sea Magical Realists held their first show at the Tripp Gallery, Amwell Street, London. Rodulfo and Burrell exhibited paintings, sculptures, etchings and included assemblages by group member Guy Richardson (b.1932)&lt;ref&gt; http://trippgallery.co.uk/exhibition/north-sea-magical-realists/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pia de' Tolomei''''' is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by English artist [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], painted around 1868 and currently housed at the [[Spencer Museum of Art]], on the campus of the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. 

==History==
This work was painted at the start of Rossetti's affair with [[Jane Morris]], who modelled for the picture. As he was to do with ''[[Beata Beatrix]]'' (1870), Rossetti chose a tale by [[Dante Aligheri]] (from ''[[Purgatorio]]'') to illustrate his love for his model. The story tells of a woman whose husband imprisoned and later poisoned her:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Dante Alighieri]], [[The Divine Comedy]]'', "[[Purgatorio]]", Canto V, vv.130-136 "[[Pia de' Tolomei]]". &lt;/ref&gt; Rossetti wanted the world to believe the fantasy with which he was deluding himself - that [[William Morris]] kept Jane against her will. He continued this theme, as shown in ''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Treuherz, [[Elizabeth Prettejohn|E. Prettejohn]], and E. Becker. ''Dante Gabriel Rossetti''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossetti not only drew Jane exhaustively, he also choreographed photographic sessions of her and used the photographs as preliminary sketches for drawings. Amongst other representations of her, Rossetti depicts Jane as [[Proserpina|Proserpine]], [[Queen Guinevere]] and [[Desdemona]] - all of whom were at the mercy of men.&lt;ref&gt;V. Surtees. ''Dante Gabriel Rossetti''. Vol.I, Oxford: Clarendon Press (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane appears disproportionately large in most of Rossetti's pictures. The background is immaterial as long as the viewer focuses on the beauty of her face. In ''Pia de' Tolomei'' her elongated neck seems almost dislocated, and the whiteness of her skin shines out, defying the viewer to pay attention to any other aspects of the painting. Miller's hair colour is misrepresented in the painting. Her natural colour was dark brown, yet Rossetti paints it with an auburn tinge - closer to [[Lizzie Siddal]]'s hair colour than Miller's. Also, her hands are twisted and intertwined in a peculiar way.&lt;ref&gt;O. Doughty, ''A Victorian Romantic: Dante Gabriel Rossetti''  London: Frederick Muller (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Polish Vaporwave''' - [[Poland|Polish]] interpretation of the classic [[vaporwave]]. Apart from typical vaporwave style which refers to aesthetics of [['90's|90's]] and [[80's]], in Polish variant of this genre, one can be find multiple references to general vibe of post communist Poland. 

So far there were not many songs in actuall Polish vaporwave style. Most of them are simply iconic Polish songs changed with use of right tools and graphics to enhance nostagic effect of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://noizz.pl/big-stories/1995-rok-to-ostatni-rok-gdy-wszystko-bylo-estetyczne-tlumaczymy-czym-jest-vaporwave-w/1k8c5g9|title=1995 rok to ostatni rok, gdy wszystko było estetyczne.

== General concept ==

Whereas the original vaporwave is mainly focused on satirizing consumerist lifestyle and [[hedonism]], Polish vaporwave in addition criticizes the mindless fascination with the western world culture focusing on polish motifs (still maintained in vapor theme).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/pl/article/bnqw75/sens-zycia-wedlug-vaporwave|title=Sens życia według Vaporwave|date=2014-09-25|work=Vice|access-date=2018-11-13|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contractors ==
From few music projects that has been released so far, the most famous without a doubt is Żydoleptyk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Oskar Telech|title=Żydoleptyk — Polish Vaporwave|date=2017-01-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WOGbk7I4OU&amp;t=103s|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Author of this piece of music, who remains anonymous, exploits premade samples adding to them elements of Polish culture like quotes from pope [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]. It was published on channel ''Oskar Telech'' on 3rd of January 2017.

There is also another anonymous creator,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=americanboy|title=skaner - nadzieja ＰＯＬＩＳＨ    ＶＡＰＯＲＷＡＶＥ|date=2016-10-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5664CWpFyk&amp;t=104s|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reformulates songs of Robert Sasinowski ([[Disco polo|disco-polo]] artist) to the point where the original style is almost unrecognizable.

The '''Public Dance Halls Act 1935''' ({{lang-ga|Acht Um Hallai Rinnce Puibli, 1935}}) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Oireachtas]] which regulates [[dance hall]]s in Ireland by introducing a licensing system and a tax on admission tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dance Theatre in Ireland: Revolutionary Moves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2EbCeH5DWQIC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=7 December 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-03547-9|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The proposals were based on the recommendations of the 1932 report of the Carrigan Commission into [[juvenile sex crimes]].&lt;ref name="history707"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/707|title=Review of 'Ireland’s Magdalen Laundries and the Nation’s Architecture of Containment'|last=Murphy|first=Paula|date=December 2008|work=Reviews in History|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Carrigan Report recommendations were enacted in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, which raised the [[age of consent]] and banned artificial [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="history707" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0006/index.html|title=Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On dance halls, the report stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In the course of the Inquiry no form of abuse was blamed more persistently for pernicious consequences than the unlicensed dances held all over the country in unsuitable buildings and surroundings, for the profit of persons who are liable to no control or supervision by any authority. The scandals that are the outcome of such a situation are notorious. They have been denounced in [[Pastoral letter|pastoral]]s, exposed in the Press, and condemned by clergy, judges and justices, without avail. Before us the Commissioner, speaking for the [[Garda Síochána|Civic Guard]], said these dance gatherings in many districts were turned into "orgies of dissipation, which in the present state of legislation the police are powerless to prevent." In short, there is no effective legislation to put down this nuisance.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Public Dance Halls Bill was introduced in 1934 by the [[Government of the 8th Dáil|then government]] of [[Fianna Fáil]], and supported by the opposition [[Fine Gael]] and [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1934062800016?opendocument|title=In Committee on Finance. - Public Dance Halls Bill, 1934—Second Stage.|date=28 June 1934|work=Dáil Éireann debates|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was supported by [[Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference|the Catholic hierarchy]]. Secular nationalist institutions like the [[Gaelic League]] the legislation were seen as beneficial for protecting Irish culture against foreign influence.&lt;ref name="Gedutis2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Gedutis|title=See You at the Hall: Boston's Golden Era of Irish Music And Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TtO3jbQ1YZ0C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=1 July 2005|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-640-4|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural effect==
Licensing is administered at the [[District Court (Ireland)|district court]], subject to the discretion of the local judge. In the early years of its effect, they were less tolerant of more recently introduced musical styles, such as [[set dancing]] (seen as "foreign") and [[1930s in jazz|jazz]] dance clubs.&lt;ref name="Roche2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Roche|title=The Cambridge Companion to Brian Friel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jexvtdc88PMC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=19 October 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-82767-6|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StokesBohlman2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Stokes|author2=Philip V.

This set the conditions for the predominance of the [[céilidh]], with its large and loud musical ensembles and wide open dance spaces.&lt;ref name="Gedutis2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallely1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fintan Vallely|title=The Companion to Irish Traditional Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xN1VS6sWsEC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=28 April 2013|year=1999|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-8802-8|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ceilidh]] arose at the expense of older traditional music, which declined in popularity for decades until the creation of the [[Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann]], and later the [[Folk Revival]] brought new attention to traditional Irish music.&lt;ref name="StokesBohlman2003"/&gt;

==Current status==
The Act remains in force, with amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/isbc/1935.html#a2_1935|title=Legislation directory: Public Dance Halls Act, 1935 |work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nightclub]]s may be subject to stricter conditions in some districts than in others, depending on the particular judge. The Irish Nightclub Industry Association has described the legislation as "archaic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelandrestauranttimes.ie/featuredhotelon10.html|title=INIA aim to improve standards|date=October–November 2010|work=Hotel and Restaurant Times Magazine|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 there was confusion about whether the Act applied to [[lapdancing]] clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/lapdancing-clubs-caught-on-the-hop-26249477.html|title=Lapdancing clubs caught on the hop|last=Dodd|first=Stephen|date=1 July 2001|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20802">[[File:RadicalChicNYMagazine.jpg|thumb|''New York'' magazine photograph of [[Leonard Bernstein]] (seated at center), his wife [[Felicia Montealegre]] (left) and [[Donald L. Cox|Don Cox]] (standing), Field Marshal of the [[Black Panther Party]], in the Bernsteins' 13-room penthouse on Park Avenue in Manhattan, January 14, 1970.&lt;ref name="nymag1970" /&gt; (Photo by Stephen Salmieri.)]]"'''Radical chic'''" is a term coined by journalist [[Tom Wolfe]] in his 1970 essay "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's" to describe the adoption and promotion of [[Political radicalism|radical political]] causes by [[Celebrity|celebrities]], [[socialite]]s, and [[Upper class|high society]]. The concept has been described as "an exercise in double-tracking one's public image: on the one hand, defining oneself through committed allegiance to a radical cause, but on the other, vitally, demonstrating this allegiance because it is the fashionable, ''[[:wiktionary:au courant|au courant]]'' way to be seen in moneyed, name-conscious Society."&lt;ref name=Molotov&gt;{{cite web |last=Bracewell |first=Michael |title=Molotov Cocktails |work=[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze Magazine]] |date=November–December 2004 |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190439/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/molotov_cocktails |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike dedicated [[Activism|activists]], [[Revolutionary|revolutionaries]], or [[Political dissent|dissenters]], those who engage in "radical chic" remain frivolous political agitators. They are [[Ideology|ideologically]] invested in their cause of choice only so far as it advances their social standing.

"[[Terrorism|Terrorist]] chic" is a modern expression with similar connotations. This derivative, however, de-emphasizes the [[Social commentary|class satire]] of Wolfe's original term, instead accentuating concerns over the [[semiotics]] of radicalism (such as the [[aestheticization of violence]]).

In languages such as [[American English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] the term has become widely used to indicate people identifying themselves as [[Socialism|socialists]] or radical leftists while conducting upper-class lifestyles.

==Origin and meaning==
The phrase "radical chic" originated in a 1970 ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' article by [[Tom Wolfe]], titled "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's",&lt;ref name="nymag1970"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/docs/07/05/070529radical_chic.pdf|title=Radical Chic: that Party at Lenny's|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|date=8 June 1970|work=New York|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later reprinted in his books ''[[Radical Chic &amp; Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers]]'' and ''[[The Purple Decades]]''. In the essay, Wolfe used the term to satirize composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] and his friends for their absurdity in hosting a fundraising party for the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]—an organization whose members, activities, and goals were clearly incongruous with those of Bernstein's elite circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foote |first=Timothy |title=Fish in the Brandy Snifter |date=1970-12-21 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904627,00.html? |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfe's concept of radical chic was intended to lampoon individuals  (particularly [[Elitism|social elites]] like the [[jet set]]) who endorsed [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] radicalism merely to affect worldliness, assuage [[white guilt]], or garner prestige, rather than to affirm genuine political convictions.

{{Quote|[Wolfe's] subject is how culture's patrician classes – the wealthy, fashionable intimates of high society – have sought to luxuriate in both a vicarious glamour and a monopoly on virtue through their public espousal of street politics: a politics, moreover, of minorities so removed from their sphere of experience and so absurdly, diametrically, opposed to the islands of privilege on which the cultural aristocracy maintain their isolation, that the whole basis of their relationship is wildly out of kilter from the start. ... In short, Radical Chic is described as a form of highly developed decadence; and its greatest fear is to be seen not as prejudiced or unaware, but as middle-class.|Michael Bracewell|"Molotov Cocktails"&lt;ref name=Molotov /&gt;}}

==Background==
The concept of "fashionable" espousal of radical causes by members of wealthy society in this case had been argued against by Bernstein's wife, [[Felicia Montealegre]], prior to the publication of "Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's", a fact Wolfe details in it. The essay appeared in the June 8, 1970 issue of ''New York'', 20 weeks after the actual fund raiser at the Bernstein residence was held on January 14. The first report of the event appeared the following day in a piece by ''[[The New York Times]]'' style reporter [[Charlotte Curtis]], who was in attendance. Curtis wrote in part: "Leonard Bernstein and a Black Panther leader argued the merits of the Black Panther party's philosophy before nearly 90 guests last night in the Bernsteins' elegant Park Avenue duplex." According to Wolfe, the release of the story worldwide was followed by strong criticism of the event: "The English, particularly, milked the story for all it was worth and seemed to derive one of the great cackles of the year from it."&lt;ref name=nymag1970 /&gt;

The negative reaction prompted publication of an op-ed in the ''Times'' on January 16 entitled "False Note on Black Panthers" that was severely critical of the Black Panther Party and Bernstein:

{{Quote|Emergence of the Black Panthers as the romanticized darlings of the politico-cultural jet set is an affront to the majority of black Americans. ... the group therapy plus fund-raising soiree at the home of Leonard Bernstein, as reported in this newspaper yesterday, represents the sort of elegant slumming that degrades patrons and patronized alike. It might be dismissed as guilt-relieving fun spiked with social consciousness, except for its impact on those blacks and whites seriously working for complete equality and social justice.&lt;ref name="nyt_false_note"&gt;{{cite news|title=False Note on Black Panthers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 16, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Felicia Montealegre wrote and personally delivered a response to this op-ed to the ''Times'' offices.&lt;ref name="nymag_html"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=Tom Wolfe on Radical Chic and Leonard Bernstein's Party for the Black Panthers|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/46170/index15.html|work=Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny's|publisher=New York|accessdate=11 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her response she wrote:

{{Quote|As a civil libertarian, I asked a number of people to my house on Jan. 14 in order to hear the lawyer and others involved with the Panther 21 discuss the problem of civil liberties as applicable to the men now waiting trial, and to help raise funds for their legal expenses. ... It was for this deeply serious purpose that our meeting was called. The frivolous way in which it was reported as a "fashionable" event is unworthy of the Times, and offensive to all people who are committed to humanitarian principles of justice.&lt;ref name=nymag_html /&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt_letter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Felicia M.|title=Letters to the Editor of The Times: Panthers' Legal Aid|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/01/21/archives/letters-to-the-editor-of-the-times.html |accessdate=4 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 21, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Terrorist chic==
[[File:Latuff che.png|thumb|180px|A 2002 [[political cartoon]] by [[Carlos Latuff]] depicting [[Che Guevara]] wearing a [[Palestinian costumes|Palestinian]] [[keffiyeh]]]]

'''Terrorist chic''' (also known as "terror chic" or "militant chic") is a more recent and specific variation of the term. It refers to the [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of symbols, objects, and aesthetics related to radical [[Militant (word)|militants]], usually in the context of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daly |first=Susan |title=Is the war over for terrorist chic? |work=[[Independent.ie]] |publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]] |date=2008-11-08 |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/news-gossip/is-the-war-over-for-terrorist-chic-1528669.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herr |first=Cheryl |title=Terrorist Chic and Marching Season Style |work=[[The Vacuum]] |publisher=Factotum |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.thevacuum.org.uk/issues/issues0120/issue17/is17artterchi.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such imagery is deployed [[Subversion (politics)|subversively]], the process exemplifies aestheticization of propaganda. Regardless, because terrorist chic derives its [[iconography]] from groups and individuals often associated with violent conflict or [[terrorism]], the term carries a greater pejorative tone than "radical chic."

Instances of terrorist chic have variously been interpreted as morally irresponsible, earnestly [[Counterculture|counter-cultural]], ironically [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hip]], or benignly apolitical. According to Henry K. Miller of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', the most well-known example is the ubiquitous appearance of [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara in popular culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Henry K |title=Fatal attraction |work=[[New Statesman]] |date=2002-10-28 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280033 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases that have been labeled terrorist chic include: the Prada-Meinhof fashion line (a pun on [[Prada]] and the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof Gang]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Connolly |first=Kate |title=Astrid Proll's journey to Terror Chic |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2002-10-06 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/06/germany.kateconnolly |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smiley |first=Shannon |title=Germany Debates 'Terrorist Chic': Art and Fashion Stir Memories of Leftist Violence in '70s |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=2005-02-20 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38447-2005Feb19.html |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashion of combining [[keffiyeh]]s and military-style clothing such as camo prints and heavy boots, outside the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hernandez |first=Daniel |title='Terrorist Chic' and Beyond |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=2006-04-09 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/apr/09/magazine/tm-terrorchic15 |accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lando |first=Michal |title=US chain pulls 'anti-war' keffiyehs |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |publisher=Mirkaei Tikshoret Ltd. |date=2007-01-19 |url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467767600&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |accessdate=2009-04-05 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 ''[[Bangor Daily News]]'' article "Libertarian chic hits country," Roland Nethaway compared libertarians to "John Wayne on steroids," writing they were "anti-government before anti-government was cool".&lt;ref name=libertarianchic15july1996&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=15 July 1996|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19960715&amp;id=7KleAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=304NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3051,3379934|title=Libertarian chic hits country|accessdate=7 June 2013|first=Rowland|last=Nethaway|location=Bangor, Maine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 Reuters article, Nicholas Wapshott used the term to describe those who use radical statements to add a "dangerous edge to their otherwise humdrum personas."&lt;ref name="reuters9jan2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Since when have personal guns been used to defend political liberty?|first=Nicholas|last=Wapshott|date=9 January 2013|accessdate=8 June 2013|publisher=Reuters|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/nicholas-wapshott/2013/01/09/since-when-have-personal-guns-been-used-to-defend-political-liberty/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Che embodied third world revolution, a drawing-room, radical-chic hope===
Shortly after the October 17, 1997 burial with military honors in [[Santa Clara, Cuba]] of Guevara's disinterred and identified remains, found in the Bolivian jungle by [[forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9710/17/cuba.che/ Cuba salutes 'Che' Guevara: Revolutionary Icon Finally Laid to Rest] CNN, October 17, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' columnist Richard Bernstein argued that the third-world revolution that Che embodied was no longer even a ''drawing-room, radical-chic hope.''&lt;ref name=NYT26nov1997&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/26/books/critic-s-notebook-looking-back-with-cooled-passions-at-che-s-image.html|publisher=New York Times|title=Critic's Notebook; Looking Back With Cooled Passions at Che's Image|first=Richard|last=Bernstein|date=26 November 1997|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrent with his re-burial, three major Guevara biographies were published in 1997. Noting the sustained interest in Che, Bernstein suggested that "the end of the cold war and the failure of the third-world revolution" allowed for the "scrutiny of Guevara, [as] a symbol of both the idealism and the [[moral blindness]] of the decade of protest" to take place free in a context free "of ideological partisanship and rancor."&lt;ref name=NYT26nov1997 /&gt;

'''Rare Book Room''' is an [[educational website]] for the repository of digitally scanned rare books made freely available to the public.

Starting around 1996 the California-based company [[Octavo (company)|Octavo]] began scanning rare and important books from libraries around the world. These scans were done at extremely high resolution using high-quality equipment, with some pages at over 200MB each. They were sold by Octavo as commercial products on CD-ROM. In 2006 the "Rare Book Room" website was created which contains the complete collection in medium to medium-high resolution freely available to the public through a web browser or as a PDF file. Some high resolution versions are still being sold by Octavo through a separate website. As of 2007 over 400 books have been scanned.

The repository includes books by [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]], [[Einstein]], and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]. It includes most of the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)#Quartos|Shakespeare Quartos]] from the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] Library, and the [[National Library of Scotland]], as well as the [[First Folio]] from the [[Folger Library]]. It includes [[Library of Congress]] copies of ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]], and other rare editions: a [[Gutenberg Bible]] of 1455, [[William Harvey]]'s [[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|book on the circulation of blood]], Galileo ’s ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'', the first printing of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], and the [[Magna Carta]].

'''''The River Horse''''' is a bronze sculpture of a [[hippopotamus]] located on the campus of [[George Washington University]]. It is in front of [[Lisner Auditorium]], at 21st Street and H Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]], in the [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2000/06/12/News/Gws-Oddities-18270.shtml| title=GW's oddities| work=The GW Hatchet| author= Laura Milner| date= 2000-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, George Washington University President [[Stephen Joel Trachtenberg]] presented this bronze statue as a gift to the University's Class of 2000. The hippo stands with its mouth wide. Its nose is slightly worn due to passerby rubbing it. A plaque is placed on the base:

:Legend has it that the Potomac was once home to these wondrous beasts.
:George &amp; Martha Washington are even said to have watched them cavort in
:the river shallows from the porch of their beloved Mount Vernon on summer evenings.
:Credited with enhancing the fertility of the plantation, the Washingtons believed
:the hippopatamus brought them good luck &amp; children on the estate often attempted
:to lure the creatures close enough to the shore to touch a nose for good luck.

:So, too, may generations of students of the George Washington University.
:Art for wisdom,
:Science for joy,
:Politics for beauty,
:And a Hippo for hope.

The hippopotamus is not native to North America.  President Trachtenberg admitted he invented the story.  He said that, for fun, he made up a story that George Washington watched hippos swim in the Potomac River.  http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trachtenberg-reveals-truth-behind-hippo   http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Petition-Seeks-to-Change-GW-Colonials-to-the-GW-Hippos-481773571.html

'''Samuel Palmer''' (27 January 1805 – 24 May 1881) was a British [[Landscape art|landscape]] painter, [[etcher]] and [[printmaker]]. He was also a prolific writer. Palmer was a key figure in [[Romanticism]] in Britain and produced visionary pastoral paintings.

==Early life==
Palmer, who was born in Surrey Square off the [[Old Kent Road]] in [[Newington, London]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/samuel_palmer/palmer_and_primitivism.aspx Samuel Palmer on the British Museum Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051208/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/samuel_palmer/palmer_and_primitivism.aspx |date=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the son of a bookseller and sometime [[Baptist]] minister, and was raised by a pious nurse. Palmer painted churches from around age twelve, and first exhibited [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]-inspired works at the [[Royal Academy]] at the age of fourteen. He had little formal training, and little formal schooling, although he was educated briefly at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]].&lt;ref&gt;Minchin, J. G. C., ''Our public schools, their influence on English history; Charter house, Eton, Harrow, Merchant Taylors', Rugby, St. Paul's Westminster, Winchester'' (London, 1901), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shoreham==
[[File:Samuel Palmer 002.jpg|left|thumbnail|234px|''In a Shoreham Garden''. 1820s or early 1830s]]
Through [[John Linnell (1792)|John Linnell]], he met [[William Blake]] in 1824.  Blake's influence can be seen in work he produced over the next ten years and generally reckoned to be his greatest. The works were landscapes around [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]], near Sevenoaks in the west of [[Kent]]. He purchased a run-down cottage, nicknamed "Rat Abbey", and lived there from 1826 to 1835, depicting the area as a demi-paradise, mysterious and visionary, often shown in sepia shades under moon and star light. There Palmer associated with a group of Blake-influenced artists known as [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] (including [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] and [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]]).  They were among the few who saw the Shoreham paintings as, resulting from attacks by critics in 1825, he opened his early portfolios only to selected friends.

Palmer's somewhat disreputable father &amp;ndash; Samuel Palmer senior &amp;ndash; moved to the area, his brother Nathaniel having offered him an allowance that would "make him a gentleman" and restore the good name of the family.  Samuel Palmer senior rented half of the [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]]-era 'Waterhouse' which still stands by the [[River Darent]] at Shoreham and is now known as the 'Water House'. Palmer's nurse, Mary Ward, and his other son William joined him there. The Waterhouse was used to accommodate overflow guests from "Rat Abbey". In 1828 Samuel Palmer left "Rat Abbey" to join his father at Water House and lived there for the rest of his time in Shoreham. While at Shoreham he fell in love with the fourteen-year-old Hannah Linnell, whom he later married.

==Maturity==
[[File:Palmer. A Cornfield by Moonlight with the Evening Star. Watercolour with bodycolour and pen and ink c.1830..jpg|right|thumbnail|234px|''A Cornfield by Moonlight with the Evening Star'' c. 1830]]
After returning to London in 1835, and using a small legacy to purchase a house in [[Marylebone]], Palmer produced less mystical and more conventional work. Part of his reason in returning to London was to sell his work and earn money from private teaching. He had better health on his return to London, and was by then married to Hannah, daughter of the painter [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]] who he had known since she was a child, and married when she was nineteen and he was thirty-two. He sketched in [[Devon]]shire and Wales around this time. His peaceful vision of rural England had been disrupted by the [[Swing Riots|violent rural discontent]] of the early 1830s. His small financial legacy was running out and he decided to produce work more in line with public taste if he was to earn an income for himself and his wife. He was following the advice of his father-in-law. Linnell, who had earlier shown remarkable understanding of the uniqueness of [[William Blake]]'s genius, was not as generous with his son-in-law, towards whom his attitude was authoritarian and often harsh.

Palmer turned more to watercolour which was gaining popularity in England. To further a commercial career, the couple embarked on a two-year [[honeymoon]] to Italy, made possible by money from Hannah's parents in 1837. In Italy Palmer's palette became brighter, sometimes to the point of garishness, but he made many fine sketches and studies that would later be useful in producing new paintings. On his return to London, Palmer sought patrons with limited success. For more than two decades he was obliged to work as a private drawing master, until he moved from London in 1862. To add to his financial worries, he returned to London to find his dissolute brother William had pawned all his early paintings, and Palmer was obliged to pay a large sum to redeem them. By all accounts Palmer was an excellent teacher, but the work with uninspired students reduced the time he could devote to his own art.

==Later years==
From the early 1860s he gained some measure of critical success for his later landscapes, which had a touch of the early Shoreham work about them – most notable is the etching of ''The Lonely Tower'' (1879).  He became a full member of the [[Water Colour Society]] in 1854, and its annual show gave him a yearly goal to work towards.

[[File:Palmer. A Dream in the Appenine c.1864 (watercolor and gouache on paper laid on wood) Tate Britain.jpg|right|thumbnail|234px|''A Dream in the Apennine'' (c. 1864)]]

His best late works include a series of large watercolours illustrating [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poems ''[[L'Allegro]]'' and ''[[Il Penseroso]]'' and his etchings, a medium in which he worked from 1850 onwards, including a set illustrating [[Virgil]].

Palmer's later years were darkened by the death in 1861, at the age of 19, of his elder son Thomas More Palmer &amp;ndash; a devastating blow from which he never fully recovered. He lived in various places later in his life, including a small cottage and an unaffordable villa both in [[Kensington]], where he lived at 6 [[Drouro Place]],&lt;ref name="kensingtonpast114"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Barbara|last2=Starren|first2=Carolyn|title=Kensington Past|date=1998|publisher=Historical Publications|location=London, U.K.|isbn=9780948667503|oclc=42308455|page=114|quote=The residents were somewhat lower perhaps on the social scale, but many had distinguished artistic reputations such as the sculptor Alfred Stevens, at 7 Canning Place, and the painter, Samuel Palmer, at 6 Drouro Place, 1851–61.}}&lt;/ref&gt; then a cottage at [[Reigate]]. But it was only when a small measure of financial security came his way, that was he able to move to Furze Hill House in Redhill, Surrey, from 1862.  He could not afford to have a daily newspaper delivered to Redhill, suggesting that his financial circumstances there were still tight.

Samuel Palmer died in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], Surrey, and is buried with his wife in Reigate churchyard.

==Legacy==

Palmer was largely forgotten after his death. In 1909, many of his Shoreham works were destroyed by his surviving son Alfred Herbert Palmer, who burnt "a great quantity of father's handiwork ... Knowing that no one would be able to make head or tail of what I burnt; I wished to save it from a more humiliating fate".  The destruction included "sketchbooks, notebooks, and original works, and lasted for days". It wasn't until 1926 that Palmer's rediscovery began through a show curated by Martin Hardie at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], ''Drawings, Etchings and Woodcuts made by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake''. But it took until the early 1950s for his reputation to recover, stimulated by [[Geoffrey Grigson]]'s 280-page book ''Samuel Palmer'' (1947) and later by an exhibition of the Shoreham work in 1957 and by Grigson's 1960 selection of Palmer's writing.  His reputation rests mainly on his Shoreham work, but some of his later work has recently received more appreciation.

The Shoreham work has had a powerful influence on many English artists after being rediscovered. Palmer was a notable influence on [[F. L. Griggs]], [[Robin Tanner]], [[Graham Sutherland]], [[Paul Drury]], [[Joseph Webb]], [[Eric Ravilious]], [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], the glass engraving of [[Laurence Whistler]], and [[Clifford Harper]]. He also inspired a resurgence in twentieth-century landscape printmaking, which began amongst students at Goldsmiths' College in the 1920s. (See: Jolyon Drury, 2006)

In 2005 the [[British Museum]] collaborated with the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] to stage the first major retrospective of his work, timed to coincide with the bicentenary of Palmer's birth. The show ran from October 2005 to January 2006, and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, March &amp;ndash; May 2006.

'''''Shah Jo Risalo''''' ({{lang-sd|&lt;big&gt;'''شاھ جو رسالو'''&lt;/big&gt;}}) is a poetic compendium of famous [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] Sufi poet [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]]. In fact, it is many compendia, for Shah Abdul Latif's poetry in various forms of [[Beit|bayt]] and wai was compiled by many of his devotees during his lifetime and after his death. The devotees compiled his poetry and designated it as '''Shah Jo Risalo''' or '''Poetry of Shah'''.

[[Ernest Trumpp]] called it [[Diwan (poetry)|Diwan]] when he edited the ''Risalo'' and published it from [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] in 1866 A.D. Afterwards, many scholars and linguists have published the Shah Jo Risalo with their own compilations, hence many editions are available.

Shah Jo Risalo, written in very pure and concise [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] verses, is great storehouse for Muslims but also for the Hindus. Shah Abdul Latif has hidden his mystical ideas under layers of symbols taken from all spheres of life as well as from the classical Sufi tradition, and particularly from Maulana [[Rumi]]'s [[Mathnawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, ''Pearls from the Indus:Studies in Sindhi Culture'' Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan: Sindhi Adabi Board (1986). See pp. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surs (chapters) ==
The traditional compilations of Shah Jo Risalo include 30 Surs (chapters) which were compiled by renowned researchers. The oldest publications of Shah Jo Risalo contained some 36 Surs, but later most of the linguists discarded 6 Surs, as their language and content did not match the Shah's style. Recently, Dr. Nabi Bakhsh Baloch, a renowned linguist of the [[Sindhi language]], has compiled and printed a new edition after 32 years of research into folk culture, language and the history of Sindhi language. Another poet Dr Aurangzeb Siyal has recently launched a book named "Louk Zangeer" in which he has attempted to define three Surs i-e Momal Rano, Sasui Punho and Umar Marvi in an easy manner and in different poetic style.

The word "[[Svara|Sur]]", from [[Sanskrit]] word [[Svara]], means a mode of singing. The Surs are sung as [[Raga]]s In [[Indian classical music]], its "Ragas" and "Raginis" are sung at different times of day and night. In Risalo the Surs are named according to their subject matter. The underlying theme is how the individual is to cultivate the godly attributes, negate his ego so as to evolve to a better human being.

The traditional 30 Surs included in Shah Jo Risalo are:

These Surs contain [[Beit|Bayts]] which Shah latif sang in state of ecstasy. These Bayts in the Surs concerning the life-stories of his heroines, viz. Suhni, Sassui, Lila, Mumal, Marui, Nuri and Sorath, are not in chronological sequences, for the Sufi Poet in his state of "Wajd" or ecstasy, was concerned with the moments of denouncements in life-stories, which he used as allegories to express his mystical experiences.

== Shah's Heroines ==
{{Main|The Seven Queens of Sindh}}

The [[heroines]] of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai's poetry are known as the Seven queens of [[Sindhi folklore]] who have been given the status of royalty in Shah Jo Risalo. The Seven Queens are celebrated throughout [[Sindh]] for their positive qualities: [[honesty]], [[integrity]], [[piety]] and [[loyalty]]. They are also valued for their [[bravery]] and their willingness to risk their lives in the name of [[love]]. The Seven Queens mentioned in Shah Jo Risalo are '''Marui, Momal, Sassui, Noori, Sohni, Sorath, and Lila'''. In his poetry Shah has alluded in elaborate way to these characters of Sindhi folktales and used them as metaphors for high spiritual life.

Perhaps what Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai saw in his tales of these [[women]] was an idealized view of [[womanhood]], but the truth remains that the Seven Queens inspired women all over Sindh to have the courage to choose love and freedom over tyranny and oppression. The lines from the Risalo describing their trials are sung at Sufi shrines all over Sindh, and especially at the ''[[urs]]'' of Shah Abdul Latif every year at Bhit Shah.

These romantic tales of Bhittai are commonly known as ''[[Momal Rano]]'', ''[[Umar Marvi|Umar Marui]]'', ''[[Sohni Mehar]]'', ''[[Lilan Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'', ''[[Sassui Punnhun]]'' and ''[[Raja Dhach]]'' or Seven Queens ({{lang|sd|&lt;big&gt;ست سورميون&lt;/big&gt;}}) of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224737/http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812045415/http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812045415/http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sassui Punnhun]]'' and ''Sohni Mehar'' aka [[Sohni Mahiwal]] in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] are also celebrated in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] along with ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'' and ''[[Mirza Sahiban]]'' and thus form part of Punjabi traditions.

These nine tragic romances from [[South Asia]] (all from present day [[Pakistan]]) have become part of the cultural identity of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://punjabiworld.com/Creative-Punjab/Legends-of-Punjab/love-legends-of-punjab.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations ==
Shah Jo Risalo was first translated into [[German language|German]] in 1866 by Ernest Trump, a German scholar and missionary when in 1860s he became fascinated by [[Sindhi language]] and culture and the [[jogi]]s and singers who sang Shah Latif’s verses. With the help of Sindhi scholars he compiled a selection of the original verses and called it "Shah Jo Risalo" (the message of Shah). It was first translated in English by [[Elsa Kazi]], a German lady married to [[Allama I. I. Kazi]], who translated selections of Shah Jo Risalo in English prose. Later in 1940, Dr H.T Sorley, an English scholar learnt Sindhi, and published selections from the Risalo by the Oxford University Press entitled "Shah Abdul latif of Bhit - His Poetry, Life and Times".

The most recent work (1994) of translation of Risalo into English is that of Amena Khamisani, a professor in English Literature at the [[University of Sindh|Sindh University]]. [[Shaikh Ayaz]], the famous Sindhi poet, translated Risalo into [[Urdu]]. Risalo is also translated in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and more recently [[French language|French]] translation was also undertaken by Cultural department of Sindh. Part of Risalo is also translated in Arabic.
There is one more translation of Shah Abdul Latif by name "Seeking The Beloved" translated by Hari Daryani 'Dilgir' a noted Sindhi poet and Anju Makhija. This book was honoured with Sahitya Akademi Award for translation in the year 2012.

[[File:Sliprännor Gantofta 1.jpg|thumb|Sliprännor i Gantofta]]
[[File:Sliprännor Gantofta 2.jpg|thumb|Sliprännor i Gantofta; Detail]]

The '''Sliprännor i Gantofta''' (Swedish: Grooves of the Giant) in the [[Helsingborg]] region in [[Scania]] in [[Sweden]] are located on the escarpment of a river valley in a [[sandstone]] outcrop. Traditionally, they were held to be grooves produced by people sharpening knives and axes, like the countless straight [[grooves (archaeology)|grooves]] in [[Gotland]].

However, modern surveys of the concave horizontal grooves indicate that they were created by means of a pendulum motion or a rotating wheel, like the monument [[Sliprännor i Foteviken]]. Today it is believed that the concave grooves in particular (and possibly also the straight ones) are the remains of ritual with religious or magical significance.

Grooves are particularly common in the northwest of Scania, especially on the [[Kullen]] peninsula, Gotland and [[Östergötland]]. Traces of the [[stone age]] [[Pitted Ware culture]] (c. 3200-2600 BC) are also common in these areas. However, there is as yet no certain evidence that the grooves were made in the stone age.

{{About|the theatrical performance|the psychological disorder|Self-talk}}
{{refimprove|date=June 2009}}
A '''soliloquy''' (from Latin ''solo'' "to oneself" + ''loquor'' "I talk") is a device often used in drama when a character speaks to him- or herself, relating thoughts and feelings, thereby also sharing them with the audience, giving off the illusion of being a series of unspoken reflections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy|title=Definition of SOLILOQUY|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; If other characters are  present, they keep silent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/553410/soliloquy|title=Soliloquy - drama|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or are disregarded by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/soliloquy|title=the definition of soliloquy|author=|date=|website=www.dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it should be said that sometimes, depending on the performance, a monologue that is written as a soliloquy, will be addressed directly to the audience. And sometimes it is hard to tell if what is being heard is a monologue, or a duologue or a soliloquy; in which case choosing the right term may be a matter of interpretation.

A soliloquy is a type of [[monologue]], but it is not an [[aside]]: a monologue is a speech where one character addresses other characters, or the audience; or it is a speech that is self-directed; an aside is a (usually short) comment by one character towards the audience, though during the play it may seem like the character is addressing him or herself.

Soliloquies were frequently used in dramas but went out of fashion when [[Literary#drama|drama]] shifted towards [[Realism (literature)|realism]] in the late 18th century. But nowadays, with budget restrictions in theatre, they have come back into fashion. 

Good examples in literature can be seen in the words of the character of [[Iago]], who has a leading role in [[Shakespeare]]'s famous play ''[[Othello]]''.

Examples of a present form of soliloquy are found in the sitcom ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' and the political drama ''[[House of Cards (UK TV series)|House of Cards]]''.

==Soliloquies in Shakespeare==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
Shakespeare’s soliloquies contain some of his most original and powerful writing. Possibly prompted by the essays of [[Montaigne]], he explores in his greatest tragedies the way someone wrestles with their private thoughts under pressure, often failing to perceive the flaws in their own thinking, as in the great galloping I-vii soliloquy (‘if ‘twere done when ‘tis done…’) in which Macbeth unconsciously reveals through his imagery his fear of damnation.  That is part of it; he actually has a variety of thoughts. But he fails to realise what really holds him back from murdering his king: simply the fact that it is wrong.  And if he does indeed realize that, and is choosing not to give that fear greater importance, he also expresses his fear of getting caught, and feeling guilty, and how things will play out.

The earliest of the mature soliloquies occur in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' where Shakespeare develops Brutus as a forerunner of Hamlet: the self-critical and honest man struggling to do what’s right in unpropitious circumstances. Hamlet’s seven soliloquies, and the single major soliloquy of Claudius in ''Hamlet'' can all be described as ‘a search for a difficult sincerity’, and represent Shakespeare’s most extended study of the workings of the human mind; it is not until the novels of Dostoyevsky that a character’s inner self is examined with such power, discrimination and technical skill.

Shakespeare’s soliloquies are written in blank verse of unparalleled variety, invention and rhythmic flexibility, suggestive of the rapidly changing moods of their speakers. Often, it is through vivid and memorable imagery that an individual registers his unique take on the world: Hamlet’s perception of Elsinore as ‘an unweeded garden that grows to seed’, the frantically deluded Leontes who feels he has ‘drunk and seen the spider’, the self-dramatising murderer, Othello ‘Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse’ or Antony’s transcendent vision of his afterlife with Cleopatra: ‘Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand, And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze’.

'''Sydney Alvin Field''' (December 19, 1935{{spaced en dash}}November 17, 2013) was a leading American [[screenwriter]] and author, who wrote several books on screenwriting, the first being ''[[Screenplay (book)|Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting]]'' (Dell Publishing, 1979). He led workshops and seminars about producing salable [[screenplay]]s. [[Hollywood]] [[film producer]]s use Field's ideas on structure to measure the potential of screenplays.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
Syd Field was born on December 19, 1935 in [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mylife.com/syd-field Syd Field] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401025951/http://www.mylife.com/syd-field |date=2014-04-01 }} at [[MyLife]]&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ommolketab.ir/aaf-lib/pmsy139cewn2dvsmg5ru8ghfb72oma.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Field taught screenwriting for the [[Master of Professional Writing Program]], at [[University of Southern California]]. Field also wrote and produced the television series ''Men in Crisis'', ''[[Hollywood and the Stars]]'', ''National Geographics'', and ''Jacque Cousteau Specials'' from 1963−1965 for [[David L. Wolper#Productions|David L. Wolper Productions]].

Field died on November 17, 2013, aged 77, at his home in [[Beverly Hills, California]], surrounded by his wife, family, and friends.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author=[[William Yardley (reporter)|William Yardley]] |coauthors= |title=Syd Field, Who Wrote the Book on Writing Screenplays, Dies at 77 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/arts/syd-field-author-of-the-definitive-work-on-writing-screenplays-is-dead-at-77.html |quote=...

==The paradigm==
[[Image:Syd Field2.jpg|thumb|right|Field in an instructional video]]
Field's most notable contribution is his paradigm "[[three-act structure]]". In this structure, a writer sets a film's plot within the first twenty to thirty minutes. Then the [[protagonist]] experiences a '''''plot point''''', providing the protagonist with a goal. About half of a movie's running time focuses on the protagonist's struggle to achieve this goal. The second act is called the '''''confrontation'''''. Field also refers to the '''''midpoint''''', a turning point around the middle of the screenplay (such as on or around page 60 of a 120-page screenplay). This turning point is often a devastating reversal of the protagonist's fortune. The third act depicts the protagonist's struggle to achieve (or not achieve) his or her goal, as well as the aftermath.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6209">[[File:Izler solomon cbs 1948.JPG|thumb|[[Izler Solomon]] (in 1948), who made the first recording of Chávez's Fifth Symphony]]
'''Symphony No. 5''', also called ''Sinfonía para cuerdas'' (Symphony for Strings) is a composition for string orchestra by [[Carlos Chávez]], composed in 1953.

==History==
The Fifth Symphony was commissioned on 24 September 1952 by the Koussevitsky Music Foundation, and was sketched in July and August 1953. Chávez composed all of it during the month of September, while he was living in Acapulco, completing the fair copy of the score the following month. The score is dedicated to the memory of [[Serge Koussevitzky|Serge]] and Natalie Koussevitsky. It was premiered in Royce Hall, Los Angeles, by the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, conducted by the composer, on either 1 December {{harv|García Morillo|1960|loc=164}} or 10 December 1953 {{harv|Orbón|1987c|loc=80}}.

==Instrumentation==
The work is scored for a conventional string orchestra of violins I and II, violas, cellos, and double basses.

==Analysis==
The Symphony is in three movements:
#Allegro molto moderato
#Molto lento
#Allegro con brio

In contrast to the Romantic character of the Fourth Symphony, Chávez here adopts a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] orientation. This is especially pronounced in the last movement, whose contrapuntal textures lend it a decidedly baroque character {{harv|Orbón|1987c|loc=73}}. The first movement is in 12/8 time and in a sort of E minor tonality. The style of the movement resembles the opening of the Allegro of the [[Symphony No. 3 (Chávez)|Third Symphony]], though of course without the powerful effect of a large orchestra {{harv|García Morillo|1960|loc=166}}.

A '''tertiary color''' is a color made by mixing full saturation of one primary color with half saturation of another primary color and none of a third primary color, in a given [[color space]] such as [[RGB color model|RGB]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = How Video Works | author = Marcus Weise and Diana Weynand | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2007 | ISBN = 0-240-80933-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KGbFAYGt5qsC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22tertiary+color%22++rgb&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=egQlSMaZM5TstgOal_m9DQ&amp;sig=Z8nS3gwQNshO57wThW611DC2z8o#PPA58,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] (more modern) or [[RYB color model|RYB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Art and Science of Professional Makeup | author = Stan Place and Bobbi Ray Madry | publisher = Thomson Delmar Learning | year = 1990 | ISBN = 0-87350-361-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tG2ncjtg_lYC&amp;pg=PA307&amp;dq=%22tertiary+color%22++red-yellow-blue&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=OwYlSIK2GI3itAOh4rjEDQ&amp;sig=sL8j3zZHN6aWyDUgUAFHh764I3I }}&lt;/ref&gt; (traditional).

Tertiary colors have general names, one set of names for the RGB color wheel and a different set for the RYB color wheel. These names are shown below.

Another definition of tertiary color is provided by color theorists such as Moses Harris&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Natural System of Colours | author = Moses Harris | publisher = Laidler | year = 1766 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Colours-Facsimile-Perhaps-Literature/dp/B000KS0NZE }}&lt;/ref&gt;and Josef Albers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Interaction of Color | author = Josef Albers | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1963 | ISBN = 0-300-01846-0 | url = https://www.amazon.com/Interaction-Color-Revised-Josef-Albers/dp/0300018460/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;, who suggest that tertiary colors are created by intermixing pairs of [[secondary color]]s: orange-green, green-purple, purple-orange; or by intermixing [[complementary color]]s. This approach to tertiary color relates specifically to color in the form of paints, pigments and dyes. 

==RGB or CMY primary, secondary, and tertiary colors==
[[File:RBG color wheel.svg|thumb|300px|Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors of the RGB (CMY) color wheel.]]
The primary colors in an RGB color wheel are [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]], because these are the three [[additive color]]s—the primary colors of light. The secondary colors in an RGB color wheel are [[cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] because these are the three [[subtractive color]]s—the primary colors of pigment.

The tertiary color names used in the descriptions of [[RGB]] (or equivalently [[CMYK]]) systems are shown below.

==Traditional painting (RYB)==
[[File:Color star-en (tertiary names).svg|300px|thumb|A traditional [[RYB color model|RYB]] color wheel.]]
The primary colors in an [[RYB color model|RYB]] color wheel are [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]]. The secondary colors — [[Orange (colour)|orange]], [[green]], and [[purple]] — are made by combining the primary colors.

In the [[RYB color model|red–yellow–blue system]] as used in traditional painting and interior design, tertiary colors are typically named by combining the names of the adjacent primary and secondary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Human Evolution Coloring Book | author = Adrienne L.

===Tertiary- and quaternary-color terms===
{{anchor|Tertiary and quaternary color words}}
The terms for the RYB tertiary colors are not set. For the six RYB hues intermediate between the RYB primary and secondary colors, the names [[amber (color)|amber]]/marigold (yellow–orange), [[vermilion]]/cinnabar (red–orange), [[magenta]] (red–purple), [[violet (color)|violet]]/indigo (blue–purple), [[teal (color)|teal]]/aqua ([[blue-green]]), and [[chartreuse (color)|chartreuse]]/lime green (yellow–green) are commonly found. The names for the twelve quaternary colors are more variable, if they exist at all, though [[indigo]] and [[scarlet (color)|scarlet]] are standard for blue–violet and red–vermilion.

In another sense, a tertiary color is obtained by mixing secondary-colored pigments. These three colors are [[russet (color)|russet]] (orange–purple), [[slate gray|slate]] (purple–green), and [[citron (color)|citron]] (green–orange), with the corresponding three quaternary colors [[plum (color)|plum]] (russet–slate), [[sage (color)|sage]] (slate–citron), [[buff (colour)|buff]] (citron–russet) (with [[olive (color)|olive]] sometimes used for either slate or citron).&lt;ref&gt;William J. Miskella, 1928, ''Practical Color Simplified: A Handbook on Lacquering, Enameling, Coloring And Painting'', pp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lemos, 1920, "Color Charts for the School Room", in ''School Arts'', vol. 19, pp 580–584&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that are shades of grey (blue grey and brown greys), which approach but never quite reach black.

The RYB color terminology outlined above and in the color samples shown below is ultimately derived from the 1835 book ''Chromatography'', an analysis of the RYB color wheel by [[George Field (chemist)|George Field]], a chemist who specialized in pigments and dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Maerz and Paul | title = A Dictionary of Color | location = New York | date = 1930 | page = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of RGB and RYB color wheels==
Unlike the RGB (CMY) color wheel, the RYB color wheel has no scientific basis. The RYB color wheel was invented centuries before the 1890s, when it was found by experiment that magenta, yellow, and cyan are the primary colors of pigment, not red, yellow, and blue.

The RGB (CMY) color wheel has largely replaced the traditional RYB color wheel because it is possible to display much brighter and more saturated colors using the primary and secondary colors of the RGB (CMY) color wheel. In the terminology of [[color theory]], [[RGB color model|RGB color space]] ([[CMYK color model|CMY color space]]) has a much larger [[color gamut]] than [[RYB color model|RYB color space]].

'''''The Monk by the Sea''''' ({{lang-de|Der Mönch am Meer}}) is an [[oil painting]] by the [[German Romantic]] artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]]. It was painted between 1808 and 1810 in [[Dresden]] and was first shown together with the painting ''[[The Abbey in the Oakwood]]'' (''Abtei im Eichwald'') in the [[Akademie der Künste|Berlin Academy]] exhibition of 1810. On Friedrich's request ''The Monk by the Sea''  was hung above ''The Abbey in the Oakwood''.&lt;ref&gt;Held: Romantik, 2003, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; After the exhibition both pictures were bought by king [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick Wilhelm III]] for his collection.&lt;ref name="Friedrich 31"&gt;Friedrich, Norbert Wolf, Taschen, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Today the paintings hang side by side in the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]], [[Berlin]].

For its lack of concern with creating the illusion of depth, ''The Monk by the Sea'' was Friedrich's most radical composition. The broad expanses of sea and sky emphasize the meager figure of the monk, standing before the vastness of nature and the presence of God.&lt;ref name="vanProoyen"&gt;van Prooyen, Kristina. [https://oxford.academia.edu/KristinavanProoyen/Papers/93897/The_Realm_of_the_Spirit_Caspar_David_Friedrichs_artwork_in_the_context_of_romantic_theology_with_special_reference_to_Friedrich_Schleiermacher The Realm of the Spirit: Caspar David Friedrich's artwork in the context of romantic theology, with special reference to Friedrich Schleiermacher] ''Journal of the Oxford University History Society'', Winter 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

A single figure, dressed in a long garment, stands on a low dune sprinkled with grass. The figure, usually identified as a monk, has turned almost completely away from the viewer and surveys a rough sea and a gray, blank sky that takes up about three quarters of the picture. It is unclear whether he is standing on a high rock or only on a gentle slope to the sea. The dune forms an inexpressive triangle in the composition, at the farthest point of which is the figure. Contrasting with the dark ocean there are several whitecaps of waves sometimes mistaken for seagulls.

Although Friedrich's paintings are landscapes, he designed and painted them in his studio, using freely drawn [[plein air]] sketches, from which he chose the most evocative elements to integrate into an expressive composition. The composition of ''The Monk by the Sea'' shows evidence of this reductive process, as Friedrich removed elements from the canvas after they were painted. Recent scientific investigations have revealed that he had initially painted two small sailing ships on the horizon, which he later removed.&lt;ref name="Friedrich 31" /&gt; Friedrich continued to modify the details of the painting right up to its exhibition—to the sky's grey was added blue, with stars and a moon—but the basic composition always stayed the same.&lt;ref&gt;Die Briefe/ Caspar David Friedrich, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture appeared at a time when Friedrich had his first public success and critical acknowledgment with his controversial ''Tetschener Altar'', a work that explicitly fused the landscape format with a religious theme. ''The Monk by the Sea'' furthered his success and drew much attention.

Friedrich probably began the painting in Dresden, 1808. In a letter of February 1809, he described the image for the first time. The stages in its conception were also documented by guests to his studio. In June 1809, the wife of painter [[Gerhard von Kügelgen]], an acquaintance of Friedrich, visited him and later criticized the painting in a letter; she was put off by the loneliness of the setting and the lack of consolation that movement or narrative might provide the "unending space of air".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Linda |year=1978 |title=Caspar David Friedrich and the age of German Romanticism |publisher=Branden Books |page=73 |isbn=0-8283-1659-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian [[Albert Boime]] believed that the figure of the monk was Friedrich, walking on the cliffs at [[Rügen]], which would place the subject near the site where a Protestant mystic built a chapel for poor fishermen who were far from home and wished to profess their faith.&lt;ref&gt;Eisler, Colin. [http://www.artchive.com/artchive/F/friedrich.html ''Masterworks in Berlin: A City's Paintings Reunited''], Little Brown and Company, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of the monk as a self-portrait has been accepted by other scholars, both for physical resemblances to Friedrich (the long blond hair and round skull), and for the fact that, in keeping with the perception of artists as belonging to a "higher priesthood", Friedrich later painted himself in a monk's clothing.&lt;ref name="vanProoyen"/&gt;

== Contemporary reception ==

The painting was exhibited in its current form at the Berlin Academy in October 1810, to much controversy and criticism. The composition notably lacks a [[repoussoir]]—a framing device that leads the viewer's gaze into the image. Rather, the emptiness of the foreground is overwhelming. It is commonly argued that a viewer of this painting has difficulty relating himself to the picture's space. One cannot mentally "penetrate" the image: Friedrich has created an unbridgeable gap between the monk and the viewer. The monk is cut off from us spatially and existentially, and there are no traditional landscape elements that might soften the effect—only a cold sky and a flat foreground, void of greenery, and a dark sea, reduced to a narrow band on which no vessels sail. Friedrich has compressed space in a manner anticipating abstract art; ''The Monk by the Sea'' has been described as "perhaps the first 'abstract' painting in a very modern sense".&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller&lt;/ref&gt;

In the month of the exhibition, German Romantic author [[Clemens Brentano]] submitted an article on the painting to the ''Berliner Abendblätter'', a new daily journal edited by his friend [[Heinrich von Kleist]]. The piece, titled "Different Feelings about a Seascape by Friedrich on which is a Capuchin Monk",  was critical of the work, but Kleist substantially revised Brentano's text to produce an article sympathetic to Friedrich's painting. Kleist's commentary has become a central element in discussion of the painting and of Friedrich; the two men are seen as at odds with the aesthetic of the more conventional [[German Romantic]]s, in which Brentano was firmly entrenched.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

Kleist wrote, for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
How wonderful it is to sit completely alone by the sea under an overcast sky, gazing out over the endless expanse of water. It is essential that one has come there just for this reason, and that one has to return. That one would like to go over the sea but cannot; that one misses any sign of life, and yet one senses the voice of life in the rush of the water, in the blowing of the wind, in the drifting of the clouds, in the lonely cry of the birds ... No situation in the world could be more sad and eerie than this—as the only spark of life in the wide realm of death, a lonely center in a lonely circle... Nevertheless, this definitively marks a totally new departure in Friedrich's art...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted with translation in: {{cite book |last=Isham |first=Howard F. |year=2004 |title=Image of the sea: oceanic consciousness in the romantic century |publisher=Peter Lang |page=101 |isbn=0-8204-6727-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More famously, Kleist also wrote, "since in its monotony and boundlessness it has no foreground except the frame, when viewing it, it is as if one's eyelids had been cut away."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted with translation in: {{cite book |first1=Frederick |last1=Burwick |first2=Jürgen |last2=Klein |year=1996 |title=The Romantic imagination: literature and art in England and Germany |page=414 |isbn=90-420-0065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was too minimalist for [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who had been a supporter of Friedrich by introducing his work to the duke of Weimar and  gaining prizes for him at an 1805 exhibition. Goethe said the painting "could be looked at standing on one's head", making a criticism that would be levied against abstract artists a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Romantic Vision of Caspar David Friedrich: Paintings and Drawings from the U.S.S.R|editor1-first=Sabine |editor1-last=Rewald | publisher = Metropolitan Museum of Art | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-87099-603-7  | first1= Robert|last1= Rosenblum |first2= Boris I.|last2= Asvarishch|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==

[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], ''Harmony in blue and silver: Trouville'', 1865.]]

''The Monk by the Sea'' inspired responses from painters like [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] later in the 19th century. In works such as Gustave Courbet's ''The Coast Near Palavas'' a lone figure is depicted as a seeker, similarly exposed and looking out to sea.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marc-horse in a landscape.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Expressionist painter [[Franz Marc]]'s ''Horse in a Landscape'' bears formal similarities with ''The Monk by the Sea''.]]

Friedrich, though a Romantic painter, had a significant influence on later [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and [[Expressionist]] artists. [[Franz Marc]]'s ''Horse in a Landscape'' (1910) has been described as formally similar to ''The Monk by the Sea''. Although their use of colour is at two extremes, both paintings are compositionally simple, with undulating horizontals and a figure that looks out at the same scene as the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Braiterman |first=Zachary |year=2007 |title=The shape of revelation: aesthetics and modern Jewish thought |series=Stanford studies in Jewish history and culture |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=98 |isbn=0-8047-5321-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--begin substantial copy from CDF article:--&gt;In his 1961 article "The Abstract Sublime", the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and [[J.M.W. Turner|Turner]] with the [[Abstract Expressionist]] paintings of [[Mark Rothko]]. Rosenblum specifically describes ''The Monk by the Sea'', Turner's ''The Evening Star''&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction of Turner's ''The Evening Star'' here [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng1991]". [[National Gallery, London]]. Retrieved on November 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rothko's 1954 ''Light, Earth and Blue''&lt;ref&gt;See also, Geldzahler (1969), 353. Reproduction of the Rothko can be found here {{cite web |url=http://www.angel-art-house.com/oil_paintings_artists/r/RothkoMark/Light_Earth_and_Blue_1954.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201080419/http://www.angel-art-house.com/oil_paintings_artists/r/RothkoMark/Light_Earth_and_Blue_1954.htm |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, "Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us on the threshold of those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night."&lt;ref name="Rosenblum"&gt;Rosenblum, Robert. "The Abstract Sublime". Reprinted in: {{cite book |last=Geldzahler |first=Henry |title=New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970 |year=1969 |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |series=Exhibition catalog |lccn=71087179 |page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum goes on to say, "Like the mystic trinity of sky, water and earth that, in the Friedrich and Turner appears to emanate from one source, the floating horizontal tiers of veiled light in the Rothko seem to conceal a total, remote presence that we can only intuit and never fully grasp. These infinite glowing voids carry us beyond reason to the Sublime; we can only submit to them in an act of faith and let ourselves be absorbed into their radiant depths."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--end copy--&gt; From the 1960s on, [[Gotthard Graubner]]'s picture-size coloured cushions or "color-space bodies" were also inspired by Friedrich's ''The Monk by the Sea''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.landtag.nrw.de/portal/WWW/GB_II/II.1/OeA/Publikationen/Broschuere/Landtag_NRW_Raum_der_Stille_scr.pdf Raum der Stille im Landtag Nordrhein-Westfalen].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Schütz, "Color-Space Bodies: The Art of Gotthard Graubner", ''Arts Magazine'', Volume 65, April 1991, pp. 49-53.&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Werner Hofmann (art historian)|Werner Hofmann]], both Graubner and Friedrich created an aesthetics of monotony as a counterpart to the aesthetics of variety that was predominant before the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/1975/52/kissenkunst-zerrissene-realitaet/seite-2 "Kissenkunst, zerrissene Realität"], ''Die Zeit'', 19 December 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7582">[[File:Reptil Parc Guell Barcelona.jpg|thumb|350px|Dragon with trencadís at the entrance of [[Parc Güell]] overlooking [[Barcelona]].]]
'''Trencadís'''  ({{IPA-va|tɾəŋkəˈðis}}), also known as '''pique assiette''', '''broken tile mosaics''', '''bits and pieces''', '''memoryware''', and '''shardware''', is a type of [[mosaic]] made from cemented-together tile shards and broken chinaware.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=ebay /&gt; Glazed china tends to be preferred, and glass is sometimes mixed in as well, as are other small materials like buttons and shells. Artists working in this form may create random designs, pictorial scenes, geometric patterns, or a hybrid of any of these.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;

Although as a folk art the method itself may be centuries old, the two most commonly used terms are both of modern origin. Trencadís, a Valencian term that means 'chopped', is the name for this method as it was revived in early 20th century [[Valencian modernism]] and [[Catalan modernism]], while pique assiette is a more general name for the technique that comes from the French language. In French, pique assiette ('plate thief') is a term for a scrounger or sponger, and thus as a name for this mosaic technique, it refers to the recycled or 'scrounged' nature of the materials.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=ebay /&gt;

== Technique ==
Traditional mosaics, such as classical Roman floors, are made up of individual [[tesserae]], usually small cubes that are uniformly shaped and designed for their intended use. Trencadís differs in that the tesserae are nonuniform pieces broken from tiles and chinaware originally made for other uses. Trencadís is thus a form of [[bricolage]], [[found object]] art, or recycled art.

There are two main methods for trencadís. In the first, an initial design is drawn up and the ceramic fragments are carefully fitted into the design; in this case, the mosaic is only cemented together once all of the fragments have been placed. Alternatively, an artist may spontaneously arrange fragments without a prior design; here the success of the finished work depends greatly on their improvisation skills.

== Notable artists and works ==

=== Demetrio Ribes ===

The Valencian architec Demetrio Ribes used trencadís extensively for decoration in the hall of [[Valencia's|Valencia]] [[Estació del Nord (Valencia)|North Station]] in 1907.

=== Antoni Gaudí and  Josep Maria Jujol ===
The Catalan modernist architects [[Antoni Gaudí]] and  [[Josep Maria Jujol]] used trencadís in many projects, among which [[Barcelona]]'s [[Parc Güell]] (1900–1914) is probably the most famous. Gaudí's first use of this technique was at the [[Güell Pavilions]], where the sinuous architecture forced him to break the tiles in order to cover the curved surfaces.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Gaudí tended to create patterns with his trencadís work, and he leaned towards brightly colored glazed ceramic shards. He often used discarded pieces of ceramic tile collected from the factory Pujol i Bausis located in [[Esplugues de Llobregat]], as well as pieces of white ceramic from broken cups and plates discarded by other Spanish manufacturers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Raymond Edouard Isadore ===
In France, the term pique assiette is most closely associated with Raymond Edouard Isadore (1900–1964) a French graveyard sweeper and folk artist. Starting in the late 1930s, he spent 30 years covering both the inside and outside of his house as well as his furniture and his garden walls with mosaics.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;&lt;ref name=chartres /&gt; He found his materials in the surrounding fields and quarries, in the public dump, and at auctions.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt; This habit of scavenging earned him the nickname "pique assiette" later shortened to "picassiette".&lt;ref name=chartres /&gt;

Isadore, a very religious man, created many of his mosaic scenes with Christian personages and symbols.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt; He also built a "sweeper's throne" and a "sweeper's tomb" covered in pique assiette.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt; As the mosaics expanded, the project became more widely known, and in 1954, [[Pablo Picasso]] visited Isadore's house.&lt;ref name=atlas /&gt; Today, the house is a tourist attraction near [[Chartres]] known as "Maison Picassiette".&lt;ref name=Jacobsen /&gt;

=== Watts Towers ===
{{Main|Watts Towers}}
The [[Watts Towers]] in Los Angeles were built over a period of 30 years by [[Simon Rodia]], a construction worker and tile mason. Begun in 1921, the 17 interconnected towers were decorated with fragments of porcelain, tile, glass, seashells and other found objects. Rodia built them without a premade plan, using damaged pieces from local tile companies and materials scavenged by neighborhood children.

=== Bridge of the Dragon ===
A contemporary example is the Bridge of the Dragon, which crosses the [[Guadaíra]] River at [[Alcalá de Guadaíra]].&lt;ref name=dragon /&gt; The bridge's support structure emulates a dragon's body and is covered in trencadís.&lt;ref name=dragon /&gt; Designed by engineer José Luis Manzanares, it was directly inspired by Gaudí's dragon fountain in Parc Güell.&lt;ref name=dragon /&gt;

=== Memory jugs ===
{{Main|Memory jug}}
A related form is the [[memory jug]], an American [[folk art]] form that memorializes the dead.&lt;ref name=eafa/&gt; The memory jug is a vessel with a mosaic-like surface decoration of glass and ceramic shards, seashells, trinkets, coins and other small objects, especially objects associated with a specific dead person.&lt;ref name=eafa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabler /&gt; Most known examples date back no further than the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=eafa/&gt;

'''Unbreakable glass''' is [[glass]], or glass substitute, which does not display the normal fragility of glass - in general the term is not used to refer to something that is absolutely unbreakable.

==In history==
A number of ancient writers tell the story of the inventor who approached the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] with his invention of unbreakable glass.  Tiberius asked if anyone else  was aware of the  invention.  When the inventor replied that he was the only person who knew the secret, Tiberius had him killed.  The motivation, according to Reynolds, was to protect the livelihood of the glassmakers.&lt;ref name="Reynolds 2002"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Terry S.

[[File:Bringing up baby film still.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Film still]] from the 1938 film ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]''  featuring [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Cary Grant]]  ]]
A '''unit still photographer''', or simply '''still photographer''', is a person who creates [[film still]]s, still [[Photography|photographic]] images specifically intended for use in the marketing and publicity of feature [[film]]s in the motion picture industry and network [[television]] productions.&lt;ref name="Dzyak2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Dzyak|title=What I Really Want to Do on Set in Hollywood: A Guide to Real Jobs in the Film Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWY6Ej4fO1QC&amp;pg=PA303|year= 2010|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-87516-7|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Larry Goldman|title=The professional photographer: developing a successful career|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7k4YAQAAMAAJ|page=117|year= 1983|publisher=Doubleday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerrigan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Finola Kerrigan|title=Film Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbWKtM-L-ugC&amp;pg=PT243|year= 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-44000-7|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides creating photographs for the promotion of a film, the still photographer contributes daily to the filming process by creating set stills. With these, the photographer is careful to record all details of cast wardrobe, set appearance and background.  The director and assistants review these images frequently for continuity and matching of all stage aspects.&lt;ref&gt;"Still Photography in the Motion Picture Industry" by Ned Scott&gt;: http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/authorship.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornel Lucas]], a pioneer of film portraiture in the 1940s and 1950s, was the first still photographer to be awarded a [[BAFTA]], in 1998, for work with the [[British Film Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cornel Lucas: Photographer who made his name as a pioneer of film portraiture - Obituaries |newspaper=The Independent| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cornel-lucas-photographer-who-made-his-name-as-a-pioneer-of-film-portraiture-8399597.html|author=Martin Childs|date=11 December 2012| accessdate = 2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DawsonHolmes2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Dawson|author2=Sean Holmes|title=Working in the Global Film and Television Industries: Creativity, Systems, Space, Patronage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yixuaRMJ6tIC&amp;pg=PT136|date=2 August 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78093-021-3|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in the industry ==
Using individual [[Film frame|frames]] from film or recorded video material is not practical due to their relatively low quality. Much higher resolution images are therefore used. Typically, the end uses of these still photos include the film's theatrical release poster, [[DVD]] box artwork, the official web site photos, [[billboard]]s, [[bus stop]] adverts, [[Point of sale|point-of-purchase]] displays, key art image sets released to the press and media, and other printed and online collateral materials.

Unit still photographers are also responsible for creating "photo [[Theatrical property|props]]" and "set dressing images", the photos and images used on-camera to create various [[illusion]]s such as [[Forensic science|forensic photos]], crime drama booking photos, character driver's licenses, [[passport]] and I.D. photos, on-screen family photos, surveillance photos, computer screen displays, and any other image a producer may require in the course of a production.

In [[North America]] in particular, and some international locations, a unit still photographer must be a member of [[International Cinematographers Guild|IATSE Local 600 International Cinematographers Guild]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} in order to perform services on union productions and union studio lots and locations.  The most prestigious of these unit still photographers are members of The Society of Motion Picture Still Photographers, an organization which promotes the work of those within the industry.

While often perceived as a "glamour" job for photographers, the reality is often long hours (70-plus hours per week) on remote locations under difficult and often extreme conditions.  The unit still photographer often coordinates with the unit publicist, but physically works in close proximity to the film's [[Film crew|camera crew]], [[Film director|director]] and [[actor]]s, and also in close proximity to the film's boom microphone operator. Unit still photographers go to great lengths to muffle the sound of their camera's [[motor drive]] and [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] to avoid distracting the actors, and to remain inaudible on the film's recorded dialogue soundtrack.

Typically, this is accomplished using a [[sound blimp]], which is a sound-absorbing, foam-filled metal case in which the still camera body is fitted with a proprietary remote operation cable. This allows the camera to be activated and operated from a two-button (activation, focus and shutter release) exterior control. Limitations exist once the blimp is closed around the camera, as one can no longer access the cameras controls ([[f-number]], shutter speed, ASA/[[Film speed|ISO]] settings) or menu displays directly. The [[Liquid crystal display|LCD display]] for reviewing the images will also be obscured in the closed position.  This requires the photographer to make control selections in advance, and use with those settings until the take in progress has been "cut", making adjustments only between takes or set-ups. Unit still photographers in this field typically produce over 2000 marketable images per week for their major-studio clients. Still photography involves the use of alignment, positioning, and other techniques to capture the "money shot". Still-life photography is the depiction of inanimate subject matter, most typically a small grouping of objects that are either human-made or natural.

Since 2010, high-end [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR cameras]], which can be remotely controlled with [[mobile apps]] on [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s, using the built-in 2-way [[Wi-Fi]] radio-controlled interface between the tablet and the DSLR camera, and offer internal [[active noise control|''active noise reduction'']] technologies, have increased the ability of the unit still photographer to work quietly on the set.
