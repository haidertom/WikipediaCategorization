'''Articulatory gestures''' are the actions necessary to enunciate language.   Examples of articulatory gestures are the hand movements necessary to enunciate sign language and the mouth movements of speech.   In [[semiotic]] terms, they are the physical embodiment (signifiers) of speech signs, which are gestural by nature (see below).

The definition of ''[[gesture]]'' varies greatly, but here it will be taken in its widest sense, namely, any meaningful action.   An intentional action is meaningful if it is not strictly utilitarian: for example, sending flowers to a friend is a gesture, because this action is performed not only for the purpose of moving flowers from one place to another, but also to express some sentiment or even a conventional message in the [[language of flowers]].  Use of the broadest definition of gesture (not restricted to hand movements) allows [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]]’s  “rapid fading” [[design features of language | design feature of human language]] to be accommodated as a type of sign in semiotic theory.

But if an articulatory gesture is to be considered a true gesture in the above sense, it must be meaningful.   Therefore, an articulatory gesture must be at least as large as the smallest meaningful unit of language, the morpheme.  A morpheme corresponds roughly to a spoken word or a sign language gesture.   

This definition differs from the practice, common among linguists,  of referring to phonemes (meaningless mouth movements) as articulatory gestures (see [[articulatory phonology]]).   In [[semiotics]], meaningless components of spoken gestures (written as individual letters), or meaningless components of sign language gestures (such as location of hand contact) are known as [[figurae]], the constituents of signs.    

It also differs from the tradition of considering speech sounds to be the signifiers of speech signs.  But this practice confuses signals with symbols.  Sound and light are analogue signals, whereas mouth and hand gestures are discrete symbolic entities.  A sound or light signal is subject to random noise, whereas the image of the gesture is subject to regular [[image distortion | distortion]], as when a signer’s hand is viewed from different angles. In speech, the sound of the contact of the tongue in the letter T can be distorted by surrounding mouth movements, as in the phrase “perfect memory”.  When pronounced at conversational speed, the sound of the tongue contact is completely obscured by surrounding consonants even though this T movement is fully carried out.

Articulatory gestures, when seen as the physical embodiment of speech and sign language symbols, provide a link between these two language types, and show how speech resembles sign language more closely than is generally presumed.

The '''Bezalel school''' was an [[art movement]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the late Ottoman and [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] periods.  Named for the Bezalel Art School, predecessor of the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]], it has been described as "a fusion of [[Asian art|oriental art]] and [[Jugendstil]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artatthecenter.com/HTML/Artists.cfm?ID=35 AATC Artists - Ze'ev Raban]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bezalel school artists blended varied strands of surroundings, tradition and innovationin paintings and craft objects that  invoked biblical themes, Islamic design and European traditions in their effort to carve out a distinctive style of Jewish art for the new nation planned in the ancient Jewish homeland.&lt;ref&gt;MUSEUM REVIEW | DERFNER JUDAICA MUSEUM, Jewish Art, the Hudson and Bingo in the Bronx, [[Edward Rothstein]], ''The New York Times'', June 10, 2009, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/arts/design/11muse.html?_r=1&amp;ref=arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the school was [[Boris Schatz]], who left his position as  head of the Royal Academy of Arts in Sofia, Bulgaria, to make aliyah 1906 and established an academy for Jewish arts in [[Jerusalem]].  The artists were Zionist immigrants from Europe and the Middle East, with all the psychological and social upheaval that this implies.&lt;ref&gt;Bezalel School turns 100 years old, by Shulamit Reinharz, Jewish Advocate, Tuesday March 4, 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.thejewishadvocate.com/this_weeks_issue/columnists/reinharz/?content_id%3D2076 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207235245/http://www.thejewishadvocate.com/this_weeks_issue/columnists/reinharz/?content_id=2076 |archivedate=2007-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement developed a distinctive style combining Biblical and Zionist subjects with [[art nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]  and traditional Persian and Syrian artistry.&lt;ref&gt;SOTHEBY'S BEZALEL AND ISRAELIANA CATALOG, TEL-AVIV, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bezalel School produced decorative art objects in a wide range of materials: silver, leather, wood, brass and fabric. While the artists and designers were European-trained, the craftsmen who executed the works were often members of the [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite Jewish community]], which had a long tradition of craftsmanship in precious metals, and began to make aliyah about 1880. In Yemen, filigree jewelry making was a respected profession among the Jews, with cultural as well as religious applications. [[Yemenite Jewish silversmiths]] worked primarily with silver, creating pieces by hand using traditional methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyndiesstudiodesigns.com/filigreehistory.html A History of Filigree]&lt;/ref&gt; Yemenite immigrants wearing colorful traditional costumes were also frequent subjects of Bezalel School artists.

Leading members of the school were Boris Schatz, [[Ephraim Moses Lilien|E. M. Lilien]], [[Ya'akov Stark]], [[Meir Gur-Aryeh]], [[Ze'ev Raban]], [[Jacob Eisenberg]], [[Jacob Steinhardt]], [[Shmuel Ben David]], and [[Hermann Struck]].

The artists produced not only paintings and etchings, but objects sold as Judaica and souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.absolutearts.com/artsnews/2000/08/25/27362.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, ''[[The New York Times]]''  praised the “Exquisite examples of filigree work, copper inlay, carving in ivory and in wood,” in a touring exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;REVIVE JEWISH ARTISTRY.; Bezalel School of Jerusalem Shows Distinctive Works of Art, ''The New York Times'', Nov. 14, 1915  query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30D15FF3A5812738DDDAD0994D9415B858DF1D3&lt;/ref&gt;

In the metalwork Moorish patterns predominated, and the damascene work, in particular, showed both artistic feeling and skill in execution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F04E3DF1E39E633A2575AC0A9679C946596D6CF, Work of Bezalel School of Handicrafts, ''The New York Times'', Jan. 9, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">'''Bioclimatology''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of science that studies the interactions between the [[biosphere]] and the [[Earth's atmosphere]] on time scales of the order of seasons or longer (by opposition to [[biometeorology]]).

==Examples of relevant processes==

[[Climate]] processes largely control the distribution, size, shape and properties of living organisms on [[Earth]]. For instance, the general circulation of the atmosphere on a planetary scale broadly determines the location of large [[desert]]s or the regions subject to frequent [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], which, in turn, greatly determine which organisms can naturally survive in these environments. Furthermore, changes in climates, whether due to natural processes or to human interferences, may progressively modify these [[Habitat (ecology)|habitats]] and cause [[overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]] or [[extinction]] of indigenous species.

The biosphere, for its part, and in particular continental [[vegetation]], which constitutes over 99% of the total [[biomass]], has played a critical role in establishing and maintaining the chemical composition of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], especially during the early evolution of the planet (See [[History of Earth]] for more details on this topic). Currently, the terrestrial vegetation exchanges some 60 billion tons of [[carbon]] with the atmosphere on an annual basis (through processes of [[carbon fixation]] and [[carbon respiration]]), thereby playing a critical role in the [[carbon cycle]]. On a global and annual basis, small imbalances between these two major fluxes, as do occur through changes in [[land cover]] and [[land use]], contribute to the current increase in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]].

'''Bureau-shaping''' is a [[rational choice]] model of [[bureaucracy]] and a response to the [[budget-maximization model]]. It argues that rational officials will not want to maximize their [[budget]]s, but instead to shape their agency so as to maximize their personal utilities from their work. For instance, bureaucrats would prefer to work in small, [[elite]] agencies close to political [[Power centre (retail)|power centre]]s and doing interesting work, rather than to run large-budget agencies with many staff but also many risks and problems. For the same reasons, and to avoid risks, the bureau-shaping model also predicts that senior government bureaucrats will often favour either 'agencification' to other public sector bodies (as in the UK 'Next Steps' programme) or off-loading functions to contractors and privatization. In the health and social work fields, officials will favour 'deinstitutionalization' and 'care in the community'. The model was developed by [[Patrick Dunleavy]] from the [[London School of Economics]] in ''Democracy, Bureaucracy and Public Choice'' (London:  Pearson Education, 1991, reissued 2001).

It was propounded in response to William Niskanen's harsh criticism of Public Bureaucracies in his Budget Maximising Model. The Niskanen model predicts that in representative democracies, public bureaucracies will not only generate allocative inefficiency (by '''oversupplying''' public goods) but also x-inefficiency (by producing public goods inefficiently). It is evident that the Niskanen model is heavily reliant on an American institutional milieu. Patrick Dunleavy, a British political scientist who set out to demolish the public choice arguments on bureaucracy, came instead in the end to develop a public choice model of bureaucratic behaviour which combines elements of Peacock’s insight with the original American model. The Dunleavy (1985, p.&amp;nbsp;300) model of public bureaucracy is built on six basic assumptions. The first three are consistent with Niskanen’s model:

(i) bureau policies are set by bureaucrats interacting with the government;

(ii) governments largely depend on information from bureaus about the costs and value of producing within given ranges of output; and

(iii) bureaucrats maximise their personal utilities (by satisfying "self-regarding, relatively hard-edged preferences") when making official decisions.

Added to these are two 4 assumptions which greatly weaken the budget-maximising conclusion. These are that a bureau’s aggregate policy behaviour is set by some combination of individual decisions made by its officials, although the actual combination that results may be an outcome desired by no bureau member; and that, within broad limits, officials’ influence on bureau policy is always correlated with rank and those nearest the top of bureaus are the most influential. Dunleavy therefore discards Niskanen’s assumption that a bureau’s behaviour will be wholly in line with the preferences of a single senior bureaucrat. In a bureau, where no individual has complete hegemony, budget maximisation is a collective, not an individual good. Rational utility maximising individuals will thus tend to favour strategies that directly advance their personal interests ahead of strategies that advance the collective good. The interaction of the maximising activities of individuals within a bureau will not necessarily lead to budget maximizing.

The '''Camphill Movement''' is an initiative for social change based on the principles of [[anthroposophy]]. Camphill [[Intentional community|communities]] are residential communities and schools that provide support for the education, employment, and daily lives of adults and children with [[developmental disabilities]], mental health problems, or other special needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/2013-10-05/news/42721660_1_camphill-soltane-disabilities-communities At Camphill Kimberton, crafting a different way to live - Pilly.com 2013-10-05]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 100 Camphill communities in more than 20 countries across [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Southern Africa]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://camphill.net/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310010325/http://camphill.net/# |archive-date=2015-03-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
The movement was founded in 1939 at Kirkton House near [[Aberdeen]] by a group that included [[Austria]]n [[paediatrician]] [[Karl König]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Jackson, The role of [[social pedagogy]] in the training of residential child care workers, ''Journal of Intellectual Disabilities'', 2006 Vol. 10, No. 1, 61-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Holistic Special Education: Camphill Principles and Practice''. 2006, Floris Books, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; It was König's view that every human being possessed a healthy inner personality that was independent of their physical characteristics, including characteristics marking developmental or mental disability, and the role of the school was to recognize, nurture and educate this essential self.&lt;ref name="MH"/&gt; The communities' philosophy, [[anthroposophy]], states that "a perfectly formed spirit and destiny belong to each human being."&lt;ref name="BPR"&gt;Busalle, Rebecca, Cornelius Pietzner, and Stephan Rasch.

==History==
The Camphill Movement takes its name from Camphill Estate in the [[Milltimber]] area of [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]], where the Camphill pioneers moved to with their first community for [[Special education in the United Kingdom|children with special needs]] in June 1940. Camphill Estate is now{{when|date=September 2013}} a campus of Camphill School Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071114201243/http://www.prpartnership.co.uk/home/default_press.asp?pageid=247 Report Demonstrates Standards of Excellence at Aberdeen Special Needs School], press release, 12 September 2007.

'''Colored music notation''' is a technique used to facilitate enhanced learning in young music students by adding visual color to written musical notation.  It is based upon the concept that color can affect the observer in various ways, and combines this with standard learning of basic notation.

==Basis==
Viewing [[color]] has been widely shown to change an individual's [[Emotion|emotional state]] and stimulate [[neurons]].  The [[Lüscher color test]] observes from experiments that when individuals are required to contemplate pure red for varying lengths of time, [the experiments] have shown that this color decidedly has a stimulating effect on the [[nervous system]]; [[blood pressure]] increases, and [[respiration rate]] and [[heart rate]] both increase.  Pure blue, on the other hand, has the reverse effect; observers experience a decline in blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing.&lt;ref name="poast"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poast |first=Michael |date=June 2000 |title=Color Music: Visual Color Notation for Musical Expression  |journal=Leonardo |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=215–21 |jstor=1577047 |doi=10.1162/002409400552531}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given these findings, it has been suggested{{by whom|date=November 2014}} that the influence of colored musical notation would be similar.

==Music education==
In [[music education]], color is typically used in method books to highlight new material.  Stimuli received through several senses excite more neurons in several localized areas of the cortex, thereby reinforcing the learning process and improving retention.&lt;ref name="rogers-91"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=George L. |title=Effect of Color-Coded Notation on Music Achievement of Elementary Instrumental Students |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education  |volume=39 |issue=1 |year=1991 |pages=64–73 |jstor=3344609 |doi=10.2307/3344609}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information has been proven by other researchers; Chute (1978) reported that "elementary students who viewed a colored version of an instructional film scored significantly higher on both immediate and delayed tests than did students who viewed a monochrome version".&lt;ref name="rogers-96"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=George L. |title=Effect of Colored Rhythmic Notation on Music-Reading Skills of Elementary Students |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education |volume=44 |issue=1 |year=1996 |pages=15–25 |jstor=3345410 |doi=10.2307/3345410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color studies==

===Effect on achievement===

A researcher in this field, George L. Rogers is the Director of [[Music Education]] at [[Westfield State College]].  He is also the author of 25 articles in publications that include the Music Educators Journal, The Instrumentalist, and the Journal of Research in Music Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Faculty Listing |publisher=[[Westfield State College]] |url=http://www.wsc.ma.edu/music/faculty/default.asp?who= |accessdate=2006-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006124206/http://www.wsc.ma.edu/music/faculty/default.asp?who= |archivedate=October 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, George L. Rogers did a study that researched the effect of color-coded notation on music achievement of elementary instrumental students.  Rogers states that the color-coded notation used in this study was not meant to replace the present notational system; rather, it was intended as a pedagogical aid for beginners.&lt;ref name="rogers-91"/&gt;

The subjects used for this study were 92 fifth- and sixth-grade beginner [[wind instrument]] players who attended two different schools.  The experimental group used color-coded method books and supplementary materials in which each different pitch was highlighted with a different color using felt-tip markers.  The control group used identical materials, but with the notation uncolored.  The students were then tested in three different parts: 
# Students performed a 26-note melody from memory (The materials were presented either in color or uncolored notation).
# Students [[Sight reading|sight-read]] two 12-note melodies (One melody was presented in color-coded notation, the other uncolored. The students were then asked which notation was easier to play).
# Students named the letter names of the notes in two 7-note melodies.&lt;ref name="rogers-91"/&gt;

The results of this study are as follows:  Subjects in the experimental and [[Scientific control|control groups]] performed much the same on the task of playing music from memory.   For the task of sight-reading, the experimental group scored higher than did the control group.  However, the control group (without color-coded notation) scored higher when sight-reading uncolored notation.  In fact, the students who learned using color-coded notation scored significantly lower when sight-reading plain notation.

A possible theory regarding these results is that the students in the experimental group memorized the colors instead of the notation.  The third task of note naming seemed to be less of a challenge for the control group who learned to read notation than the experimental group who learned which color is which fingering on their instrument.  In regards to which type of notation was easier to read, in the experimental group all but three found the color-coded notation easier to play, in the control group 18 out of the 46 chose color-coded notation also easier to read.  This is a deviation from standard findings, as most students prefer the method they were first introduced to.&lt;ref name="rogers-91"/&gt;

===Effect on music-reading skills===

In 1996, Rogers did another study researching the effect of colored [[rhythm|rhythmic notation]] on the music-reading skills of elementary students.   Rogers states that the purpose of studying the effect of colored rhythmic notation was to determine if instruction involving the addition of color to standard rhythmic notation would affect the performance of elementary music students on the task of clapping and vocalizing rhythmic exercises on sight.  The subjects of this study were 134 first- and second-grade general music students. The two particular schools involved in the experiment were chosen because most students attending were dealing with notation intensively for the first time.&lt;ref name="rogers-96"/&gt;

The experimental subjects participated in vocalizing and clapping rhythms notated with colored chalk on the chalkboard as a regular part of general music classes.  Control subjects read, vocalized and clapped identical rhythms noted in white chalk.  In the experimental group, contrasting colors were used to notate the different rhythmic values.  The colors used were arbitrary and changed from week to week (so no one color was identified with a particular note or rest).

The students used the [[Cheve]] rhythm syllables, consisting of ''ta''’s for quarter notes and ''ti-ti''’s for [[Note value|eighth notes]]. The students were tested by sight-reading two exercises from a chalkboard and clapping and vocalizing the rhythmic notation.  One test was in colored rhythmic notation and the other was uncolored.  The students performed the two exercises involving similar rhythms, with colored notation being applied randomly to either the first or second task.&lt;ref name="rogers-96"/&gt;
			
The results of this study are as follows:  Students in both experimental and control groups scored well, with a combined mean for all subjects of 10.66 out of 12 points.  Students who experienced colored rhythmic notation during the treatment period scored somewhat higher as a group on both tasks.&lt;ref name="rogers-96"/&gt;

===Special needs students===
Students who need academic assistance are often students who have [[Learning disability|learning disorders]].  Kent Gerlach clarifies some of the symptoms of learning disorders, and establishes that certain difficulties arise, particularly with the following:

*Poor [[visual memory]] – forgetting what has been seen or read.
*Poor visual discrimination, especially when distinguishing between squares and rectangles, circles and ovals, the letters m, r, h, n, r, p, b, d, g, and q, and the numbers 6 and 9, 21 and 12.
*Poor figure ground – difficulty selecting one thing from a group, such as a particular letter in a word or word in a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerlach |first=Kent |title=Individuals with Special Needs |publisher=Pacific Training Associates |location=[[Seattle, WA]] |oclc=57378072}}{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogers found that during the 1991 study on the effects of color-coded notation on music achievement of elementary instrumental students that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The high level of dependence on color-coding among learning disabled and [[Developmental disability|mentally handicapped]] students may reflect a situation similar to that reported by Chute in which students of different ability levels were affected differently by the presence or absence of color in instructional materials. Not only did the learning-disabled and mentally handicapped students in the experimental group score much higher on the tasks that involved color-coded notation than on the uncolored notation, but it also appeared that the color-coded notation enabled them to score as high as or higher than the other students"&lt;ref name="rogers-91"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He suggests that the scores of students identified as receiving extra academic assistance were examined separately and were found to be lower than the overall student sample, but were otherwise similar to the means for all students.&lt;ref name="rogers-96"/&gt;

==Findings==
As a result of these experiments, colored notation does seem to help early music students to learn notation and rhythms more than students with uncolored notation. In Rogers' 1991 study of color-coded notation, it is clear that students relied more heavily on the colors that were assigned to the notation, rather than on learning the notation.  However, as the students were able to easily tell the different notes apart, perhaps by using different colors that are not assigned to a note, the experimental students would have been able to read not only the colored notation better but also the uncolored notation.  Rogers did change the second study, in 1996, making the colors arbitrary.  While the obvious disadvantage of memorization from the 1991 study exists, the overall findings of the study were that colored musical notation is an inexpensive and effective tool when used with young music students.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The [[conservation ethic]] is based on the findings of conservation biology.

== Origins ==

The term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with the convening of "The First International Conference on Research in Conservation Biology" held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in La Jolla, California in 1978 led by American biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and [[Michael E. Soulé]] with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and conservationists including [[Kurt Benirschke]], Sir [[Otto Frankel]], [[Thomas Lovejoy]], and [[Jared Diamond]]. The meeting was prompted by the concern over [[tropical deforestation]], disappearing species, eroding [[genetic diversity]] within species.&lt;ref&gt;J. Douglas. 1978. Biologists urge US endowment for conservation. Nature Vol. 275, 14 September 1978. Kat Williams . 1978. Natural Sciences. Science News. September 30, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference and proceedings that resulted&lt;ref name=ConsBiol80/&gt; sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Organization of the meeting itself also entailed bridging a gap between genetics and ecology. Soulé, was an evolutionary geneticist working with wheat geneticist Sir Otto Frankel to advance [[conservation genetics]] as a new field at the time. [[Jared Diamond]], who suggested the idea for a conference to Wilcox was concerned with the application of community ecology and island biogeography theory to conservation. Wilcox and [[Thomas Lovejoy]], who together initiated planning for the conference in June 1977 when Lovejoy secured a commitment of seed funding at [[World Wildlife Fund]], felt both genetics and ecology should be represented. Wilcox suggested use of a new term  ''conservation biology'', complementing Frankel's conception and coining of "conservation genetics",  to encompass the application of biological sciences in general to conservation. Subsequently, Soulé and Wilcox wrote conceived the agenda for the meeting they jointly convened on September 6–9, 1978, titled ''First International Conference on Resesarch in Conservation Biology'', in which the program described "The purpose of this conference is to accelerate and facilitate the development of a rigorous new discipline called conservation biology -- a multidisciplinary field drawing its insights and methodology mostly from population ecology, community ecology, sociobiology, population genetics, and reproductive biology." This inclusion of topics at the meeting related to animal breeding reflected participation and support of the zoo and captive breeding communities.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity ([[biodiversity]]) emerged together, helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and [[National Environmental Policy Act|policy]].  The inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science, [[conservation behavior]] and conservation physiology.&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooke |first1=S. J. |last2=Sack |first2=L. |last3=Franklin |first3=C. E. |last4=Farrell |first4=A. P. |last5=Beardall |first5=J. |last6=Wikelski |first6=M. |last7=Chown |first7=S.

== Description ==

Conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of [[biodiversity loss]], species [[extinction]]s, and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to [[Sustainability|sustain]] the well-being of human society. Conservation biologists work in the field and office, in government, universities, non-profit organizations and industry. The topics of their research are diverse, because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences. Those dedicated to the cause and profession [[advocate]] for a global response to [[Holocene extinction|the current biodiversity crisis]] based on [[morals]], [[ethics]], and scientific [[reason]]. Organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research, monitoring, and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales.&lt;ref name="Soule86"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;

=== Natural resource conservation ===

Conscious efforts to conserve and protect ''global'' biodiversity are a recent phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|title=Biodiversity protection and preservation|website=www.ffem.fr|access-date=2016-10-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018140452/http://www.ffem.fr/lang/en/accueil-FFEM/activites-ffem/biodiversite_protection|archive-date=2016-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural resource conservation, however, has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation. Resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature. Regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained, therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; This social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hardin G |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–8 |date=December 1968 |pmid=5699198 |url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175825/http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/dees/V1003/lectures/population/Tragedy%20of%20the%20Commons.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also considered to be a consequence of evolution, where individual selection is favored over group selection.

From this principle, conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt; For example, the Alaskan [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] peoples and the [[Haida people|Haida]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] had resource boundaries, rules, and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of [[sockeye salmon]]. These rules were guided by clan elders who knew lifelong details of each river and stream they managed.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;Mason, Rachel and Judith Ramos. (2004).

The Mauryan emperor [[Ashoka]] around 250 B.C. issued edicts restricting the slaughter of animals and certain kinds of birds, as well as opened veterinary clinics.

Conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings. There are examples in the [[Tao]], [[Shinto]], [[Hindu]], [[Islamic]] and [[Buddhist]] traditions.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Primack 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last = Primack | first =Richard B. | title = A Primer of Conservation Biology, 3rd ed. | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year= 2004 | pages = 320pp. | isbn = 0-87893-728-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek philosophy, Plato lamented about pasture [[land degradation]]: "What is left now is, so to say, the skeleton of a body wasted by disease; the rich, soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, E., and H.

Wilderness was denigrated while agricultural development was praised.&lt;ref name="Evans97"&gt;{{cite book |author=Evans, David |title=A history of nature conservation in Britain |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-415-14491-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as early as AD 680 a [[wildlife sanctuary]] was founded on the [[Farne Islands]] by [[St Cuthbert]] in response to his religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="Dyke08" /&gt;

=== Early naturalists ===

[[File:White Gerfalcons.jpg|thumb|right|upright|White [[gyrfalcon]]s drawn by [[John James Audubon]] ]]

[[Natural history]] was a major preoccupation in the 18th century, with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. By 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in [[Germany]], 250 in [[Great Britain]], 250 in the [[United States]], and 300 in [[France]].&lt;ref name="Farber00"&gt;{{cite book |author=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Finding order in nature: the naturalist tradition from Linnaeus to E. O. Wilson |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2000 |isbn=0-8018-6390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservationist or conservationist sentiments are a development of the late 18th to early 20th centuries.

Before Charles Darwin set sail on HMS ''Beagle'', most people in the world, including Darwin, believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biology|last=Mader|first=Sylvia|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2016|isbn=978-0-07-802426-9|location=New York, NY|page=262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George-Louis Leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief. He proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Erasmus Darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved. Erasmus Darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species' ancestors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The thinking of these early 18th century naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalist.

By the early 19th century [[biogeography]] was ignited through the efforts of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Charles Lyell]] and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.uwindsor.ca/courses/biology/macisaac/55-437/intro.htm|title=Introduction to Conservation Biology and Biogeography|website=web2.uwindsor.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors.&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt; Although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and [[Environmental organization|conservation organizations]], their writings, by modern standards, showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections.&lt;ref name="Farber00" /&gt;

=== Conservation movement ===
{{Main article|Conservation movement}}

The modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period particularly in [[England]] and [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Evans97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cloyd"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cloyd | first = E. L. | year = 1972 | title = James Burnett, Lord Monboddo | publication-place = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | page = 196 | isbn = 0-19-812437-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of thinkers, among them notably [[Lord Monboddo]],&lt;ref name="Cloyd" /&gt; described the importance of "preserving nature"; much of this early emphasis had its origins in [[Christian theology]].

Scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of [[British India]]. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the [[Natural environment|environment]], that there was a [[civic duty]] to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir [[James Ranald Martin]] was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in [[British India]] through the establishment of [[Indian Forest Service|Forest Departments]].&lt;ref&gt;Stebbing, E.P (1922)''The forests of India'' vol. 1, pp. 72-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madras]] Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by [[Alexander Gibson (botanist)|Alexander Gibson]], a professional [[botany|botanist]] who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WDYlNljAP5AC|title=Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism|first1=Greg |last1=Barton|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=48|isbn=978-1-139-43460-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]] [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to [[British empire|other colonies]], as well the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/11/05/stories/2007110550080500.htm|title=A life for forestry|last=MUTHIAH|first=S. |date=Nov 5, 2007|work=Metro Plus Chennai|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=2009-03-09|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cleghorn|first=Hugh Francis Clarke |title=The Forests and Gardens of South India |publisher=W.

The term ''conservation'' came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management, mainly for economic reasons, of such natural resources as [[timber]], fish, game, [[topsoil]], [[pasture]]land, and minerals. In addition it referred to the preservation of [[forest]]s ([[forestry]]), [[wildlife]] ([[wildlife refuge]]), parkland, [[wilderness]], and [[Drainage basin|watersheds]]. This period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869]] was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author1=G.

In the [[United States]], the [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]] gave the President power to set aside forest reserves from the land in the public domain. [[John Muir]] founded the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892, and the [[New York Zoological Society]] was set up in 1895. A series of [[National Park|national forests and preserves]] were established by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] from 1901 to 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-and-conservation.htm|title=Theodore Roosevelt and Conservation - Theodore Roosevelt National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050223142405/http://www.runet.edu/~wkovarik/envhist/5progressive.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-02-23 |title=Environmental timeline 1890–1920 |website=runet.edu }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1916 National Parks Act, included a 'use without impairment' clause, sought by John Muir, which eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="Davis96"&gt;{{cite book |author=Davis, Peter |title=Museums and the natural environment: the role of natural history museums in biological conservation |publisher=Leicester University Press |location=London |year=1996 |isbn=0-7185-1548-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global conservation efforts ===

In the mid-20th century, efforts arose to target individual species for conservation, notably efforts in [[big cat]] conservation in [[South America]] led by the New York Zoological Society.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Rabinowitz, ''Jaguar: One Man's Battle to Establish the World's First Jaguar Preserve'', Arbor House, New York, N.Y. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the New York Zoological Society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities; the work of Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr., [[Carl E. Akeley]], [[Archie Carr]] and his son Archie Carr III is notable in this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carr, Marjorie Harris |author2=Carr, Archie Fairly |title=A naturalist in Florida: a celebration of Eden |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05589-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/chronob/OSBO1887.htm|title=Chrono-Biographical Sketch: (Henry) Fairfield Osborn, Jr.|website=www.wku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}&lt;!-- The timings of these two sentences contradict each other. --&gt; Akeley for example, having led expeditions to the [[Virunga Mountains]] and observed the [[mountain gorilla]] in the wild, became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities. He was instrumental in persuading [[Albert I of Belgium]] to act in defense of the [[mountain gorilla]] and establish [[Albert National Park]] (since renamed [[Virunga National Park]]) in what is now [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;Akeley, C., 1923. ''In Brightest Africa'' New York, Doubleday. 188-249.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, led primarily by work in the United States under the [[Endangered Species Act]]&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Endangered Species Act (7 U.S.C. § 136, 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.) of 1973, Washington DC, U.S. Government Printing Office&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Species at Risk Act]] (SARA) of Canada, [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s developed in [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued. Notably the United Nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind. The programme was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2006, a total of 830 sites are listed: 644 cultural, 162 natural. The first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the United States, which passed back to back legislation in the Endangered Species Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/1531-|title=16 U.S. Code § 1531 - Congressional findings and declaration of purposes and policy|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1966) and [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+42USC4321|title=US Government Publishing Office - FDsys - Browse Publications|website=frwebgate.access.gpo.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research. Other conservation developments, however, have taken hold throughout the world. India, for example, passed the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul R. |last1=Krausman |first2=A. J. T. |last2=Johnsingh |year=1990 |title=Conservation and Wildlife Education in India |journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=342–7 |jstor=3782224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, a significant development was the emergence of the [[urban wildlife|urban conservation]] movement. A local organization was established in [[Birmingham]], [[UK]], a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the UK, then overseas. Although perceived as a [[grassroots movement]], its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife. Initially perceived as radical, the movement's view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought. Considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology. The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] originated in 1985.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

By 1992, most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml Convention on Biological Diversity Official Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227072411/http://www.biodiv.org/convention/default.shtml |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently many countries began programmes of [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders, as well as protect associated habitats. The late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector, with the maturing of organisations such as the [[Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management]] and the [[Society for the Environment]].

Since 2000, the concept of [[landscape scale conservation]] has risen to prominence, with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions. Instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists, although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species.

Ecology has clarified the workings of the [[biosphere]]; i.e., the complex interrelationships among humans, other species, and the physical environment. The [[Human overpopulation|burgeoning human population]] and associated [[agriculture]], [[industry]], and the ensuing pollution, have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gore, Albert |title=Earth in the balance: ecology and the human spirit |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |year=1992 |isbn=0-395-57821-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring extinction rates ===
{{annotated image/Extinction|float=right}}

Extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways. Conservation biologists measure and apply [[statistical measure]]s of [[fossil record]]s,&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Regan |first1=Helen M. |last2=Lupia |first2=Richard |last3=Drinnan |first3=Andrew N. |last4=Burgman |first4=Mark A. |title=The Currency and Tempo of Extinction |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=157 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |year=2001 |pmid=18707231 |doi=10.1086/317005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rates of [[habitat loss]], and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacKenzie |first1=Darryl I. |last2=Nichols |first2=James D. |last3=Hines |first3=James E. |last4=Knutson |first4=Melinda G. |last5=Franklin |first5=Alan B. |title=Estimating Site Occupancy, Colonization, and Local Extinction When a Species Is Detected Imperfectly |journal=Ecology |volume=84 |issue=8 |year=2003 |pages=2200–2207 |jstor=3450043 |doi=10.1890/02-3090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain such estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balmford |first1=Andrew |last2=Green |first2=Rhys E. |last3=Jenkins |first3=Martin |title=Measuring the changing state of nature |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=326–30 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00067-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacArthur|first1=R.H.|author-link1= Robert MacArthur|last2=Wilson|first2=E.O.|author-link2= E. O. Wilson|title=[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]] |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2001 |isbn=0-691-08836-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction. The current [[background extinction rate]] is estimated to be one species every few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raup DM |title=A kill curve for Phanerozoic marine species |journal=Paleobiology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=37–48 |year=1991 |pmid=11538288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the Earth's species have not been described or evaluated. Estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist (estimated range: 3,600,000-111,700,000)&lt;ref name="Wilson00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Edward O. | year = 2000 | title = On the Future of Conservation Biology | url = | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–3 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.00000-e1.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; to how many have received a [[Binomial nomenclature|species binomial]] (estimated range: 1.5-8 million).&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; Less than 1% of all species that have been described beyond simply noting its existence.&lt;ref name="Wilson00" /&gt; From these figures, the IUCN reports that 23% of [[vertebrate]]s, 5% of [[invertebrate]]s and 70% of plants that have been evaluated are designated as [[endangered]] or [[threatened]].&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630054235/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The IUCN does not disaggregate endangered from [[critically endangered]] or threatened for the purpose of these statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Better knowledge is being constructed by [[The Plant List]] for actual numbers of species.

=== Systematic conservation planning ===

Systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems. Margules and Pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Margules CR, Pressey RL |title=Systematic conservation planning |journal=Nature |volume=405 |issue=6783 |pages=243–53 |date=May 2000 |pmid=10821285 |doi=10.1038/35012251 |url=http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225013400/http://www.ecology.uq.edu.au/docs/SoC_Brazil_2005/Papers/Margules_and_Pressey_2000.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Compile data on the biodiversity of the planning region
# Identify conservation goals for the planning region
# Review existing conservation areas
# Select additional conservation areas
# Implement conservation actions
# Maintain the required values of conservation areas

Conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for [[Grant (money)|grant proposals]] or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070704172505/http://www.amphibians.org/newsletter/ACAP.pdf Amphibian Conservation Action Plan] is one example. See also: {{cite journal |vauthors=Chan KM, Shaw MR, Cameron DR, Underwood EC, Daily GC |title=Conservation Planning for Ecosystem Services |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=e379 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17076586 |pmc=1629036 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040379}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Systematic strategies generally employ the services of [[Geographic Information Systems]] to assist in the decision making process.

=== Conservation physiology: a mechanistic approach to conservation ===

Conservation physiology was defined by [[Steven J. Cooke]] and colleagues as: 'An integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts, tools, and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications; understanding and predicting how organisms, populations, and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors; and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa (i.e. including microbes, plants, and animals). Physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales, and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations, restore ecosystems, inform conservation policy, generate decision-support tools, and manage natural resources.'&lt;ref name="Cooke et al 2013"/&gt;  Conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines.

=== Conservation biology as a profession ===

The [[Society for Conservation Biology]] is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity. Conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology, into subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[economics]], [[humanities]], [[arts]], [[anthropology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groom06" /&gt; Within biology, [[conservation genetics]] and [[evolution]] are immense fields unto themselves, but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology.

Is conservation biology an [[Objectivity (science)|objective science]] when biologists [[advocate]] for an inherent [[Ecosystem valuation|value in nature]]? Do conservationists introduce [[bias]] when they support policies using qualitative description, such as [[Habitat degradation|habitat ''degradation'']], or ''healthy'' [[ecosystem]]s? As all scientists hold values, so do conservation biologists. Conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of [[science]], [[reason]], [[logic]], and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] in their conservation management plans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt; This sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options, both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach.

There is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manolis JC, Chan KM, Finkelstein ME, Stephens S, Nelson CR, Grant JB, Dombeck MP |title=Leadership: A new frontier in conservation science |journal=Conserv. Biol. |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an [[adaptive management]] approach. The concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power, authority, and dominance. Adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring, purposeful, and collegial. Adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the Aldo Leopold Leadership Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leopoldleadership.org/content/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217231043/http://leopoldleadership.org/content|archive-date=2007-02-17|title=Aldo Leopold Leadership Program|publisher=Woods Institute for the Environment, Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches ===

Conservation may be classified as either [[in-situ conservation]], which is protecting an endangered species in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], or [[ex-situ conservation]], which occurs outside the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kala |first1=Chandra Prakash |title=Medicinal plants conservation and enterprise development |journal=Medicinal Plants - International Journal of Phytomedicines and Related Industries |volume=1 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=79–95 |doi=10.5958/j.0975-4261.1.2.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat. Ex-situ conservation, on the other hand, involves protection outside of an organism's natural habitat, such as on reservations or in gene banks, in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Also, non-interference may be used, which is termed a [[Environmentalism|preservationist]] method. Preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; In this regard, conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension, as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems. Some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans.{{quote|text=|sign=|source=|"Animals have not yet invaded 2/3 of Earth's habitats, and it could be that without human influence the diversity of tetrapods will continue to increase in an exponential fashion."}}

=== Ethics and values ===
{{See also|Conservation (ethic)|Land ethic}}

Conservation biologists are [[interdisciplinary]] researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences. Chan states&lt;ref name="Chan08"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chan |first1=Kai M. A. |title=Value and Advocacy in Conservation Biology: Crisis Discipline or Discipline in Crisis? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |year=2008 |pmid=18254846 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00869.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values.

A conservationist may be inspired by the ''resource conservation ethic'',&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|15}} which seeks to identify what measures will deliver "the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time."&lt;ref name="Hunter96" /&gt;{{Rp|13}} In contrast, some conservation biologists argue that nature has an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] that is independent of [[anthropocentric]] usefulness or [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|3,12,16–17}} Intrinsic value advocates that a gene, or species, be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain. [[Aldo Leopold]] was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy, ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists.&lt;ref name="Dyke08"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

=== Conservation priorities ===

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis. The IUCN provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its Red List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627094911/http://www.iucnredlist.org/ |archivedate=2014-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List]] serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Vié09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =Vié  | first1 = J.

Concerns for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at ecological processes, such as migration, and a holistic examination of biodiversity at levels beyond the species, including genetic, population and ecosystem diversity.&lt;ref name="Molnar04"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Molnar |first = J. |last2 = Marvier |first2 = M. |last3 = Kareiva |first3 = P. |title = The sum is greater than the parts |journal = Conservation Biology |volume = 18 |issue = 6 |pages = 1670–1 |year = 2004 |url = http://www.environmental-expert.com/Files%5C8392%5Carticles%5C9961%5CTheSumIsGreaterthantheParts.pdf |doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x |ref = harv }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive, systematic, and rapid rates of biodiversity loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving holistic network of genetic and ecosystem diversity. While the [[conservation status]] of species is employed extensively in conservation management,&lt;ref name="Vié09" /&gt; some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity. Moreover, common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="Gaston10"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.1182818 | last=Gaston | first=K.J. | title=Valuing common species | journal=Science | volume=327 | issue=5962 | pages=154–155 | year=2010 | isbn= | pmid=20056880 | ref=harv|bibcode = 2010Sci...327..154G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kearns10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kearns |first1=Carol Ann |year=2010 |title=Conservation of Biodiversity |journal=Nature Education Knowledge |volume=3 |issue=10 |page=7 |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/conservation-of-biodiversity-13235087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most in the community of conservation science "stress the importance" of [[sustainability|sustaining biodiversity]],&lt;ref name="CREOcare"&gt;Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms. "[http://creo.amnh.org/care.html Why Care About Species That Have Gone Extinct?]". URL accessed July 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; there is debate on how to prioritize genes, species, or ecosystems, which are all components of biodiversity (e.g. Bowen, 1999). While the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving ''[[biodiversity hotspots]]'', some scientists (e.g)&lt;ref name="Luck03"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luck |first1=Gary W. |last2=Daily |first2=Gretchen C. |last3=Ehrlich |first3=Paul R. |title=Population diversity and ecosystem services |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=18 |issue=7 |year=2003 |pages=331–6 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00100-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and conservation organizations, such as the [[Nature Conservancy]], argue that it is more cost-effective, logical, and socially relevant to invest in ''biodiversity coldspots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=Will R. |last2=Brandon |first2=Katrina |last3=Brooks |first3=Thomas M. |last4=Costanza |first4=Robert |last5=da Fonesca |first5=Gustavo A. B. |last6=Portela |first6=Rosimeiry |title=Global Conservation of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services |journal=BioScience |volume=57 |issue=10 |year=2007 |pages=868–73 |doi=10.1641/B571009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of discovering, naming, and mapping out the distribution of every species, they argue, is an ill-advised conservation venture. They reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Molnar J, Marvier M, Karieva P |title=The sum is greater than the parts |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=1670–1 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00l07.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes, species, and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface. For example, "[...] 44% of all species of vascular plants and 35% of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4% of the land surface of the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Norman |last2=Mittermeier |first2=Russell A. |last3=Mittermeier |first3=Cristina G. |last4=da Fonseca |first4=Gustavo A.

Those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity. They point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the Earth's ecosystems where [[biomass]], not biodiversity, reigns supreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Underwood EC, Shaw MR, Wilson KA |title=Protecting Biodiversity when Money Matters: Maximizing Return on Investment |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=e1515 |year=2008 |pmid=18231601 |pmc=2212107 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001515 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001515|bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.1515U |editor1-last=Somers |editor1-first=Michael |display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 36% of the Earth's surface, encompassing 38.9% of the worlds vertebrates, lacks the [[endemic species]] to qualify as biodiversity hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leroux SJ, Schmiegelow FK |title=Biodiversity concordance and the importance of endemism |journal=Conserv.

Summary of 2006 [[IUCN Red List]] categories
&lt;/div&gt;

Those in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem, they are concentrated in places that are most threatened, and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx|title= The Biodiversity Hotspots|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222043456/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate= 2008-12-22|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List]] categories, which appear on Wikipedia species articles, is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action; species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their Wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale.{{dubious|date=July 2012}} This is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass.&lt;ref name="Wood08" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2012}} Species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability, ecosystem processes, evolutionary [[adaptation|adaptability]], and biomass.&lt;ref&gt;The following papers are examples of research showing the relationship between biodiversity, biomass, and ecosystem stability:&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bowen |first=B.

=== Strategic species concepts ===

==== Keystone species ====
{{Main article|Keystone species}}

Some species, called a ''keystone species'' form a central supporting hub unique to their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/keystone-species/|title=keystone species|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|newspaper=National Geographic Society|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function, as well as the loss of coexisting species.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; The importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'') through its interaction with [[sea otter]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[kelp]]. [[Kelp bed]]s grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the [[food chain]]. Sea urchins feed on kelp, while sea otters feed on sea urchins. With the rapid decline of sea otters due to [[overhunting]], sea urchin populations [[urchin barren|grazed unrestricted]] on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed. Left unchecked, the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the Steller's sea cow's diet and hastened their demise.&lt;ref&gt;P. K. Anderson. (1996). Competition, predation, and the evolution and extinction of Steller's Sea Cow, ''Hydrodamalis gigas''. Marine Mammal Science, 11(3):391-394&lt;/ref&gt; The sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival. However this was later questioned by Turvey and Risley,&lt;ref name=pmid17148336&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turvey |first1=S.T |last2=Risley |first2=C.L |title=Modelling the extinction of Steller's sea cow |journal=Biology Letters |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=94–7 |year=2006 |pmid=17148336 |pmc=1617197 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that hunting alone would have driven the Steller's sea cow extinct.

==== Indicator species ====
{{Main article|Indicator species}}

An ''indicator species'' has a narrow set of ecological requirements, therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem. Some animals, such as [[amphibian]]s with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to [[wetland]]s, have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a ''[[Miner's canary|miner's canary]]''. Indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice, such as through different forest [[silviculture]] treatments and management scenarios, or to measure the degree of harm that a [[pesticide]] may impart on the health of an ecosystem.

Government regulators, consultants, or [[NGO]]s regularly monitor indicator species, however, there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Landres PB, Verner J, Thomas JW |title=Ecological Uses of Vertebrate Indicator Species: A Critique |journal=Conserv. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=316–28 |year=1988 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/2007_rule/1988_12_Landres%20et%20al%201988.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00195.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recommended that multiple indicators (genes, populations, species, communities, and landscape) be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex, and often unpredictable, response from ecosystem dynamics (Noss, 1997&lt;ref name="Meffe97"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carroll, C. Dennis |author2=Meffe, Gary K. |title=Principles of conservation biology |publisher=Sinauer |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=1997 |isbn=0-87893-521-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|88–89}}).

==== Umbrella and flagship species ====
{{Main article|Umbrella species|Flagship species}}

An example of an ''umbrella species'' is the [[monarch (butterfly)|monarch butterfly]], because of its lengthy [[Insect migration|migrations]] and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value. The monarch migrates across North America, covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist. Any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats. An umbrella species is often used as ''flagship species'', which are species, such as the [[giant panda]], the [[blue whale]], the [[tiger]], the [[mountain gorilla]] and the monarch butterfly, that capture the public's attention and attract support for conservation measures.&lt;ref name="Hunter96"/&gt; Paradoxically, however, conservation bias towards flagship species sometimes threatens other species of chief concern.&lt;ref&gt;Fedriani JM, García L, Sanchéz M, Calderon J, and C Ramo. 2017.

== Context and trends ==

Conservation biologists study trends and process from the [[paleontological]] past to the [[ecological]] present as they gain an understanding of the context related to [[species extinction]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction"/&gt; It is generally accepted that there have been five major global mass extinctions that register in Earth's history. These include: the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction event|Ordovician]] (440 [[mya (unit)|mya]]), [[Late Devonian extinction|Devonian]] (370 mya), [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] (245 mya), [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|Triassic–Jurassic]] (200 mya), and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] (66 mya) extinction spasms.

=== Status of oceans and reefs ===
{{See also|Ocean|Coral reef|Marine pollution|Marine conservation}}

Global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline. By 2000, 27% of the world's coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed. The largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic "bleaching" event in 1998, where approximately 16% of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year. ''[[Coral bleaching]]'' is caused by a mixture of [[environmental stress]]es, including increases in ocean temperatures and [[Ocean acidification|acidity]], causing both the release of [[symbiotic]] [[algae]] and death of corals.&lt;ref name="ausSOE01"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia state of the environment 2001: independent report to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |location=Collingwood, VIC, Australia |year=2001 |isbn=0-643-06745-0 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/report/pubs/part03b.pdf |author=Australian State of the Environment Committee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years.

The oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels. This is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic [[natural resource]]s. A concern is that the majority of all [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] species will not be able to [[Evolution|evolve]] or [[acclimate]] in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Society. 2005. Ocean acidification due to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Policy document 12/05. {{ISBN|0-85403-617-2}} [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=13539 Download]&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when "[...] 90% of all of the large (average approximately ≥50 kg), open ocean tuna, billfishes, and sharks in the ocean"&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; are reportedly gone. Given the scientific review of current trends, the ocean is predicted to have few surviving [[multi-cellular organism]]s with only [[microbes]] left to dominate [[marine ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

=== Groups other than vertebrates ===

Serious concerns also being raised about [[Taxonomic rank|taxonomic groups]] that do not receive the same degree of social attention or attract funds as the vertebrates. These include [[fungus|fungal]] (including [[lichen]]-forming species),&lt;ref name="fungal-conservation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/blogs/orphans-of-rio.pdf |title=Orphans of Rio |publisher=fungal-conservation.org |accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; invertebrate (particularly [[insect]]&lt;ref name="Koh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=JA |last2=Telfer |first2=MG |last3=Roy |first3=DB |last4=Preston |first4=CD |last5=Greenwood |first5=JJ |last6=Asher |first6=J |last7=Fox |first7=R |last8=Clarke |first8=RT |last9=Lawton |first9=JH |title=Comparative Losses of British Butterflies, Birds, and Plants and the Global Extinction Crisis |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5665 |pages=1879–81 |year=2004 |pmid=15031508 |doi=10.1126/science.1095046 |bibcode=2004Sci...303.1879T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dunn |first1=Robert R. |title=Modern Insect Extinctions, the Neglected Majority |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=19 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=1030–6 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.00078.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[plant]] [[Community (ecology)|communities]] where the vast majority of biodiversity is represented. Conservation of fungi and conservation of insects, in particular, are both of pivotal importance for conservation biology. As mycorrhizal symbionts, and as decomposers and recyclers, fungi are essential for sustainability of forests.&lt;ref name="fungal-conservation" /&gt; The value of insects in the [[biosphere]] is enormous because they outnumber all other living groups in measure of [[species richness]]. The greatest bulk of [[biomass]] on land is found in plants, which is sustained by insect relations. This great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these aesthetically 'unpleasant' creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |title=The Little Things That Run the world (The Importance and Conservation of Invertebrates) |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=1 |issue=4 |year=1987 |pages=344–6 |jstor=2386020 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1987.tb00055.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Samways |first1=Michael J. |title=Insects in biodiversity conservation: some perspectives and directives |journal=Biodiversity and Conservation |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=258–82 |doi=10.1007/BF00056672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing [[honey bee]]s (''Apis mellifera''). Honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops. The use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Society, National Geographic. "Honeybee." National Geographic. National Geographic, n.d. Web. 11 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) is not uncommon. However, in  16-month period from 2006 through 2007, 29% of 577 [[beekeeper]]s across the United States reported CCD losses in up to 76% of their colonies. This sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector. The cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists. [[Pest (organism)|Pests]], [[pesticide]]s, and [[global warming]] are all being considered as possible causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holden |first1=C. |title=Ecology: Report Warns of Looming Pollination Crisis in North America |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5798 |page=397 |year=2006 |pmid=17053115 |doi=10.1126/science.314.5798.397 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stokstad |first1=E. |title=Entomology: The Case of the Empty Hives |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5827 |pages=970–2 |year=2007 |pmid=17510336 |doi=10.1126/science.316.5827.970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservation biology of parasites ===
{{Main article|Conservation biology of parasites}}

A large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction. A few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals, however, most of them are harmless. Threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations, or the extinction of host species.

=== Threats to biodiversity ===
{{Main article|Biodiversity threats}}

Today, many threats to Biodiversity exist.

[[File:Seneka Starszy Sevilla cropped.JPG|thumb|right|[[Seneca the Elder]] compiled a study of the classic themes in his ten volumes of ''Controversiæ''.]]
A '''''controversia''''' is an exercise in [[rhetoric]]; a form of [[declamation]] in which the student speaks for one side in a notional legal case such as treason or poisoning.  The facts of the matter and relevant law are presented in a persuasive manner, in the style of a legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=500–501 |title=Handbook of Literary Rhetoric |author=Heinrich Lausberg, translated by David E. Orton |publisher=BRILL |year=1998 |isbn=9789004107052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The exercise was used in [[ancient Rome]], where it was, with the ''[[suasoria]]'', the final stage of a course in rhetoric at an [[academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Declamation and contestation in satire |author=Susanna Morton Braund |page=148 |title = Roman Eloquence: Rhetoric in Society and Literature |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=9780415125444}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''controversia'' is distinguished from this rhetorical practice because of the complexity of its structural system of argument and the greater range of situations and characters employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric, Volume 1|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=9780195125955|location=Oxford|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction can also be explained in the way students who focused on this exercise end up as forensic [[Public speaking|orators]] while those who trained in ''suasoria'' followed a career in [[deliberative rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philo and Paul Among the Sophists|last=Winter|first=Bruce|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0521591082|location=Cambridge|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Seneca the Elder]] was an expert rhetorician and, from memory, compiled a set of classical themes for this exercise: the ''Controversiæ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=276 |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome|volume=1 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9780195170726}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Controversia'' is demonstrated in the case of [[Quintilian|Quintillian]]'s ''Declamationes Minores'' where ''suasoria'' was turned into this exercise by using a courtroom as a setting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Roman Rhetoric|last=Dominik|first=William|last2=Hall|first2=Jon|publisher=John Wiley &amp; sons|year=2010|isbn=9781405120913|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot addressed the issue of a son who married the daughter of his father's enemy so he could use the [[dowry]] to ransom his who was captured by pirates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prof. '''Davor Džalto''' (Давор Џалто: born May 17, 1980) is an [[artist]], [[art historian]], [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]] of [[Liberalism|liberal]] orientation born in [[Travnik]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He is also known as one of the most important [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[Christian]] thinkers in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.svspress.com/the-human-work-of-art-a-theological-appraisal-of-creativity-and-the-death-of-the-artist/)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Davor-dzalto.jpg|thumb|Davor Džalto]]

He graduated from the School of Art in [[Niš]]. His academic career started in [[Belgrade]] where he received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] in the [[history of art]]. In 2004 he began writing his PhD thesis at the [[Albert-Ludwigs Universitaet]] in Freiburg, Germany (mentor Professor Dr. Angeli Janhsen), where he defended it successfully in 2006, becoming the youngest doctor of philosophy in the humanities in Germany and the South-East European region.&lt;ref&gt;(Ksenija Pavlovic, ''10/30 Exhibition Catalogue'', Belgrade: 2010, 5–6)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 he has been a [[university professor]] of history and theory of art and of Orthodox Christian theology and [[religious studies]]. As a visiting and honorary professor he has taught at various universities in Europe and the US, including [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], [[Indiana University]], [[Fordham University]] of New York and [[The American University of Rome]]. He is also the [[president]] of The [[Institute]] for the Study of [[Culture]] and [[Christianity]].

His work is based on examination of the relations between [[personhood]] and [[authorship]], especially in the [[postmodern]] and [[globalization]] context. He has formulated a theory according to which art represents an [[Symbolic expression|expression]] of the [[personal identity]] of the human being, having an [[Existentialism|existential]] importance. That way he contributed to the revision of the [[postmodernism]], actualizing the question of possibility and meaning of the art creation. He continued to further develop theological concepts of [[John Zizioulas]] and philosophical statements given by [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], implementing them on the contemporary historical and cultural context. He also examines the concept of "[[simulacrum]]" in relation to the human person and its ability to create.

He also works in various media artistically including [[video art]], performance, painting, and sculpture.

His work has been presented at numerous exhibitions internationally. He has taken part in many conferences and seminars, having [[peace]] and inter-religious backgrounds. It is also held that he played an important role in [[South Eastern Europe]] in promoting peace, reconciliation and cooperation between religious communities, primarily because he has contacts among all important religions and religious leaders in the [[Balkans]] and in Europe. He was directly involved in many initiatives during his engagement in the [[Pax Christi]] office in Belgrade. He has written a number of articles and theoretical texts. As an 18-year-old student he published his first book, ''On Writings as an Artistic, Historical, Social and Cultural Phenomenon''. He is a founding member and the art director of the [[Flexible Art Network]] and vice president of the Christian Cultural Center. He lives and works in [[Freiburg]], [[Münster]] and [[Belgrade]]. Based on the ''Aesthetik der Absenz'', formulated in German-speaking art circles, he recognized and explained the phenomenon of "absence of body" in twentieth-century art. In 2007 his name was added to the list of 100 most influential people in the world, originating from the South Eastern European region.

The '''''Illustrated Bible Dictionary''''',{{efn|Full title: ''Illustrated Bible Dictionary and Treasury of Biblical History, Biography, Geography, Doctrine, and Literature with Numerous Illustrations and Important Chronological Tables and Maps''.{{sfnp|Easton|1893}}}} better known as '''''Easton's Bible Dictionary''''', is a reference work on topics related to the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]] compiled by [[Matthew George Easton]]. The first edition was published in 1893,{{sfnp|Easton|1893}} and a revised edition was published the following year.{{sfnp|Easton|1894}} The most popular edition, however, was the third,  published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] in 1897, three years after Easton's death.{{sfnp|Easton|1897}} The last contains nearly 4,000 entries relating to the [[Bible]]. Many of the entries in ''Easton's'' are [[encyclopedia#Characteristics|encyclopedic]] in nature, although there are also short dictionary-type entries.

Because of its age, it is now a [[public domain resource]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5737">{{About|the narrative device|other uses of "epilogue" and "epilog"|Epilogue (disambiguation)}}
An '''epilogue''' or '''epilog''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἐπίλογος ''epílogos'', "conclusion" from ἐπί ''epi'', "in addition" and λόγος ''logos'', "word") is a piece of writing at the end of a work of literature, usually used to bring closure to the work.&lt;ref name="EpiDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Epilogue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented from the perspective of within the story. When the author steps in and speaks indirectly to the reader, that is more properly considered an [[afterword]]. The opposite is a [[prologue]]&amp;mdash;a piece of writing at the ''beginning'' of a work of literature or drama, usually used to open the story and capture interest.&lt;ref name="ProDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Prologue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some genres, for example [[television programs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[video games]], call the epilog an "outro" patterned on the use of "intro" for "introduction".

==In literature==
[[Image:Grandville, Autre Monde, Epilog.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Illustration from ''Un Autre Monde'' epilogue, by [[Jean Ignace Isidore Gérard Grandville|Grandville]].]]

An epilogue is the final [[chapter (books)|chapter]] at the end of a [[narrative|story]] that often serves to reveal the fates of the [[Character (arts)|character]]s. Some epilogues may feature [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] only tangentially related to the subject of the story. They can be used to hint at a sequel or wrap up all the loose ends. They can occur at a significant period of time after the main [[plot (narrative)|plot]] has ended. In some cases, the epilogue is used to allow the main character a chance to "speak freely".

An epilogue can continue in the same narrative style and perspective as the preceding story, although the form of an epilogue can occasionally be drastically different from the overall story. It can also be used as a [[sequel]].

==In film==
In [[film]]s, the final scenes may feature a montage of images or clips with a short explanation of what happens to the characters. A few examples of such films are ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'', ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[Remember the Titans]]'', and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]''.

There are many films which do not only include a few glimpses of the character's future, but also are based on an epilogue. Most epilogues in films are shown in a dramatic fashion, usually in silence, to commemorate an important happening, for example, the fate of a character in the film.

The epilogue of ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' shows a happy ending, an alternative to the actual ending. 

In many [[documentaries]] and [[biopics]], the epilogue is text-based, explaining what happened to the subjects after the events covered in the film.

==In video gaming==
In [[Video game|video gaming]], epilogues can occur at the end of the story, usually after the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]] have rolled. An epilogue in a game functions similarly to an epilogue in [[film]] and [[literature]], providing closure to the end of a story.

However, the way in which an epilogue is interacted with in a video game can then determine how a story ends, in works of fiction that contain [[Types of fiction with multiple endings#Video games|multiple endings]]. For example, there are four possible endings to ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]]'', and three of the endings are chosen by what the player does in the epilogue.

In games that feature the [[Permadeath|permanent death]] of [[Player character|playable characters]], an epilogue can chronicle what has happened to the various characters that have survived the events of the game, depicting how their situation has changed after the story has come to a conclusion. For example, the 2015 video game ''[[Until Dawn]]'' features those who survived recounting their experiences to the Police after being rescued. This system can also be expanded on. In most games of the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, relationships can be built between characters, allowing for unique outcomes to happen for characters depending on the actions of the player throughout the campaign.

A [[visual novel]] can also feature a type of epilogue, which will wrap up all of the scenarios encountered by a player, most often after the game has been fully completed by reaching all of the multiple endings; as is the case with ''[[Tsukihime]]'', featuring an epilogue that expands on the endings of all completable routes, as well as providing context for the rest of the game by explaining events in the prologue.

==In television==
For many years ''[[The Epilogue]]'', a reflective 5-minute [[sermonette]], was the last programme of the day broadcast on a Sunday evening by [[BBC]] radio and later television. The format was picked up by the independent broadcaster [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1956 and was adopted across its various franchises until 1988.

Within the field of [[anthropology]] and other [[social science]]s, [[ethnography]] is a form of research that relies on a range of sources of data, but usually tends to rely mainly on [[participant observation]]. However, the term also refers to the product of this type of research, which of course normally takes a textual form. As a result, ethnography is also sometimes seen as a ''genre of writing, one'' used to describe patterns of human social interaction in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Works and Lives: The anthropologist as author|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=Stanford CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of ethnography, the term 'realism' is often used to refer to the assumptions that some kinds of ethnographic work make about the phenomena to be investigated, and how these are to be understood. However, 'ethnographic realism' has also been used to refer to a style of writing that narrates the author's experiences and observations as if the reader were witnessing or experiencing events first hand. A work written using ethnographic realism may be referred to as a '''realist ethnography''', and classified as a subgenre of ethnography.

==Styles of ethnographic realism==
George Marcus and Dick Cushman described and categorized realist ethnographies under certain characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcus|first1=George|last2=Cushman|first2=Dick|title=Ethnographies as Texts|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=Jan 1, 1982|volume=11|pages=25–69|jstor=2155775|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.11.100182.000325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''innuendo''' is a [[wikt:hint|hint]], [[wikt:insinuation|insinuation]] or [[wikt:intimation|intimation]] about a person or thing, especially of a denigrating or a derogatory nature. It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging  (also called '''insinuation'''), that works obliquely by [[allusion]]. In the latter sense the intention is often to [[insult]] or accuse someone in such a way that one's words, taken literally, are innocent.

According to the ''[[Advanced Oxford Learner's Dictionary]]'', an innuendo is "an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude", such as:'' "innuendos about her private life" ''or'' "The song is full of sexual innuendo".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/innuendo?q=innuendo ''Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094326/http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/innuendo?q=innuendo |date=2015-05-18 }} (7th Edition; electronic version)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''sexual innuendo''' has acquired a specific meaning, namely that of a "risqué" [[double entendre]] by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering. For example: "We need to go deeper" can be seen as either a request for further inquiry, or a request to go deeper into an [[intimate part]].

In the context of [[Defamation|defamation law]], an innuendo meaning is one which is not directly contained in the words complained of, but which would be understood by those reading it based on special knowledge.

==Film, television and other media==
Comedy film scripts have used innuendo since the beginning of sound film itself. A notable example is the ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' film series (1958–1992) in which innuendo was a staple feature, often including the title of the film itself. [[British sitcoms]] and comedy shows such as ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|title=Going down: 'Grace Bros' store closes|publisher=BBC News|date=February 1, 1999|quote=The innuendo was loud and clear|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227013009/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/264230.stm|archivedate=February 27, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Round the Horne]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3605608/A-return-to-unalloyed-joy.html|title=A return to unalloyed joy|author=Dominic Cavendish|date=31 Oct 2003|publisher=''The Daily Telegraph''|quote=...a censor-baiting mixture of absurd spoofs, yarns, links and character-turns, laced with end-of-the-pier innuendo and erudite-infantile wordplay.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924212749/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/drama/3605608/A-return-to-unalloyed-joy.html|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also made extensive use of innuendo. Mild sexual innuendo is a staple of British [[pantomime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/25/144248303/only-the-brits-not-christmas-without-pantomime|title=Only The Brits: Not Christmas Without Pantomime|publisher=NPR|date=December 25, 2011|quote=No panto is complete without a dose of smutty innuendo for the adults and some contemporary political jokes.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101101932/http://www.npr.org/2011/12/25/144248303/only-the-brits-not-christmas-without-pantomime|archivedate=January 1, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Animal Flyer.jpg|thumb|A male cat paying a "call" on a female cat, who then serves up kittens, insinuating that the "result" of children is predicated on a male "catcall"]]

Numerous television programs targeted at child audiences often use innuendos in attempt to entertain adolescent/adult audiences without exceeding their network's censorship policies.

Many American primetime shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point that it is rated TV-PG/14 D for dialogue.{{fact|date=January 2012}} Also, many radio shows, are notable for this.{{fact|date=January 2012}}

On ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]], listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with innuendos in a humorous context, a feature known as "Innuendo Bingo". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innuendo Bingo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|accessdate=15 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102185555/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00hq228|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mental process''' or '''mental function''' are all the things that individuals can do with their [[mind]]s. These include [[perception]], [[judgement]] [[memory]], [[thought|thinking]] (such as [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]], [[imagination]], [[belief]], [[reasoning]], etc.), [[Volition_(psychology)|volition]], and [[emotion]].

Sometimes the term ''[[cognitive function]]'' is used instead.

A specific instance of engaging in cognitive [[Cognition]] process is a [[mental event]]. The ''event'' of perceiving something is different from the entire process, or ''capacity'' of perception — one's ability to perceive things. In other words, an instance of perceiving is different from the ability that makes those instances possible.

'''Minimalism''' describes movements in various forms of art and design, especially [[Visual arts|visual art]] and [[Minimalist music|music]], where the work is set out to expose the essence, essentials or identity of a subject through eliminating all non-essential forms, features or concepts. As a specific movement in the arts it is identified with developments in post–World War II Western Art, most strongly with American visual arts in the 1960s and early 1970s. Prominent artists associated with this movement include [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Donald Judd]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Anne Truitt]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Frank Stella]]. Artists themselves have sometimes reacted against the label due to the negative implication of the work being simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Amy. Styles, Schools and Movements, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2002.] "The artists themselves did not like the label because of the negative implication that their work was simplistic and devoid of 'art content'."&lt;/ref&gt; Minimalism is often interpreted as a reaction against [[Abstract expressionism]] and a bridge to [[Postminimalism|Postminimal]] art practices.

==Minimal art, minimalism in visual art==

Minimalism in visual art, generally referred to as "minimal art", ''literalist art'' &lt;ref&gt;Fried, M. "Art and Objecthood", ''Artforum'', 1967&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ABC Art''&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Barbara. "ABC Art", ''Art in America'' 53, no. 5 (October–November 1965): 57–69.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in New York in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cindy Hinant|editor1-last=Meyer-Stoll|editor1-first=Christiane|title=Gary Kuehn: Between Sex and Geometry|date=2014|publisher=Snoeck Verlagsgessellschaft|location=Cologne|isbn=3864421098|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially minimal art appeared in New York in the 60s as new and older artists moved toward [[geometric abstraction]]; exploring via painting in the cases of [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Al Held]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Robert Ryman]] and others; and sculpture in the works of various artists including [[David Smith (artist)|David Smith]], [[Anthony Caro]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Donald Judd]] and others. Judd's sculpture was showcased in 1964 at the [[Green Gallery]] in Manhattan as were Flavin's first fluorescent light works, while other leading Manhattan galleries like the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] and the [[Pace Gallery]] also began to showcase artists focused on geometric abstraction. In addition there were two seminal and influential museum exhibitions: ''[[Primary Structures]]: Younger American and British Sculpture''' shown from April 27 - June 12, 1966 at the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]], organized by the museum's Curator of Painting and Sculpture, Kynaston McShine &lt;ref&gt;''Time'' magazine, June 3, 1966, "Engineer's Esthetic", pg. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'' magazine, May 16, 1966, "The New Druids", pg. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Systemic Painting,'' at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]] also in 1966 that showcased [[Geometric abstraction]] in the American art world via [[Shaped canvas]], [[Color Field]], and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/publications/from-the-archives/items/view/72 ''Systemic Painting'', Guggenheim Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/systemic-art Systemic art, Oxford-Art encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Systemic+Painting,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NdebCUxYBJ&amp;sig=JLIUKPxFw3KycjSoDwPKLFqRz3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0alTT7m1LcTz0gHhw7y8DQ&amp;ved=0CHsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Systemic%20Painting%2C&amp;f=false Lawrence Alloway, ''Systemic Painting'', Google books online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of those exhibitions and a few others the [[art movement]] called ''minimal art'' emerged.

==History==
[[Jean Metzinger]], following the ''[[Succès de scandale]]'' created from the [[Cubist]] showing at the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], in an interview with Cyril Berger published in ''Paris-Journal'' 29 May 1911, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We cubists have only done our duty by creating a new rhythm for the benefit of humanity. Others will come after us who will do the same. What will they find? That is the tremendous secret of the future. Who knows if someday, a great painter, looking with scorn on the often brutal game of supposed colorists and taking the seven colors back to the primordial white unity that encompasses them all, will not exhibit completely white canvases, with nothing, absolutely nothing on them. (Jean Metzinger, 29 May 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, "Chez Metzi'', interview by Cyril Berger, published in the ''Paris-Journal'', 29 May 1911, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff and Patricia Leighten: ''A Cubism Reader, Documents and Criticism, 1906-1914'', University of Chicago Press, 2008, Document 17, Cyril Berger, ''Chez Metzi'', Paris-Journal, 29 May 1911, pp. 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Kazimir Malevich, 1915, Black Suprematic Square, oil on linen canvas, 79.5 x 79.5 cm, Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow.jpg|thumb|[[Kazimir Malevich]], ''Black Square'', 1915, oil on canvas, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/collection/_show/image/_id/378 Malevich, Kazimir Severinovich, ''Black Suprematic Square'', 1915, oil on canvas, 79.5 х 79.5 cm, Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140206000538/http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/collection/_show/image/_id/378 |date=2014-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Metzinger's (then) audacious prediction that artists would take [[abstract art|abstraction]] to its logical conclusion by vacating representational subject matter entirely and returning to what Metzinger calls the "primordial white unity", a "completely white canvas" would be realized two years later. The writer of a satirical manifesto, possibly [[Francis Picabia]], in a publication entitled ''Evolution de l'art: Vers l'amorphisme'', in ''Les Hommes du Jour'' (3 May 1913), may have had Metzinger's vision in mind when the author justified amorphism's blank canvases by claiming 'light is enough for us'.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt; With perspective, writes art historian Jeffery S. Weiss, "''Vers Amorphisme'' may be gibberish, but it was also enough of a foundational language to anticipate the extreme reductivist implications of non-objectivity".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jj82ZE_ctIoC&amp;pg=PA86 Jeffrey S. Weiss, ''The Popular Culture of Modern Art: Picasso, Duchamp, and Avant-gardism''], Yale University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|9780300058956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monochrome painting was initiated at the first [[Incoherents|Incoherent arts]]' exhibition in 1882 in Paris, with a black painting by poet [[Paul Bilhaud]] entitled "Combat de Nègres dans un tunnel" (''Negroes fight in a tunnel''). In the subsequent exhibitions of the Incoherent arts (also in the 1880s) the writer [[Alphonse Allais]] proposed seven other monochrome paintings, such as "Première communion de jeunes filles chlorotiques par un temps de neige" (''First communion of anaemic young girls in the snow'', white), or "Récolte de la tomate par des cardinaux  apoplectiques au bord de la Mer Rouge" (''Tomato harvesting by apoplectic cardinals on the shore of the Red Sea'', red).  However, this kind of activity bears more similarity to 20th century [[Dada]], or [[Neo-Dada]], and particularly the works of the [[Fluxus]] group of the 1960s, than to 20th century monochrome painting since Malevich.

[[File:IKB 191.jpg|thumb|[[Yves Klein]], IKB 191, 1962, [[Monochrome painting]]. Klein was a pioneer in the development of Minimal art.]]
In a broad and general sense, one finds European roots of minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s of painters associated with the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the [[De Stijl]] movement, and the [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivist]] movement, and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artcritical.com/2004/10/01/albert-york-and-giorgio-morandi/ Maureen Mullarkey, Art Critical, ''Giorgio Morandi'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hr-5GcN0F6kC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=Constantin+Br%C3%A2ncu%C5%9Fi.+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fdrAkynIx&amp;sig=_wMpgr2P-ywVUMWpAziTWIuQnjI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mRHeTr_IF6jg0QHZ55XHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Daniel Marzona, Uta Grosenick; ''Minimal art'', p.12]&lt;/ref&gt; Minimal art is also inspired in part by the paintings of [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Josef Albers]], and the works of artists as diverse as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Giorgio Morandi]], and others. Minimalism was also a reaction against the painterly subjectivity of [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]] that had been dominant in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=abstract+expressionism+and+minimal+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NddevTB5zD&amp;sig=nyIwlEqV3XyQaTkeVPgZNqfOGUY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rBfeTtKeI8Pd0QG20am2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abstract%20expressionism%20and%20minimal%20art&amp;f=false Gregory Battcock, ''Minimal Art: a critical anthology'', pp 161-172]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide range of possibilities (including impossibility) of interpretation of monochrome paintings is arguably why the monochrome is so engaging to so many artists, critics, and writers. Although the monochrome has never become dominant and few artists have committed themselves exclusively to it, it has never gone away. It reappears as though a spectre haunting [[high modernism]], or as a symbol of it, appearing during times of [[aesthetic]] and sociopolitical upheavals.&lt;ref&gt;''The Primary Colors for the Second Time: A Paradigm Repetition of the Neo-Avant-Garde,'' [[Benjamin H.

Artist and critic [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]] noted in his 1981 essay  "Last Exit: Painting" [[Artforum]], October: 40-47, minimalism did not reject [[Clement Greenberg]]'s claims about modernist painting's &lt;ref name="sharecom"&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/modernism.html Clement Greenberg, ''Modernist Painting,'' 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; reduction to surface and materials so much as take his claims literally. According to Lawson minimalism was the result, even though the term "minimalism" was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it, and many practitioners of art designated minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such. Also taking exception to this claim was Clement Greenberg himself; in his 1978 postscript to his essay ''Modernist Painting'' he disavowed this incorrect interpretation of what he said; Greenberg wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There have been some further constructions of what I wrote that go over into preposterousness: That I regard flatness and the inclosing of flatness not just as the limiting conditions of pictorial art, but as criteria of aesthetic quality in pictorial art; that the further a work advances the self-definition of an art, the better that work is bound to be. The philosopher or art historian who can envision me—or anyone at all—arriving at aesthetic judgments in this way reads shockingly more into himself or herself than into my article.''&lt;ref name="sharecom"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast to the previous decade's more subjective [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]], with the exceptions of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]]; minimalists were also influenced by composers [[John Cage]] and [[La Monte Young|LaMonte Young]], poet [[William Carlos Williams]], and the landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. They very explicitly stated that their art was not about self-expression, unlike the previous decade's more subjective philosophy about art making theirs was 'objective'. In general, Minimalism's features included [[Geometry|geometric]], often [[Cube|cubic]] forms purged of much [[metaphor]], equality of parts, [[wikt:repetition|repetition]], neutral surfaces, and industrial materials.

[[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], an influential theorist and artist, wrote a three part essay, "Notes on Sculpture 1-3", originally published across three issues of ''[[Artforum]]'' in 1966. In these essays, Morris attempted to define a conceptual framework and formal elements for himself and one that would embrace the practices of his contemporaries. These essays paid great attention to the idea of the [[wikt:Gestalt|gestalt]] - "parts... bound together in such a way that they create a maximum resistance to perceptual separation." Morris later described an art represented by a "marked lateral spread and no regularized units or symmetrical intervals..." in "Notes on Sculpture 4: Beyond Objects", originally published in ''[[Artforum]]'', 1969, continuing to say that "indeterminacy of arrangement of parts is a literal aspect of the physical existence of the thing." The general shift in theory of which this essay is an expression suggests the transitions into what would later be referred to as ''[[postminimalism]]''.
One of the first artists specifically associated with minimalism was the painter, [[Frank Stella]], whose early "pinstripe" paintings were included in the 1959 show, ''[[Dorothy Miller#1959: Sixteen Americans|16 Americans]],'' organized by [[Dorothy Miller]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. The width of the stripes in Frank Stellas's pinstripe paintings were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used for stretchers, visible as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side, used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. The decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective, but pre-conditioned by a "given" feature of the physical construction of the support. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint [[wikt:stripe|stripe]]s. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently highly subjective and emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and, in terms of precedent among the previous generation of abstract expressionists, leaned more toward the less gestural, often somber, [[color field]] paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]]. Although Stella received immediate attention from the MoMA show, artists including [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[Monochrome|monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge painting|Hard-edge]] formats from the late 50s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in minimal art to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal, there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in ''Arts Yearbook 8'', 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including [[Jasper Johns]], Dan Flavin and [[Lee Bontecou]]. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman Brooklynrail.org]&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

This movement was heavily criticised by modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some critics thought minimal art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried]], a formalist critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In "Art and Objecthood" (published in ''[[Artforum]]'' in June 1967) he declared that the minimal work of art, particularly minimal sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's [[participant Media|participation]] in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of minimal art. Fried's essay was immediately challenged by [[postminimalist]] and [[Land art|earth artist]] [[Robert Smithson]] in a letter to the editor in the October issue of ''[[Artforum]]''. Smithson stated the following: "What Fried fears most is the [[consciousness]] of what he is doing--namely being himself theatrical."

In addition to the already mentioned [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]] and [[Donald Judd]] other minimal artists include: [[Robert Mangold]], [[Larry Bell (artist)|Larry Bell]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Ronald Bladen]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Paul Mogensen]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[David Novros]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[John McCracken (artist)|John McCracken]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Fred Sandback]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Patricia Johanson]], and [[Anne Truitt]].

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] nearly all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art:

"The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;''Art as Art: The Selected Writings of Ad Reinhardt'' (New York: Viking Press, 1975):{{Page needed|date=November 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-520-07670-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt's remark directly addresses and contradicts [[Hans Hofmann]]'s regard for nature as the source of his own abstract expressionist paintings. In a famous exchange between Hofmann and [[Jackson Pollock]] as told by [[Lee Krasner]] in an [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm interview with Dorothy Strickler] (1964-11-02) for the Smithsonian Institution [[Archives of American Art]].&lt;ref name="aaa"&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/krasne64.htm Lee Krasner, Archives of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt; In Krasner's words,

"When I brought [[Hans Hofmann|Hofmann]] up to meet Pollock and see his work which was before we moved here, Hofmann's reaction was — one of the questions he asked Jackson was, ''do you work from nature?'' There were no still lifes around or models around and Jackson's answer was, ''I am nature.'' And Hofmann's reply was, ''Ah, but if you work by heart, you will repeat yourself.'' To which Jackson did not reply at all." The meeting between Pollock and Hofmann took place in 1942.&lt;ref name="aaa"/&gt;

      <comment>No, it is not. Most Christians today are Trinitarians, but not all of them. Historically speaking, Trinitarianism developed in late antiquity, several centuries after the beginning of Christianity, as one of several proposed solutions to the problem of the relationship between Jesus, God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is never actually clarified in the Bible itself. Christians before that time were still Christians, perhaps not "orthodox" Christians, but Christians nonetheless.</comment>

"Monotheism" Accessed 23 January 2013, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/390101/monotheism&lt;/ref&gt;

Monotheism is distinguished from [[henotheism]], a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and [[monolatrism]], the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Eakin, Jr. ''The Religion and Culture of Israel'' (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1971), 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "monolatry" was perhaps first used by [[Julius Wellhausen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mackintosh|first=Robert|year=1916|title=Monolatry and Henotheism|journal=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics|volume=VIII|pages=810|url=https://archive.org/details/EncyclopaediaOfReligionAndEthics.Hastings-selbie-gray.13Vols|accessdate=Jan 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The broader definition of monotheism characterizes the traditions of [[Bábism]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Balinese Hinduism]], [[Cao Dai|Cao Dai (Caodaiism)]], [[Cheondoism|Cheondoism (Cheondogyo)]], [[Christianity]], [[Deism]], [[Eckankar]], [[Hindu sects]] such as [[Shaivism]] and [[Vaishnavism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Mandaeism]], [[Rastafari]], [[Seicho no Ie]], [[Sikhism]], [[Tengrism]] (Tangrism), [[Tenrikyo|Tenrikyo (Tenriism)]], [[Yazidism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]], and elements of pre-monotheistic thought are found in early [[religion]]s such as [[Atenism]], [[Chinese folk religion|ancient Chinese religion]], and [[Yahweh#Iron Age I (1200–930 BCE): El, Yahweh, and the origins of Israel|Yahwism]].&lt;ref&gt;References:&lt;br&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''[[:wikt:monotheism|monotheism]]'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:μόνος|μόνος]]}} (''monos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368642 Monos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "single" and {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} (''theos'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2348292 Theos], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "[[Deity|god]]".&lt;ref&gt;The compound {{lang|el|μονοθεισμός}} is current only in [[Modern Greek]]. There is a single attestation of {{lang|grc|μονόθεον}} in a Byzantine hymn (''Canones Junii'' 20.6.43; A. Acconcia Longo and G. Schirò, ''Analecta hymnica graeca, vol. 11 e codicibus eruta Italiae inferioris''. Rome: Istituto di Studi Bizantini e Neoellenici. Università di Roma, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; The English term was first used by [[Henry More]] (1614–1687).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness |last=More |first=Henry |year=1660 |publisher= Flesher &amp; Morden |location=London |page= 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2017}}
Quasi-monotheistic claims of the existence of a universal deity date to the [[Late Bronze Age]], with [[Akhenaten]]'s ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]''. A possible inclination towards monotheism emerged during the [[Vedic period]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Sharma | first= Chandradhar | title= Indian Philosophy: A Critical Survey| publisher= Barnes &amp; Noble| location= New York | year= 1962 | page= vi | chapter= Chronological Summary of History of Indian Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Iron-Age South Asia. The [[Rigveda]] exhibits notions of [[monism]] of the [[Brahman]], particularly in the comparatively late [[Mandala 10|tenth book]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv10190.htm HYMN CXC. Creation.]&lt;/ref&gt; which is dated to the early [[Iron Age]], e.g. in the [[Nasadiya sukta]]. 

Since the sixth century BCE, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] have believed in the supremacy of one God above all: [[Ahura Mazda]] as the "Maker of All"&lt;ref&gt;Yasna, XLIV.7&lt;/ref&gt; and the first being before all others.&lt;ref&gt;"First and last for all Eternity, as the Father of the Good Mind, the true Creator of Truth and Lord over the actions of life." (Yasna 31.8)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Vispanam Datarem", ''Creator of All'' (Yasna 44.7)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Data Angheush", ''Creator of Life'' (Yasna 50.11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/zor/sbe23/sbe2330.htm NYÂYIS.]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Zoroastrianism was not strictly monotheistic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Duchesne-Guillemin|first1=Jacques|title=Zoroastrianism|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zoroastrianism|website=Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it venerated other ''[[yazatas]]'' alongside Ahura Mazda. Ancient Hindu theology, meanwhile, was [[monist]], but was not strictly monotheistic in worship because it still maintained the existence of many gods, who were envisioned as aspects of one supreme God, [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Numerous ancient Greek philosophers, including [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] and [[Antisthenes]] believed in a similar polytheistic monism that came close to monotheism, but fell short.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Judaism was the first religion to conceive the notion of a personal monotheistic God within a monist context.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBSJNDndGjwC&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=No Other Gods: Emergent Monotheism in Israel|first=Robert Karl|last=Gnuse|date=1 May 1997|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|isbn=1-85075-657-0|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[ethical monotheism]], which holds that morality stems from God alone and that its laws are unchanging,&lt;ref name=EncyclopediaBritannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical monotheism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1770434/ethical-monotheism|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prager|first1=Dennis|title=Ethical Monotheism|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/mono.html|website=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; first occurred in [[Judaism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fischer|first1=Paul|title=Judaism and Ethical Monotheism|url=https://blog.uvm.edu/pfischer/2013/10/27/judaism-and-ethical-monotheism/|website=platophilosophy|publisher=The University of Vermont Blogs|accessdate=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is now a core tenet of most modern monotheistic religions, including Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref&gt;Nikiprowetzky, V.

According to Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as "the Adamic religion", or, in the terms of [[Andrew Lang]], the "[[Urreligion]]". Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th century in favour of an [[development of religion|evolutionary progression]] from [[animism]] via [[polytheism]] to monotheism, but by 1974 this theory was less widely held, and a modified view similar to Lang's became more prominent.&lt;ref name="odccmono"/&gt;{{qn|date=January 2017}} Austrian anthropologist [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] had postulated an ''[[Urmonotheismus]]'', "original" or "primitive monotheism" in the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam|date=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0345384560|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was objected{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] had grown up in opposition to polytheism as had Greek philosophical monotheism.&lt;ref name="odccmono"/&gt; More recently, [[Karen Armstrong]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam|date=1994|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0345384560}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other authors have returned to the idea of an evolutionary progression beginning with [[animism]], which developed into [[polytheism]], which developed into [[henotheism]], which developed into [[monolatry]], which developed into true monotheism.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = Evolutionary interpretations of the history of religion are usually understood to be an explanation of the phenomenon of religion as a result of a continuous development. The model for such development is the growth of living beings which leads to increasingly subtle differentiation and integration. Within such a framework of thought, monotheism would be interpreted as the result of a continuous development from animism, polytheism, henotheism and monolatry to belief in the one and only God. Such a development cannot be proved. Monotheism appeared suddenly, though not without being prepared for.

While all adherents of the Abrahamic religions consider themselves to be monotheists, some in Judaism do not consider Christianity to be a pure form of monotheism (due to The Christian doctrine of the Trinity), classifying it as [[Shituf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mohammedamin.com/Community_issues/Triangulating-the-Abrahamic-faiths.html |title=Triangulating the Abrahamic faiths – measuring the closeness of Judaism, Christianity and Islam |author=Mohammed Amin |quote=Christians were seen as polytheists, due to the doctrine of the Trinity.

Christians, on the other hand, argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is a valid expression of monotheism, citing that the Trinity does not consist of three separate [[deities]], but rather the three [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|persons]], who exist [[consubstantiality|consubstantially]] (as one [[Ousia|substance]]) within a single [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]].&lt;ref&gt;https://icucourses.com/pages/025-10-three-persons-are-subsistent-relations ; International Catholic University, The One True God: "The fatherhood constitutes the Person of the Father, the sonship constitutes the Person of the Son, and the passive spiration constitutes the Person of the Holy Spirit. But in God "everything is one where there is no distinction by relative opposition." Consequently, even though in God there are three Persons, there is only one consciousness, one thinking and one loving. The three Persons share equally in the internal divine activity because they are all identified with the divine essence. For, if each divine Person possessed his own distinct and different consciousness, there would be three gods, not the one God of Christian revelation. So you will see that in this regard there is an immense difference between a divine Person and a human person."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://orthodoxwiki.org/Holy_Trinity ; Holy Trinity, Orthodox Wiki: "Orthodox Christians worship the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—the Holy Trinity, the one God. Following the Holy Scriptures and the Church Fathers, the Church believes that the Trinity is three divine persons (hypostases) who share one essence (ousia). It is paradoxical to believe thus, but that is how God has revealed himself. All three persons are consubstantial with each other, that is, they are of one essence (homoousios) and coeternal. There never was a time when any of the persons of the Trinity did not exist. God is beyond and before time and yet acts within time, moving and speaking within history."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trinity-Christianity ; Britannica, Trinity: "The Council of Nicaea in 325 stated the crucial formula for that doctrine in its confession that the Son is “of the same substance [homoousios] as the Father,” even though it said very little about the Holy Spirit. Over the next half century, Athanasius defended and refined the Nicene formula, and, by the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers), the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since. It is accepted in all of the historic confessions of Christianity, even though the impact of the Enlightenment decreased its importance."&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Ancient Israel====
{{see also|Yahweh|Elohim|Baal}}
During the 8th century BCE, the worship of [[Yahweh|YHWH]] in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the [[Yahwist]] faction collectively as [[Baal]]s. The oldest books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] reflect this competition, as in the books of [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] and [[Book of Nahum|Nahum]], whose authors lament the "[[apostasy]]" of the people of Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 18, Jeremiah 2; Othmar Keel, Christoph Uehlinger, Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel, Fortress Press (1998); Mark S.

YHWH was originally the [[national god]] of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref name="Israel Drazin"/&gt; As time progressed, the [[henotheistic]] cult of Yahweh grew increasingly militant in its opposition to the worship of other gods.&lt;ref name=Albertz/&gt; Later, the reforms of [[King Josiah]] imposed a form of strict [[Monolatrism#In ancient Israel|monolatrism]].

====The Shema====
{{Main article|Shema Yisrael}}
''Shema Yisrael'' ("Hear, [O] Israel") are the [[Incipit|first two words]] of a section of the [[Torah]], and is the title of a prayer that serves as a centerpiece of the morning and evening [[Jewish services|Jewish prayer services]]. The first verse encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Judaism: "Hear, O Israel: the [[YHVH|{{LORD}}]] our God, the {{LORD}} is one" ({{Lang-he-n|שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹהֵינוּ ה' אֶחָד}}), found in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|6:4|HE}}, sometimes alternatively translated as "The {{LORD}} is our God, the {{LORD}} alone". Observant Jews consider the Shema to be the most important part of the [[prayer]] service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a ''[[mitzvah]]'' (religious commandment). It is traditional for Jews to say the Shema as their [[last words]], and for parents to teach their children to say it before they go to sleep at night.

===Christianity===
{{Main article|God in Christianity|Trinity}}
[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-English.svg|thumb|right|The [[Trinity]] is the belief in Christianity that God is one God in essence but three persons: [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]] ([[Jesus]]), and [[God the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name="def-lateran"&gt;Definition of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] quoted in ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P17.HTM#1FT §253].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Among [[early Christians]] there was considerable debate over the nature of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]], with some denying the incarnation but not the deity of Jesus ([[Docetism]]) and others later calling for an [[Arianism|Arian]] conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local [[Council of Alexandria|synod]] rejecting the claim of Arius, this [[Christology|Christological]] issue was to be one of the items addressed at the [[First Council of Nicaea]].

The First Council of Nicaea, held in [[Nicaea]] (in present-day [[Turkey]]), convoked by the [[Roman Emperors|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] in 325, was the first [[ecumenical council|ecumenical]]&lt;ref&gt;''Ecumenical'', from [[Koine Greek]] [[Oikoumene|oikoumenikos]], literally meaning worldwide the earliest extant uses of the term for a council are in Eusebius's ''Life of Constantine'' 3.6 [http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/eusebius/vc/gr/index.htm] around 338 "{{lang|grc|σύνοδον οἰκουμενικὴν συνεκρότει}}" (he convoked an Ecumenical council), Athanasius's Ad Afros Epistola Synodica in 369 [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2819.htm], and the Letter in 382 to [[Pope Damasus I]] and the Latin bishops from the [[First Council of Constantinople]][http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-63.htm#TopOfPage]&lt;/ref&gt; council of [[bishop]]s of the [[Roman Empire]], and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian [[doctrine]], called the [[Nicene Creed]]. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general ecumenical councils of bishops ([[synod]]s) to create statements of belief and [[Canon law|canons]] of doctrinal [[orthodoxy]]— the intent being to define a common creed for the [[Christian Church|Church]] and address [[heresy|heretical]] ideas.

One purpose of the council was to resolve [[Arian controversy|disagreements]] in [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]] over the nature of [[Jesus]] in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the [[Homoousia|same substance]] as [[God the Father]] or merely of [[Homoiousia|similar substance]]. All but two bishops took the first position; while [[Arius]]' argument failed.

Christian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was reaffirmed in 381 at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] and reached its full development through the work of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising three "[[person]]s", [[God the Father]], [[God the Son]], and [[God the Holy Spirit]]. These three are described as being "of the same substance" ({{lang|grc|[[ousia|ὁμοούσιος]]}}).

Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: "I believe in one God". From earlier than the times of the [[Nicene Creed]], 325&amp;nbsp;CE, various Christian figures advocated&lt;ref&gt;''Examples of ante-Nicene statements'':

&lt;/ref&gt; the triune [[Holy Mystery|mystery]]-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to [[Roger E. Olson]] and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded "that God must exist as both a unity and trinity", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=Roger E.|title=The Trinity|date=2002|publisher=Wm.

Most modern Christians believe the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]] is triune, meaning that the three persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly God. They also hold to the doctrine of a [[Hypostatic union|man-god]] [[Christ Jesus]] as [[God incarnate#Christianity|God incarnate]]. These Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and one. Other Christian religions, including [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormonism]] and others, do not share those views on the Trinity.

Some Christian faiths, such as [[God in Mormonism|Mormonism]], argue that the Godhead is in fact three separate individuals which include God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/articles-of-faith|title=Articles of Faith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormon.org/beliefs/jesus-christ|title=Jesus Christ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the Council of Nicaea, the predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three separate individuals. In support of this view, they cite early Christian examples of belief in [[subordinationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/fullscreen/?pub=1105&amp;index=3|title=Offenders for a Word|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard Lewis, The Jews of Islam, 1987, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Hadith]]s account them as converts to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Sahih Bukhari Book #7 Hadith #340, Book #59 Hadith #628, and Book #89 Hadith #299 etc.&lt;/ref&gt; However this interpretation may be related to the fact that [[Quraysh]] polytheists used to describe anyone who converted to Islam with the word "Saba"{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} ({{lang|ar|صبى/صبوت}}) which may either mean that this term was used for anyone who changed his religion or that they identified the message of Muhammed as a "Sabian belief". The former linguistic explanation (i.e. ''saba'' = ''changed his religion'') is the one adopted by most Muslim scholars.

Sabians are often identified with [[Mandaeism]], a small monotheistic community which lives today in [[Iraq]] and call themselves ''Yahyawiya'' ({{lang-ar|يحياوية}}). Muslim scholars traditionally viewed them as followers of the prophets [[Noah]] and ''Yahya'' (i.e. [[John the Baptist]]).&lt;ref name="Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad"&gt;Khalil ‘ibn Ahmad (d. 786–787), who was in Basra before his death, wrote: "The Sabians believe they belong to the prophet Noah, they read ''[[Zaboor]]'' (see also [[Book of Psalms]]), and their religion looks like Christianity." He also states that "they worship the angels."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atenism==
{{Main article|Atenism}}
[[File:La salle dAkhenaton (1356-1340 av J.C.) (Musée du Caire) (2076972086).jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] and his family adoring the Aten.]]

[[Amenhotep IV]] initially introduced [[Atenism]] in Year 5 of his reign (1348/1346 BCE) during the [[18th dynasty]] of the [[New Kingdom]]. He raised [[Aten]], once a relatively obscure Egyptian [[Solar deity]] representing the disk of the sun, to the status of Supreme God in the Egyptian pantheon.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalie David, op. cit., p.125&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the [[cartouche]] form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a [[Sed festival]], a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, this possibly was a festival in honour of [[Amenhotep III]], who some Egyptologists think had a [[coregency]] with his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years.

Year 5 is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, [[Akhetaten]] (''Horizon of the Aten''), at the site known today as [[Amarna]]. Evidence of this appears on three of the boundary [[stele|stelae]] used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (''Agreeable to Aten'') as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/1344 BCE), the capital was moved from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna), though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.

The move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance too—taken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at [[Karnak]] and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of [[Amun]].

In Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon, but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the ''[[Great Hymn to the Aten]]'': "O Sole God beside whom there is none".

The details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but most scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of [[monolatrism|monolatry]] rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. It is known that Atenism did not solely attribute divinity to the Aten. Akhenaten continued the [[imperial cult#Ancient Egypt|cult]] of the Pharaoh, proclaiming himself the [[Son of God|son of Aten]] and encouraging the Egyptian people to worship him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk/amarnareligion.html|title=Ancient Egypt Gods: The Aten|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian people were to worship Akhenaten; only Akhenaten and Nefertiti could worship Aten directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hart|first=George|title=The Routledge dictionary of Egyptian gods and goddesses|year=2005|edition=2nd|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34495-1|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Akhenaten's successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.

==Chinese view==
{{Main article|Shangdi|Tian|Mohism}}
[[File:天-bronze-shang.svg|thumb|upright|[[Shang Dynasty]] [[bronze script]] character for ''tian'' (天), which translates to Heaven and sky.]]
The orthodox faith system held by most dynasties of [[China]] since at least the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1766&amp;nbsp;BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of ''[[Shangdi]]'' (literally "Above Sovereign", generally translated as "God") or [[Tian|Heaven]] as an omnipotent force.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Homer H. Dubs, "Theism and Naturalism in Ancient Chinese Philosophy," ''Philosophy of East and West'', Vol. 9, No. 3/4, 1959&lt;/ref&gt; This faith system pre-dated the development of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] and the introduction of [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]]. It has features of monotheism in that Heaven is seen as an omnipotent entity, a [[Incorporeality|noncorporeal]] force with a [[personal god|personality]] [[transcendent reality|transcending]] the world. From the writings of [[Confucius]] in the ''[[Analects]]'', it is known Confucius believed that Heaven cannot be deceived, Heaven guides people's lives and maintains a personal relationship with them, and that Heaven gives tasks for people to fulfill in order to teach them of virtues and morality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with ''Shangdi''. Still, later variants such as [[Mohism]] (470 BCE–c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of ''Shangdi'', akin to the angels in Abrahamic religions which in turn counts as only one god. In [[Mozi]]'s ''Will of Heaven'' (天志), he writes:

{{quote box |width=60em |align=center
|quote="I know Heaven loves men dearly not without reason. Heaven ordered the sun, the moon, and the stars to enlighten and guide them. Heaven ordained the four seasons, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Summer, to regulate them. Heaven sent down snow, frost, rain, and dew to grow the five grains and flax and silk that so the people could use and enjoy them. Heaven established the hills and rivers, ravines and valleys, and arranged many things to minister to man's good or bring him evil. He appointed the dukes and lords to reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, and to gather metal and wood, birds and beasts, and to engage in cultivating the five grains and flax and silk to provide for the people's food and clothing. This has been so from antiquity to the present."

且吾所以知天之愛民之厚者有矣，曰以磨為日月星辰，以昭道之；制為四時春秋冬夏，以紀綱之；雷降雪霜雨露，以長遂五穀麻絲，使民得而財利之；列為山川谿谷，播賦百事，以臨司民之善否；為王公侯伯，使之賞賢而罰暴；賊金木鳥獸，從事乎五穀麻絲，以為民衣食之財。自古及今，未嘗不有此也。
|source=''Will of Heaven'', Chapter 27, Paragraph 6, ca. 5th century BCE
}}

Worship of ''Shangdi'' and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to ''Shangdi'', usually by slaughtering a completely healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China. Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]] as the last ruler of the Qing declared himself [[son of heaven]].

The supreme god of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] was the god [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr '']]. A number of words derived from the name of this supreme deity are used in various [[Indo-European languages]] to denote a monotheistic God.

In western Eurasia, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion contained elements of monotheism. In the sixth century AD, the Byzantine chronicler [[Procopius]] recorded that the Slavs "acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals."&lt;ref name=katicic2008&gt;{{cite book |last=Katičić |first=Radoslav |title=Božanski boj: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine |year=2008 |publisher=IBIS GRAFIKA |location=Zagreb |isbn=978-953-6927-41-8 |url=http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/120570/96db5654f2d3025b46454ace91716506.pdf |ref=Katičić 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018000746/http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/120570/96db5654f2d3025b46454ace91716506.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deity to whom Procopius is referring is the storm god [[Perún]], whose name is derived from [[Perkwunos|*''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'']], the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning.

Hindu views are broad and range from monism, through pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely polytheistic. Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed that while God's forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many, God is one. The ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]'' of the ''[[murti]]'' is a way to communicate with the abstract one god (''[[Brahman]]'') which creates, sustains and dissolves creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam101.com/religions/hinduism/conceptOfGod.htm |title=Concept Of God In Hinduism By Dr Naik |publisher=Islam101.com |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of auspicious qualities of God are countless, with the following six qualities (''bhaga'') being the most important:
* ''Jñāna'' (omniscience), defined as the power to know about all beings simultaneously
* ''[[Aishvarya]]'' (sovereignty, derived from the word [[Ishvara]]), which consists in unchallenged rule over all
* ''Shakti'' (energy), or power, which is the capacity to make the impossible possible
* ''Bala'' (strength), which is the capacity to support everything by will and without any fatigue
* ''Vīrya'' (vigor), which indicates the power to retain immateriality as the supreme being in spite of being the material cause of mutable creations
* ''Tejas'' (splendor), which expresses His self-sufficiency and the capacity to overpower everything by His spiritual effulgence&lt;ref name= Tapasyananda&gt;{{cite book

In the [[Shaivite]] tradition, the ''[[Shri Rudram]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] श्रि रुद्रम्), to which the Chamakam (चमकम्) is added by scriptural tradition, is a Hindu ''[[stotra]]'' dedicated to [[Rudra]] (an epithet of [[Shiva]]), taken from the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 4.5, 4.7).&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the Śatarudriya see: Kramrisch, pp. 71-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a full translation of the complete hymn see: Sivaramamurti (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Shri Rudram is also known as ''Sri Rudraprasna'', ''{{IAST|Śatarudrīya}}'', and ''Rudradhyaya''. The text is important in [[Vedanta]] where [[Shiva]] is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the [[Names of God|names of a deity]],&lt;ref&gt;For the {{IAST|Śatarudrīya}} as an early example of enumeration of divine names, see: Flood (1996), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition developed extensively in the [[sahasranama]] literature of [[Hinduism]].

The [[Nyaya]] school of Hinduism has made several arguments regarding a monotheistic view. The Naiyanikas have given an argument that such a god can only be one. In the ''Nyaya Kusumanjali'', this is discussed against the proposition of the ''[[Mimamsa]]'' school that let us assume there were many demigods (''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s'') and sages (''[[rishi]]s'') in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Nyaya says that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[If they assume such] omniscient beings, those endowed with the various superhuman faculties of assuming infinitesimal size, and so on, and capable of creating everything, then we reply that the ''law of parsimony'' bids us assume only one such, namely Him, the adorable Lord. There can be no confidence in a non-eternal and non-omniscient being, and hence it follows that according to the system which rejects God, the tradition of the Veda is simultaneously overthrown; there is no other way open.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yP-fIislexUC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=In+other+words,+Nyaya+says+that+the+polytheist+would+have+to+give+elaborate+proofs+for+the+existence+and+origin+of+his+several+celestial+spirits,+none+of+which+would+be+logical,+and+that+it+is+more+logical+to+assume+one+eternal,+omniscient+god.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XcvJAwws4J&amp;sig=mJlpVrEaVtXqdq6u0n6kt6vzuNQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEsZ7mt_zSAhVP5mMKHc5PBc4Q6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20other%20words,%20Nyaya%20says%20that%20the%20polytheist%20would%20have%20to%20give%20elaborate%20proofs%20for%20the%20existence%20and%20origin%20of%20his%20several%20celestial%20spirits,%20none%20of%20which%20would%20be%20logical,%20and%20that%20it%20is%20more%20logical%20to%20assume%20one%20eternal,%20omniscient%20god.&amp;f=false|title=The Arian Christian Doctrines: The Origins of Christianity|last=Studies|first=Institute for Metaphysical|last2=Inc|first2=The Institute for Metaphysi Studies|last3=MM|first3=MR Charles D.

God in Sikhi is called ''[[Waheguru|Vāhigurū]]'', and is [[Nirankar|shapeless]], [[akaal|timeless]], and [[Alakh Niranjan|sightless]]: ''niraṅkār'', ''akaal'', and ''alakh''. God is present (''[[sarav viāpak]]'') in all of creation. God must be seen from "the inward eye", or the "heart".

Sikhism is a monotheistic faith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/sikhism/beliefs.htm |title=Sikh Beliefs and Doctrine |publisher=ReligionFacts |accessdate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multifaithcentre.org/sikhism/71-a-short-introduction-to-sikhism- |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20091221113705/http://www.multifaithcentre.org/sikhism/71-a-short-introduction-to-sikhism- |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-12-21 |title=A Short Introduction to Sikhism |publisher=Multifaithcentre.org |accessdate=2012-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that arose in northern [[India]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. [[Sikh]]s believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], known as the [[Mul Mantra]], signifies this:

:{{lang-pa|ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥}}
:[[Transliteration]]: ikk ōankār sat(i)-nām(u) karatā purakh(u) nirabha'u niravair(u) akāla mūrat(i) ajūnī saibhan&lt;small&gt;(g)&lt;/small&gt; gur(a) prasād(i).
:One Universal creator God, The supreme Unchangeable Truth, The Creator of the Universe, Beyond Fear, Beyond Hatred, Beyond Death, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent, by Guru's Grace.

The word "ੴ" ("Ik ōaṅkār") has two components. The first is ੧, the digit "1" in [[Gurmukhi]] signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: "One Universal creator God".

It is often said that the 1430 pages of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, some derived from [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]], they all refer to the same Supreme Being.

The Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of space and is the creator of all beings in the [[universe]]. The following quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib highlights this point:
{{quote|
"Chant, and meditate on the One God, who permeates and pervades the many beings of the whole Universe. God created it, and God spreads through it everywhere. Everywhere I look, I see God. The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; there is no place without Him."|Guru Granth Sahib, Page 782}}

However, there is a strong case for arguing that the Guru Granth Sahib teaches [[monism]] due to its non-dualistic tendencies:
{{quote|
{{lang-pa|ਸਹਸ ਪਦ ਬਿਮਲ ਨਨ ਏਕ ਪਦ ਗੰਧ ਬਿਨੁ ਸਹਸ ਤਵ ਗੰਧ ਇਵ ਚਲਤ ਮੋਹੀ ॥੨॥}}&lt;br&gt;
"You have thousands of Lotus Feet, and yet You do not have even one foot. You have no nose, but you have thousands of noses. This Play of Yours entrances me." |[[Guru Granth Sahib]], Page 13}}

Sikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to the One [[God]], [[VāhiGurū]]. Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as Islam, Hinduism and [[Christianity]] all worship the same God, and the names [[Allah]], [[Ar-Rahim|Rahim]], [[Al-Karim|Karim]], [[Hari]], [[Rama|Raam]] and [[Brahman|Paarbrahm]] are frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scriptures. Although there is no set reference to God in Sikhism, the most commonly used Sikh reference to God is [[Akal Purakh]] (which means "the true immortal") or [[Waheguru]], the Primal Being.

====Zoroastrianism====

[[File:Faravahar-Gold.svg|thumb|right|[[Faravahar]] (or Ferohar), one of the primary symbols of Zoroastrianism, believed to be the depiction of a Fravashi (guardian spirit)]]

Zorastrianism was once one of the largest religions on Earth, as the official religion of the [[Persian Empire]]. By some scholars,{{who|date=January 2012}} the Zoroastrians ("Parsis" or "Zartoshtis") are credited with being some of the first monotheists and having had influence on other world religions.

===Ancient Greek religion===
{{main|Ancient Greek religion}}

====Classical Greece====
[[File:Xenophanes in Thomas Stanley History of Philosophy.jpg|thumb|right|Fictionalized portrait of [[Xenophanes]] from a 17th-century engraving]]

The surviving fragments of the poems of the classical Greek philosopher [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] suggest that he held views very similar to those of modern monotheists.&lt;ref&gt;McKirahan, Richard D. "Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 61. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems harshly criticize the traditional notion of anthropomorphic gods, commenting that "...if cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,... [they] also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Xenophanes frr. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Xenophanes declares that there is "...one god, greatest among gods and humans, like mortals neither in form nor in thought."&lt;ref name="osborne62"&gt;Osborne, Catherine. "Chapter 4." ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophanes's theology appears to have been monist, but not truly monotheistic in the strictest sense.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Although some later philosophers, such as [[Antisthenes]], believed in doctrines similar to those expounded by Xenophanes, his ideas do not appear to have become widely popular.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s writings, he often presents [[Socrates]] as speaking of "the God" in the singular form. He does, however, often speak of the gods in the plural form as well. The [[Euthyphro dilemma]], for example, is formulated as "Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamb|first1=W. R. M.|title=Euthyphro|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DEuthyph.%3Asection%3D10a|website=Perseus|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hellenistic Religion====
{{main|Hellenistic religion}}
The development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a product of the [[Late Antiquity]]. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, [[origins of Christianity|early Christianity]] was just one of several competing religious movements advocating monotheism.

"[[Henology|The One]]" (Τὸ Ἕν) is a concept that is prominent in the writings of the [[Neoplatonists]], especially those of the philosopher [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

[[File:Columns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.jpeg|thumb|Remains of the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|Temple of Apollo]] at Delphi, Greece.]]

A number of oracles of [[Apollo]] from [[Didyma]] and [[Clarus]], the so-called "theological oracles", dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible]], s.v. "Apollo".&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] concept of the "Uncaused Cause"—never incorporated into the polytheistic ancient Greek religion—has been used by many exponents of Abrahamic religions to articulate their arguments for the existence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic version of God.

The [[Hypsistarian]]s were a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards Monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace. The worship of Zeus as the head-god signaled a trend in the direction of monotheism, with less honour paid to the fragmented powers of the lesser gods.

==New religious movements==
{{Expand section|date=July 2012}}
Various [[New religious movements]], such as [[Cao Dai|Cao Đài]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Seicho no Ie]], and [[Cheondoism]], are monotheistic.

==Tengrism==
{{See also|Tengrism}}
Tengrism or Tangrism (sometimes stylized as Tengriism), occasionally referred to as Tengrianism &lt;!-- Do not put non-English translations on the English Wikipedia page --&gt;, is a modern term&lt;ref&gt;
The spelling ''Tengrism'' is found in the 1960s, e.g. Bergounioux (ed.), ''Primitive and prehistoric religions'', Volume 140, Hawthorn Books, 1966, p. 80.
''Tengrianism'' is a reflection of the Russian term, {{lang|ru|Тенгрианство}}. It is reported in 1996 ("so-called Tengrianism") in Shnirelʹman (ed.), ''Who gets the past?: competition for ancestors among non-Russian intellectuals in Russia'', Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5221-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4iwHp8asmsdEC&amp;pg=PA31 p. 31] in the context of the nationalist rivalry over [[Bulgars#Legacy|Bulgar legacy]]. The spellings ''Tengriism'' and ''Tengrianity'' are later, reported (deprecatingly, in scare quotes) in 2004 in ''Central Asiatic journal'', vol. 48-49 (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GeRVAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Tengriism&amp;dq=Tengriism p. 238].

In ''[[Irk Bitig]]'', Tengri is mentioned as ''Türük Tängrisi'' (God of Turks).&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Roux, Die alttürkische Mythologie, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The term is perceived among [[Turkic peoples]] as a ''national'' religion.

In [[Sino-Tibetan peoples|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Altaic mythologies|Turco-Mongol]] traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely diminished in those regions due to [[ancestor worship]], [[Taoism]]'s [[pantheistic]] views and Buddhism's rejection of a creator God, although Mahayana Buddhism does seem to keep a sense of divinity. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared.

==Native American religion==
Native American theology may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof.

Cherokee for example are monotheist as well as pantheist.

Some researchers have interpreted [[Aztec philosophy]] as fundamentally monotheistic or panentheistic. While the populace at large believed in a polytheistic pantheon, Aztec priests and nobles might have come to an interpretation of [[Teotl]] as a single universal force with many facets.&lt;ref name="iepMaffie"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Maffie|title=Aztec Philosophy|work= [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date= 2005|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aztec.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been criticism to this idea, however, most notably that many assertions of this supposed monotheism might actually come from post-Conquistador bias, imposing an Antiquity pagan model unto the Aztec.&lt;ref&gt;James Maffie, Aztec Philosophy: Understanding a World in Motion, University Press of Colorado, 15/03/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pupitre bois.jpg|thumb|200px|A heavy wooden music stand. This stand is designed for use in a private home or teaching studio. Its weight and fine finish make it unsuitable for daily transportation to rehearsals and gigs.]]
A '''music stand''' is a pedestal or elevated rack designed to hold a paper score or [[sheet music|sheets of music]] in position for reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music stand|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/music-stand|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/music%20stand &lt;/ref&gt; Most music stands for [[orchestra]]l, [[chamber music]] or solo orchestra-family instruments (violin, oboe, trumpet, etc.) can be raised or lowered to accommodate seated or standing performers, or performers of different heights. Many types of keyboard instruments have a built-in or removable music rack or stand where sheet music can be placed. Music stands enable musicians to read sheet music or scores while playing an instrument or conducting, as the stand leaves the hands free. Music stands are sometimes used by singers, however for [[choir]]s, singers typically hold their sheet music in a folder, and singers performing solo recitals or [[opera]] performances typically memorize the lyrics and melodies. Some singers use stands, such as lounge singers and wedding vocalists who have a repertoire of hundreds of songs, which makes remembering all of the verses difficult.

==Types==
[[File:Abant Cuartet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A vocal group using music stands.]]
There are various types of music stands for different purposes and intended users. Folding stands collapse, which makes them convenient to take to rehearsals and performances out of the home. Folding stands are typically used by amateur musicians at rehearsals and performances. Professional musicians are more likely to limit their use of folding stands to rehearsals held outside of normal performance venues (e.g., a [[chamber music]] rehearsal at a private home) or small gigs. Non-folding stands tend to be used by professional orchestras and [[big band]]s for rehearsals and concerts.
===Folding===
====Lightweight====
[[File:Music stand metal folded.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A folding music stand in its collapsed position, ready for transportation.]]
Folding stands range from inexpensive, lightweight models made of metal, which are designed to hold a few pages of sheet music or a thin songbook, to stronger, more expensive heavy-duty models. Metal folding stands often have solid wire extensions or metal "arms" which can be folded out to support more than two pages of music or over-size sheets or pages. This is the kind most often used by music students in [[youth orchestra]]s. Lightweight folding stands are designed to collapsible; if folding stands did not collapse, they would be awkward and unwieldy to carry. The collapsible nature of folding stands makes them small enough to slip into many instrument cases or backpacks. This feature makes folding stands more portable. As such, they are a popular stand type for [[rehearsal]]s, [[audition]]s and even some types of performances. Amateur orchestras and some youth orchestras may ask members to bring folding stands to rehearsals, and sometimes also to performances, as this saves the ensemble the cost of buying or renting, and transporting one or more racks of non-folding stands.

Lightweight stands are not designed to support heavy books of music such as full-size [[fake book]]s; while the fake book may stay open on the stand, the music stand may fall over. Folding stands consist of a rack for the music and a telescoping cylindrical column for supporting the rack, with screws or other fastening devices to secure the extended columns at the desired height. Folding stands typically have a foldable tripod that supports the column and the music shelf. The rack area for holding the music is either pre-set at a slight incline away from the performer (as compared with being straight up), so that a song book or étude book will lie open naturally, or the degree of incline can be adjusted by the performer (on more expensive stands).

The portability of lightweight music stands can lead to some problems. Heavy fake books or full scores may overload the stand, leading to it falling over when a performer turns a page. As well, when a lightweight stand is used with its column fully extended, as by a standing orchestral timpanist or double bass player, a heavy part may be "tippy" on the over-extended column. Oversized parts, which are used in some [[contemporary classical music]], may be too wide to be supported by the stand; a solution that some musicians use is to use multiple stands for oversize parts. As well, during outdoor performances, such as playing at a wedding, picnic or a [[bandstand]], lightweight stands may be blown over by wind, which can interrupt a performance or even, if the stand strikes an instrument, damage the finish of an instrument.

====Heavy duty====
Heavy duty folding models typically use a hollow cylindrical column as the main support and three cylindrical columns arrayed in a tripod to ensure the stand stays upright. Heavy duty stands can reliably support a thick, several hundred page [[fake book]], [[song book]] or a binder full of songs. The height of the column can be raised or lowered to permit the stand to be used for a seated performer (common for most orchestral instruments, except for percussion and sometimes double bass) or a standing performer.

===Non-folding===
[[File:2012-05-20 Musicians leaving a wedding.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Musicians leaving a wedding performance carry non-folding music stands.]]
Professional [[orchestra]]s, [[concert band]]s and [[big band]]s typically use non-portable, non-folding heavy-duty stands. The stands are typically coloured or painted black so that the stands blend in with the black clothing of the musicians and are not distracting. The music holding portion of the stand may be plastic or metal, and in both cases, the music holding portion is supported by a metal column. The part supporting the music often has a shelf below it for pencils, [[rosin]] (for string players), and other rehearsal accessories. The metal column can be raised or lowered to put the stand at the desired height. Professional stands can be lowered to be used for a seated performer or raised for standing performers. Some non-folding stands have perforations in the music rack to reduce the weight of the stand, an especially important consideration when a large number of stands are being moved.

These stands do not fold or collapse (apart from the ability to lower the height of the stand) and are thus rarely used by musicians travelling alone or one-by-one to rehearsals or gigs. The stands can be moved, but for a full orchestra to move its 50-100 stands, which are often loaded onto a heavy rack, a moving truck and movers need to be hired to relocate the stands. Professional stands either have some type of tripod-style or quadruped-style base, or they have a heavy, metal base, often circular.
[[File:2016 Stojak na nuty.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An expensive antique music stand.]]
Some musicians use non-folding, professional stands for all of their rehearsals and gigs, even though this may require them to take more trips to load their gear into the hall. The reason some musicians choose to use non-folding stands is because they are more stable, even with heavy parts or scores, they are more resistant to falling over during outdoor shows, and they look more professional. As well, some performers like to have access to a shelf underneath their stand, to obtain music accessories that are needed throughout a rehearsal or show (e.g., pencils, rosin for string players, picks for guitar players, reeds for reed players, valve oil for brass players, a tuning key for percussionists, etc.)

Musicians may also have expensive non-folding stands in their homes or music studios made of wood or metal. These stands are not designs that are meant to be relocated. Due to their weight and/or their delicate finishes, they are intended to be used in a single location, such as a private home. Some heavy stands are made of carved wood and feature [[bas relief]] carvings and inlay work. Other heavy stands are made of brass, and feature musical motifs such as [[treble clef]]s. Some of these heavy stands are objects of art in their own right.

===Digital===
[[Digital data|Digital]] music stands that use a computer screen to display the music began being used in the 1990s and 2000s. The digital "pages" can be turned by pressing an electronic footpedal, thus enabling performers to play [[chamber music]] or solo pieces with difficult page turns without hiring or finding a volunteer to act as a page turner. The music notation is typically displayed on a [[flatscreen display]] or a [[tablet computer]] screen.
===Marching band===
[[File:Trumpet's lectern.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A marching band "clip" for a [[trumpet]] player.]]
[[Marching band]] or some [[brass band]] members use a small sheet holder called a '''lyre''' or a '''clip''' which, can be attached to an instrument. The clip holds a smaller-sized part for the performer, so she/he can read the music while marching.

===Conducting===
[[File:full score.jpg|thumb|right|A large, heavy conductor's stand.]]
Large, heavy duty music stands are available for [[Conducting|conductors]] of [[orchestra]]s, [[concert band]]s, [[choir]]s and [[big band]]s to hold their heavy, over-size scores of music. These stands are typically not designed to be easily transportable, and they are usually intended for installation in a rehearsal hall or concert hall. Conductor's stands have to be able to be angled much flatter than an instrumentalist's stand, because the conductor reads from a large [[full score|full-score]], which contains the parts for all of the instruments. For some [[symphony|symphonies]], the score can be both thick and heavy; to ensure that the stand is stable, a conducting stand needs to have a heavy, wide base and a sturdy platform for the score. As with professional instrumentalist stands, some conducting stands have a narrow shelf where a conductor can store her [[baton (music)|batons]], [[handkerchief]]s, [[reading glasses]], and, for rehearsals, a small [[metronome]].

===Keyboard instruments===
[[Upright piano]]s, [[grand piano]]s, [[stage piano]]s, [[harpsichord]]s, [[pipe organ]]s, [[Hammond organ]]s and many post-1980s [[electronic keyboard]]s have some type of rack or stand to hold sheet music and/or scores. On some grand pianos, the music stand can be removed, for example, if the performer is playing a piano solo work or a [[piano concerto]] from memory. On some electronic or electric keyboards, the stand can be removed, to facilitate transportation of the instrument to rehearsals and gigs. If the music stands on electronic and electric keyboards were permanently affixed, they would make the instrument harder to load into a van or car, and the stand would be vulnerable to damage. 
[[File:KORG LP350 with music scores on music stand (photozou 43110250) by Ludwig D. Omen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Korg LP350 electronic keyboard with a music stand on the top of the instrument.]]
On some [[digital piano]]s designed for use in a private home or studio, the music rack is permanently installed, but most users of digital pianos do not transport them to rehearsals and gigs, because these instruments often have a number of design features that are not conducive to regular transport (e.g., fixed keyboard legs and a [[modesty panel]] and fixed pedals for sustain and sostenuto). Most keyboardists who are regularly transporting electronic keyboards to rehearsals and gigs use [[stage piano]]s or [[MIDI controller]] keyboards along with a [[sound module]]; on these instruments, all of the accessories (music rack, keyboard stand, sustain pedal) can be disconnected. By enabling the keyboard to be broken down into separate components, it makes the instrument more transportable in a regular car, even including small vehicles. In contrast, a high-end digital piano with a fixed music rack, stand and pedals would need a van and several helpers to transport it.

===Tabletop===
[[File:Music stand table.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A table top stand.]]
While the vast majority of music stands are designed to provide their own support for raising the music rack to the desired height, there are some music racks which are designed for placing on a table or counter. Since a table or counter must be used, this makes these racks unsuitable for instruments such as timpani.

==Challenges==
With outdoor performances, users of music stands can face challenges due to wind blowing the pages of sheet music off the stand or blowing the pages to an incorrect page. To resolve this challenge, performers use metal clips or clothes pins on the sides of the music or lay a sheet of plexiglass over the stand. While these methods prevent the music or pages from being blown by the wind, they make page turns more difficult. As well, users of lightweight folding stand may face challenges on windy days, as the opened pages of a music part may act like a sail and catch the wind, which can lead to the entire stand blowing over. Heavy-duty folded stands, and professional stands are less likely to blow over in outdoor concerts, due to their greater weight. In outdoor concerts where windy conditions are a problem, the most wind-resistant stand is a professional, non-folding stand with a heavy, weighted base.

In opera, ballet and musical theatre, the orchestra (or band in the case of musicals) often plays in an [[orchestra pit]] in front of and at a lower level than the main performance stage. For dramatic reasons, the stage may be darkened at times during the performance, and the [[house lights]] turned off. This darkness could pose challenges for the musicians who are reading parts or chord charts in the pit. To resolve this challenge, small stand lights are clipped onto the tops of stands. To avoid having the stand lights distract audience members, some venues have cloth "hoods" over the lights. Originally, stand lights were incandescent, requiring extension cords running throughout the pit and regular bulb changes. In the 2000s, as [[LED]] lights became more affordable, battery powered LED lights have become widely used. LED lights do not need extension cords and the bulbs almost never need replacement. Stand lights do not clip as securely to thin folding stands. Stand lights clip more securely onto the solid rack of a professional, non-folding stand. A Canadian viola player invented a stand with a built-in LED light, for dark performing settings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ottawalife.com/article/visionary-music-stand-puts-ottawa-at-the-forefront-of-innovation &lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with music desk==
The term ''stand'', as it is used to describe furniture such as a plant stand or music stand, generally implies a relatively small surface area supported at the required height, most usually by a turned leg or support known as a ''standard''. Any inclined surface that can be used for supporting music may be thought of a music stand, although generally this function is divided between two types of furniture: a music stand proper and a music desk. The music stand, as the name suggests, consists of a support for the music raised upon a freestanding column or tripod, which, in addition to being movable may also be adjustable with regard to its height and the angle at which it may be tilted. A music [[desk]] generally implies a similar, tiltable support for the music, but rather than being raised on a stand, instead forms part of a table. In as much as the term "desk" originally implied a sloping-topped table for reading or writing, the slight adjustment necessary to turn a desk into a music desk was a relatively simple matter.

Plastic bags cause many minor and major ecological and environmental issues. The most general issue with plastic bags is the amount of waste produced. Many plastic bags end up on streets and subsequently pollute major water sources, rivers, and streams.

Even when disposed of properly, they take many years to [[decompose]] and break down, generating large amounts of [[garbage]] over long periods of time. If not disposed of properly the bags can pollute [[waterways]], clog [[Sewerage|sewers]] and have been found in oceans affecting the [[habitat]] of [[animals]] and [[marine creatures]].&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt;

Two primary kinds of direct damage to wildlife are entanglement and ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter/publications/docs/trash_that_kills.pdf|title=Marine litter – trash that kills|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildlife animals or birds can become entangled. When the animals or birds are entangled they drown or cannot fly due to entanglement.&lt;ref name="Plastic Waste and Wildlife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plasticwastesolutions.com/plastic-litter/#Plastic%20Waste%20and%20Wildlife|title=Plastic Waste and Wildlife|website=Plastic Waste Solutions|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic bags are often [[ingested]] by animals because they cannot distinguish whether it is food or not. As a result, it clogs their intestines which results in death by starvation.&lt;ref name="Plastic Waste and Wildlife"/&gt; Plastic bags can block drains, trap birds and kill livestock. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] has estimated that over 100,000 whales, seals, and turtles die every year{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} as a result of eating or being trapped by plastic bags. In India, an estimated number of 20 cows die per day as a result of ingesting plastic bags and having their digestive systems clogged by the bags. It is also very common across Africa to have sewers and drain systems clogged by bags which cause severe cases of malaria due to the increased population of mosquitoes that live on the flooded sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.google.de/search?client=opera&amp;q="Getting+Friendly+Environment"+"The+Dell+Challenge"&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8|title=Getting Friendly Environment|publisher=The Dell Challenge|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "white pollution" has been coined in China to describe the local and global effects of discarded plastic bags upon the environment.&lt;ref name=Watts2015&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Watts|first1=Jonathan|title=China's biggest plastic bag maker closes after ban|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/27/china.plasticbags|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 October 2015|date=27 February 2008|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightweight plastic bags are also blown into trees and other plants and can be mistaken for flowers by animals affecting their diet. Plastic bags break down, but they never biodegrade. As a result, any toxic additives they contain—including flame retardants, antimicrobials, and plasticizers—will be released into the environment. Many of those toxins directly affect the endocrine systems of organisms, which control almost every cell in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiener|first=Robert|title=Plastic Pollution|journal=CQ Global Researcher|date=1 July 2010|pages=157–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research shows the average operating "lifespan" of a plastic bag to be approximately 20 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Plastic bags can last in landfill – an anaerobic environment – for up to 1000 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The plastic bags that get dumped in the Pacific Ocean would all eventually end up in the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]]. 80% of the plastic waste comes from land while the rest of the 20% comes from oil platforms and ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts|url=http://garbagepatch.net/greatpacificoceangarbagepatchfacts/|website=Garbage Patch – The Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other pollution issues|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large amount of plastic waste in the Pacific Ocean could be eaten up by marine animals, and this will end up blocking up their breathing passages and digestive systems. Plastic bags not only stay in the Great Pacific garbage patch, they can be washed back up to shore in beaches around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garces|first1=Diego|title=A staggering amount of waste – much of which has only existed for the past 60 years or so – enters the oceans each year.|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/problems/pollution/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Somalia ====

Plastic bags were banned in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland on 1 March 2005 after a 120-day grace period that the government had given to the public to get rid of their stocks. The Ministry of Trade and Industries announced the cabinet decision in a decree titled: "Banning importation, production and use of plastic bags in the country". The bags had been nicknamed "the Hargeysa flower", as many of them ended up being blown around and getting stuck in trees and shrubs, posing a danger to livestock because the animals that feed on the leaves often ingest the bags accidentally. In 2015 the ban was repeated by Presidential Decree No. #JSL/M/XERM/249-3178/042015, again providing for a 120 days grace period to get rid of stocks. To ensure the implementation of the ban, the government constituted enforcement teams in 2016 to conduct special drives which launch probes into business stalls. At least 1000 men and women in uniform deployed into the main markets and shopping malls. The government announced fines against violators who continue selling plastic bags in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/53210/somalia-somaliland-bans-use-plastic-bags Somaliland bans use of plastic bags], IRIN News, 1 March 2005.

==== South Africa ====
Plastic bags were a major concern in [[South Africa]] before the bag levy was introduced in 2004. The bags were never banned, but a levy was introduced, payable by the plastic bag manufacturer.

A strict ban was introduced in Bangladesh in 2002 after floods caused by [[littered]] plastic bags submerged two-thirds of the country in water between 1988 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/top+5/6442656206/story.html|title=Top 5 places with plastic bag bans|date=7 June 2012|author=Nicole Bogart|publisher=Global News|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plastic bags remain a big problem for sewerage system and waterways.

==== Bhutan ====
Bhutan has banned plastic bags, but the legislation has not been very effective so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=22302|title=Plastic ban still ineffective – BBS|date=14 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cambodia ====
Cambodia passed the legislation to impose a plastic bag tax in October 2017. Supermarkets now are charging customers 400 Riels (10 US cents) per plastic bag should they need one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/cambodia-to-charge-customers-for-plastic-bags-9324502|title=Cambodia to charge customers for plastic bags|work=Channel News Asia|date=19 October 2017|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== China ====
A total plastic bag ban on ultra thin plastic bags and a fee on plastic bags was introduced in [[China]] on 1 June 2008. This came into effect because of the problems with sewerage and general waste. One 2009 survey suggests that plastic bag use fell between 60 and 80% in Chinese supermarkets, and 40 billion fewer bags were used. However, first hand accounts clearly indicate, the ban has seen limited success, and that the use of plastic bags remains prevalent. Street vendors and smaller stores, which make up a significant portion of retail in China, do not abide by the policy in part due to difficulties of enforcing the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/3158| title=China's bag ban, one year later| date=10 July 2009| author=Shi Jierui| publisher=China Dialogue| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hong Kong ====
[[Hong Kong]] forbids retailers from giving plastic bags under a certain thickness and for free.&lt;ref name="worldbag reduction" /&gt; A 50 cent plastic bag levy was implemented on 1 April 2015 across Hong Kong. The use of plastic bags dropped 90% after the introduction of the levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/newshour/20110601/107359.shtml| title=Plastic bag ban abroad| date=6 January 2011|publisher=China Network Television|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs show that Hong Kong is phasing out the use of plastic bags at a dramatic rate.

==== India ====
In 2002, [[India]] banned the production of plastic bags below 20&amp;nbsp;µm in thickness to prevent plastic bags from clogging of the municipal drainage systems and to prevent the cows of India ingesting plastic bags as they confuse it for food.&lt;ref name="worldbag reduction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=plastic pollution: cow eating a plastic bag, near the Ganges River, Allahabad, India, 2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/136513/A-cow-eating-a-plastic-bag-discarded-by-Hindu-devotees|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, enforcement remains a problem.

The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has also passed regulation to ban all polythene bags less than 50 microns on 18 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Thickness of Plastic Carry Bags Increased from 40 to 50 Microns|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=138144|publisher=Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to poor implementation of this regulation, regional authorities(states and municipal corporations), have had to implement their own regulation.

Himachal Pradesh was the first state to ban plastic bags less than 30&amp;nbsp;µm. The Karnataka state became first state to ban all forms of plastic carry bags, plastic banners, plastic buntings, flex, plastic flags, plastic plates, plastic cups, plastic spoons, cling films and plastic sheets for spreading on dining tables irrespective of thickness including the above items made of thermacol and plastic which uses plastic micro beads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/Total-plastic-ban-in-Karnataka/articleshow/51397198.cms|title=Total plastic ban in Karnataka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangalore.citizenmatters.in/articles/karnataka-plastic-ban-petition-order-march-2016|title=HC refuses to stay plastic ban; asks plastic industry to go to Green Tribunal|date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indonesia ====
Starting in 2016, Environment Ministry enforced retailers in 23 cities across the archipelago (mini-market, hypermarket, and supermarket) to charge consumers for plastic bags between Rp.200 and Rp.5,000 for each bag including degradable plastic bags. And money which came from tax are used by retailers as public funds for waste management alongside non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/indonesia-launches/2534464.html|title=Indonesia launches campaign to reduce use of plastic bags|date=21 February 2016|author=Sujadi Siswo|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
Since January 2017, large retailers are required to charge consumers for plastic bags with handles, at [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]] 0.10 for each bag. The tax revenues will be used to fund public waste-management programs.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The average use of plastic bags in Israel in 2014 was 275 per person per year.&lt;ref&gt;Udasin, Sharon: [http://www.jpost.com/Enviro-Tech/Knesset-bills-seeks-to-alleviate-scourge-of-plastic-shopping-bags-in-Israel-340958 "Knesset bills seeks to alleviate scourge of plastic shopping bags in Israel "], in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 10 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Four months after the law came into force, the number of disposable plastic bags distributed by retailers subject to the law had dropped by 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-disposable-plastic-bag-use-falls-1001190032|title=Disposable plastic bag use falls very sharply – Globes English|website=Globes|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Myanmar ====
In 2009, plastic bag factories in [[Rangoon]] were ordered by local authorities to stop production by the end of November or face heavy punishment, as the [[Burmese government]] looked to ban plastic bags. Rangoon was thus following in the footsteps of central Burma's [[Mandalay]] and the new capital [[Naypyidaw]], both of which had eliminated plastic bags.

==== Nepal ====
Nepal has banned plastic bags, but the legislation is poorly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/ban-production-use-plastic-bags-comes-effect/|title=Ban on production and use of plastic bags comes into effect|date=17 July 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, the European Commission published a proposal aiming to reduce the consumption of lightweight (thickness below 50 microns) plastic carrier bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-1017_en.htm| title=EUROPA – Press release – Environment: Commission proposes to reduce the use of plastic bags| publisher=European Commission| accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the proposal, EU member states can choose the most appropriate measures to discourage the use of plastic bags.
On 29 April 2015 the European Parliament passed [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] 2015/720 to reduce plastic bag use by 50% by 2017 and 80% by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/sustainable-dev/news/eu-to-halve-plastic-bag-use-by-2019/|title=EU to halve plastic bag use by 2019|author=Cécile Barbière|work=Euractiv|date=29 April 2015|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- News source says it passed on the 28th, but the directive itself is dated 29th --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU directive |serial=2015/720 |year=2015 |date=29 April 2015 |description=amending Directive 94/62/EC as regards reducing the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags |eurlextag=celex%3A32015L0720 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Denmark ====
In 2003, [[Denmark]] introduced a tax on retailers giving out plastic bags. This encouraged stores to charge for plastic bags and pushed the use of reusable bags. It was thought that this saved about 66% of plastic and paper bags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.reuseit.com/learn-more/top-facts/trends-from-around-the-world| title=Learn About Global Efforts to Reduce Waste from Disposable Products| publisher=Reuse it| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a similar law was passed by the ''Inatsisartut ''in Greenland, which applied a recycling tax on plastic bags.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ina.gl/demokratihome/publikationer.aspx?docgallery=10554&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 Denmark had the lowest plastic bag use in Europe, with 4 bags per person per year, compared to 466 in Portugal, Poland and Slovakia.&lt;ref name="ABC 2014"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/environment/articles/2014/04/17/3987712.htm "Europe votes to slash plastic bag use"], ABC News, 17 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Portugal ====

Portugal has implemented a plastic bag tax amounting to 10 cents (€) on single-use carrier bags, which led to a reduction of 90% in their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/plastic-bag-use-plummets-a-year-after-tax-introduction/37473|title=Plastic bag use plummets a year after tax introduction|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many retailers started selling thicker (reusable) plastic bags, which are not subject to the tax, for the same amount. Before the Portuguese government implemented this plastic bag tax, some supermarkets in Portugal had already implemented a 2 cent (€) fee on each plastic bag.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09640568.2010.490054 |title=The influence of a voluntary fee in the consumption of plastic bags on supermarkets from Madeira Island (Portugal) |journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management |volume=53 |issue=7 |pages=883–889 |year=2010 |last1=Luís |first1=Idalina Perestrelo |last2=Spínola |first2=Hélder }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In Madeira Island where supermarkets implemented this bag fee, there was a 64% reduction in plastic bag consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Romania ====
A law was introduced in 2006 (law 578/2006) - and was later modified in 2011 (law 1032/2011) – that puts a mandatory tax on non-biodegradable plastic bags. The modification in 2011 reduced the tax on plastic bags and was regarded by some as a step backwards from environmental protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://legestart.ro/ecotaxa-pe-pungi-si-sacose-pentru-cumparaturi| title=Ecotaxa pe pungi şi sacoşe pentru cumpărături| date=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Switzerland ====
{{See also|Environmental movement in Switzerland|Waste management in Switzerland}}

In 2016, the two largest chains of supermarkets in Switzerland, the [[Federation of Migros Cooperatives]] and [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]], announced that they will progressively stop to distribute free plastic bags (at the check-out).&lt;ref name=Guillaume&gt;{{fr}} Michel Guillaume, "L'économie suisse promet de verdir", ''[[Le temps]]'', Monday 26 September 2016, page 4. Published on-line as [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/09/25/leconomie-suisse-promet-verdir-malgre-rejet-linitiative "L'économie suisse promet de verdir malgré le rejet de l'initiative"] on 25 September 2016 (page visited on 26 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Both distributors announced that they will not make money with paid bags, but that profits from their sale will be invested in environmental projects.&lt;ref name=RTS/&gt;

[[Migros]] previously tested the measure in the [[Canton of Vaud]] since 2013: they reduced the number of plastic bags distributed by ninety percent (and saved 100,000 [[Swiss francs|francs]] per year).&lt;ref name=Guillaume/&gt;&lt;ref name=West&gt;{{fr}} Michael West, "Environnement. « Petits prix pour grands effets »", ''Migros magazine'', number 39, 29 September 2016, page 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Migros will be the first to introduce the measure across the country, on 1 November 2016 (the bags will be made with recycled plastic and cost 0.05 [[Swiss francs]] each).&lt;ref name=Guillaume/&gt;&lt;ref name=West/&gt; [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]] plans to introduce this in 2017.&lt;ref name=RTS&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.rts.ch/info/economie/8036213-chez-coop-et-migros-les-sacs-jetables-vont-desormais-couter-5-centimes.html "Chez Coop et Migros, les sacs jetables vont désormais coûter 5 centimes"], [[Radio télévision suisse]], 22 September 2016 (page visited on 25 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====

The [[Climate Change Act 2008]] served as the legislative framework for the regulation of plastic bags in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everett|first=Michael|last2=Priestley|first2=Sara|title=The 5p Plastic Bag Charge|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7241#fullreport|date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wales=====
Wales introduced a legal minimum charge of 5 pence for almost all single use bags in October 2011. Paper and biodegradable bags are included in the charge as well as plastic bags, with only a few specific exemptions – such as for unpackaged food or medicine supplied on an [[NHS Wales|NHS]] prescription.
[[Value added tax|VAT]] raised from the charge is collected by the government. Retailers are asked to pass the rest of the proceeds on to charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retailers|url=http://www.carrierbagchargewales.gov.uk/retailers/?lang=en|work=Carrier bag charge Wales|publisher=Crown|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 2012 statistics released by the Welsh Government suggested that carrier bag use in Wales had reduced 96% since the introduction of the charge.&lt;ref name="bigfatbags.co.uk"/&gt;

=====Northern Ireland=====
[[Northern Ireland]] introduced a 5 pence levy on almost all single use bags on 8 April 2013. The levy will be extended to reusable carrier bags with a retail price of less than 20 pence from 19 January 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Direct Bag Levy|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/baglevy|website=Carrier bag Levy Northern Ireland|publisher=NI Direct|date=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as data from a number of retailers indicate that reusable bag sales have increased by 800% since the introduction of the levy on single use bags.
The proceeds of the levy (£4.17m in 2013/14) are paid to the Department of the Environment
and used to fund local environmental projects and enforce the levy.
Official statistics for the Northern Ireland levy show that the number of single use bags dispensed fell from around 300 million in 2012/13 to 84.5 million in 2013/14 – a reduction of 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Bag Levy Annual Statistics 2013/14|url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/carrier_bag_levy_-_annual_statistics_2013-14.pdf|website=Carrier bag Levy Northern Ireland Statistics|publisher=DOE NI|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Scotland=====
A five pence minimum charge for single-use carrier bags came into force in [[Scotland]] on 20 October 2014.
The proceeds of the charge can be used by the retailers as they see fit,&lt;ref name=independent-scot&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/scotlands-5p-carrier-bag-charge-comes-into-effect-9806706.html|title=Scotland's 5p carrier bag charge comes into effect|author=Natasha Culzac|date=20 October 2014|work=The Independent|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although retailers are encouraged to pledge to donate proceeds to "good causes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carrierbagchargescotland.org.uk/|accessdate=2015-10-21|title=Home – Carrier Bag Charge Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge is not exclusive to plastic bags, and includes [[biodegradable]] bags, such as paper.&lt;ref name=independent-scot /&gt; Bags for unpackaged food, loose seeds, soil-contaminated goods, axes, knives or blades; drugs or medical appliances; small packaged uncooked fish, meat or poultry; aquatic animals; purchases made in [[Airport security|aerodrome security restricted areas]]; or goods bought on board a ship, train, aircraft, coach or bus are exempt from the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite law|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2014/161/schedule/paragraph/1/made|title=The Single Use Carrier Bags Charge (Scotland) Regulations 2014|article=1|articletype=Schedule|accessdate=2015-10-21|year=2014|number=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the rest of the UK, the English charge does not apply to paper bags or bags made from other natural materials. As with the other nations, [[Value added tax|VAT]] raised on sales will be collected by the Government. Retailers can choose how the money raised from bag sales is used. The Government publishes information yearly on the scheme, encouraging retailers to donate the proceeds to charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34346309|title=The 5p plastic bag charge: All you need to know|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=6 October 2015|date=2016-07-30|last1=Howell|first1=Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carrier bags: why there's a charge |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/single-use-plastic-carrier-bags-why-were-introducing-the-charge/carrier-bags-why-theres-a-5p-charge |publisher=[[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] |date=3 November 2015 |accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote the growth of new businesses in England, retailers with fewer than 250 employees are exempt from the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everett|first=Michael|last2=Priestley|first2=Sara|title=The 5p Plastic Bag Charge|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7241|date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents to the exemption of small retailers argued that this exemption would diminish the environmental impact of the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news/plasticbagsgvtresponse/|title=Plastic bags: Government response – News from Parliament|website=UK Parliament|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this criticism, in the UK government has announced plans to extend the charge to all retailers and double the charge to 10p.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-42630898|title=5p plastic bag charge set to be extended|date=11 January 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/plastic-bag-charge-to-double-to-10p-and-will-also-affect-smaller-retailers-11481388|title=Plastic bag charge to 'double to 10p and will also affect smaller retailers'|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Notes'''
*{{Smallsup|1}} The City of Fort Collins, Colorado passed a 5¢ fee on single-use bags on 19 August 2014, and repealed it on 21 October 2014.
*{{Smallsup|2}} Although the state of Hawaii does not ban plastic bags, all of its local jurisdictions do, effectively banning them statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens Group Pushes City Council to Repeal Disposable Shopping Bag Fee|url=http://fighttheplasticbagban.com/2014/10/23/citizens-group-pushes-city-council-to-repeal-disposable-shopping-bag-fee/#more-2535|accessdate=22 November 2014|date=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Smallsup|3}} On June 22, 2018, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that a bag ban implemented by Laredo, TX was in violation of state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Supreme Court strikes down Laredo's plastic bag ban, likely ending others|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/22/texas-supreme-court-rules-bag-bans/|accessdate=9 August 2018|date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent letters to 11 other Texas cities with bag bans telling them that such bans were now illegal and unenforceable. On July 3, 2018, the City of Austin announced that it would end enforcement of its bag ban. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Austin to end its bag ban after Texas Supreme Court ruling|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/07/03/report-austin-end-its-bag-ban-after-texas-supreme-court-ruling/|accessdate=9 August 2018|date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== California =====
Californians voted in November 2016 to approve state legislation banning plastic bags statewide in Propositions [[California Proposition 67 (2016)|67]] and [[California Proposition 65 (2016)|65]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13551320/science-issues-election-2016-measures-climate-energy-health-marijuana|title=10 science issues at stake in the 2016 election|first=Alessandra|last=Potenza|date=7 November 2016|publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 local laws with similar or tougher regulations will remain and supersede the statewide legislation.

{{main|Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags in Australia}}
Although the nation does not ban lightweight bags, the states of [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], and the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and [[Northern Territory]], along with some cities have independently banned the bag.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Coles Bay, Tasmania]] was the first location in Australia to ban the bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-04-29-tasmania-carries-ecofight-bans-plastic-bags| title=Tasmania carries eco-fight, bans plastic bags| date=29 April 2003| publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the "Zero Waste" program in South Australia led to its lightweight bag ban in October 2008.

In 2012, the [[Buenos Aires]] [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|city government]] allowed [[supermarkets]] to charge for plastic bags in order to discourage their use, which is said to have reduced their use by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El gobierno porteño anunció que desde 2017 se prohibirán bolsas plásticas en los súper|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201609/161475-bolsas-plasticas-supermercados-ciudad-gobierno-porteno.html|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the city announced a full ban on the distribution of plastic bags in supermarkets and hypermarkets, commencing 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adiós a un clásico: desde 2017, no habrá más bolsas de plástico en los súper porteños|url=http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Adios-clasico-bolsas-plastico-portenos_0_1643235849.html|website=Clarin|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polémica por la prohibición de bolsas en los comercios porteños|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1934273-polemica-por-la-prohibicion-de-bolsas-en-los-comercios-portenos|website=La Nacion|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Uruguay ====
Legislation banning non-biodegradable bags and applying a charge to biodegradable bags has been passed by the government of Uruguay but is yet to enter into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/politica/senado-aprobo-ley-bolsas-plasticas-trata.html|title=Senado aprobó la ley sobre el uso de bolsas plásticas, ¿de qué se trata?|first=|last=ElPais|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different methods of phase-out ==
Two of the most popular methods of phasing out lightweight plastic bags have been outlined above, including both fees and bans. The fee strategy is said to have all of the same results in plastic bag reduction as a plastic bag ban, with the additional benefit of creating a new revenue source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lisa |last1=Skumatz |first2=Dana |last2=D'Souza |date=November 2016 |title=Bag ban basics |journal=Plastics Recycling Update |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=16–19 |url=https://resource-recycling.com/plastics/2016/12/08/bag-ban-basics/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plastic bag fee method also protects consumer choice, which the ban does not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Recycling of plastic bags can be another method of phase-out. However, a big issue with recycling is that only 5% of plastic bags make it to recycling facilities to begin with.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even when bags are brought to these recycling bins and facilities, they often fly out of these bins or recycling trucks and end up as litter on the streets.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Momentum for Plastic Bag Bans Spreading; Recycling Programs Earn Mixed Reviews |journal=Solid Waste Report |volume=45 |issue=8 |date=April 25, 2014 |pages=5–6 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/95763387/momentum-plastic-bag-bans-spreading-recycling-programs-earn-mixed-reviews }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue with recycling is that different bags are made from different yet aesthetically similar types of plastics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bags can be either made of bioplastics or biodegradable plastics, and if accidentally combined in a compost, the bioplastics could contaminate the biodegradable composting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These bags can also jam recycling equipment when mixed with other types of plastic, which can be costly to repair.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Costs of repairs rounded out to be about $1 million per year in San Jose, California.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Individuals can also engage in advocacy local officials and local merchants. With the rise in eco-tourism &lt;ref&gt;https://travel.usnews.com/features/why-ecotourism-is-booming&lt;/ref&gt; and green travel, there are many opportunities to say no to plastic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://theluckystraw.com/blogs/news/9-popular-languages-say-no-thank-you-to-single-use-plastics | title=Say "No to Plastic" in 9 Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The term '''psychic apparatus''' (also '''psychical apparatus''', '''mental apparatus''') denotes a central, theoretic construct of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[metapsychology]], wherein:

{{quote|We assume that mental life is the function of an apparatus to which we ascribe the characteristics of being extended in space and of being made up of several portions &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Id, ego and super-ego]].|Freud, ''An Outline of Psychoanalysis'' (1940)}}

As a [[Ego psychology|psychologist]], [[Sigmund Freud]] used the German terms '''''psychischer Apparat''''' and '''''seelischer Apparat''''', about the functioning of which he elaborates:

{{quote|We picture the unknown apparatus, which serves the activities of the mind, as being really like an instrument constructed of several parts (which we speak of as 'agencies'), each of which performs a particular function, and which have a fixed, spatial relation to one another: it being understood that by 'spatial relation'—'in front of' and 'behind', 'superficial' and 'deep'—we merely mean, in the first instance, a representation of the regular succession of the functions.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Freud proposed the psychic apparatus as solely a theoretic construct explaining the functioning of the [[mind]], and not a [[Neurology|neurologic]] structure of the [[brain]]:

{{quote|It is a [[hypothesis]], like so many others in the sciences: the very earliest ones have always been rather rough. 'Open to revision', we can say in such cases ... the value of a 'fiction' of this kind ... depends on how much one can achieve with its help.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

Moreover, in emphasizing the immateriality of the psychic apparatus, Freud dismissed the matter of its physical substance:

{{quote|That is not a subject of psychological interest. [[Ego psychology|Psychology]] can be as indifferent to it as, for instance, optics can be to the question of whether the walls of a telescope are made of metal or cardboard. We shall leave entirely to one side the '''material''' line of approach.|Freud, ''The Question of Lay Analysis'' (1926)}}

'''Religion and peacebuilding''' refers to the study of religion's role in the development of peace. Scholars generally accept that religion has been, at different points in history, both advantageous and [[religion and violence|ruinous to the promotion of peace]]&lt;ref&gt;John Siebert, "Religion and Violent Conflict: A Practitioner's Functional Approach," The Ploughshares Monitor, Vol 28, No.2 (Summer 2007),pp9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many approaches to explaining this variability.

Nathan C. Funk and Christina J. Woolner categorize these approaches into three models. The first is “peace through religion alone”. This proposes to attain world peace through devotion to a given religion. Opponents claim that advocates generally want to attain peace through their particular religion only and have little tolerance of other ideologies. 
The second model, a response to the first, is “peace without religion”. Critics claim that it is overly simplistic and fails to address other causes of conflict as well as the peace potential of religion. It is also said that this model excludes the many contributions of religious people in the development of peace. Another critique claims that both approaches require bringing everyone into their own ideology.

The third and final approach is known as “peace with religion”. This approach focuses on the importance of coexistence and interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan C. Funk and Christina J. Woolner, "Religion and Peace and COnflict Studies," in Critical Issues in Peace and Conflict Studies, ed. Thomas Matyok, Jessica Senehi, and Sean Byrne (Toronto: Lexington Books, 2011), pp 351-358.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerrie ter Haar suggests that religion is neither inherently good nor bad for peace, and that its influence is undeniable.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrie ter Haar, "Religion: Source of Conflict or Resource for Peace?" in Bridge or Barrier: Religion, Violence and Visions for Peace, ed. Gerrie ter Haar and James J. Busuttil (Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill, 2005), pp. 18-36&lt;/ref&gt; Peace with religion, then, emphasises promoting the common principles present in every major religion.

A major component of religion and peacebuilding is faith-based [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs). Douglas Johnston points out that faith-based NGOs offer two distinct advantages. The first is that since faith-based NGOs are very often locally based, they have immediate influence within that community. He argues that “it is important to promote indigenous ownership of conflict prevention and peacebuilding initiatives as early in the process as possible.” The second advantage Johnston presents is that faith-based NGOs carry [[moral authority]] that contributes to the receptivity of negotiations and policies for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Johnston, "Faith-Based Organizations: The Religious Dimension of Peacebuilding." in People Building Peace II: Successful Stories of Civil Society, ed Paul van Tongeren, et al (Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner, 2005), pp. 209-218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism and peacebuilding==
{{main|Judaism and peace}}

===Hebrew Bible===

The Hebrew Bible contains many sources for religious peacebuilding. Some of which include:

*The [[Priestly Blessing]] ({{bibleverse||Numbers|6:24–26|HE}}) ends with: "May God lift up his face onto you and give you '''peace'''"
*{{bibleverse||Leviticus|26:6|HE}}: "And I shall place '''peace''' upon the land"
*{{bibleverse||Numbers|25:12|HE}}: "Behold I give him my covenant of '''peace'''"
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|57:19|HE}}: '''Peace, peace''' to the distant and the close"
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|11:5|HE}}: The LORD examines the righteous, but the wicked, those who love violence, he hates with a passion.
*{{bibleverse||Psalms|34:15|HE}}: "Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it"
*{{bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|9:17-18|HE}}:" The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools. Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
*{{bibleverse||Isaiah|11:6-9|HE}}:The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together;and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
* {{Bible verse||Isaiah|2:4|121}} &amp; {{Bible verse||Micah|4:3|121}} They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.

===Project Ploughshares===
{{Main|Project Ploughshares}}
[[Project Ploughshares]] is a Canadian non-government organization concerned with the prevention of war, the [[disarmament]] of weapons, and peacebuilding. Though it is an agency of the [[Canadian Council of Churches]] and is sponsored by the nine national churches of Canada, Project Ploughshares is run by and for people of a variety of different faith backgrounds. Project Ploughshares works with various NGOs operating abroad to develop research and complete analyses of government policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/faq#FAQ5|title=FAQ|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Project Ploughshares' work has included meeting with prime ministers to discuss nuclear disarmament, establishing and coordinating an agency for disarmament and security of the Horn in Africa, working with the UN and NATO on policy-making, and publishing research papers, one of which was endorsed by over 40 000 Canadians and had a serious influence over Canada's decision not to declare war on Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/accomplishments|title=Accomplishments|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Ploughshares takes its name from Isaiah 2:4 where it is written "God shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their [[swords into ploughshares]], and spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/content/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pax Christi===
{{Main|Pax Christi}}
[[Pax Christi]] is the "official international Catholic peace movement" as recognized by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Marie, [http://www.cmsm.org/forum/forum_summer08_psi.html “Pax Christi International”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304180629/http://www.cmsm.org/forum/forum_summer08_psi.html |date=2014-03-04 }} ‘’CMSM Forum," Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded after [[World War II]] as reconciliary movement by French citizens including Bishop [[Pierre-Marie Théas]] of [[Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes|Tarbes and Lourdes]]. First goal was the reconciliation between [[France]] and [[Germany]]; the German branch or section later concentrated on reconciliation with [[Poland]] and initiated the foundation of the [[:de:Maximilian-Kolbe-Werk]].

Today the Pax Christi network membership is made up of 18 national sections and 115 Member Organizations working in over 50 countries,
focusing on five main issues: human rights, human security, disarmament and demilitarisation, just world order, and religion and peace.

==The Bahá'í Faith and peacebuilding==

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] requires believers to avoid prejudice in daily life, to be friendly to people of all [[religions]], social statuses, nationalities or various [[culture|cultural]] traditions. At the nation's level, it calls for negotiation and dialogue between country leaders, to promote the process of world peace. For world peace, the Bahá'í Faith has the notion of "the Lesser Peace" and "the Great Peace". The previous one is considered the level of political peace, that a peace treaty is signed, and wars are eliminated; the latter refers to [[God]]'s kingdom on earth, the world reaches its unity and in cooperation, all world's people uses an auxiliary language, a unified currency system, achieves economic justice, a world tribunal is available, and massive disarmament of all countries.

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], discouraged all forms of violence, including religious violence, writing that his aim was to: ``quench the flame of hate and enmity" and that the ``religion of God is for love and unity; make it not the cause of enmity or dissension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kitab-i-Ahd|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-16.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned of the dangers of religious fanaticism describing it as a ``world devouring fire",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah|pages=288|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-132.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited holy war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Bisharat|pages=21|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and condemned the shedding of blood, the burning of books, the shunning of the followers of other religions and the extermination of communities and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Tablet of the World|pages=91|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] promoted the concept of the oneness of the world and human beings describing the Earth as "but one country, and mankind its citizens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tablets of Baha'u'llah Revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas, Tablet of Maqsud|pages=167|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] identified the elimination of disunity as a necessary pre-requisite to peace.  "The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah|pages=286|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-131.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, as a contribution to the 1986 International Year of Peace, the international governing body of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[the Universal House of Justice]], released a major statement on the promotion of peace, that was distributed worldwide by the Bahá'í community. The statement sets out an analysis and strategy for creation of a more peaceful world. It identifies the following barriers to peace: racism, economic injustice, uncontrolled nationalism, religious strife, inequality between man and women, an absence of universal education, and the need for an international auxiliary language. The statement concludes with a call for establishment of the "oneness of humanity", a call which implies "no less than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized world — a world organically unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the national characteristics of its federated units."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Promise of World Peace|url=http://www.bahai.org/documents/the-universal-house-of-justice/promise-world-peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism and peacebuilding==

===Buddhist scripture===

===Engaged Buddhism===
{{Main|Engaged Buddhism}}

'''Engaged Buddhism''' is a term coined by [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] in the 1960s to describe a more socially active form of Buddhism. Originating during the [[Indochina Wars]] with Nhat Hanh and the [[Unified Buddhist Church]], adherents of Engaged Buddhism became participants in the war, not against the Americans or the Vietnamese, but against the violence itself, which they saw as unnecessary. They attempted to draw attention to the injustices of the war by placing themselves directly between the lines of battle and even engaging in [[self immolation]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S. Queen, "The Peace Wheel: Nonviolent Activism in the Buddhist Tradition," in Subverting Hatred: The Challenge of Nonviolence in Religious Traditions, ed. Daniel L. Smith-Christopher (Cambridge, MA: Boston Research Center for the 21st Century, 1998)pp38-43&lt;/ref&gt;

Engaged Buddhism represents a socially aware non-violent movement within the larger Buddhist community. Inspired by the Buddhist tradition of the Peace Wheel and the teachings of non-violence of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], Engaged Buddhism has since spread to other conflicts in other countries, with groups in Tibet, struggling for self-determination; in Burma and Cambodia, advocating for human rights; in [[Sri Lanka]], promoting the [[Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement]]; and in India, working with [[Dalit|untouchables]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S.

Smith-Christopher (Cambridge, MA: Boston Research Center for the 21st Century, 1998)pp39&lt;/ref&gt; The group has also since opened up churches in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher S.

The '''Rutherford Appleton Laboratory''' ('''RAL''') is one of the national scientific research laboratories in the UK operated by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stfc.ac.uk/ | date = 23 June 2005 | title = Science and Technology Facilities Council |publisher=Science and Technology Facilities Council |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as the '''Rutherford High Energy Laboratory''', merged with the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] in 1975 to create the '''Rutherford Lab'''; then in 1979 with the [[Appleton Laboratory]] to form the current laboratory.

It is located on the [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] at [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] near [[Didcot]] in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. It has a staff of approximately 1,200 people who support the work of over 10,000 scientists and engineers, chiefly from the university research community. The laboratory's programme is designed to deliver trained manpower and economic growth for the UK as the result of achievements in science.

==History==
RAL is named after the [[physicist]]s [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]].

The National Institute for Research in Nuclear Science (NIRNS) was formed in 1957 to operate the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory established next to the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] on the former [[RAF Harwell]] airfield between [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] and [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]]. The 50 [[Electron volt|MeV]] [[proton]] [[linear accelerator]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/83354m18260g2737/ | date = January 1955 | title = Proton linear accelerators for nuclear research, and the A.E.R.E. 600 MeV project | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = 2 | pages = 413–422 |accessdate=6 June 2009| doi = 10.1007/BF02746099 | last1 = Pickavance | first1 = T. G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; was transferred from the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] to the new laboratory to become a national facility for particle physics as the [[Nimrod (synchrotron)]]. Some components of this [[linear accelerator]] are still operating as part of the [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS Neutron and Muon Source]] injector linac over 50 years after their first use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/learning/video/inside-the-isis-linear-particle-accelerator11761.html | date = 6 March 2011 | title = Inside the ISIS linear particle accelerator |publisher=Science and Technology Facilities Council |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the laboratory has grown both with the expansion of its established facilities, and the incorporation of facilities from other institutions to provide the benefits from [[economies of scale]]. The major mergers were in 1975 with the adjacent [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] creating the Rutherford Laboratory, and then in 1979 with the [[Appleton Laboratory]] to form the current Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. With the closure of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] in 1998, some small offices also moved to RAL. Similarly, laser technology moved to RAL from [[Joint European Torus]] at [[Culham]] to become the foundation of the Central Laser Facility.

To be able to decide the priorities for government funding across all areas of scientific research, the Science &amp; Technology Act of 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1965/plain/cukpga_19650004_en | date = 23 March 1965 | title = Science &amp; Technology Act, 1965 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; created the Science Research Council (SRC) which took over management of the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory from NIRNS along with many other previously disparate UK science bodies. To prioritise economic impact over [[blue skies research]], the SRC became the [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (SERC) in the early 1980s, and in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1994/Uksi_19940611_en_1.htm#tcon | date = 5 March 1994 | title = The Research Councils, (Transfer of Property etc) Order 1994 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the SERC was eventually divided into three [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] (the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]], [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council|PPARC]] and the [[Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils|CCLRC]] – which took responsibility for RAL from EPSRC in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950630_en_1.htm | date = 3 March 1995 | title = The Research Councils, (Transfer of Property etc) Order 1995 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), so that each could then focus its development around one of three incompatible business models – administratively efficient short duration grant distribution, medium term commitments to international agreements, long term commitments to staff and facilities provision. To unify the planning of the provision for UK scientists to access large national and international facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/pdf/uksi_20070279_en.pdf | date = 7 February 2007 | title = The Science and Technology Facilities Council Order 2007 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 the CCLRC merged with PPARC and incorporated the [[nuclear physics]] discipline from EPSRC to create the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] which then took responsibility for RAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/pdf/uksi_20070770_en.pdf | date = 8 March 2007 | title = The Research Councils, (Transfer of Property etc) Order 2007 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
RAL hosts two of the UK's major scientific facilities:

[[ISIS neutron source|ISIS Neutron and Muon Source]] is a [[spallation]] [[neutron source]]. The neutrons it produces are mainly used in [[neutron scattering]] experiments to study the atomic structure and dynamics of materials. [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS Neutron and Muon Source]] has been in operation since 1984, annually supporting a national and international community of 3,000 researchers from academia and industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stfc.ukri.org/files/impact-publications/isis-neutron-and-muon-source-lifetime-impact-report/|title=ISIS Lifetime Impact Study|last=|first=|date=|website=stfc.ukri.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ISIS Neutron and Muon Source evolved from the original [[Nimrod (synchrotron)|Nimrod]] proton synchrotron,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1961/mar/14/nuclear-research-nimrod-proton | date = 14 March 1961 | title = Commons Hansard |publisher=[[House of Commons]] |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose location is currently used for the synchrotron which generates the neutrons and muons used to study materials at the facility.

The Central Laser Facility provides access to large scale laser systems for researchers from the United Kingdom and other EU countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.clf.rl.ac.uk/ | date = April 2007 | title = Central Laser Facility |publisher= Science and Technology Facilities Council |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility operates high power glass and Ti:Sapphire laser installations(including the [[Vulcan laser|Vulcan]] and Gemini [[lasers]]) and a number of smaller scale, tuneable lasers. A vigorous development programme ensures that facilities maintain their international competitiveness.

A third major facility is sited next to RAL and mostly owned by the STFC, sharing campus infrastructure:

The [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] was controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1999/nov/25/synchrotron | date = 25 November 1999| title = Hansard vol 339 c164W |website=Hansard  |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2000/apr/18/synchrotron | date = 18 April 2000| title = Hansard vol 348 c424W |website=Hansard  |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo000523/text/00523w20.htm |date=23 May 2000 |website=Hansard |accessdate=6 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605032501/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199900/cmhansrd/vo000523/text/00523w20.htm |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; chosen over the [[Daresbury Science and Innovation Campus]] as the site for the [[synchrotron light]] source [[Diamond Light Source|Diamond]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.diamond.ac.uk/ | date = 23 June 2005 | title = Diamond Light Source |publisher=DLS |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which officially opened in January 2007.

RAL also hosts several minor facilities, including:
* Microelectronics Support Centre (MSC)
* [[National Grid Service|NGS]] UK national academic computing grid
* [[GridPP]]'s Tier1 computing centre
* Energy Research Unit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eru.rl.ac.uk/  | date = 23 June 2005 | title = Energy Research Unit |publisher=Science and Technology Facilities Council |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAL hosts a number of other resources and services in [[microelectronics]], [[atmospheric science]]s, [[spectroscopy]] and [[renewable energy]] research.

==Programmes==
In addition to hosting facilities for the UK, RAL also operates departments to co-ordinate the UK programme of participation in major international facilities. The largest of these are the areas of [[particle physics]], and [[space science]].

In [[particle physics]] the largest international project is the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]], but RAL has a major role in the UK participation in several other projects such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hepwww.rl.ac.uk/ | date = 23 June 2005 | title = Particle Physics Department | publisher = Science and Technology Facilities Council | accessdate = 2 November 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081219072104/http://hepwww.rl.ac.uk/ | archivedate = 19 December 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[MINOS]] – Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search,
* the [[T2K]] – to measure the third type of neutrino oscillation,
* experiments to measure the electric dipole moment of the neutron at the [[Institut Laue–Langevin]],
* [[International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment]],
* the [[UK Dark Matter Collaboration]] experiment at the Boulby Mine in Yorkshire.

In [[space science]], RAL builds components for, and tests satellites, as well as receiving, analysing and curating the data collected by those spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sstd.rl.ac.uk/ |date=23 June 2005 |title=Space Science and Technology Department |publisher=Science and Technology Facilities Council |accessdate=2 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610002830/http://www.sstd.rl.ac.uk/ |archivedate=10 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite missions in which RAL has a significant role include:

==Economic impact==
{{original research|section|date=June 2010}}
In recent years, there has been an increasing political drive towards requiring that the science undertaken at RAL and the technology created there result in a proportional economic benefit to the UK to justify the investment of public funds in the laboratory. RAL management have argued that this is achieved in various ways, including:

* From the commercial products and services resulting from the scientific results which are achieved on the facilities at RAL (e.g., through new materials, new drugs etc.).
* Through the early warning of disasters predicted from terrestrial and space data acquired and analysed at RAL (e.g., radio/mobile phone interference predictions, severe weather predictions etc.).
* Through the training of specialist scientists and engineers at RAL, who then move into commercial companies.
* Through the standardisation of technologies which has resulted in the acceleration of economic growth through interoperability and interchangeability of products — especially in computing.
* By the enthusiasm generated in science by the results of large facilities (e.g., from astronomical images or from particle physics experiments), which leads to schoolchildren choosing scientific training and scientific careers in many fields.
* By technologies developed at RAL during the development of facilities themselves, which are then licensed to UK companies, or spin-out companies.

==In popular culture==
RAL was used as a set for the filming of an episode of [[Terry Nation]]'s [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Blake's 7]]''.

The [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) for [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' were created at the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] which is now part of RAL.

The Space Science department featured in the "In the Box" episode of the [[CBeebies]] series ''[[Nina and the Neurons]]''.

The '''Rylands Papyri''' are a collection of thousands of [[papyrus]] fragments and documents from [[North Africa]] and [[Greece]] housed at the [[John Rylands University Library]], [[Manchester]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The collection includes the [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], also known as the "St John's fragment", a fragment from a [[papyrus]] [[codex]], generally accepted as the earliest extant record of a [[Canonical gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[7Q5]] for an alternate candidate.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblefacts.org/history/oldtext.html List of Ancient [[New Testament]] Manuscripts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203110136/http://biblefacts.org/history/oldtext.html |date=2009-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleandscience.com/languages/greek.htm&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{P}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; on the Institute for Biblical &amp; Scientific Studies website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The collection==
The Rylands Papyri collection held by the John Rylands University Library, is one of the most extensive and wide-ranging [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]] collections in the [[United Kingdom]]. It includes religious, devotional, literary and administrative texts. The collection includes 7 [[hieroglyph]]ic and 19 [[hieratic]] papyri which are funerary documents dating from the 14th century [[Common Era|BCE]] to the 2nd century [[Common Era|CE]]. It also holds 166 [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] papyri, mostly dating from the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] period, including the famous ''[[Petiese|Petition of Petiese]]'' (pRylands 9)&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaew2.bbaw.de Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae], G. Vittmann ed., ''P. Rylands 9'',  Demotische Textdatenbank, Akademie f&amp;uuml;r Sprache und Literatur Mainz&lt;/ref&gt; from the reign of [[Darius I of Persia]].&lt;ref name=JRL&gt;[http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/insight/papyrus.htm The Rylands Papyri on the [[John Rylands University Library]]]website&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection also houses about 500 [[Coptic language|Coptic]] papyri, and around 800 [[Arabic language|Arabic]] papyri consisting of private letters, together with tradesmen's and household accounts. Among the roughly 2,000 [[Koine Greek|Greek]] papyri are the famous fragments of the ''[[Gospel of John]]'' and ''[[Deuteronomy]],'' the earliest surviving fragments of the [[New Testament]] and the [[Septuagint]] (Papyrus 957, the Rylands Papyrus iii.458)&lt;ref name=JRL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dines |first=Jennifer Mary |authorlink= |last2=Knibb |first2=Michael Anthony |author2-link= |title=The Septuagint |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2004 |location= |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qv8Riv3QIbQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=0-567-08464-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively; [[Papyrus 31]], a fragment of a papyrus manuscript of the ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]''; and [[Papyrus 32]], a fragment of the ''[[Epistle to Titus]].'' Also held in the collection is [[Papyrus Rylands 463]], a copy of the apocryphal ''[[Gospel of Mary]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]], and John Rylands Papyrus 470, a prayer in [[Koine Greek]] to the [[Theotokos]], written about 250 [[Common Era|CE]] in brown ink, the earliest known copy of such a prayer. It was acquired by the Library in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theoblogoumena.blogspot.com/2007/08/john-rylands-papyrus-470.html John Rylands Papyrus 470]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alan Turing Building Manchester from Upper Brook St July 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Alan Turing Building. Home of the School of Mathematics from July 2007]]
The '''School of Mathematics''' at the [[University of Manchester]] is one of the largest
&lt;ref name="location"&gt;Certainly the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge]] is larger. Exact figures for Cambridge are hard to come by as the faculty is divided into [[DPMMS]] and [[DAMTP]] (which includes some physicists). In the 2001 RAE Cambridge returned 60 applied mathematicians and 38 pure mathematicians as lecturers and professors. In any measure Cambridge is bigger. Oxfords 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise|RAE]] return {{cite web |url=http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/submissions/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203002456/http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/submissions/index.htm |archivedate=3 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }} lists 43 pure, 32 applied and also 12 statisticians making it slightly larger than and the size may have increased. Probably the next biggest after Manchester is Leeds with about 70 academic staff over pure, applied and statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; mathematics departments in the United Kingdom, with around 80 academic staff and an undergraduate intake of roughly 400 a year (including students studying mathematics with a minor in another subject)&lt;ref&gt;League Tables of UK Mathematics Departments, [http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~bl/maths_league/uk-maths-league-tables.html] gives more details of size.&lt;/ref&gt; and another 200 postgraduate students. The school was formed in 2004 by the merger of the mathematics departments of [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]] (UMIST) and the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] (VUM).  In July 2007 the school moved from the [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]] into a purpose-designed building – the first three floors of the [[Alan Turing Building]] – on Upper Brook Street.

==Organization==
[[Image:Alan Turing building atrium July 2007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The atrium of the Alan Turing Building]]
The current head of the school is [[Peter Duck (mathematician)|Peter Duck]]. The school is divided, mainly for the purposes of teaching administration, into three groups: ''Pure Mathematics'' headed by Mark Kambites, ''Applied Mathematics'' headed by Oliver Jensen, and ''Probability and Statistics'' headed by Goran Peskir. The Manchester Institute for Mathematical Sciences (MIMS) is a unit of the school focusing on the organising of mathematical colloquia and conferences, and research visitors. MIMS is headed by [[Nicholas Higham|Nick Higham]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], who is also Director of Research. Other high-profile mathematicians at Manchester include Sir [[Martin J. Taylor|Martin Taylor]] FRS and [[Jeff Paris (mathematician)|Jeff Paris]] (Fellow of the [[British Academy]])

Since its formation, the school has made some influential appointments including the [[Topology|topologist]] [[Viktor Buchstaber]] (a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]) and [[Model theory|model theorist]] [[Alex Wilkie]] FRS. Numerical analyst [[Jack Dongarra]], famous as one of the authors of [[LINPACK]], was appointed in 2007 as Turing Fellow. In the autumn of 2007 another corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences [[Albert Shiryaev]] was appointed to a 20% chair. Shiryaev is famous for his work on probability theory (he was a student of [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]) and for his work on [[financial mathematics]].

==Research==

As might be expected from its size, the school has a wide range of research interests, including the traditionally pure areas of [[Algebra]], [[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]], [[Noncommutative geometry]], [[Ergodic theory]], [[Mathematical logic]], [[Number theory]], [[Geometry]] and [[Topology]]; and the more applied [[Dynamical system]], [[Fluid dynamics]], [[Solid mechanics]], [[Inverse problem]]s, [[Mathematical finance]], [[Wave propagation]] and [[Scattering]]. The school also has a strong tradition in [[Numerical analysis]] and well established groups in [[Probability theory]], and [[Mathematical statistics]].

Manchester mathematicians have a long tradition of applying mathematics to industrial problems. Nowadays this involves not only the traditional applications in engineering and the physical sciences, but also in the life sciences and the financial sector. Some of the recent industrial partners include [[Qinetiq]], [[Hewlett Packard]], [[Numerical Algorithms Group|NAg]], [[MathWorks]], [[Comsol]], [[Philips]] Labs, [[Thales Underwater Systems]], [[Rapiscan Systems]] and [[Schlumberger]].

===Research Assessment Exercise (2008)===


The School of Mathematics entered research into three units of assessment. In Pure Mathematics 20% of submissions from 27 FTE category A staff were rated 4* (World Class) and 40% 3* (Internationally Excellent). In Applied Mathematics 25% of submissions from 28.8 FTE category A staff were rated 4* and 35%, 3*. And in Statistics and Operational Research, 20% of submissions from 10.9 FTE category A staff were rated 4* and 35%, 3*.&lt;ref name="RAE 2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Assessment Exercise 2008|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/Submissions/submissions.aspx?id=163&amp;type=hei|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time of merger the two departments that came together to form the school were of roughly equal sizes and academic strengths, and already had a substantial record of collaboration including shared research seminar programmes and fourth year undergraduate and MSc programmes.

Many famous mathematicians have worked at the precursor departments to the school.

In 1885 [[Horace Lamb]], famous for his contribution to [[fluid dynamics]] accepted a chair at the VUM and under his leadership the department grew rapidly. Newman wrote:

:'His lecture courses were numerous, and his books provide a record of his methods. Many of his students were engineers, and they found in him a sympathetic guide, one who understood their difficulties and shared their interest in applications of mathematics to mechanics.'

In 1907 famous analyst and number theorist [[John Edensor Littlewood]] was appointed to the [[Richardson Chair of Applied Mathematics|Richardson Lectureship]] which he held for three years.

During 1912–1913 the pioneer of weather forecasting and numerical analysis [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] worked at [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|Manchester College of Science and Technology]] (later to become UMIST). Number theorist [[Louis J. Mordell]] joined the College in 1920. During this time he discovered the result for which he is best known, namely the finite basis theorem (or [[Mordell–Weil theorem]]), which proved a conjecture of [[Henri Poincaré]]. Mordell then went on to become Fielden Reader in Pure Mathematics at VUM in 1922 and then held the Fielden Chair in 1923. Mordell built up the department, offering posts to a number of outstanding mathematicians who had been forced from posts on the continent of Europe. He brought in [[Reinhold Baer]], [[G. Billing]], [[Paul Erdős]], [[Chao Ko]], [[Kurt Mahler]], and [[Beniamino Segre]]. He also recruited [[J. A. Todd]], [[Patrick du Val]], [[Harold Davenport]], [[L. C. Young]], and invited distinguished visitors. 

Although Manchester was later to be known as the birthplace of the electronic computer, [[Douglas Hartree]] made an earlier contribution building a [[differential analyser]] in 1933. The machine was used for [[ballistics]] calculations as well calculating railway timetables.

Mordell was succeeded by the famous topologist and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] [[Max Newman]] in 1945 who, as head of department, transformed it into a centre of international renown.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ledermann, Encounters of a Mathematician, 2009 {{isbn|978-1-4092-8267-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate numbers increased from eight per year to 40 and then 60. In 1948 Newman recruited [[Alan Turing]] as Reader in the department, and he worked there until his death in 1954, completing some of his profound work on the foundations of computer science including ''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]''. Newman retired in 1964. From 1949 to 1960 [[M. S. Bartlett]] held the first chair in [[mathematical statistics]] at VUM, he is known for his contribution to the analysis of data with spatial and temporal patterns, the theory of [[statistical inference]] and in [[multivariate analysis]]. At Manchester he developed an interest in [[epidemiology]], building a strong group in mathematical statistics and strengthening the department.

[[Image:Maths Tower, University of Manchester 2.jpg|thumb|left|The VUM [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]] prior to its demolition]]

[[Fluid dynamics|Fluid dynamicist]] [[Sydney Goldstein]] held the [[Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics]] from 1945 to 1950, and was succeeded from 1950 to 1959 by [[James Lighthill]], also a fluid dynamicist. In pure mathematics, [[Bernhard Neumann]], an influential [[group theory|group theorist]], joined the department at VUM in 1948, leaving as a Reader in 1961 to take a chair in Australia. In 1969, VUM's [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]], an 18-storey skyscraper on Oxford Road, was completed. 

[[Image:Frank Bowman UMIST Mathematician oil portrait.jpg|right|thumb|Frank Bowman was the longest serving head of Mathematics at UMIST: 1933–1957. This portrait was presented to the department by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]]]
Up until the 1950s, UMIST's Mathematics Department taught largely service courses for the engineering and applied science courses, and despite stars such as Richardson, Mordell and in 1958–1963 group theorist [[Hanna Neumann]], did not have a strong focus on research.  Neumann was later to be the first woman appointed to a Professorial Chair of Mathematics in Australia. 

[[Image:Maths and Social Science Building.jpg|thumb|left|The Maths and Social Sciences Building, which housed the UMIST Department of Mathematics from 1968 until merger, and part of the merged School until the opening of the Alan Turing Building in July 2007]]

With the rapid expansion of higher education and the starting of an undergraduate mathematics degree this changed, and by 1968 the 15-storey [[Maths and Social Sciences Building]] (MSS) was completed on UMIST campus to house the growing department. In 1960 [[Robin Bullough]] joined the UMIST department initiating four decades of mathematical physics focusing especially on [[soliton]]s. The statistics group also grew in strength with an emphasis on [[time series]], led by [[Maurice Priestley]] and also [[Tata Subba Rao]]. In 1986 pure mathematics at UMIST was strengthened by the appointment of [[Martin J. Taylor]] FRS, famous for his work on properties and structures of [[algebraic numbers]].

Another renowned topologist, [[Frank Adams]], succeeded Newman in the Fielden Chair, which he held from 1964 to 1970.

The VUM [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics tower]] was demolished in 2005, with most of the staff moving to temporary buildings, the pure mathematicians to one named after Newman and the applied to one named after Lamb. The history of the School entered a new phase in July 2007 with the move to the Alan Turing Building.

'''Science Research Associates Inc.''', commonly known as '''SRA''', is a [[Chicago]]-based publisher of educational materials and schoolroom reading comprehension products.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.sraonline.com/about_history.html SRA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Science Research Associates Inc. was founded in 1938.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; Early on, it had a trade and occupational focus. In 1957, it moved into individualized classroom instruction with the iconic SRA [[Reading (process)|Reading]] Laboratory Kit, a format that later translated to mathematics, science, and social studies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Commonly called '''SRA cards''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/lost-generation-finds-new-pride-20100604-xkiv.html|title=Lost generation finds new pride|first= Miranda |last= Devine|work= [[Sydney Morning Herald]]| date= 2010-06-05|accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the labs were large boxes filled with color-coded cardboard sheets. Each sheet included a reading exercise for students. Each student would have an independent topic, and would work on it independently of the other students in the class, consulting with the teacher only if they got stuck. The student would then follow up with [[multiple choice]] questions. As the child moved ahead, he or she would advance in difficulty.

SRA was purchased by [[IBM]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Highlights-of-IBM-History.html| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071206054110/http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Highlights-of-IBM-History.html| website= ed-thelen.org| title= Highlights of IBM History| archivedate= December 6, 2007| access-date= July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by that time its products geared to primary and secondary schools had increased, especially at a time when math education was seen as critical during the [[Cold War]] and [[Space Race]]. Despite being an IBM subsidiary, SRA produced both [[IBM PC]] and [[Apple II]] software in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="pc198311"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q8fwTt09_MEC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA696&amp;pg=RA1-PA265#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Cross Clues / Free Enterprise | work=PC Magazine | date=November 1983 | accessdate= 22 October 2013 | author=Advertisement | pages=263, 265}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxwell Communications Corporation]] bought SRA in 1988. SRA became part of [[Macmillan/McGraw-Hill]] when the joint venture with [[McGraw-Hill]] was created in 1989. When Maxwell Communications collapsed, McGraw-Hill acquired full ownership of Macmillan/McGraw-Hill and SRA.

==Educational programs==
Since the 1960s, SRA has been the publisher of Direct Instruction programs, also known as [[DISTAR]] (Direct Instruction System for Teaching Arithmetic and Reading).  These include ''Language for Learning, Reading Mastery, Reasoning and Writing, Connecting Math Concepts'' and ''Corrective Reading''.  SRA purchased [[Open Court Reading]] in the 1990s.

In the early 2000s, the company was purchased by [[McGraw-Hill Education]] and the brand name and products are now part of the PreK-12 business of McGraw-Hill Education.  The ''Imagine It!'' reading program was launched in 2007.  McGraw-Hill Education also competes as a publisher of mathematics and science materials with programs such as ''Real Math, Number Worlds'' and ''Snapshots Video Science''.

'''Simultaneous communication''', '''SimCom''', or '''sign supported speech''' ('''SSS''') is a technique sometimes used by [[deaf]], hard-of-hearing or hearing [[sign language]] users in which both a spoken language and a manual variant of that language (such as [[English language|English]] and [[manually coded English]]) are used simultaneously. While the idea of communicating using two modes of language seems ideal in a hearing/deaf setting, in practice the two languages are rarely relayed perfectly. Often the native language of the user (usually spoken language for the hearing person and sign language for the deaf person) is the language that is strongest, while the non-native language degrades in clarity. In an educational environment this is particularly difficult for deaf children as a majority of teachers who teach the deaf are hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/LAADCtwo3.html|title=Language Attitudes in the American Deaf Community|website=gupress.gallaudet.edu|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from surveys taken indicate that communication for students is indeed signing (about 2/3 of the population of students), and that the signing leans more toward English rather than ASL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newell|first=William|last2=Stinson|first2=Michael|last3=Castle|first3=Diane|last4=Mallery-Ruganis|first4=Dominique|last5=Holcomb|first5=Barbara Ray|date=2013-10-02|title=Simultaneous Communication: A Description by Deaf Professionals Working in an Educational Setting|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507083|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=391–414|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0023|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History/overview ==
[[Manual communication]], including simultaneous communication, has existed for a while in the United States, but gained traction in the 70's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Madeline M.|date=2013-10-02|title=Simultaneous Communication: The State of the Art &amp; Proposals for Change|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507082|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=333–390|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0019|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of using signing with children has been a tumultuous one, with many swings between discouraging the use of signed languages and focusing on [[oralism]], to the current push of [[bilingualism]] in Deaf schools. Ultimately, the majority of schools pushed the signed language they used to focus on English, resulting in the birth of a language that combined spoken language (English) with a manual language. The historical use of SC in schools has been stormy, with professionals (both researchers and teachers alike) on either side of the debate on whether the language is useful or not.

== Studies/research ==

===Positive approaches===

According to a study done in 1984, it was found that compared with haphazard instruction involving no language approach whatsoever, Total Communication was proved to be beneficial when combined with the correct approach.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Mark T.|last2=Calderon|first2=Rosemary|last3=Kusché|first3=Carol|date=1984-01-01|title=Early Intervention Using Simultaneous Communication with Deaf Infants: The Effect on Communication Development|jstor=1129972|journal=Child Development|volume=55|issue=2|pages=607–616|doi=10.2307/1129972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study entitled "Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication|first1=Robert L|last1=Whitehead|first2=Nicholas|last2=Schiavetti|first3=Douglas J|last3=MacKenzie|first4=Dale Evan|last4=Metz|date=1 May 2004|publisher=|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=37|issue=3|pages=241–253|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2003.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 [[Hearing loss|hearing impaired]] individuals were asked to audit the audio samples of 4 hearing sign language experts who had produced recordings of a Simultaneous Communication (SC) sample and a Speech Alone (SA) sample. The 12 hearing impaired individuals were asked to then determine which speech produced was clearer. After listening to both audio samples, hearing impaired listeners agreed that both SC and SA were intelligible, which is supported by previous research. Since the intelligibility of the speech was kept on par with English grammar, the study results indicate that SC is a positive tool to use with [[Hearing loss|Deaf]] and [[Hearing loss|Hard of Hearing]] children as a language model and for Deaf/Hard of Hearing adults to keep using.

Another study showed the difference between a control group, families who participated in an intervention program that offered services such as classes on Total Communication, private teachers for the child and a deaf adult who came to the families house, and another group of families who used TC, but did not have as much intervention as the control group. The results showed that intervention did work, and that it positively correlated with the communication skills show by the control group's children. The children showed advanced cognitive skills, including comprehension and expression, specifically related to time.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Negative approaches ===

A study done in 1990 titled "The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom"&amp;nbsp;by Dennis Cokely reviewed research done previously that supported the use of Total Communication (SimCom) in the classroom. However, the study pointed out several restrictive factors that several research tests had not approached. One of the tests administered only compared SimCom, the [[Rochester Method]] and speech reading with voice ([[lip reading]]), omitting the option of ASL as a means of communication. The 1990 study addressed this issue by comparing SimCom, Sign Alone and Interpretation to see which was the most effective. The results from the comparison showed that signing alone as a way for students to understand information given was the most effective and SimCom was the least effective. Overall, Sign Alone and Interpretation was most effective in all areas of the test, proving that SimCom was a struggle for teachers and students alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cokely|first=Dennis|date=2013-10-02|title=The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507084|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=415–442|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0027|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; When working with two separate modes of communication, the one that comes naturally for the user will be the more prominent mode. A study conducted in 1998 showed that signing and speaking at the same time results in a slower approach to instruction than if just one modality was used to express language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Constructing Simultaneous Communication: The Contributions of Natural Sign Language"|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%22Constructing_Simultaneous_Communication:_The_Contributions_of_Natural_Sign_Language%22&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of Total Communication ==
Listed below are the signed communications that are used within SimCom. Since SimCom can use any spoken language, mainly English, combined with any signed mode, all communication listed below are available for use. 
* [[American Sign Language]]
* [[Signing Exact English]]
* [[Cued speech]]
* [[Contact sign]] (Pidgin Sign)
* [[Total Communication]]
* [[Bimodal bilingualism]]

'''Social support''' is the perception and actuality that one is cared for, has assistance available from other people, and most popularly, that one is part of a supportive [[social network]]. These supportive resources can be emotional (e.g., nurturance), tangible (e.g., financial assistance), informational (e.g., advice), or companionship (e.g., sense of belonging) and intangible (e.g., personal advice).

Social support can be measured as the perception that one has assistance available, the actual received assistance, or the degree to which a person is integrated in a social network. Support can come from many sources, such as family, friends, pets, neighbors, coworkers, organizations, etc. Government-provided social support is often referred to as '''public aid''' in foreign nations. 

Social support is studied across a wide range of disciplines including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[sociology]], [[nursing]], [[public health]], [[education]], [[Psychiatric rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], and [[social work]]. Social support has been linked to many benefits for both physical and mental health, but "social support" (e.g., gossiping about friends) is not always beneficial.

Social support theories and models were prevalent as intensive academic studies in the 1980s and 1990s &lt;ref&gt; Vaux, A. (1988). ''Social Support: Theory, Research and Interventions''. My, NY: Praeger. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2006). Social support. In: G. Albrecht, ''Encyclopedia on Disability'', 1470-1471. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE. &lt;/ref&gt;, and are linked to the development of caregiving and payment models, and community delivery systems in the US and around the world. &lt;ref&gt; O'Connor, S. (1995). More than they bargained for: The meaning of support to families. In: S. J. Taylor, R. Bogdan, &amp; Lutfiyya, Z.M. ''The Variety of Community Experience'' (pp.193-210). Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Two main models have been proposed to describe the link between social support and health: the buffering hypothesis and the direct effects hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q6xkh3QdyGEC&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;dq=%22direct%20effects%20hypothesis%22%20%22main%20effects%20hypothesis%22&amp;pg=PA426#v=onepage&amp;q=%22direct%20effects%20hypothesis%22%20%22main%20effects%20hypothesis%22&amp;f=false | title=DSM-IV Sourcebook| isbn=9780890420744| last1=Association| first1=American Psychiatric| year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gender]] and [[culture|cultural]] differences in social support have also been found &lt;ref&gt;Harry, B., Kaylanpur, M. and Day, M. (1999). ''Building Cultural Reciprocity with Families: Case Studies in Special Education.'' London, Toronto: Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt;in fields such as education "which may not control for age, disability, income and social status, ethnic and racial, or other significant factors".

==Categories and definitions==

===Distinctions in measurement===
Social support can be categorized and measured in several different ways.

There are four common functions of social support:&lt;ref name=Wills91&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wills|first=T.A.|title=Social support and interpersonal relationships|journal=Prosocial Behavior, Review of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=12|pages=265–289|editor1-first=Clark|editor1-last=Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wills|first=T.A.|title=Social support and health|year=1985|publisher=Academic Press|location=Orlando, FL|pages=61–82|editor=S.

*''Emotional support'' is the offering of empathy, concern, affection, love, trust, acceptance, intimacy, encouragement, or caring.&lt;ref name=Nursing&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langford|first=C.P.H.|author2=Bowsher, J. |author3=Maloney, J.P. |author4=Lillis, P.P. |title=Social support: a conceptual analysis|journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing|year=1997|volume=25|issue=1|pages=95–100|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.1997.1997025095.x|pmid=9004016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slevin 1996 1275–1279"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slevin|first=M.L. |author2=Nichols, S.E. |author3=Downer, S.M. |author4=Wilson, P. |author5=Lister, T.A. |author6=Arnott, S. |author7=Maher, J. |author8=Souhami, R.L. |author9=Tobias, J.S. |author10=Goldstone, A.H. |author11=Cody, M.|title=Emotional support for cancer patients: what do patients really want?|journal=British Journal of Cancer|year=1996|volume=74|issue=8 |pages=1275–1279|doi=10.1038/bjc.1996.529 |pmid=8883417 |pmc=2075927}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the warmth and nurturance provided by sources of social support.&lt;ref name=SETReview&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|title=The Handbook of Health Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=189–214|editor=M.S.

*''Tangible support'' is the provision of financial assistance, material goods, or services.&lt;ref name=HealthBehav&gt;{{cite book|last=Heaney, C.A., &amp; Israel, B.A.|title=Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|edition=4th|editor=Glanz, K. |editor2=Rimer, B.K. |editor3=Viswanath, K.|chapter=Social networks and social support}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=House&gt;{{cite book|last=House|first=J.S.|title=Work stress and social support|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also called instrumental support, this form of social support encompasses the concrete, direct ways people assist others.&lt;ref name=Nursing /&gt;
*''Informational support'' is the provision of advice, guidance, suggestions, or useful information to someone.&lt;ref name=Wills91 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krause|first=N.|title=Social support, stress, and well-being|journal=Journal of Gerontology|year=1986|volume=41|issue=4|pages=512–519|doi=10.1093/geronj/41.4.512}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of information has the potential to help others problem-solve.&lt;ref name=Nursing /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tilden|first=V.P.|author2=Weinert, S.C. |title=Social support and the chronically ill individual|journal=Nursing Clinics of North America|year=1987|volume=22|issue=3|pages=613–620}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Companionship support'' is the type of support that gives someone a sense of social belonging (and is also called belonging).&lt;ref name=Wills91 /&gt;   This can be seen as the presence of companions to engage in shared social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Uchino|first=B.|title=Social Support and Physical Health: Understanding the Health Consequences of Relationships|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers also commonly make a distinction between perceived and received support.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt;&lt;ref name=Barrera&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrera|first=M|title=Distinctions between social support concepts, measures, and models|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|year=1986|volume=14|issue=4|pages=413–445|doi=10.1007/bf00922627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Perceived support'' refers to a recipient’s subjective judgment that providers will offer (or have offered) effective help during times of need. ''Received support'' (also called enacted support) refers to specific supportive actions (e.g., advice or reassurance) offered by providers during times of need.&lt;ref name=Cultural&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurung|first=R.A.R.|title=Health Psychology: A Cultural Approach|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Wadsworth|location=Belmont, CA|pages=131–171|chapter=Coping and Social Support}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, social support can be measured in terms of structural support or functional support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wills|first=T.A.|title=Behavioral medicine and women: A comprehensive handbook|year=1998|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York, NY|pages=118–128|editor=Blechman, E.A. |editor2=Brownell, K.D.|chapter=Social support}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Structural support'' (also called ''social integration'') refers to the extent to which a recipient is connected within a social network, like the number of social ties or how integrated a person is within his or her social network.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wills91 /&gt;  Family relationships, friends, and membership in clubs and organizations contribute to social integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakey|first=B|title=Social support and social integration|url=http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/constructs/social_support/social_support.pdf|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Functional support'' looks at the specific functions that members in this social network can provide, such as the emotional, instrumental, informational, and companionship support listed above.&lt;ref name=UBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Uchino|first=B.|title=Social Support and Physical Health: Understanding the Health Consequences of Relationships|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Data suggests that emotional support may play a more significant role in protecting individuals from the deleterious effects of stress than structural means of support, such as social involvement or activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=R. C.|author2=McLeod, J. D. |title=Sex differences in vulnerability to undesirable life events|year=1984|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=49|issue=5|pages=620–631|doi=10.2307/2095420|jstor=2095420|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.9669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social support can come from a variety of sources, including (but not limited to): family, friends, romantic partners, pets, community ties, and coworkers.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt; Sources of support can be natural (e.g., family and friends) or more formal (e.g., mental health specialists or community organizations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan, B.|author2=Linden, W. |author3=Najarian, B. |title=Social support interventions: Do they work?|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|year=2002|volume=22|issue=3|pages=381–440|doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(01)00102-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social support is also available among [[social media]] sites. As technology advances, the availability for online support increases. Social support can be offered through social media websites such as [[blog|blogs]], [[Facebook]] groups, health forums, and online support groups. According to Hwang, the support is similar to face-to-face social support, but also offers the unique aspects of convenience, anonymity, and non-judgmental interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social support in an Internet weight loss community|journal = International Journal of Medical Informatics|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1386-5056|pmc = 3060773|pmid = 19945338|pages = 5–13|volume = 79|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.10.003|first = Kevin O.|last = Hwang|first2 = Allison J.|last2 = Ottenbacher|first3 = Angela P.|last3 = Green|first4 = M.

Social support through social media is available to everyone with internet access and allows users to create relationships and receive encouragement for whatever issue they may be facing.

Coulson claims online support groups provide a unique opportunity for health professionals to learn about the experiences and views of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social support in cyberspace: a content analysis of communication within a Huntington's disease online support group|journal = Patient Education and Counseling|date = 2007-10-01|issn = 0738-3991|pmid = 17629440|pages = 173–178|volume = 68|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.pec.2007.06.002|first = Neil S.|last = Coulson|first2 = Heather|last2 = Buchanan|first3 = Aimee|last3 = Aubeeluck|url = http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/721/1/Coulson_Buchanan_Aubeeluck_2007_PEC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of social support can also benefit users by providing them with a variety of information. Seeking informational social support allows users to access suggestions, advice, and information regarding health concerns or recovery. Many need social support, and with its emergence on social media access can be obtained from a wider range of people in need. Wong and Ma (2016) have done research that shows online social support affects users' online [[subjective well-being]].

In a 2013 study, Akey et al. did a qualitative study of 34 men and women diagnosed with an eating disorder and used the [[Health Belief Model]] (HBM) to explain the reasons for which they forgo seeking social support. Many people with eating disorders have a low perceived susceptibility, which can be explained as a sense of denial about their illness. Their perceived severity of the illness is affected by those to whom they compare themselves to, often resulting in people believing their illness is not severe enough to seek support. Due to poor past experiences or educated speculation, the perception of benefits for seeking social support is relatively low. The number of perceived barriers towards seeking social support often prevents people with eating disorders from getting the support they need to better cope with their illness. Such barriers include fear of social stigma, financial resources, and availability and quality of support. Self-efficacy may also explain why people with eating disorders do not seek social support, because they may not know how to properly express their need for help. This research has helped to create a better understanding of why individuals with eating disorders do not seek social support, and may lead to increased efforts to make such support more available. Eating disorders are classified as mental illnesses but can also have physical health repercussions. Creating a strong social support system for those affected by eating disorders may help such individuals to have a higher quality of both mental and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Akey, J.

Various studies have been performed examining the effects of social support on psychological distress. Interest in the implications of social support were triggered by a series of articles published in the mid-1970s, each reviewing literature examining the association between psychiatric disorders and factors such as change in marital status, geographic mobility, and social disintegration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cobb|first=S.|title=Social support as a moderator of life stress|year=1976|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=98|issue=5|pages=300–314|doi=10.1097/00006842-197609000-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassel|first=J.|title=Psychosocial processes and "stress":theoretical formulation|year=1974|journal=International Journal of Health Services|volume=4|issue=3|pages=471–482|doi=10.2190/wf7x-y1l0-bfkh-9qu2|pmid=4475665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers realized that the theme present in each of these situations is the absence of adequate social support and the disruption of social networks. This observed relationship sparked numerous studies concerning the effects of social support on mental health.

One particular study documented the effects of social support as a coping strategy on psychological distress in response to stressful work and life events among police officers. Talking things over among coworkers was the most frequent form of coping utilized while on duty, whereas most police officers kept issues to themselves while off duty. The study found that the social support between co-workers significantly buffered the relationship between work-related events and distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Patterson|first= George T.|title=Examining the effects of coping and social support on work and life stress among police officers|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|year=2003|volume=31|issue= 3|pages=215–226|doi=10.1016/s0047-2352(03)00003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have examined the social support systems of single mothers. One study by D'Ercole demonstrated that the effects of social support vary in both form and function and will have drastically different effects depending upon the individual. The study found that supportive relationships with friends and co-workers, rather than task-related support from family, was positively related to the mother's psychological well-being. D'Ercole hypothesizes that friends of a single parent offer a chance to socialize, match experiences, and be part of a network of peers. These types of exchanges may be more spontaneous and less obligatory than those between relatives. Additionally, co-workers can provide a community away from domestic life, relief from family demands, a source of recognition, and feelings of competence. D'Ercole also found an interesting statistical interaction whereby social support from co-workers decreased the experience of stress only in lower income individuals. The author hypothesizes that single women who earn more money are more likely to hold more demanding jobs which require more formal and less dependent relationships. Additionally, those women who earn higher incomes are more likely to be in positions of power, where relationships are more competitive than supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Ercole|first=Ann|title=Single Mothers: Stress, Coping, and Social Support|year=1988|journal=Journal of Community Psychology|volume=16|pages=41–54|doi=10.1002/1520-6629(198801)16:1&lt;41::aid-jcop2290160107&gt;3.0.co;2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have been dedicated specifically to understanding the effects of social support in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In a study by Haden et al., when victims of severe trauma perceived high levels of social support and engaged in interpersonal coping styles, they were less likely to develop severe PTSD when compared to those who perceived lower levels of social support. These results suggest that high levels of social support alleviate the strong positive association between level of injury and severity of PTSD, and thus serves as a powerful protective factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haden|first=Sara C. |author2=Scarpa, Angela |author3=Jones, Russell T. |author4=Ollendick, Thomas H.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and injury: the moderating role of perceived social support and coping for young adults|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2007|volume=42|issue=7 |pages=1187–1198|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.09.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, data shows that the support of family and friends has a positive influence on an individual's ability to cope with trauma. In fact, a meta-analysis by Brewin et al. found that social support was the strongest predictor, accounting for 40%, of variance in PTSD severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brewin|first=C.

In some cases, support decreases with increases in trauma severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=F.

College students have also been the target of various studies on the effects of social support on coping. Reports between 1990 and 2003 showed college stresses were increasing in severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benton|first=S. A. |author2=Robertson, J. M. |author3=Tseng, W. C. |author4=Newton F.

R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of such mounting stress, students naturally seek support from family and friends in order to alleviate psychological distress. A study by Chao found a significant two-way correlation between perceived stress and social support, as well as a significant three-way correlation between perceived stress, social support, and dysfunctional coping. The results indicated that high levels of dysfunctional coping deteriorated the association between stress and well-being at both high and low levels of social support, suggesting that dysfunctional coping can deteriorate the positive buffering action of social support on well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chao|first=Ruth Chu-Lien|title=Managing Perceived Stress Among College Students: The Roles of Social Support and Dysfunctional Coping|year=2012|journal=Journal of College Counseling|volume=15|issue=1|pages=5–21|doi=10.1002/j.2161-1882.2012.00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students who reported social support were found more likely to engage in less healthy activities, including sedentary behavior, drug and alcohol use, and too much or too little sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorsteinsson|first= E.

====Physical health====

Social support has a clearly demonstrated link to physical health outcomes in individuals, with numerous ties to physical health including [[Death|mortality]].  People with low social support are at a much higher risk of death from a variety of diseases (e.g., cancer or cardiovascular disease).&lt;ref name=UBook /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; Numerous studies have shown that people with higher social support have an increased likelihood for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt-Lunstad|first=J.|author2=Smith, T.B. |author3=Layton, J.B. |title=Social relationships and mortality ris: A meta-analytic review|journal=PLoS Med|year=2010|volume=7|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316|pmid=20668659|pmc=2910600|pages=e1000316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
Social support is integrated into service delivery schemes and sometimes are a primary service provided by governmental contracted entities (e.g., companionship, peer services, family caregiving). Community services known by the nomenclature community support, and workers by a similar title, Direct Support Professional, have a base in social and community support "ideology". &lt;ref&gt; Racino, J. (2000). ''Personnel Preparation in Disability and Community Life''. Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publishers. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Wehman, P. and Kregel, J. (1998). ''More than a Job: Securing Satisfying Careers for People with Disabilities''. London, Toronto: Paul H. Brookes. &lt;/ref&gt; All supportive services from [[supported employment]] to [[supported housing]], [[family support]], [[supported education]], and [[supportive living]] are based upon the relationship between "informal and formal" supports, and "paid and unpaid caregiving". &lt;ref&gt; Nisbet, J. and Hagner, D. (1988). Natural supports in the workplace: A reexamination of supported employment. ''JASH'', 13(4): 260-267. &lt;/ref&gt;Inclusion studies, based upon affiliation and friendship, or the conversely, have a similar theoretical basis &lt;ref&gt; Sapon-Shevin, M. (1992). Including all children and their gifts within regular classrooms. In: S. Stainback &amp; W. Stainback, ''Controversial Issues Confronting Special Education'' (pp. 69-81). London: Allyn and Bacon. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Strully, J. and Strully, C. (1985). Friendship and our children. ''JASH,'' 10(4): 224-227. &lt;/ref&gt; as do "person-centered support" strategies.

Social support theories are often found in "real life" in cultural, music and arts communities, and as might be expected within religious communities. Social support is integral in theories of aging, and the "social care systems" have often been challenged (e.g., creativity throughout the lifespan, extra retirement hours). &lt;ref&gt; Maduro, R. (1991, Spring). The 
old man as a creative artist in India. ''Generations'', XV (2):17-20. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Kunkel, S. (1989, Spring). An extra eight hours a day. ''Generations'', XIII(2): 57-60. &lt;/ref&gt; Ed Skarnulis' (state director) adage, "Support, don't supplant the family" applies to other forms of social support networks.

Although there are many benefits to social support, it is not always beneficial.  It has been proposed that in order for social support to be beneficial, the social support desired by the individual has to match the support given to him or her; this is known as the matching hypothesis.&lt;ref name = Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cut&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutrona|first=C.E|title=Russell, D.W.|year=1990|publisher=Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|pages=319–366|editor=Sarason, B.R. |editor2=Sarason, I.G. |editor3=Pierce, G.R.|chapter=Types of social support and specific stress: Toward a theory of optimal matching}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McKay&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen, S., &amp; McKay, G.|title=Handbook of psychology and health|year=1984|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=253–268|editor=Baum, A. |editor2=Taylor, S.E. |editor3=Singer, J.|chapter=Social support, stress, and the buffering hypothesis: A theoretical analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Psychological stress may increase if a different type of support is provided than what the recipient wishes to receive (e.g., informational is given when emotional support is sought).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horowitz|first=L.M.|author2=Krasnoperova, E.N. |author3=Tatar, D.G. |author4=Hansen, M.B. |author5=Person, E.A. |author6=Galvin, K.L. |author7=Nelson, K.L. |title=The way to console may depend on the goal: Experimental studies of social support|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=37|pages=49–61|doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thoit"/&gt;  Additionally, elevated levels of perceived stress can impact the effect of social support on health-related outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Eric S.|author2=Penedo, Frank J. |author3=Lewis, John E. |title=Perceived stress mediates the effects of social support on health-related quality of life among men treated for localized prostate cancer|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=December 2010|volume=69|issue=6|pages=587–590|pmid=21109047|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2010.04.019|pmc=2994072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other costs have been associated with social support. For example, received support has not been linked consistently to either physical or mental health;&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; perhaps surprisingly, received support has sometimes been linked to worse mental health.&lt;ref name="Bolger 2000 953–961"/&gt;  Additionally, if social support is overly intrusive, it can increase stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shumaker|first=S.A.|author2=Hill, D.R. |title=Gender differences in social support and physical health|journal=Health Psychology|year=1991|volume=10|issue=2|pages=102–111|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.10.2.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important when discussing social support to always consider the possibility that the social support system is actually an antagonistic influence on an individual.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Two dominant models===
There are two dominant hypotheses addressing the link between social support and health: the buffering hypothesis and the direct effects hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;  The main difference between these two hypotheses is that the direct effects hypothesis predicts that social support is beneficial all the time, while the buffering hypothesis predicts that social support is mostly beneficial during [[stress (psychological)|stressful times]].  Evidence has been found for both hypotheses.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt;

In the buffering hypothesis, social support protects (or "buffers") people from the bad effects of stressful life events (e.g., death of a spouse, job loss).&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;  Evidence for stress buffering is found when the [[correlation]] between stressful events and poor health is weaker for people with high social support than for people with low social support.  The weak correlation between stress and health for people with high social support is often interpreted to mean that social support has protected people from stress. Stress buffering is more likely to be observed for perceived support than for social integration&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; or received support.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt; The theoretical concept or construct of resiliency is associated with coping theories. 

In the direct effects (also called main effects) hypothesis, people with high social support are in better health than people with low social support, regardless of stress.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; In addition to showing buffering effects, perceived support also shows consistent direct effects for mental health outcomes.&lt;ref name="Lakey, B., &amp; Cronin, A. 2008 385–408"/&gt; Both perceived support and social integration show main effects for physical health outcomes.&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;  However, received (enacted) support rarely shows main effects.&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;

===Theories to explain the links===

Several theories have been proposed to explain social support’s link to health. Stress and coping social support theory&lt;ref name=Barrera /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name = Cut/&gt;&lt;ref name =Thoit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=P.A.|title=Social support as coping assistance|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year=1986|volume=54|issue=4|pages=416–423|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.54.4.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; dominates social support research&lt;ref name=RRT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lakey|first=B.|author2=Orehek, E. |title=Relational Regulation Theory: A new approach to explain the link between perceived support and mental health|journal=Psychological Review|year=2011|volume=118|issue=3|pages=482–495|doi=10.1037/a0023477|pmid=21534704}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is designed to explain the buffering hypothesis described above. According to this theory, social support protects people from the bad health effects of stressful events (i.e., stress buffering) by influencing how people think about and [[coping (psychology)|cope]] with the events. An example in 2018 are the effects of school shootings on the well being and future of children and children's health. According to stress and coping theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazarus, R.S., &amp; Folkman, S.|title=Stress, appraisal, and coping|year=1984|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; events are stressful insofar as people have negative thoughts about the event ([[appraisal theory|appraisal]]) and cope ineffectively. Coping consists of deliberate, conscious actions such as problem solving or relaxation. As applied to social support, stress and coping theory suggests that social support promotes [[adaptation|adaptive]] appraisal and coping.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;&lt;ref name = Thoit /&gt; Evidence for stress and coping social support theory is found in studies that observe stress buffering effects for perceived social support.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; One problem with this theory is that, as described previously, stress buffering is not seen for social integration,&lt;ref name=T95&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thoits|first=P.A.|title=Stress, coping, and social support processes: Where are we?

Relational regulation theory (RRT)&lt;ref name=RRT /&gt; is another theory, which is designed to explain main effects (the direct effects hypothesis) between perceived support and mental health. As mentioned previously, perceived support has been found to have both buffering and direct effects on mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wethington|first=E.|author2=Kessler, R.C. |title=Perceived support, received support, and adjustment to stressful life events|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|year=1986|volume=27|issue=1|pages=78–89|doi=10.2307/2136504|pmid=3711634|jstor=2136504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RRT was proposed in order to explain perceived support’s main effects on mental health which cannot be explained by the stress and coping theory.&lt;ref name=RRT /&gt;  RRT hypothesizes that the link between perceived support and mental health comes from people [[Emotional self-regulation|regulating their emotions]] through ordinary conversations and shared activities rather than through conversations on how to cope with stress. This regulation is relational in that the support providers, conversation topics and activities that help regulate emotion are primarily a matter of personal taste. This is supported by previous work showing that the largest part of perceived support is relational in nature.&lt;ref name=L2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Lakey|first=B.|title=Social Psychological Foundations of Clinical Psychology|year=2010|publisher=Guildford|location=New York|pages=177–194|editor=Maddux, J.E. |editor2=Tangney, J.P.|chapter=Social support: Basic research and new strategies for intervention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life-span theory&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; is another theory to explain the links of social support and health, which emphasizes the differences between perceived and received support. According to this theory, social support develops throughout the life span, but especially in childhood [[attachment theory|attachment]] with parents.  Social support develops along with adaptive [[Trait theory|personality traits]] such as low hostility, low neuroticism, high optimism, as well as social and coping skills.  Together, support and other aspects of personality ("psychological theories") influence health largely by promoting health practices (e.g., exercise and weight management) and by preventing health-related stressors (e.g., job loss, divorce).  Evidence for life-span theory includes that a portion of perceived support is trait-like,&lt;ref name = L2010 /&gt; and that perceived support is linked to adaptive personality characteristics and attachment experiences.&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt; Lifespan theories are popular from their origins in Schools of Human Ecology at the universities, aligned with family theories, and researched through federal centers over decades (e.g., University of Kansas, Beach Center for Families; Cornell University, School of Human Ecology).  

Of [[The Big Five personality traits|the Big Five Personality Traits]], agreeableness is associated with people receiving the most social support and having the least-strained relationships at work and home.  Receiving support from a supervisor in the workplace is associated with alleviating tensions both at work and at home, as are interdependency and idiocentrism of an employee.&lt;ref name="The effects of allocentrism, idiocentrism, social support, and big five personality dimensions on work-family conflict."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shafiro|first1=M.|title=The effects of allocentrism, idiocentrism, social support, and big five personality dimensions on work-family conflict.|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering|date=2011|volume=66|issue=3|pages=191–203|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2010.12.010|ref=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological pathways===
Many studies have tried to identify [[biopsychosocial model|biopsychosocial]] pathways for the link between social support and health. Social support has been found to positively impact the [[immune system|immune]], [[neuroendocrine system|neuroendocrine]], and [[cardiovascular system]]s.&lt;ref name=T07&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|title=Foundations of health psychology|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=145–171|editor=Friedman, H.S. |editor2=Silver, R.C.|chapter=Social support}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these systems are listed separately here, evidence has shown that these systems can interact and affect each other.&lt;ref name=U2009 /&gt;

*Immune system: Social support is generally associated with better immune function.&lt;ref name=U2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herbert|first=T.B.|author2=Cohen, S. |title=Stress and immunity in humans: A meta-analytic review|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1993|pages=364–379|doi=10.1097/00006842-199307000-00004|volume=55|issue=4|citeseerx=10.1.1.125.6544}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, being more socially integrated is correlated with lower levels of inflammation (as measured by [[C-reactive protein]], a marker of inflammation),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loucks|first=E.B.|author2=Berkman, L.F. |author3=Gruenewald, T.L. |author4=Seeman, T.E. |title=Relation of social integration to inflammatory marker concentrations in men and women 70-79 years|journal=American Journal of Cardiology|year=2006|volume=97|issue=7|pages=1010–1016|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2005.10.043|pmid=16563907}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people with more social support have a lower susceptibility to the common cold.&lt;ref name=C97 /&gt;
*Neuroendocrine system: Social support has been linked to lower [[cortisol]] ("stress hormone") levels in response to stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner-Cobb|first=J.M.|author2=Sephton, S.E. |author3=Koopman, C. |author4=Blake-Mortimer, J. |author5=Spiegel, D. |title=Social support and salivary cortisol in women with metastatic breast cancer|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=2000|volume=62|pages=337–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Neuroimaging]] work has found that social support decreases activation of regions in the brain associated with social distress, and that this diminished activity was also related to lowered cortisol levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=N.I.|author2=Taylor, S.E. |author3=Gable, S.L. |author4=Hilmert, C.J. |author5=Lieberman, M.D. |title=Neural pathways link social support to attenuated neuroendocrine stress response|journal=NeuroImage|year=2007|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1601–1612|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038 |pmid=17395493 |pmc=2710966}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cardiovascular system: Social support has been found to lower cardiovascular reactivity to stressors.&lt;ref name=U2006 /&gt; It has been found to lower [[blood pressure]] and [[heart rate]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unden|first=A.L.|author2=Orth-Gomer, K. |author3=Elofsson, S. |title=Cardiovascular effects of social support in the work place: twenty-four hour ECG monitoring of men and women|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1991|volume=53|issue=1|pages=50–60|pmid=2011650}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are known to benefit the cardiovascular system.

Though many benefits have been found, not all research indicates positive effects of social support on these systems.&lt;ref name=SETReview /&gt; For example, sometimes the presence of a support figure can lead to increased neuroendocrine and [[physiological]] activity.&lt;ref name=KG /&gt;

===Support groups===
{{Main article|Support group}}

Social support groups can be a source of informational support, by providing valuable educational information, and emotional support, including encouragement from people experiencing similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helgeson|first=V.S.|author2=Cohen, S. |title=Social support and adjustment to cancer: Reconciling descriptive, correlational, and intervention research|journal=Health Psychology|year=1996|volume=15|issue=2|pages=135–148|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.15.2.135|citeseerx=10.1.1.559.9698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gottlieb, B.H.|title=Marshalling social support: Formats, processes, and effects|year=1988|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have generally found beneficial effects for social support group interventions for various conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=B.E.|author2=Najarian, B. |title=Social support interventions: Do they work?|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|year=2002|volume=22|issue=3|pages=381–440|doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(01)00102-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Internet support groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hazzard|first=A.|author2=Celano, M. |author3=Collins, M. |author4=Markov, Y. |title=Effects of STARBRIGHT World on knowledge, social support, and coping in hospitalized children with sickle cell disease and asthma|journal=Children's Health Care|year=2002|volume=31|pages=69–86|doi=10.1207/s15326888chc3101_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups may be termed "self help" groups in nation-states, may be offered by non-profit organizations, and in 2018, may be paid for as part of governmental reimbursement schemes.

===Providing support===
There are both costs and benefits to providing support to others. Providing [[long-term care]] or support for someone else is a chronic stressor that has been associated with anxiety, depression, alterations in the immune system, and increased mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulz|first=R.|author2=O'Brien, A.T. |author3=Bookwala, J. |author4=Fleissner, K. |title=Psychiatric and physical morbidity effects of dementia caregiving: Prevalence, correlates, and causes|journal=The Gerontologist|year=1995|volume=35|pages=771–791|doi=10.1093/geront/35.6.771 |pmid=8557205 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiecolt-Glaser|first=J.K.|author2=Marucha, P.T. |author3=Malarkey, W.B. |author4=Mercado, A.M. |author5=Glaser, R. |title=Slowing of wound healing by psychological stress|journal=Lancet|year=1995|volume=346|issue=8984|pages=1194–1196|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(95)92899-5 |pmid=7475659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, family caregivers and "university personnel" alike have advocated for both respite or relief, and higher payments related to ongoing, long-term caregiving. However, providing support has also been associated with health benefits. In fact, providing instrumental support to friends, relatives, and neighbors, or emotional support to spouses has been linked to a significant decrease in the risk for mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=S.L.|author2=Nesse, R.M. |author3=Vinokur, A.D. |author4=Smith, D.M. |title=Providing social support may be more beneficial than receiving it: Results from a prospective study of mortality|journal=Psychological Science|year=2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=320–327|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.14461|pmid=12807404}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, a recent neuroimaging study found that giving support to a significant other during a distressful experience increased activation in [[reward system|reward]] areas of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inagaki|first=T.K.|author2=Eisenberger, N.I. |title=Neural correlates of giving support to a loved one|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=2011|volume=epub ahead of print|issue=1|doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e3182359335|pmid=22071630|pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social defence system===
In 1959 [[Isabel Menzies Lyth]] identified that threat to a person’s identity in a group where they share similar characteristics develops a defence system inside the group which stems from emotions experienced by members of the group, which are difficult to articulate, cope with and finds solutions to. Together with an external pressure on efficiency a collusive and injunctive system develops that is resistant to change, supports their activities and prohibit others from performing their major tasks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moderntimesworkplace.com/archives/ericsess/sessvol1/Lythp439.opd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesscoachinstitute.com/library/key_concepts.shtml|title=Key Concepts in Interpersonal Psychology|author=|date=|website=www.businesscoachinstitute.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and culture==

===Gender differences===
Gender differences have been found in social support research.&lt;ref name=Cultural /&gt;  Women provide more social support to others and are more engaged in their social networks.&lt;ref name=T95 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belle|first=D.|title=Gender and stress|year=1987|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|editor=Barnett, R.C. |editor2=Biener, L. |editor3=Baruch, G.K.|pages=257–277|chapter=Gender differences in the social moderators of stress}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tend&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|author2=Klein, L.C. |author3=Lewis, B.P |author4=Gruenewald, T.L. |author5=Gurung, R.A.R. |author6=Updegraff, J.A. |title=Biobehavioral responses to stress in females: Tend-and-befriend, not fight-or-flight|journal=Psychological Review|year=2000|volume=107|pages=411–429|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.107.3.411|pmid=10941275 |issue=3|citeseerx=10.1.1.386.912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has also supported the notion that women may be better providers of social support.&lt;ref name=T95 /&gt;  In addition to being more involved in the giving of support, women are also more likely to seek out social support to deal with stress, especially from their spouses.  However, one study indicates that there are no differences in the extent to which men and women seek appraisal, informational, and instrumental types of support.  Rather, the big difference lies in seeking emotional support.&lt;ref name="Gender Differences In Perceptions Of Stressors And Utilization Of Social Support Among University Students"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Day|first1=A.|last2=Livingtone1|first2=H.|title=Gender Differences In Perceptions Of Stressors And Utilization Of Social Support Among University Students|journal=Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science|date=2003|volume=35|issue=2|pages=73–83|ref=109|doi=10.1037/h0087190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tamres|first=L.|author2=Janicki, D. |author3=Helgeson, V.S. |title=Sex differences in coping behavior: A meta-analytic review|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2002|volume=6|pages=2–30|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0601_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, social support may be more beneficial to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwarzer|first=R.|author2=Leppin, A. |title=Social support and health: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychology and Health|year=1989|volume=3|pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/08870448908400361}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Shelley Taylor]] and her colleagues have suggested that these gender differences in social support may stem from the biological difference between men and women in how they respond to stress (i.e., [[flight or fight response|flight or fight]] versus [[tend and befriend]]).&lt;ref name=Tend /&gt;  Married men are less likely to be depressed compared to non-married men after the presence of a particular stressor because men are able to delegate their emotional burdens to their partner, and women have been shown to be influenced and act more in reaction to social context compared to men.&lt;ref name="Hobfoll"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hobfoll | first1 = S.E. | last2 = Cameron | first2 = R.P. | last3 = Chapman | first3 = H.A. | last4 = Gallagher | first4 = R.W. | year = 1996 | title = Social support and social coping in couples | url = | journal = Handbook of Social Support and the Family | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 413–433 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-1388-3_17| isbn = 978-1-4899-1390-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   It has been found that men’s behaviors are overall more antisocial, with less regard to the impact their coping may have upon others, and women more prosocial-active with importance stressed on how their coping affects people around them.&lt;ref&gt;Malek, M.J. (2000). Coping profiles within the strategic approach to coping ccale and their relationship to physical and psychological well-being. Kent State University, 1-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roussi | first1 = P. | last2 = Vassilaki | first2 = E. | year = 2000 | title = The applicability of the multiaxial model of coping to a greek population | url = | journal = Anxiety, Stress, &amp; Coping | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 125–147 | doi=10.1080/10615800108248351}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain why women are more likely to experience negative psychological problems such as depression and anxiety based on how women receive and process stressors.&lt;ref name="Hobfoll" /&gt;  In general, women are likely to find situations more stressful than males are. It is important to note that when the perceived stress level is the same, men and women have much fewer differences in how they seek and use social support.&lt;ref name="Gender Differences In Perceptions Of Stressors And Utilization Of Social Support Among University Students"/&gt;

===Cultural differences===

Although social support is thought to be a universal resource, cultural differences exist in social support.&lt;ref name=Cultural /&gt; In many Asian cultures, the person is seen as more of a collective unit of society, whereas Western cultures are more individualistic and conceptualize social support as a transaction in which one person seeks help from another.  In more interdependent Eastern cultures, people are less inclined to enlist the help of others.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"/&gt;  For example, [[European Americans]] have been found to call upon their social relationships for social support more often than [[Asian Americans]] or Asians during stressful occasions,&lt;ref name=S04&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=S.E.|author2=Sherman, D.K. |author3=Kim, H.S. |author4=Jarcho, J. |author5=Takagi, K. |author6=Dunagan, M.S. |title=Culture and social support: Who seeks it and why?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=87|issue=3|pages=354–62|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.354 |pmid=15382985}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Asian Americans expect social support to be less helpful than European Americans.&lt;ref name=S06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=H.S.|author2=Sherman, D.K. |author3=Ko, D. |author4=Taylor, S.E |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2006|volume=32|issue=12|pages=1596–1607|doi=10.1177/0146167206291991 |pmid=17122173|title=Pursuit of Comfort and Pursuit of Harmony: Culture, Relationships, and Social Support Seeking|citeseerx=10.1.1.584.9979}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in social support may be rooted in different cultural ideas about [[social groups]].&lt;ref name=S04 /&gt;&lt;ref name=S06/&gt;  It is important to note that these differences are stronger in emotional support than instrumental support.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"/&gt;  Additionally, ethnic differences in social support from family and friends have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sagrestano|first=L.M.|author2=Feldman, P. |author3=Killingsworth-Rini, C. |author4=Woo, G. |author5=Dunkel-Schetter, C |title=Ethnicity and social support during pregnancy|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|year=1999|volume=27|issue=6|pages=873–902 |doi=10.1023/a:1022266726892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural differences in coping strategies other than social support also exist.  One study shows that Koreans are more likely to report substance abuse than European Americans are.  Further, European Americans are more likely to exercise in order to cope than Koreans. Some cultural explanations are that Asians are less likely to seek it from fear of disrupting the harmony of their relationships and that they are more inclined to settle their problems independently and avoid criticism.  However, these differences are not found among Asian Americans relative to their Europeans American counterparts.&lt;ref name="Culture and Social Support: Who Seeks It and Why?"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">A '''squib''' is a brief satirical or witty piece of writing or speech, like a [[parody|lampoon]], or a short, sometimes humorous piece in a newspaper or magazine, used as a filler. It can be  intended to ignite thinking and discourse by others on topics of theoretical importance—e.g., see [[MIT Press]]'s journal, ''[[Linguistic Inquiry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=4&amp;tid=6|title=The MIT Press|website=MIT Press|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often less substantial than this and just humorous (see [[The Daily Squib]]).

One of the most famous squibs in English literature is ''The Candidate'' by [[Thomas Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Toynbee, Paget|editorlink=Paget Toynbee|chapter=The Candidate|title=The correspondence of Gray, Walpole, West and Ashton (1734–1771)|volume=vol. 2|year=1915|pages=226–228|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QF0EAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Squib}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], squibs may outline anomalous data but not suggest a solution. This usage in the field was popularized by [[John R. Ross|John R. “Haj” Ross]] in the 1960s. A squib may also develop a minor theoretical argument. A particularly interesting variety of squibs are the so-called snippets, which are "the ideal footnote: a side remark that taken on its own is not worth lengthy development but that needs to be said".&lt;ref name="ledonline.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/|title=Led on Line - Snippets|website=www.ledonline.it|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online journal Snippets is dedicated to this type of squib.&lt;ref name="ledonline.it"/&gt;

'''Swinging''', sometimes called '''wife swapping''', '''husband swapping''' or '''partner swapping''', is a [[Non-monogamy|non-monogamous]] behavior in which both singles and partners in a [[committed relationship]] engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Swinging is a form of [[open relationship]]. People may choose a swinging lifestyle for a variety of reasons. Many cite an increased quality, quantity, and frequency of sex. Some people may engage in swinging to add variety into their otherwise conventional sex lives or due to their curiosity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.netcom.com/~jonnall/babylon/pattys.htm|title=Why Swing?|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of swinging, or at least its wider discussion and practice, is regarded by some as arising from the freer attitudes to sexual activity after the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, the invention and availability of the [[contraceptive pill]], and the emergence of treatments for many of the [[sexually transmitted disease]]s that were known at that time. The adoption of [[safe sex]] practices became more common in the late 1980s.

The swinger community sometimes refers to itself as "the lifestyle", or as "the alternative lifestyle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergstrand|first=Curtis R.|title=Swinging in America : love, sex, and marriage in the 21st century|year=2010|publisher=Praeger/ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0313379666|author2=Sinski, Jennifer Blevins }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the culture and the context, the practice has also been called "wife lending", "wife sharing", a "community of women" or similar terms.  Another term, “hotwife / hotwifing” specifically refers to a married woman who often has sexual relations with different men, with the approval of her husband.

== Description ==
[[John Stossel]] produced an investigative news report into the swinging lifestyle. Stossel's report in 2005 cited [[Terry Gould]]'s research, which concluded that "couples swing in order to not cheat on their partners". When Stossel asked swinging couples whether they worry their spouse will "find they like someone else better," one male replied, "People in the swinging community swing for a reason. They don't swing to go out and find a new wife;" a woman asserted, "It makes women more confident – that they are the ones in charge." Stossel interviewed 12 marriage counselors. According to Stossel, "not one of them said don't do it," though some said "getting sexual thrills outside of marriage can threaten a marriage". Nevertheless, swingers whom Stossel interviewed claimed "their marriages are stronger because they don't have affairs and they don't lie to each other."&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Health/story?id=2395727&amp;page=1#.UG4e3U3A_Jc |title=The 'Lifestyle' – Real-Life Wife Swaps |date=18 March 2005 |publisher=ABC 20/20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swinging can take place in a number of contexts, ranging from spontaneous sexual activity involving partner swapping or adding a third or more participants at an informal gathering of friends to planned regular social meetings to "[[Casual sex|hooking up]]" with like-minded people at a [[sex club]] (also known as a swinger club, not to be confused with a [[strip club]]). Different clubs offer varied facilities and atmospheres, and often hold "theme" nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swingerspartiesuk.com |title=Advice and information on Swingers Clubs |publisher=Swingers parties |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swinging is also known to take place in semi-public venues such as hotels, resorts, or cruise ships, or often in private homes.&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Hallie |title=Happily Married Swingers |url=http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/happy-swinger-couples |publisher=Redbook |accessdate=2 July 2013|date=September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many websites that cater to swinging couples now exist, some boasting hundreds of thousands of members.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

== Prevalence ==
In 2018, a study of the prevalence of nonmonogamous practices in the United States estimated that 2.35% of Americans currently self-identify as swingers and 4.76% had identified as swingers at some point in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.31234/osf.io/st2k5 |title=Counting polyamorists who count: Prevalence and definitions of an under-researched form of consensual nonmonogamy |last1=Burleigh |first1=Tyler |last2=Rubel |first2=Alicia }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study solicited respondents through [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and [[Sampling (statistics)#Survey weights|weighted]] responses to increase representativeness.

== Effects ==

=== Relationship quality ===

Research on swinging has been conducted in the United States since the late 1960s. One 2000 study, based on an Internet questionnaire addressed to visitors of swinger-related sites, found swingers are happier in their relationships than the norm.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers" /&gt;

60% said that swinging improved their relationship; 1.7% said swinging made their relationship less happy. Approximately 50% of those who rated their relationship "very happy" before becoming swingers maintained their relationship had become happier. 90% of those with less happy relationships said swinging improved them. Almost 70% of swingers claimed no problem with jealousy; approximately 25% admitted "I have difficulty controlling jealousy when swinging" as "somewhat true", while 6% said this was "yes, very much" true. Swingers rate themselves happier ("very happy": 59% of swingers compared to 32% of non-swingers) and their lives more "exciting" (76% of swingers compared to 54% of non-swingers) than non-swingers, by significantly large margins. There was no significant difference between responses of men and women, although more males (70%) than females completed the survey. This study, which only polled self-identified swingers, is of limited use to a broader application to the rest of society ([[external validity]]) owing to [[self-selection bias|self-selected sampling]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Some believe sexual attraction is part of human nature and should be openly enjoyed by a committed or married couple. Some swingers cite divorce data in the US, claiming the lack of quality of sex and spousal infidelity are significant factors in divorce. One study showed 37% of husbands and 29% of wives admit at least one extramarital affair (Reinisch, 1990), and divorce rates for first marriages approached 60%.

=== Sexually transmitted infections ===
Swingers are exposed to the same types of risks as people who engage in [[casual sex]], with the main concerns being the risk of pregnancy and of contracting a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI). Some swingers engage in [[unprotected sex]], a practice known as [[barebacking]], while others follow [[safe sex]] practices and will not engage with others who do not also practice safe sex. Swingers may reduce the risk of STI by exchanging STI test results and [[serosorting]]. Proponents of swinging argue that safe sex is accepted within the swinging community and the risk of sexual disease is the same for them as for the general population&amp;nbsp;– and that some populations of sexually non-monogamous people have clearly lower rates of STIs than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aim-med.org/news/2009/10/20/1256052533/ |title=Superior Court Quashes CAL-OSHA'S Attempt to Subpoena Confidential AIM Medical Records |accessdate=2009-10-21 |date= 2009-10-20 |publisher=AIM Medical}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents are also concerned about the risk of pregnancy and STIs such as [[HIV]], arguing that even protected sex is risky given that some STIs may be spread regardless of the use of condoms, such as [[Herpes]] and [[HPV]]. In a 1992 study, an overall 7% of swingers had quit swinging because of the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic. It was also stated that 62% of swingers changed their sex practices, by becoming more selective with partners or by practicing safe sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenks|first1=Richard J.|date=|year=1998|title=Swinging: A Review of the Literature|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=27|issue=5|pages=507–521|doi=10.1023/a:1018708730945|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Dutch study that compared the medical records of self-reported swingers to that of the general population found that STI prevalence was highest in young people, homosexual men, and swingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/sti.2009.041954 |pmid=20577016 |title=Older and swinging; need to identify hidden and emerging risk groups at STI clinics |journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=315–317 |year=2010 |last1=Dukers-Muijrers |first1=N. H. T. M. |last2=Niekamp |first2=A.-M. |last3=Brouwers |first3=E. E. H. G. |last4=Hoebe |first4=C. J. P. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study has been criticized as not being representative of swinger populations as a whole: its data was formulated solely on patients receiving treatment at an STI clinic. In addition, according to the conclusions of the report, the STI rates of swingers were in fact nearly identical to those of non-swinging straight couples, and concluded that the safest demographic for STI infection were female prostitutes. According to the Dutch study, "the combined rates of [[chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]] were just over 10% among straight people, 14% among gay men, just under 5% in female prostitutes, and 10.4% among swingers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/23/us-sex-diseases-swingers-idUSTRE65M6NX20100623 |work=Reuters |title=Disease risk higher for swingers than prostitutes |date=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy ===

Although there is a risk of pregnancy, they are the same as monogamous sex and can be minimized.  Solutions include a tubal ligation (female sterilization), vasectomy (male sterilization), or having a group entirely made of menopausal women. Other solutions include using condoms or the pill. Proper use of a condom with an effective birth control method minimises the risk of pregnancy and transmission of STIs.&lt;ref name="Condom Effectiveness"&gt;{{cite web|title=Condom Effectiveness |url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/416 |work=advocatesforyouth.org |accessdate=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Western society ==
It may not be possible to trace a precise history of swinging since the modern concept is so closely related to basic human sexuality and relationships, and they vary significantly across time and cultures. The modern concept of "swinging" is a recent Western phenomenon with no counterpart or meaning in many other cultures and civilizations in history in which monogamous relationships was the norm or which had religious or social prohibitions against such sexual practices.

=== 16th century ===
The "community of women" was practiced by several radical [[Anabaptist]] sects including the [[Batenburgers]] and the [[Münster rebellion|Munsterites]].

A formal arrangement was signed by [[John Dee]], his wife Lynae, his [[scryer]], [[Edward Kelley]] and Kelley's wife Joanna on 22 April 1587, whereby conjugal relations would be shared between the men and their spouses. This arrangement arose following [[seance]]s which apparently resulted in spirits guiding Dee and Kelley towards this course of action. The arrangement ended badly and destroyed Dee's working relationship with Kelley.&lt;ref&gt;''The Queen's Conjuror; The life and magic of John Dee'' by Benjamin Woolley, [[Harper Collins]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-8050-6510-7}}, p292&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th century ===
It has been claimed that two related 18th-century messianic Jewish sects—the Frankists, followers of [[Jacob Frank]], and the [[Dönmeh]], followers of [[Sabbatai Zevi|Shabbetai Zvi]]—held an annual springtime Lamb Festival, which consisted of a celebratory dinner that included a ritualized exchange of spouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeek.net/706jay/ |title=Why I Study Sabbateanism |last=Michaelson |first=Jay |date=June 2007| publisher=Zeek.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gadnassi.com/files/publications/Exploring_the_Pagan_-_Jewish_and_Ottoman_Roots_of_the_Sabbatean-Lamb_Festival.pdf |title=Exploring the Pagan, Jewish and Ottoman Roots of the "Sabbatean Lamb Festival" |last=Nassi |first=Gad |publisher=GadNassi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
One of the criticisms of [[communism]] was the allegation that communists practice and propagandize the "community of women". In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848), [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] suggest that this allegation is an example of hypocrisy and [[psychological projection]] by "[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]" critics of communism, who "not content with having wives and daughters of their [[proletariat|proletarians]] at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch02.htm |author=Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels|year= 1848 |title=Manifesto of the Communist Party|accessdate=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
According to [[Terry Gould]]'s ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers'',&lt;ref&gt;Terry Gould, ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers''. Vintage Canada, November 23, 1999 {{ISBN|1-55209-482-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; swinging began among American [[United States Army Air Forces|Air Force]] pilots and their wives during [[World War II]] before pilots left for overseas duty. The mortality rate of pilots was so high, as Gould reports, that a close bond arose between pilot families that implied that pilot husbands would care for all the wives as their own&amp;nbsp;– emotionally and sexually&amp;nbsp;– if the husbands were lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homerf.org History of Wife Swapping], homerf.org&lt;/ref&gt; The realities of the demographics and basing of US Army Air Force (USAAF) pilots and crew suggest that this arrangement did not evolve during WWII, instead evolving later. US military personnel in WWII were not accompanied by their families (and many especially in the USAAF, were single) - the giant military bases where families live while accompanying a deployed soldier, sailor, aviator, or Marine are mostly Cold War creations. Though the origins of swinging are contested, it is assumed American swinging was practiced in some American military communities in the 1950s. By the time the [[Korean War]] ended, swinging had spread from the military to the [[suburb]]s. The media dubbed the phenomenon wife-swapping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libchrist.com/swing/began.html The History and Definitions of Swinging which is Couples Only], Liberated Christians, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s in the heyday of the ''[[Free love|Free Love]]'' movement, the activities associated with swinging became more widespread in a variety of social classes and age levels.&lt;ref name="Stonesex"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "Sex, Love and Hippies"]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, sometimes referred to as "The Swinging '70s", swinging activities became more prevalent, but were still considered "alternative" or "fringe" because of their association with non-mainstream groups such as [[communes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sheff |first=Elisabeth |title=Gender, Family, and Sexuality: Exploring Polyamorous Community |year=2005 |publisher=University of Colorado |pages=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key party is a form of swinger party, in which male partners place their car or house keys into a common bowl or bag on arriving. At the end of the evening the female partners randomly select keys from the bowl and leave with that key's owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell | first = Robert | authorlink =   | title = Social Deviance: A Substantive Analysis | publisher = Dorsey Press | year = 1971 | location = University of Michigan | isbn = 978-0-256-01663-5 | page = 74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key parties are portrayed in Season 4 Episode 4 of [[List of Masters of Sex episodes|''Masters of Sex'']], Season 2 Episode 4 of the TV show [[List of Life on Mars (UK TV series) episodes|''Life on Mars'' (UK)]], Episode 14 of  [[Life on Mars (U.S. TV series)|''Life on Mars'' (US)]] and episode 8 of ''[[List of Journeyman episodes|Journeyman]]'', as well as in the film ''[[The Ice Storm (film)|The Ice Storm]]''.

According to economic studies on swinging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'Orlando | first1 = Fabio | year = 2010 | title = Swinger Economics | url = | journal = The Journal of Socio-Economics | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 303–304 | doi=10.1016/j.socec.2009.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the information and communications technology revolution, together with improvements in medicine, has been effective in reducing some of the costs of swinging and hence in increasing the number of swingers.

Swinging activities had another surge in interest and participation in the late 1990s due to the rise of the [[Internet]].

=== Religious and moral objections ===
{{See also|Religion and sexuality|Sexual norm|Casual sex}}
Some people object to swinging on moral or philosophical grounds. Most religious communities and moralists regard swinging as [[adultery]], not withstanding that it is with the knowledge, consent or encouragement of one spouse to the other. Some argue that strict [[monogamy]] is the ideal form for marital relationships and that sexual relations should only take place between marriage partners or, perhaps, between partners in a committed monogamous relationship.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

== In other societies ==
===Native Americans===
According to Mark Carroll, wife lending and husband lending was a Native American custom, especially within the family such as brothers. He says that anthropologists have characterised it as "anticipatory [[Levirate marriage|levirate]]" – that is, in anticipation of a future levirate marriage - of the wife to her brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YEwFREzG_TcC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=wife+lending#v=onepage&amp;q=wife%20lending&amp;f=false |last=Carroll |first=Mark |title=Homesteads Ungovernable: Families, Sex, Race, and the Law in Frontier Texas, 1823-1860 |page=26 |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2010 |location= |isbn=9780292782730 |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arabia===
Wife lending was a practice in pre-Islamic Arabia whereby husbands allow their wives to live with "men of distinction" to produce noble offspring. The husband, who abstained while his wife lived with the other man, would then be socially considered the father of the child. After the arrival of Islam this practice was forbidden and was considered a form of adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwlusa.org/topics/history/herstory.html|title=Women in Pre-Islamic Arabia|last=Muslim Women's League|date=September 1995 |publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
Temporary spouse-trading is practiced as an element of ritual initiation into the [[Lemba people|Lemba]] secret society in the [[French Congo]] through "wife exchange:"&lt;ref&gt;Janzen 1982, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; "you shall lay with the priestess-wife of your Lemba Father and he shall lay with your wife too."&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; McGaffey 1974, p. 100b (.7.10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janzen &amp; McGaffey 1974, p. 116 (81)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Guinea ===
Among the [[Orya]] of northern [[Irian Jaya]], the ''agama toŋkat'' (Indonesian for "walking-stick") cult "encouraged men to trade wives, i.e., to have sexual relations with each other's wives. This trading of sexual favours ... was only between pairs of families, ... adherents are now very secretive concerning cult activities and teachings."&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In this 'walking-stick' cult "the walking stick ... ''dute'' is the term men use to refer to the husband of the woman who becomes his sexual partner."&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Phil, ''Of Paradise Lost: Orya myth''. 1998, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, "There have been other similar movements ... near Jayapura. These are popularly called Towel Religion (''agama handuk'') and the Simpson Religion (''agama simpson'')."&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1998, p. 39, fn. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Mimika of southern Irian Jaya, temporary spouse-trading is said to have been originated by a woman who had returned from the world of the dead: "The wife says to her husband, '...&amp;nbsp;tonight I will sleep in the house of the headman ..., and ... his wife, will sleep in your house. Because I have been dead ..., tonight I am going to do for the first time what people have been looking forward to (for so long). I am going to institute the ''papisj'', wife exchange.'"&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Zegwaard (transl. from the Dutch by Peter Mason and Ton van Santvoord), ''Amoko''. Crawford House, Belair (SA), 2002. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inuit and Aleut ===
[[Inuit]] wife trading has often been reported and commented on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lawrence |last=Hennigh |date=March 1970 |title=Functions and Limitations of Alaskan Eskimo Wife Trading |journal=Arctic |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=24–34 |jstor=40507675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporary "wife-lending ... was apparently more common among the Aleuts than Eskimos".
Several motivations for temporary spouse-trading among the Inuit have been suggested:
*at the instigation of an [[Alaska Native religion|aŋekok]] (shaman), as a magical rite to achieve better weather for hunting expeditions
*as a regular feature of the annual "[[Bladder Festival]]"
*for a man visiting unaccompanied by his wife, under the promise that he will in the future make his own wife sexually available to his host whenever the host will himself come visiting his erstwhile guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2066/do-eskimo-men-lend-their-wives-to-strangers |title=Do Eskimo men lend their wives to strangers? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=2003-01-21 |accessdate=2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Inuit, a very specialized and socially circumscribed form of wife-sharing was practiced. When hunters were away, they would often stumble into the tribal lands of other tribes, and be subject to death for the offense. But, when they could show a "relationship" by virtue of a man, father or grandfather who had sex with their wife, mother or other female relatives, the wandering hunter was then regarded as family. The Inuit had{{When|date=October 2012}} specific terminology and language describing the complex relationships that emerged from this practice of wife sharing. A man called another man "aipak", or "other me", if the man had sex with his wife. Thus, in their conception, this other man having sex with one's wife was just "another me".&lt;ref name="Ley, David 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ley |first=David |title=Insatiable Wives: Women Who Stray and The Men Who Love Them |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2009 |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-1-4422-0030-2 |oclc=373474387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenous peoples in South America ===
Among the [[Araweté]] ([[Asurini]]) in the state of [[Pará]], [[Brazil]], "spouse-swapping" is practiced.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Batalha Viveiros de Castro (transl. from the Portuguese by Catherine V. Howard) : ''From the Enemy's Point of View''. University of Chicago Press, 1992. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Bari tribe of Venezuela, when a woman becomes pregnant, the woman often takes other male lovers. These additional lovers then take on the role of secondary or tertiary fathers to the child. If the primary father should die, the other men then have a social obligation to support these children. Research has shown that children with such "extra" fathers have improved life outcomes, in this economically and resource-poor area of the jungle.&lt;ref name="Ley, David 2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7379">The '''Hartwell Paper''' called for a reorientation of [[climate policy]] after the perceived failure in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|2009 of the UNFCCC climate conference in Copenhagen]]. It was a response to the [[United Nations]]' [[Kyoto Protocol]], a previous international agreement meant to reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The paper was published in May 2010 by the [[London School of Economics]] in cooperation with the [[University of Oxford]]. The authors are 14 natural and social scientists from Asia, Europe and North America, including [[Mike Hulme]], [[Roger A. Pielke (Jr)]], [[Nico Stehr]] and [[Steve Rayner]], who met under the [[Chatham House Rule]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf|title=The Hartwell Paper|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors saw the [[Great Recession|2009 economic crisis]] as an opportunity to re-evaluate global priorities. They argued that "decarbonisation will only be achieved successfully as a benefit contingent upon other goals which are politically attractive and relentlessly pragmatic."

[[File:Hartwell House, Bucks.jpg| thumb | right | 200px | [[Hartwell House, Buckinghamshire|Hartwell House]], where the meetings took place.]]

They emphasize [[human dignity]] as a necessary guiding principle for climate [[Climate policy|policy]]: "To reframe the climate issue around matters of human dignity is not just noble or necessary. It is also likely to be more effective than the approach of framing around human sinfulness – which has failed and will continue to fail."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 EU Climate Policy after the Crash of 09.] The European Business Review, September 2010 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325063036/http://www.europeanbusinessreview.com/?p=2303 |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle of human dignity is expanded to three main objectives:
* 1. Energy access for all - the paper advocates taking investments in the innovations of renewable energy to decrease energy costs and to make them more affordable to society. Only this diversification of energy could extend the access to energy, especially in undeveloped countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* 2. Development that does not interfere with essential Earth systems.
* 3. Societies well equipped to withstand climate-related dangers.

Their ultimate goal is "to develop non-carbon energy supplies at unsubsidised costs less than those using [[fossil fuels]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/mackinderProgramme/theHartwellPaper The Hartwell Paper.] [[London School of Economics]], May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/international/displayStory.cfm?story_id=16099521 Oblique strategies], [[The Economist]], 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8673828.stm After the crash - a new direction for climate policy.] BBC News, 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hartwell Paper recommends that they are to achieve this goal by introducing low [[carbon]] [[Carbon tax|taxes]]. However, this money is able to be used to develop a CO2 free energy supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Kyoto and Climate Change Misconceptions ==

"The previous 'Kyoto' model has dangerously narrowed the option space for thinking seriously and realistically about energy and environmental policies. The Hartwell Paper wishes to contribute to a new pragmatism in the policy discourse surrounding climate change. To this end, we gathered at Hartwell House in Buckinghamshire in February 2010 and this paper is the base of our work".

The Hartwell Paper argues that, although we should attempt to reduce climate change, we must also prepare to adapt if necessary. According to the authors, the Kyoto principles implied that adaptation to the environment should be seen as a failure to halt climate change. Those at the Hartwell meeting proposed that these strategies; mitigation, and adaptation, should both be employed. This is to keep in mind the dignity of those who would be most affected while simultaneously slowing global warming.

The following are climate myths presented in the paper:
* '''Climate change is a problem that must be solved''' - "Rather than being a discrete problem to be solved. Climate change is better understood as a persistent condition that must be coped with and can only be partially managed more – or less – well. It is just one part of a larger complex of such conditions encompassing population, technology, wealth disparities, resource use, etc."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* '''The "deficit model" of science''' - The idea that the lack of information hinders the making of environmental progress. Once the science is understood by all, an agreement can be reached. The Hartwell authors call this a myth, saying that it doesn't address the varying political and religious ideologies that can result in differing interpretations of scientific data. "In turn, this error has led to the common and flawed assumption that the solutions to climate change should be ‘science driven’ as if a shared understanding of science will lead to a political consensus."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Key Features of Hartwell Plan ==

The authors propose a holistic model of environmental practice. They believe there has been too much emphasis placed on carbon dioxide as if it is our only problematic emission. They state that while the CO2 reduction is central to the plan, smaller changes in a variety of practices and industries are also important.
* Diversification and moving away from fossil fuels
* Eradication of "Black Carbon" - Black Carbon is simply soot, which can come from burning wood or coal within the home. This has an environmental effect far greater (per ton) than simple CO2. According to the authors, this is an important step to take, as it should be much easier than phasing out gasoline.
* Reduce Tropospheric Ozone
* Protect Tropical Forests
* The "Kaya Identity" - these are four primary factors when it comes to a region's environmental footprint. They are population, wealth, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. Nations face different environmental issues, and the solution for one is not the solution for all.

== Reception and Criticism ==

The Hartwell Paper has received both praise and criticism. According to The Economist, the Hartwell approach to decarbonisation has been a source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16099521|title=Oblique strategies|date=2010-05-11|work=The Economist|access-date=2017-12-04|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because large, rapidly industrializing nations are driven by fossil fuels, the authors claim that slowing this process just isn't politically feasible. ''The Economist'' article argues that Hartwell's "oblique strategies" may be more difficult to turn into policy than a more direct attack on carbon dioxide emissions.

The '''''Theodore Psalter''''' is an [[Illuminated manuscript|illustrated manuscript]] and compilation of the ''[[Psalms]]'' and the canticles, or Odes from the ''[[Old Testament.]]''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantine|last=A. P.Kazhdan - Alice-Mary MaffryTalbot - Anthony Cutler - Timothy E.Gregory - Nancy PattersonŠevčenko|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0195046526|location=Oxford University, U.K.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This [[Psalter]] has been held in the [[British Library]] since 1853 as ''Additional 19.352''," wrote Princeton Art History professor Charles Barber in his first essay that is a companion to the ''Theodore Psalter E-Facsimile''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Charles|date=February 5, 2000|title=Theodore Psalter E-Facsimile|url=|journal=University of Illinois Press|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barber called the Psalter, "One of the richest illuminated manuscripts to survive from [[Byzantium]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He goes on to say, "This essay will introduce a number of the various approaches that have been brought to bear upon this work. In reviewing these wide-ranging approaches it will be possible both to define the questions that have shaped the reception of this work and to formulate some possibilities for future research."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:Theodore Psalter 03.jpg|alt=Courtesy of the British Library; London, U.K.|thumb|&lt;blockquote&gt;Colophon of the Theodore Psalter--MS 19352, f 208&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]

==The Psalter==
The ''[[Psalms]]'' are a book within the ''Old Testament,'' written in metered [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], or twelve-syllable poetic lines, and are thought to be [[Musical instrument|musical]]. They have been compared to a harp, or other instruments of music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Byzantine psalters stand out in historically because of the religious and spiritual artistic qualities the [[Byzantine Empire]] was known for. This includes images and icons painted by hand. The [[art]] within the Byzantine psalters were specifically unique because of the history surrounding the creation and use of images two centuries before during opposition to icons in the [[Iconoclastic controversy]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|last=Cormack|first=Robin|publisher=Oxford University Press, U.K.|date=November 26, 2000|isbn=978-0195046526|location=Oxford, U.K.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[psalter]] is a [[book]] made specifically to contain the 150 psalms from the book of [[Psalms]].  Psalters have also included the odes or [[canticle]]s, which are songs or prayers in song form from the [[Old Testament]]. Psalters were created purely for [[Liturgical book|liturgical]] purposes, and the Psalms were the most popular books of the ''Old Testament'' in Byzantium.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The ''Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium'' observed, "Like a garden, the book of ''Psalms'' contains, and puts in musical form everything that is to be found in other books, and shows, in addition, its own particular qualities."&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford dictionary of Byzantium|date=1991|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|isbn=978-0195046526|edition=1. print.|location=New York [u.a.]|editor=Alexander P.

]]Barber wrote in "Essay One" of the ''Theodore Psalter E-Facsimile,'' "Completed in Constantinople in February 1066, the 208 folios of this [[Manuscript culture|manuscript]] include 440 separate [[Images and Words|images]], making this the most fully [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] Psalter to come down from the [[Byzantine Empire]]."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theodore Psalter E-Facsimile|last=Barber|first=Charles|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=February 5, 2001|isbn=978-0252025853|location=Illinois|pages=Essay}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;He further writes, "Before entering upon this [[Historiography|historiographical]] discussion the manuscript itself should be introduced. In recent years this Psalter has come to be known as the ''Theodore Psalter'', a name that memorializes the [[scribe]] mentioned in the manuscript's [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]], (folio 208r). In its modern binding, the manuscript is 208 folios in length and gathered into twenty-six [[Units of paper quantity|quires]]. Each quire is numbered in the lower margin of its opening folio (except where cut) in [[carmine]] and black and on the final folio in black."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Barber adds, "The prayer of dedication and the colophon found that the final opening of the manuscript (folios 207v-208r) provide precise information on the production of this manuscript. The colophon, written on folio 208r can be translated as follows: "This volume of the divine ''Psalms'' was completed in the month of February of the fourth [[indiction]] of the year 6574 [i.e. 1066 C.E.] on the order of the divinely inspired felker and [[synkellos]] Michael, abbot of the all-holy and all-blessed monastery."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Barber added, "The name of the monastery is lost, but from other evidence within the manuscript we know that it was the [[Monastery of Stoudios|Stoudios Monastery]] in [[Constantinople]]."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The second part of the colophon reads,&lt;blockquote&gt;"Written and written in [[gold]] by the hand of Theodore the [[Archpriest|protopresbyter]] of this monastery and scribe from Caesarea, whose shepherd and luminary was the glorious and brilliant Basil, who was truly great and was also so named."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Professor Barber continues, "First, there is Theodore from Caesaera. He describes himself as an archpriest and scribe of the monastery. Furthermore, he has defined himself within this last role in two ways: he has both written and written in gold this manuscript. Clearly, Theodore should be identified with the hands-on production of this work. The second name is the abbot of the monastery, Michael, who is described as the divinely inspired father and synkellos of the monastery and about whom we have no other firm information. The colophon shows that Michael is to be understood as the patron of this book, which was made at his order.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [[Monastery of Stoudios|Stoudios Monastery]] was known for its rigorous academic and artistic excellence, and especially in the Byzantine style of religious icons. A ''[[protopresbyteros]]'' is an [[archpriest]]—a kind of clerk and monk.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Liturgy and the Psalms==
The Byzantine Empire witnessed a very prolific movement in the creation of art.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The legalization of [[Christianity]] by [[Constantine the Great|Emperor Constantine]] in 313 inspired works of art linked to this new religious movement, specifically [[Icons, Abstract Thee|icons,]] and they became very popular, and the quintessential art form from Byzantine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Church services created and inspired by religious devotion were called liturgical services.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|page=1240}} [[Liturgy]] was the concept behind icons, ceremonies or rituals, and the creation of religious books. The act of reading the Psalms was not new. It was thought that icons created a mental universe for the reader imbued with images derived from texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawkes-Teeples|first1=Steven|last2=Groen|first2=Bert|last3=Alexopoulos|first3=Stefanos|title=Studies on the liturgies of the Christian east : selected papers of the Third International Congress of the Society of Oriental Liturgy, Volos, May 26-30, 2010|date=2013|publisher=Peeters|location=Leuven|isbn=9789042927490|pages=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art History Professor Herbert L. Kessler believes such manuscripts were created to transport the reader to a different place, a place with high spiritual aspirations. He mentions an illuminated manuscript, the Gospel of St. Luke, and writes, "This eleventh-century manuscript demonstrates a trend of the High Middle Ages in which transcendental contemplation was initiated by abstract means. Here, thin washes of celestial colors elevate the animal flesh itself, the vellum on which words and pictures are elsewhere inscribed, to guide the viewer's thoughts from the physical world toward (though not all the way to) the invisible God."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seeing Medieval Art|last=Kessler|first=Herbert L.|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1551115351|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustrations and Images==
[[File:Theodore Psalter page 099v. Ps.76.21 - Moses and Aaron.jpg|thumb|Theodore Psalter--Courtesy of the British Library; London, U.K.]]
The ''Theodore Psalter'' features 440 miniatures, or illustrations. They are ‘marginal’ miniatures; they appear in the margins of the book. The miniatures include illustrations from the [[Gospel]]s, liturgical illustrations and [[Hagiography|hagiographical]] miniatures, or stories about Christ.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|page=2046}} The word ''miniature'' means illustration, and originates with the word ''minium'', which had nothing to do with size or the word ‘minimum’. Instead, the word refers to the red lead of the pencils used in the 9th Century for these psalters. Throughout the psalter there are both red and blue lines connecting the miniatures to text, much like the way we today link text to photos or other websites.

The ''Theodore Psalter'' miniatures convey allegorical meaning from the ''Psalms'' or the ''Odes'', and have "an extra layer of meaning supplied by images displaying vigorous anti-Iconoclastic propaganda".&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;{{rp|page=1753}} One example is Mathew commenting on the Psalms.

There are animals: goats and dogs: mice and birds including pelicans; a dragon and unicorn; and a Tree of Life. There are men playing music, and vegetation.

Professor Barber continues his commentary on the Psalter, "The image and prayer on folio 207v develop our understanding of Michael's possession of the book. A blessing bust of Christ can be assumed in the medallion. Below and to the right is a standing figure of David, clearly labeled, wearing royal costume and carrying a psaltery. Between them, and now almost lost, is the faint trace of a third figure. This bearded man carries a book in his left hand, looks up toward Christ, and gestures with his right hand. He is identified by the text written around him: "Our most Holy Father Michael, the abbot and synkellos, the Stoudite says...He says, "Savior, take hold of the finished book of your prophet and wise king." The image and text together indicate that thePsalter is shown in the left hand of Michael. David is identified as the author of the Psalms, but it is Michael who possesses, for the moment, the Psalter. (see Essay 3). It is his to give to Christ. The manuscript's final opening provides a writer-producer (Theodore), a patron-pssessor (Michael), an ordinary author (David), and a national recipient (Christ). In addition, the texts indicate that the manuscript was completed in February 1066. Taken together, this information provides rare precise details on the location of the production and the possession of a Byzantine Illuminated manuscript. As such, the Theodore Psalter necessarily provides a fixed point in any discussion of eleventh-century Constantinopolitan illumination."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This kind of scene occurs throughout the Psalter, and there are surprising examples.

Professor Robin Cormack writes in his book ''Byzantine Art'' about the ''Theodore Psalter.'' Patriarch Nikephoros, an Orthodox patriarch who supported the use of icons 250 years before, during the Iconoclastic Debate, appears in the text, and there are conversations, but there is a surprising twist. He is replaced by a monk who had lived at the monastery at the same time. That monk was Theodore the Studite who was made a saint after his death, and who had been persecuted for actively supporting the making and the using icons.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Professor Cormack writes, "The prominent role of Patriarch Nikephoros, as triumphant iconophile is replaced with portraits of the monk St. Theodore the Studite. Natural though it was to celebrate a past member of the community in which the manuscript was made, it slants the opposition to iconoclasm away from patriarch to monk."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
[[File:Theodore Psalter page 134r. Ps. 101.7.jpg|thumb|Miniature from the Theodore Psalter. Courtesy of the British Library.]]
There is another interesting detail, and that is the image of the pelican in the manuscript. Eriko Tsuji wrote an article about the Theodore Psalter and the appearance of the image of a pelican, " Where both the Chludov (Moscow, Historical Museum, 129d) and the Barberini Psalters show a bird nesting on a column as an illustration of Psalms 103:17 ("There the sparrows will build their nests; and the house of the heron takes the lead among them," the Theodore Psalter has precisely the same composition at Psalms 101:7, "I have become like a pelican of the wilderness; I have become like an owl in the ruined house").  Theodore must have moved the miniature intentionally because he added a new motif instead of the bird on a column as an illustration of Psalms 103:17. The illustration of the bird on a column was regarded as a pelican in the Theodore Psalter because of the relationship to the word "Pelican" in the text. Though the miniature of the pelican itself is now lost, we have a photograph of the miniature of Crucifixion interpreting a fable of the pelican. It is obvious among the monks of the monastery that the pelican can be considered as an image of the Passion of Christ. The miniature cycle of the Theodore Psalter was devised for the abbot of the monastery. By examining the miniatures as a product of the highly intellectual culture of the monastery, we can speculate that the modification by Theodore is a reflection of the interests and concerns of the Stoudios monastery in the eleventh century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsuji|first=Eriko|volume=61 |issue=1 |date=2011|title=The Iconography of the Pelican in the Scriptorium of the Stoudios Monastery.|url=|journal=University of Tennessee, Knoxville|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experience of the Icon ==
Art historian and Stanford professor Bissera Pentcheva points out that the icon must be experienced with the senses:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Focusing on the Byzantine icon, this study plunges into the realm of senses and performative objects. To us, the Greek word for icon, designates portraits of Christ, Mary, angels, saints, and prophets painted in encaustic or tempera on wooden boards. By contrast, ''eikon'' in Byzantium had a wide semantic spectrum ranging from hallowed bodies permeated by the Spirit, such as the Stylite saintes or the Eucharist, to imprinted images on the surfaces of metal, stone, and earth. Eikon designated matter imbued with divine pneuma, releasing charis, or grace. As matter, this object was meant to be physically experienced. Touch, smell, taste, and sound were part of "seeing" an eikon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pentcheva|first1=Bissera|title=Sensual icon : space, ritual, and the senses in byzantium.|date=2013|publisher=Penn State Univ Press|location=University Park|isbn=9780271035833|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Text and Script==
There are two kinds of script used in the ''Theodore Psalter.'' One is called m''ajuscule'', and is a kind of calligraphy consisting of large or upper case letters. In the Theodore Psalter the m''ajuscule'' lettering appears in gold. The other kind of text or script used in the manuscript is a smaller text called ''[[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]]''. It is also a kind of [[calligraphy]] established in the 8th and 9th century by [[Charlemagne]] and revived during the [[Italian Renaissance]]''. Minuscule'' is the foundational script that forms the basis of the present day Roman [[letter case|upper and lower case]] type. These small letters appear in red and gold throughout the text, and the cover has those same colors in majuscule. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Professor Barber adds, "the predominant script is a ''minuscule perlschrift'' typical of the eleventh century. A gilded ''majuscule'' is used for emphasized passages and titles. The text is written beneath the ruled line in brown ink, although certain passages, titles, and initial letters of Psalm verses are written in gold on carmine ink. A varied system of marks in carmine or blue link text and image is in this manuscript." Barber adds that the (ruling) pattern is relatively uncommon. "The text block is ruled for a single column of text and measures approximately 10.6 cm by 15.2 cm. The number of text lines varies between twenty and twenty-four; normally these are consistent within a quire. The Psalter contains 151 Psalms (folios 1-189r), a unique telve-syllable poem on the early life of David (folios 189v-191r), a prayer for the abbot of a monastery (folios 191v-192), ten biblical odes (folios 192v-208r), and a dedication and colophon (folios 207v and 208r). The Psalms and Odes are numbered next to their titles and the Psalm text is divided into hathismata and doxai, reflecting common monastic practice.Numerous initial letters are ornamented, although the significance of the distribution of these letters is not disclosed by their occurrence."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theodore Psalter E-Facsimile|last=Barber|first=Charles|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date=February 5, 2001|isbn=978-0252025853|location=Illinois|pages=Essay One}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Combinations of Art and Text in the Theodore Psalter==
[[File:Theodore Psalter, Pslam 26, 1066.jpg|thumb|Theodore Psalter-Courtesy of the British Library; London, U.K.]]
The relationship of icons and text, especially religious text, is an ongoing topic of interest to scholars.  &lt;blockquote&gt;Professor Liz James writes:  "Art and text, the interface between images and words, is one of the oldest issues in art history. Are works of art and writings different but parallel forms of expression? Are they intertwined and interdependent?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;She goes on to ask, "Can art ever stand alone and apart from text or is it always enmeshed in the meanings expressed in the written and the oral that make it perpetually exposed to subjective interpretation? Byzantium was a culture in which the interactions between word and image underpinned, in many ways, the whole meaning of art. For the Byzantines, as a People of the Book, the interface between images and words, and, above all, Christ, the Word of God, was crucial. The dynamic between art and text in Byzantium is essential for understanding Byzantine society, where the correct relationship between the two was critical to the well being of the state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=edited by Liz|title=Art and text in Byzantine culture|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521834094|pages=1|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Time Structured Mapping''' (TSM) is a [[musical notation|score based]] system created and used by the composer [[Pete M Wyer|Pete M. Wyer]]. It uses the [[bar (music)|bar-lines]] found in conventional musical scores to indicate durational periods during which performers, who may include actors, singers, dancers, poets as well as musicians, are given instructions, which may include conventional musical scoring or [[improvisation]]al guidelines (see: [[musical improvisation]]).
The system allows large and sometimes disparate groups to improvise together coherently, or to combine improvisation with scored music or with other media. It has been used to get orchestras, including the [[Orchestra of the Swan]] (see below), to improvise effectively and in educational projects, to combine student musicians with professionals, such as with [[Welsh National Opera]] and to combine other media such as dance and poetry with musical improvisation in a structured form, such as with [http://www.mirodancetheatre.org/ Miro Dance Theatre], Philadelphia.

The flexibility of the system has allowed for the combination of musicians from very different backgrounds, as well as disparate ensembles with players of very different standards. Works generally combine improvisation with conventional scoring and move frequently from one system to the other. The synchronisation using 'clock-time' as a basis has also enabled works made up of players who are spatially separated such as with ''Four Bridges'' which was performed simultaneously in Britain, Germany, America and India, it allows for  works which alter the conventional relationship of the composer with the musician by involving the performer directly into the creative process.

== Beginnings - The Simultaneity Project ==
In 2004 Wyer began creating [[Simultaneity]] works: works that made recordings at the same time in different locations. The first recordings took place around [[Columbus Circle]], New York – Wyer mapped out a circumference that passed through the Time Warner building and around the periphery of Columbus Circle itself and, with the help of a team of volunteer staff from [[WNYC]] radio, made a series of simultaneous recordings that, when played back across multiple speakers, gave what he described as a ‘God’s ear view’ of the location – the experience of being at all points simultaneously; cars, subway trains and people moved from speaker to speaker, featuring the endless rotation of revolving doors that interfaced the very contrasting sonic landscape of the interior of the [[Time Warner Building]] with the bustling Manhattan streets outside.

This led to Simultaneity recordings that were not made in the same location: in December 2004, with volunteers primarily from [[Canadian Electroacoustic Community|CEC]] Canada’s online forum, a recording was made simultaneously in countries around the world:  volunteers were asked to record exactly the same twenty minutes of their environment wherever they were in the world, regardless of time-zone, but to include something that marked the hour changing. Volunteers recorded  dawn choruses (Australia), tolling bells (Australia), railway station announcements (New Zealand), clocks in a clock shop (San Francisco), ambient sound in Police Square (Manhattan), evening traffic (Berlin),  the backstage at English National Opera (London) late night rains (Tunis)  late night chatter (Mumbai), the sounds of the jungle (Laos),  dogs barking (northern Alaska). Resulting in a complex array of sounds that coalesced into a moment of intensity as the hour struck and then dissipated back to the disparate ambient environments.

== Time structured mapping ==
In his search to incorporate the philosophy of Simultaneity within western musical systems, Wyer returned to a frequent inspiration; birdsong;  struck by the endless combinations and re-combinations of the songs of the dawn chorus he began considering ways to create systems that would enable simultaneous solos that combined in musically intelligent, coherent ways - that necessarily moved away from the western convention of counting a beat for each bar.

In 2005 Wyer made his first Time Structured Maps using the same basic scores as might be used for an orchestra but where each bar-line represented a period of 30 seconds rather than a count and each ‘bar’ consisted of a set of instructions for how to improvise during that time period, which might be very specific or left ambiguous. The result was a system that enabled musicians from all backgrounds to play together, and to incorporate other forms such as dance, speech etc. within a score.

The first significant work for the system was for the Orchestra of the Swan with a Time Structured Map (TSM) based work called Traveller, ''There Are No Paths, Paths Are Made By Walking'' created in the summer of 2005.
A second, much more ambitious work, Four Bridges, was performed in November 2005, it combined the ideas of Simultaneity with the Time Structured Mapping system: the Orchestra of the Swan played from the score in England while pianist Burkhard Finke in Frankfurt, microtonal vocal specialist [[Toby Twining]] in Boston and Indian Classical singer Anand Thakore in Mumbai performed simultaneously from the same score, without hearing each other – each performance was recorded and later combined into a work for 8 speakers, which was later broadcasrt on [[WNYC|WNYC New Sounds]].

In 2009, Time Structured Mapping was used for the creation of the one-hour ''Insomnia Poems'' for BBC Radio 3 ([[BBC Radio 3|Jazz On 3]]) &lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 3 Jazz On 3.{{full|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined post-beat poet [[Steve Dalachinsky]] with a five-piece band consisting of soprano, Evelyne Beech, electronics and processing, Mike Cross, clarinets and saxes, [[Christopher Cundy|Chris Cundy]], bass, Robert Perry and Pete M Wyer on guitar, piano with found sounds and manipulations – each performing with a synchronized stopwatch. The piece was popularly received, retaining the energy and spontaneity of improvisation within the dynamic and tonal structure of a conventionally scored piece.

Further development, funded by the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council Of England]], enabled workshops which in turn led to new works using the system: Welsh National Opera &lt;ref&gt;Welsh National Opera.{{full|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; used it for a series of educational works alongside their 2010 UK tour, the [http://www.orchestraoftheswan.org Orchestra of the Swan] also using TSM scores for ''Four Sonnets'', a twenty-minute work created in July 2010 which combined improvisation within the orchestra with text fragments submitted according to the score from members of the public and ''Listening To The Sky', ''a one hour work for chamber group with sound design, which used a TSM score to combine orchestra performance with sounds created according to the Time Structured Map''.

[[File:ToK Simple.jpg|thumb|379px|Gregg Henriques' Tree of Knowledge System]]

The '''tree of knowledge''' ('''ToK''') '''system''' is a theoretical approach to the unification of [[psychology]] developed by [[Gregg Henriques]], associate professor and director of the Combined-Integrated Doctoral Program in Clinical and School Psychology at [[James Madison University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/about%20me.htm "About Me" section of the ToK System website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the system was published in 2003 in ''[[Review of General Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Two special issues of the ''[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]'' in December 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109747885 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (December 2004). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 1) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 60 Issue 12, Pages 1203 – 1315]&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109856879 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (January 2005). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 2) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 61 Issue 1, Pages 1 – 139 ]&lt;/ref&gt; were devoted to the elaboration and evaluation of the model. The latest evaluation of this model appeared in a December 2008 special issue of ''[[Theory &amp; Psychology']]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol18/issue6/ ''Theory &amp; Psychology''. (December 2008). Volume 18, No. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official website on the tree of knowledge system claims that the ToK is

:''a new unified theory of knowledge that maps the pieces of the scientific puzzle in a novel way that connects Quantum Mechanics to Sociological processes and everything in between into a coherent whole. The most novel aspect of the ToK is its visuo-spatial depiction of knowledge as consisting of four dimensions of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture) that correspond to the behavior of four classes of objects (material objects, organisms, animals, and humans), and four classes of science (physical, biological, psychological, and social).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/other%20research.htm ToK FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "problem of psychology"==
Henriques argues that the most difficult problem in psychology as a discipline is that while there is incredible diversity offered by different approaches to psychology, there is no consensus model of what ''psychology'' actually is.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the ToK system, the "problem of psychology", (as Henriques puts it), is that a clear definition, an agreed upon subject matter, and a coherent conceptual framework have eluded its students for its entire [[history of psychology|history]]. He further argues that the patent tendency of psychology has been toward theoretical and substantial fragmentation and increasing insularity among the "specialties." In other words, the discipline has fragmented into [[psychological schools|different schools of thought]] and methodology, with no overall framework to interpret and integrate the research of different areas. At its best, the different approaches are a strength of psychology; different approaches lead to novel ideas, and prevent psychologists from clinging to a paradigm that fails to explain a phenomenon. At its worst, adherents of one particular school cling to their beliefs concerning the relative importance of their research and disregard or are ignorant of different approaches. In most cases, individual psychologists have to determine for themselves which elements of which perspective to apply, and how to integrate them into their overall understanding.
 
The reason for psychology's fragmentation, according to the ToK, is that there has been no [[metatheory|meta-theoretical]] frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions that need to be addressed. As such, the different schools of thought in psychology are like the blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 ''Review of General Psychology'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of [[B.F. Skinner]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. These luminaries were chosen because when one considers their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.

Cultural and personality psychologist, Michael Katzko,&lt;ref&gt;[http://baserv.uci.kun.nl/~mwsk49/ Homepage of Michael Katzko]&lt;/ref&gt; however critiques Henriques' position on "the problem of psychology":

:''There is a very good reason for skepticism regarding the repeated claims that the one unique problem of psychology, applicable across the entire discipline, has been identified and that the ToK System solves it. The reason is given by the detail with which alternatives have been worked out, be they historical studies of institutional development or critical commentaries on the rhetorical structure of psychology's literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Katzko, M.W. (2008). Pruning the Tree of Knowledge. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 817–828. [http://tap.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/6/817 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree of knowledge==
In one way, the tree of knowledge system reflects a fairly common hierarchy of nature and of the sciences that has been represented in one way or another since the time of [[Auguste Comte]], who in the 19th century used a hierarchical conception of nature to argue for the existence of sociology. Despite its surface agreement with a standard conception, the ToK System offers a set of ideas that have added implications for both [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The ontological claim made by the ToK, (and [[#top|depicted pictorially above]]), is that [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]] consists of four separable dimensions of complexity, namely [[matter]], life, [[mind]], and culture. The dimension of complexity argument is arguably one of the most complicated aspects of the system. Many have argued nature is hierarchically leveled; for example, a list of such levels might be [[subatomic particles]], [[atoms]], [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, organ structures, multi-celled organisms, [[consciousness]], and society is common. The ToK System embraces a view of nature as levels, but adds the notion that there are also ''dimensions of complexity''. The difference can be seen pictorially. A view of nature as solely consisting of levels would have a single "cone" of complexity, whereas the ToK depicts four "cones". The ToK posits that a separate dimension of complexity emerges when a process of selection operates on a unit of information. Thus, according to the ToK, [[natural selection]] operating on genetic combinations gives rise to the dimension of Life; [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral selection]] operating on [[neuron]]al combinations gives rise to the dimension of Mind; and [[theory of justification|justification]] operating on [[symbol]]ic combinations gives rise to Culture.

The ToK system also offers a new epistemology that Henriques believes will move toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed ''[[consilience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1999). ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]''. Vintage:USA&lt;/ref&gt; Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. The ToK offers alternative perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts science itself as both emerging out of culture and as a unique type of "justification system" that is based on the values of [[accuracy]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the ToK system. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; A "justification system", according to Henriques, refers to any belief system that emerges that coordinates the behaviors of individual humans to human populations. The four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the [[physical science|physical]], [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[social science]]s.

===Matter===

The dimension of [[matter]] refers to the set of material objects and their behaviors through time. In accordance with modern [[cosmology]], matter is theorized to have emerged from a pure energy [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the [[Big Bang]]. [[Space-time|Space and time]] were also born at such a point. Nonliving material objects range in complexity from [[subatomic particle]]s to large organic molecules. The physical sciences (i.e., [[physics]], [[chemistry]], geology, [[astronomy]]) describe the behavior of material objects.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life===

The dimension of life refers to [[organism]]s and their behaviors through time. Living objects are considered a unique subset of material objects. Just as [[quantum particle]]s form the fundamental units of material complexity, [[gene]]s are the fundamental units of living information. Although many questions about the emergence of life remain unanswered, in accordance with modern biology, the ToK posits that natural selection operating on genetic combinations through time is the unified theory of biology and forms the foundational understanding for the emergence of organic complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind===

Mind/cognition in the ToK system refers to the set of mental behaviors. ''Mental behaviors'' are behaviors of animals mediated by the [[nervous system]] that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind/cognition is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting a drink of water are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with [[sentience]] or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental/cognitive dimension. [[Cognition]], in the broad sense of the term is meaning bodily-neuro-social information processing, as in EEEE Cognition: Embodied, Embedded, Enactive, Extended. While cognitive science stands for naturalist study of mind, psychology is an approach grounded in the tradition of humanities, especially philosophy. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[behaviorism|behavioral science]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===

Culture in the ToK system refers to the set of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] behaviors, which range from large scale nation states to individual human justifications for particular actions. Just as genetic information processing is associated with the Life dimension and neuronal information processing associated with the Mind dimension, symbolic information processing emerges with the Cultural dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical joint points==

===Quantum gravity===
{{main|Quantum gravity}}

'''Quantum gravity''' refers to the imagined merger between the twin pillars of physical science which are [[quantum mechanics]], the study of the microscopic (e.g., electrons), and [[general relativity]], the science of the macroscopic (e.g., [[galaxy|galaxies]]). Currently, these two great domains of science cannot be effectively interwoven into a single, physical [[Theory of Everything]]. Yet progress is being made, most notably through [[string theory]], [[loop quantum gravity]], [[black hole thermodynamics]] and the study of the early universe. Some of the difficulties combining these two pillars of physical science are philosophical in nature and it is possible that the macro view of knowledge offered by the ToK may eventually aid in the construction of a coherent theory of quantum gravity. The reason the ToK might help is that it locates scientific knowledge in relationship to the physical universe.

===The modern synthesis===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)|l1=The Modern Synthesis}}

The '''modern synthesis''' refers to the merger of genetics with [[natural selection]] which occurred in the 1930s and 1940s and offers a reasonably complete framework for understanding the emergence of biological complexity. Although there remain significant gaps in biological knowledge surrounding questions such as the origin of life and the emergence of sexual reproduction, the modern synthesis represents the most complete and well-substantiated joint point.

===Behavioral investment theory===

'''Behavioral investment theory''' ('''BIT''') is proposed as a merger of the selection science of [[behaviorism]] with the information science of [[cognitive neuroscience]] (notice the parallel with the modern synthesis). BIT posits that the nervous system evolved as an increasingly flexible computational control system that coordinates the behavioral expenditure of energy of the animal as a whole. Expenditure of behavioral energy is theorized to be computed on an investment value system built evolutionarily through natural selection operating on genetic combinations and [[ontogeny|ontogenetically]] through behavioral selection operating on neural combinations. As such, the current behavioral investments of the animal are conceptualized as the joint product of the two vectors of [[phylogeny]] and [[ontogeny]]. A unique element of BIT is that it finds a core of agreement and builds bridges between five brain-behavior paradigms: (1) [[cognitive science]]; (2) [[behavioral science]]; (3) evolutionary theory and genetics; (4) neuroscience; and (5) [[cybernetics]]/[[systems theory]].

[[David C. Geary]] noted the similarities between his "motive-to-control" hypothesis and Henriques' Behavioral Investment Theory, which were developed independently of each other. Furthermore, Geary suggested that his model "seem[ed] to fill in many of the [[proximate causation|proximate mechanisms]] and evolutionary pressures that define the life-mind joint point, and provided a framework for further development of the mind-culture joint point."&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2005). [http://web.missouri.edu/~psycorie/JCP05%5Bfinal%5D05.pdf The motivation to control and the origin of mind: Exploring the life-mind joint point in the tree of knowledge.] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 61,'' 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justification hypothesis===

The '''justification hypothesis''' ('''JH''') is a novel proposal that allows for both the understanding of the evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.

The JH can be stated succinctly as follows: The evolution of language gave rise to the problem of justification, and this evolutionary pressure ultimately resulted in the human self-consciousness system and human culture. The JH carries with it three fundamental postulates. 
*The first is that the evolution of language must have created the problem of justification, which is the problem of explaining one’s self to others in a justifiable manner.
*The second postulate is that the human self-consciousness system can be understood as a “justification filter”. This second claim links the evolutionary analysis with key insights from [[psychodynamic theory]]. Specifically, psychodynamic theory posits that socially unjustifiable impulses are inhibited and socially justifiable reasons are given for actions taken.
*The third postulate is that culture can be understood as large scale justification systems that coordinate the behavior of human populations. Cultural systems are seen to evolve much in the same way as organisms do in biological evolution: there is a process of variation, selection and retention of belief systems.

==How the ToK solves the problem of psychology==

The problem of psychology, according to the ToK, is its conceptual incoherence, which Henriques identifies by the following: 
:(1) There is no agreed upon definition.
:(2) There is no agreed upon subject matter.
:(3) There is a proliferation of overlapping and redundant concepts.
:(4) There are a large number of paradigms with fundamentally different epistemological assumptions.
:(5) Specialization continues to be increasingly emphasized at the expense of generalization and thus the problem of fragmentation only grows.

When the various conceptions of psychology (e.g., behavioral, humanistic, cognitive) are viewed through the lens of the ToK System, psychology spans two different dimensions of complexity: the mental and the cultural. In other words, the discipline has historically spanned two fundamentally separate problems: 
:(1) the problem of animal behavior in general, and
:(2) the problem of human behavior at the individual level.
 
If, as previously thought, nature simply consisted of levels of complexity, psychology would not be crisply defined in relationship to biology or the social sciences. And, indeed, it is frequently suggested that psychology exists in an amorphous space between biology and the social sciences. However, with its dimension of complexity depiction, the ToK System suggests that psychology can be crisply defined as the science of mind, which is the third dimension of complexity. Furthermore, because human behavior exists in the fourth dimension, psychology must be divided into two broad scientific domains of 
:(1) psychological formalism and
:(2) human psychology.

''Psychological formalism'' is defined as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. ''Human psychology'' is considered to be a unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though David A. F. Haaga "congratulate[d] Dr. Henriques' ambitious, scholarly, provocative paper", and "found the Tree of Knowledge taxonomy, the theoretical joint points, the evolutionary history, and the levels of emergent properties highly illuminating", he asks the rhetorical questions, 
:''If it is so difficult to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take the rest of the afternoon off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.''&lt;ref&gt;Haaga, D.A.F. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Defining%20Psychology.pdf Defining psychology: What can it do for us?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1227–1230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, Scott O. Lilienfeld, who described Henriques' effort as "thoughtful", contended that psychology is "an inherently fuzzy concept that resists precise definition" and that "attempts to define psychology [would be] likely to hamper rather than foster consilience across disciplines". Lilienfield went on further to suggest that the scientist-practitioner gap in psychology lies not in definitional issues, but in different "epistemic attitudes" between these two groups. He stated that scientists have an epistemic attitude of [[empiricism]], (where questions regarding human nature are settled by scientific evidence), and that practitioners have an epistemic attitude of [[romanticism]], (where questions of human nature are settled by intuition). Lilienfeld suggested that the solution to the scientist-practitioner gulf isn't definitional, but in "train[ing] future clinical scientists to appreciate the proper places of romanticism and empiricism within science".&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S.O. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Is%20it%20worth%20the%20trouble.pdf Defining psychology: Is it worth the trouble?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1249–1253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and human behavior==

A frequent question and point of confusion in the ToK System is the definition and meaning of [[consciousness]]. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, it is crucial to recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are [[sentience]], which is the capacity for mental experience and [[self-awareness]], which is the capacity to be aware of one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a "level 3" phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a "perceived" electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the "hard" problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very direct analysis of the other issue of consciousness, that of [[self-awareness]]. 
 
Another frequent question that is raised is "Where does individual human behavior fall on the ToK?" To analyze human behavior from the context of the ToK, one uses the ToK like a prism to separate the dimensions of behavior into physiochemical, biogenetic, neuropsychological and sociolinguistic. Thus if we imagine a conversation between a husband and wife as follows:

:Wife: “You are late again.”
:Husband: “Please not now. It was a stressful day and traffic was bad and you know if work needs to be done, I can’t just leave it.”

The words represent the sociolinguistic dimension and are understood as a function of justification. Justification systems are seen both at the level of individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context of justification in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of the husband and wife in terms of [[facial expression]], body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood as a function of behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions of possibility that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.

==Toward the integration of human knowledge==

As stated above, the ToK System proposes a new [[epistemology]] with the goal of moving academic knowledge toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed [[consilience]]. Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. Henriques argues that the ToK affords new perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts how science emerges from culture and that the four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.

Henriques further argues that developing such a system for integrating knowledge is not just an academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen as one of the most pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.
  
In a 2008 article on the ToK,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the Tree of Knowledge System. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques cites [[Oliver Reiser]]'s 1958 call for unifying scientific knowledge that Henriques implies is similar in theme to the ToK:

::''In this time of divisive tendencies within and between the nations, races, religions, sciences and humanities, synthesis must become the great magnet which orients us all…[Yet] scientists have not done what is possible toward integrating bodies of knowledge created by science into a unified interpretation of man, his place in nature, and his potentialities for creating the good society. Instead, they are entombing us in dark and meaningless catacombs of learning.''&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, O.L. (1958). The integration of human knowledge. Boston: Porter Sargent.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its depiction of the dimensions of complexity and interlocking theoretical joint points, Henriques' believes that his  ToK System offers new avenues that might allow scholars to meet Reiser’s call for academic synthesis. Henriques, like Reiser, believes that with a shared sense of purpose and a common background of explanation, people might yet be able to integrate bodies of knowledge into a unified interpretation of humanity, with humanity's place in nature and its potentialities for creating the good society.

'''Vihara''' ({{lang-sa|vihāra}}) generally refers to a [[monastery]] for [[bhikkhu|Buddhist renunciates]]. The concept is ancient and in early [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] texts, it meant any arrangement of space or facilities for pleasure and entertainment.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lahiri2015p181"/&gt; The term evolved into an architectural concept wherein it refers to living quarters for monks with an open shared space or courtyard, particularly in Buddhism. The term is also found in Ajivika, Hindu and Jain monastic literature, usually referring to temporary refuge for wandering monks or nuns during the annual Indian monsoons.&lt;ref name=mmwvihara/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kramrisch1946p137"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundas2003p203"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-50165-X|pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Jainism, the monks continue to wander from town to town except during the rainy season ([[Chaturmas#Jainism|Chaturmas]]), the term "vihara" refers their wanderings.&lt;ref&gt;Gomaṭeśvara sahasrābdī mahotsava darśana, Niraj Jain, Śravaṇabelagola Digambara Jaina Muzaraī Insṭīṭyuśaṃsa Mainejiṅga Kameṭī, 1984, Page 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulasī prajñā, Jaina Viśva Bhāratī., 1984, Page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Vihara or vihara hall has a more specific meaning in the [[architecture of India]], especially ancient [[Indian rock-cut architecture]].  Here it means a central hall, with small cells connected to it sometimes with beds carved from the stone. Some have a shrine cell set back at the centre of the back wall, containing a [[stupa]] in early examples, or a Buddha statue later. Typical large sites such as the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Aurangabad Caves]], [[Karla Caves|Karli Caves]], and [[Kanheri Caves]] contain several viharas. Some included a [[chaitya]] or worship hall nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, George, ''The Penguin Guide to the Monuments of India, Volume 1: Buddhist, Jain, Hindu'', p. 67 and see individual entries, 1989, Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140081445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vihara was originated to be a shelter for Monks when it rains.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
Vihāra is a Sanskrit word that appears in several Vedic texts with context sensitive meanings. It generally means a form of "distribution, transposition, separation, arrangement", either of words or sacred fires or sacrificial ground.

The northern [[India]]n state of [[Bihar]] derives its name from the word "vihara", due to the abundance of Buddhist monasteries in that area. The word "vihara" has also been borrowed in [[Malay language|Malay]] where it is spelled "biara," and denotes a monastery or other non-Muslim place of worship. In [[Thailand]] and [[China]] (called ''{{lang|zh-Latn|jingshe}}''; {{zh|精舎}}), "vihara" has a narrower meaning, and designates a [[shrine]] hall or retreat house.  It is called a "Wihan" ({{lang|th|วิหาร}}) in Thai, and a "Vihear" in [[Khmer language|Khmer]]. In [[Burmese language|Burmese]], ''wihara'' ({{my|ဝိဟာရ}}, {{IPA-my|wḭhəɹa̰|IPA}}), means "monastery," but the native Burmese word ''[[kyaung]]'' ({{my|ကျောင်း}}, {{IPA-my|tɕáʊɴ|IPA}}) is preferred. Monks wandering from place to place preaching and seeking [[alms]] often stayed together in the [[sangha]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  In the [[Punjabi language]], an open space inside a home is called a 'vehra'.

==Origins==
[[File:Ellora Cave 12 si0253.jpg|thumb|Cave 12, [[Ellora]], a late multi-story rock-cut vihara.  Further decoration of the pillars was probably intended.]]

===Viharas as pleasure centers===
During the 3rd-century BCE era of [[Ashoka]], ''vihara yatras'' were travels aimed at enjoyments, pleasures and hobbies such as hunting. These contrasted with ''dharma yatras'' which related to religious pursuits and pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="Lahiri2015p181"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nayanjot Lahiri|title=Ashoka in Ancient India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaVRCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-91525-1|pages=181–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ashoka converted to Buddhism, states Lahiri, he started ''dharma yatras'' around mid 3rd century BCE instead of hedonistic royal ''vihara yatras''.&lt;ref name="Lahiri2015p181"/&gt;

===Viharas as monasteries===
The early history of viharas is unclear. Monasteries in the form of caves are dated to centuries before the start of the common era, for [[Ajivika]]s, [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]s and [[Jainism|Jaina]]s. The rock-cut architecture found in cave viharas from the 2nd-century BCE have roots in the [[Maurya Empire]] period.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"/&gt; In and around the [[Bihar]] state of India are a group of residential cave monuments all dated to be from pre-common era, reflecting the Maurya architecture. Some of these have Brahmi script inscription which confirms their antiquity, but the inscriptions were likely added to pre-existing caves.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. R. Allchin|author2=George Erdosy|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5kI02_zW70C |year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37695-2|pages=247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest layer of Buddhist and Jain texts mention legends of the Buddha, the Jain Tirthankaras or [[sramana]] monks living in caves.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gwynne2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gwynne|title=World Religions in Practice: A Comparative Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sU8nDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|date=30 May 2017|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-97228-1|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jain1991p66"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kailash Chand Jain|title=Lord Mahāvīra and His Times|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8-TxcO9dfrcC&amp;pg=PA66|year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0805-8|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; If these records derived from an [[oral tradition]] accurately reflect the significance of monks and caves in the times of the Buddha and the Mahavira, then cave residence tradition dates back to at least the 5th century BCE. According to Allchin and Erdosy, the legend of First Buddhist Council is dated to a period just after the death of the Buddha. It mentions monks gathering at a cave near Rajgiri, and this dates it in pre-Mauryan times.&lt;ref name="AllchinErdosy1995"/&gt; However, the square courtyard with cells architecture of ''vihara'', state Allchin and Erdosy, is dated to the Mauryan period. The earlier monastic residences of Ajivikas, Buddhists, Hindus, and Jains were likely outside rock cliffs and made of temporary materials and these have not survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. R. Allchin|author2=George Erdosy|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5kI02_zW70C |year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37695-2|pages=240–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known gift of immovable property for monastic purposes ever recorded in an Indian inscription is credited to Emperor Ashoka, and it is a donation to the Ajivikas.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2011p96"/&gt; According to Johannes Bronkhorst, this created competitive financial pressures on all traditions, including the Hindu Brahmins. This may have led to the development of viharas as shelters for monks, and evolution in the [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashrama]] concept to ''agraharas'' or Hindu monasteries. These shelters were normally accompanied by donation of revenue from villages nearby, who would work and support these cave residences with food and services. The Karle inscription dated to the 1st century CE donates a cave and nearby village, states Bronkhorst, "for the support of the ascetics living in the caves at Valuraka [Karle] without any distinction of sect or origin". Buddhist texts from Bengal, dated to centuries later, use the term ''asrama-vihara'' or ''agrahara-vihara'' for their monasteries.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst2011p96"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Bronkhorst|title=Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BaX58-E5-3MC |year=2011|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-20140-8|pages=96–97 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GrundrissAjantaHoehle1.jpg|thumb|270px|Plan of cave 1 at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], a large ''vihara'' hall for prayer and living, 5th century]]
Buddhist viharas or monasteries may be described as a residence for monks, a centre for religious work and meditation and a centre of Buddhist learning. Reference to five kinds of dwellings (Pancha Lenani) namely, ''Vihara, Addayoga, Pasada, Hammiya'' and ''Guha'' is found in the Buddhist canonical texts as fit for monks. Of these only the ''Vihara'' (monastery) and ''Guha'' (Cave) have survived.

At some stage of Buddhism, like other Indian religious traditions, the wandering monks of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] dedicated to asceticism and the monastic life, wandered from place to place. During the rainy season (cf. [[vassa]]) they stayed in temporary shelters. In Buddhist theology relating to rebirth and merit earning, it was considered an act of merit not only to feed a monk but also to shelter him, sumptuous monasteries were created by rich lay devotees.

==Architecture==
The only substantial remains of very early viharas are in the rock-cut complexes, mostly in north India, the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] in particular, but this is an accident of survival. Originally structural viharas of stone or brick would probably have been at least as common everywhere, and the norm in the south.  By the second century BCE a standard plan for a vihara was established; these form the majority of Buddhist rock-cut "caves".  It consisted of a roughly square rectangular hall, in rock-cut cases, or probably an open court in structural examples, off which there were a number of small cells.  Rock-cut cells are often fitted with rock-cut platforms for beds and pillows.  The front wall had one or more entrances, and often a [[verandah]].  Later the back wall facing the entrance had a fairly small shrine-room, often reached through an ante-chamber.  Initially these held [[stupa]]s, but later a large sculpted [[Buddha]] image, sometimes with [[relief]]s on the walls.  The verandah might also have sculpture, and in some cases the walls of the main hall.  Paintings were perhaps more common, but these rarely survive, except in a few cases such as Caves 2, 10, 11 and 17 at the [[Ajanta Caves]].  As later rock-cut viharas are often on up to three storeys, this was also probably the case with the structural ones.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 48, 54-56, 119-120; Michell, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

As the vihara acquired a central image, it came to take over the function of the chaitya worship hall, and eventually these ceased to be built.  This was despite the rock-cut vihara shrine room usually offering no path for circumambulation or [[pradakshina]], an important ritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 132; Michell, 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In early medieval era, Viharas became important institutions and a part of Buddhist [[Universities]] with thousands of students, such as [[Nalanda]].  Life in "Viharas" was codified early on. It is the object of a part of the [[Pali canon]], the [[Vinaya|Vinaya Pitaka]] or "basket of monastic discipline".  [[Shalban Vihara]] in [[Bangladesh]] is an example of a structural monastery with 115 cells, where the lower parts of the brick-built structure have been excavated. [[Somapura Mahavihara]], also in Bangladesh, was a larger vihara, mostly 8th-century, with 177 cells around a huge central temple.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
[[File:094 Cave 12, Vihara Cells (34123037202).jpg|thumb|Cave 12, [[Ajanta Caves]], cell entries off a vihara hall]]

===Variants in rock-cut viharas===
Usually the standard form as described above is followed, but there are some variants. Two vihara halls, Cave 5 at [[Ellora]] and Cave 11 at [[Kanheri]], have very low platforms running most of the length of the main hall. These were probably used as some combination of benches or tables for dining, desks for study, and possibly beds.  They are often termed "dining-hall" or the "[[Durbar Hall]]" at Kanheri, on no good evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 359, 374&lt;/ref&gt;

Cave 11 at the Bedse Caves is a fairly small 1st-century vihara, with nine cells in the interior and originally four around the entrance, and no shrine room.  It is distinguished by elaborate [[gavaksha]] and railing relief carving around the cell-doors, but especially by having a rounded roof and [[apse|apsidal]] far end, like a [[chaitya]] hall.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, 351-352&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Mahabodhitemple.jpg|300px|thumb|Mahabodhi Temple|[[Mahabodhi Temple]] in India.]]

The earliest Buddhist rock-cut cave abodes and sacred places are found in the western [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] dating back to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="binda"&gt;{{cite book| first= Binda| last= Thapar| year= 2004| title= Introduction to Indian Architecture| edition=| publisher= Periplus Editions| location=Singapore| page= 34| isbn=  0-7946-0011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These earliest rock-cut caves include the [[Bhaja Caves]], the [[Karla Caves]], and some of the [[Ajanta Caves]].

Vihara with central shrine containing devotional images of the Buddha, dated to about the 2nd century CE are found in the northwestern area of [[Gandhara]], in sites such as [[Jaulian]], [[Kalawan]] (in the [[Taxila]] area) or [[Dharmarajika]], which states Behrendt, possibly were the prototypes for the 4th century monasteries such as those at [[Devnimori]] in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Behrendt 170"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Behrendt| first1=Kurt A.|title=Handbuch der Orientalistik|date=2004| publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004135952| pages=168–171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9_vbgkzUSkC&amp;pg=PA168|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the discovery of clay and bronze Buddha statues, but it is unclear if the statue is of a later date.&lt;ref name="Behrendt 170"/&gt; According to Behrendt, these "must have been the architectural prototype for the later northern and western Buddhist shrines in the [[Ajanta Caves]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Ellora]], [[Nalanda]], [[Ratnagiri]] and other sites".&lt;ref name="Behrendt 170"/&gt; Behrendt's proposal follows the model that states the northwestern influences and Kushana era during the 1st and 2nd century CE triggered the development of Buddhist art and monastery designs. In contrast, Susan Huntington states that this late nineteenth and early twentieth century model is increasingly questioned by the discovery of pre-Kushana era Buddha images outside the northwestern territories. Further, states Huntington, "archaeological, literary, and inscriptional evidence" such as those in Madhya Pradesh cast further doubts.&lt;ref name=huntington401&gt;Susan L. Huntington (1990), Early Buddhist Art and the Theory of Aniconism, Art Journal, Volume 49, 1990 - Issue 4: New Approaches to South Asian Art, pages 401-408&lt;/ref&gt; Devotional worship of Buddha is traceable, for example, to Bharhut Buddhist monuments dated between 2nd and 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name=huntington401/&gt; The [[Pandavleni Caves|Krishna or Kanha Cave]] (Cave 19) at Nasik has the central hall with connected cells, and it is generally dated to about the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Himanshu Prabha Ray|title=Archaeology and Buddhism in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-wrDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT66|year=2017|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-351-39432-1|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pia Brancaccio|title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C |year=2010|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-18525-9|pages=61 with footnote 80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early stone viharas mimicked the timber construction that likely preceded them.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite web

Inscriptional evidence on stone and copper plates indicate that Buddhist viharas were often co-built with Hindu and Jain temples. The [[Gupta Empire]] era witnessed the building of numerous viharas, including those at the [[Ajanta Caves]].&lt;ref name="Asher1980p15"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick M.

===Viharas as a source of major Buddhist traditions===
As more people joined Buddhist monastic ''sangha'', the senior monks adopted a code of discipline which came to be known in the [[Pali Canon]] as the Vinaya texts.&lt;ref name="Silk2008p137"/&gt; These texts are mostly concerned with the rules of the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]''. The rules are preceded by stories telling how the Buddha came to lay them down, and followed by explanations and analysis. According to the stories, the rules were devised on an ad hoc basis as the Buddha encountered various behavioral problems or disputes among his followers. Each major early Buddhist tradition had its own variant text of code of discipline for vihara life. Major vihara appointed a ''vihara-pala'', the one who managed the vihara, settled disputes, determined sangha's consent and rules, and forced those hold-outs to this consensus.&lt;ref name="Silk2008p137"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan A.

Three early influential monastic fraternities are traceable in Buddhist history.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"/&gt; The Mahavihara established by Mahinda was the oldest. Later, in 1st century BCE, King Vattagamani donated the Abhayagiri vihara to his favored monk, which led the Mahavihara fraternity to expel that monk.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"/&gt; In 3rd century CE, this repeated when King Mahasena donated the Jetavana vihara to an individual monk, which led to his expulsion. The Mahinda Mahavihara led to the orthodox Theravada tradition.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"/&gt; The Abhayagiri vihara monks, rejected and criticized by the orthodox Buddhist monks, were more receptive to heterodox ideas and they nurtured the Mahayana tradition. The Jetavana vihara monks vacillated between the two traditions, blending their ideas.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p197"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey| title= An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viharas of the Pāla era===

A range of monasteries grew up during the Pāla period in ancient Magadha (modern Bihar) and Bengal. According to Tibetan sources, five great [[mahavihara]]s stood out: [[Vikramashila]], the premier university of the era; [[Nalanda]], past its prime but still illustrious, [[Somapura Mahavihara|Somapura]], [[Odantapuri|Odantapurā]], and [[Jagaddala Mahavihara|Jagaddala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=English |first=Elizabeth |date=2002 |title=Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms |publisher=Wisdom Publications |page=15 |isbn=0-86171-329-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sukumar Dutt, the five monasteries formed a network, were supported and supervised by the Pala state. Each of the five had their own seal and operated like a corporation, serving as centers of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Sukumar |date=1962 |title=Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture |location=London |publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd |pages=352–3 |oclc=372316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable monasteries of the [[Pala Empire]] were Traikuta, Devikota (identified with ancient Kotivarsa, 'modern Bangarh'), and [[Pandit Vihara]]. Excavations jointly conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India and University of Burdwan in 1971-1972 to 1974-1975 yielded a Buddhist monastic complex at Monorampur, near Bharatpur via Panagarh Bazar in the [[Bardhaman]] district of West Bengal. The date of the monastery may be ascribed to the early medieval period. Recent excavations at [[Jagjivanpur]] (Malda district, West Bengal) revealed another Buddhist monastery (''Nandadirghika-Udranga Mahavihara'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tathyabangla.org.in/public/i_cadeprt/archeology/arch3.asp |title=Jagjivanpur, A newly discovered Buddhist site in west Bengal |publisher=Information &amp; Cultural Affairs Department, Government of West Bengal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809033739/http://www.tathyabangla.org.in/public/i_cadeprt/archeology/arch3.asp |archivedate=9 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ninth century.

Nothing of the superstructure has survived. A number of monastic cells facing a rectangular courtyard have been found. A notable feature is the presence of circular corner cells. It is believed that the general layout of the monastic complex at Jagjivanpur is by and large similar to that of Nalanda. Beside these, scattered references to some monasteries are found in epigraphic and other sources.  Among them Pullahari (in western Magadha), [[Halud Vihara]] (45&amp;nbsp;km south of Paharpur), Parikramana vihara and Yashovarmapura vihara (in Bihar) deserve mention. Other important structural complexes have been discovered at [[Mainamati]] (Comilla district, Bangladesh). Remains of quite a few viharas have been unearthed here and the most elaborate is the [[Shalban Vihara]]. The complex consists of a fairly large vihara of the usual plan of four ranges of monastic cells round a central court, with a temple in cruciform plan situated in the centre. According to a legend on a seal (discovered at the site) the founder of the monastery was [[Bhavadeva]], a ruler of the Deva dynasty.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Southeast Asia===
[[File:Chiang-Mai Thailand Wat-Chedi-Luang-01.jpg|thumb|Vihara, locally called ''wihan'', of [[Wat Chedi Luang]] in Northern [[Thailand]]]]
As Buddhism spread in southeast Asia, monasteries were built by local kings. The term ''vihara'' referred to the assembly hall of these monasteries. Many of these viharas continue to play an important role in the modern era practice of Theravada Buddhism. For example, during the twelfth lunar month in Thailand, lay Buddhists visit a monastery and circumambulate the vihara and the reliquary as a means to earn merit. Devotees may hold banana boats containing burning incense sticks, flowers, sticky rice and few coins as they complete the circle. These boats are then carried to a local river or pond and set afloat.&lt;ref name="Swearer1995p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald K.

'''''Ways of Seeing''''' is a 1972 television series of 30-minute films created chiefly by writer [[John Berger]] and producer [[Mike Dibb]]. It was broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in January 1972 and adapted into a book of the same name. 

The series was intended as a response to [[Kenneth Clark]]'s ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' series, which represents a more traditionalist view of the Western artistic and cultural canon, and the series and book criticize traditional [[Western culture|Western cultural]] [[aesthetics]] by raising questions about hidden [[ideology|ideologies]] in visual images.

{{Episode list
| EpisodeNumber   = 1
| Title           = Episode 1
| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1972|01|08|df=y}}
| ShortSummary    = The first part of the television series drew on ideas from [[Walter Benjamin]]'s ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'' arguing that through reproduction an [[Old Master]]'s painting's modern context is severed from that which existed at the time of its making.

| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1972|01|15|df=y}}
| ShortSummary    = The second film discusses the female [[Depictions of nudity|nude]]. Berger asserts that only twenty or thirty nudes in the European oil painting tradition depict a woman as herself rather than as a subject of male idealisation or desire.

{{Episode list

| Title           = Episode 4
| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1972|01|29|df=y}}
| ShortSummary    = In the fourth programme, on publicity and advertising, Berger argues that colour [[photography]] has taken over the role of oil paint, though the context is reversed. An idealised potential for the viewer (via [[consumerism|consumption]]) is considered a substitution for the actual [[reality]] depicted in old master portraits.

'''Windycon''' is a [[science fiction convention]] held in [[Lombard, Illinois]], on the weekend closest to [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]].

[[ISFiC]], the parent corporation that runs Windycon,&lt;ref name="pavlac"&gt;Pavlac, Ross, [http://www.isfic.org/WhatIs.asp What's an ISFiC], ISFiC Web Site, retrieved, 2015-11-10&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1973 in Chicago. The first Windycon was held the following year and has been held annually ever since either in Chicago or a Chicago suburb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfic.org/conspast.asp The Windycon Big List], Windycon Web Site, retrieved, 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt; It is a general interest convention.

ISFiC and Windycon were founded to raise the profile of fandom in Chicago in preparation for a [[Worldcon]] bid.&lt;ref name="pavlac"/&gt;  In 1982, Chicon IV was the result.  From its small beginnings, Windycon has grown to have an annual membership hovering around 1300.  It is the largest of the two fan-run Chicago conventions.

Annually since 1986, ISFiC has hosted a writers contest, open to unpublished authors.  The contest is judged by professional authors and editors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isfic.org/Winners.asp|title=ISFiC, Inc.:  Writers Contest Winners|website=www.isfic.org|accessdate=15 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separately, Windycon has hosted a writers' workshop under the coordination of [[Richard Chwedyk]] since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Foster | first = Adrienne | title = Next Manuscript, Please: Amazing Tales of the Worldcon Writers Workshop | newspaper = SFWA Bulletin | pages = 10  | date = August–September 2009 | accessdate = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to traditional con activities, Windycon has also run a series of on-line chats during the con, hosting by Cybling.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Janice, [http://cybling.hypermart.net/windycon/index.html Windycon 26 Chats], Cybling, retrieved, 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Janice, [http://www.cybling.com/conventions/windyconxxix/chats.html Windycon 29 Chats], Cybling, retrieved, 2007-05-19&lt;/ref&gt;
