      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8933">{{about|the representative body of the social sciences in the United Kingdom}}

The '''Academy of Social Sciences''' is a representative body for [[Social Sciences|social sciences]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The Academy promotes social science through its sponsorship of the [[Campaign for Social Science]], its links with Government on a variety of matters, and its own policy work in issuing public comment, responding to official consultations, and organising meetings and events about social science. It confers the title of Fellow upon nominated social scientists following a process of peer review. The Academy comprises over 1000 Fellows and 41 [[Learned society|learned societies]] based in the UK and Europe.

== History and structure ==
The Academy’s origins lie in the formation of a representative body for the social science learned societies in 1982, the '''Association of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences''' ('''ALSISS'''). From 1999 to 2007 it was called the Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences before changing to its current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordanwatch.co.uk/reports/details/03847936/academyofsocialsciences.html JordanWatch.uk], retrieved on 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy is run by a Council of 21 members, with Professor Roger Goodman FAcSS as its current Chair, and Professor Sir [[Ivor Crewe]] FAcSS, Master of [[University College, Oxford]], as its current President. 7 Council members are elected by the Academy’s Fellows, 7 by its Learned Societies and 7 are appointed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://acss.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Academy-of-Social-Sciences-Memorandum-and-Articles-of-Association-amended-March-2013.pdf Academy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
The Academy advocates social science by interacting with Government and other organisations, and co-ordinates the responses of social scientists to Government consultation documents. Past consultations include:

* Independent Review of Implementation of [[RCUK]] Policy on Open Access.
* [[Public Administration Select Committee]] Enquiry on 'Building Civil service Skills for the Future'
* The [[Office for National Statistics]] consultation on the future of the Census &lt;ref&gt;[http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/consultation-responses/ Academy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy also puts forward suggestions to the Government about which social scientists should carry out its Foresight research projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/ BIS website]&lt;/ref&gt; which look at important issues and how these might change over the next 20 to 80 years.

A developing part of the Academy’s work is to bring researchers and organisations using research closer together to improve the evidence upon which public policy is based and to increase the impact of research.

== Publications and events ==
The Academy has produced a series of [http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/making-the-case/ ‘Making the Case for the Social Sciences’] booklets which give examples of important social science research which has made a difference to policy or practice. These are: Wellbeing; Ageing; Sustainability; the Environment and Climate Change; Crime; Sport and Leisure; Management; Scotland; Longitudinal Studies, Mental Wellbeing, Wales and Dementia. Further titles are in preparation. The Academy also publishes a cross-disciplinary peer-reviewed journal, [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoc21/current#.Uo34U9K9lA0 ''Contemporary Social Science'']. The Academy holds regular events, such as conferences on the ethics of social media research and the future of the [[Research Excellence Framework]]. It holds an Annual Lecture each summer, and its President's Lunch each winter. It also arranges (with the [[British Library]]) a public lecture series Enduring Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/socsci/events/socscievents.html | title=Social sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fellows==
{{main|Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences}}
Part of the Academy’s work is to recognise social scientists who are held in esteem by their peer group and whose life and work have had an impact in advancing social science. They are nominated and the nominations are then subject to peer review. Fellows are academics, policy-makers and practitioners, and are entitled to use the letters "FAcSS" after their name. In November 2014 there were 1000 Fellows, just over 1% of the 90,000 total membership of the 41 learned society members of the Academy.

Fellows were previously known as Academicians and used the post-nominal letter "AcSS". This was changed in July 2014 to bring the Academy in line with other British [[learned societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academicians now 'Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences'|url=http://acss.org.uk/news/academicians-now-fellows-academy-social-science/|website=News|publisher=Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=4 September 2014|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign for Social Science ==
The Academy launched the [[Campaign for Social Science]] in January 2011 to advocate social science to Government and the general public. The Campaign is self-funded. It has campaigned for the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Scientific Adviser,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/mar/19/the-case-for-a-chief-social-scientist Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes social science in the media and on the web, and organises roadshows around the country to emphasise the value and importance of social science.

'''Advance Concrete''' is a [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software application was developed by [[GRAITEC]], but is now an [[Autodesk]] product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/corporate-sustainability/autodesk-signs-agreement-acquire-structural-fabrication-and-d|title=Autodesk Signs Agreement to Acquire Structural Fabrication and Detailing Technology from Graitec|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222090251/http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/corporate-sustainability/autodesk-signs-agreement-acquire-structural-fabrication-and-d|archivedate=2015-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for  [[3D modeling|modeling]] and detailing [[reinforced concrete|reinforced concrete structures]]. Advance Concrete is used in the structural / civil engineering and drafting fields.

==Features==
[[File:AC-structure.png|right|thumb|Building with two floors, with stairs, modeled in Advance Concrete.]]
Advance Concrete is specifically designed for engineers and structural draftsmen looking for comprehensive and easy to use software, including its own graphics engine allowing it to run with or without [[AutoCAD]].

The application can be used for modeling and detailing different types of concrete structures, such as buildings, [[precast concrete]] elements, and also for [[civil engineering]] designs.

Advance Concrete uses AutoCAD technology: [[ObjectARX]]. This technology provides users with professional objects (beams, columns, slabs, bars, frames, stirrup bars) integrated into AutoCAD and on which most basic AutoCAD functions can be applied (stretch, shorten, copy, move). The Advance Concrete native file is the [[.dwg|DWG]] file.

The main functions of Advance Concrete concern:
* 2D / [[3D modeling]] of concrete structures;
* Automated [[Engineering drawing|drawings]], with tools for automatic creation of sections, elevations, foundations, isometric views, etc.;
* Advanced [[reinforcement]], with automatic creation and update functionalities and also with manual input tools;
* Creation of paper drawings;
* Automatic [[bill of materials]].
* Multi-user modeling. Users can securely and simultaneously work on the same project through a shared database that stores the model data.

The program provides a working environment for creating 3D structural models from which drawings are created. The 3D model is created using Advance Concrete specific objects (structural elements, openings, [[rebars]], etc.) and stored in a drawing (in [[.dwg|DWG]] format). Once a model is complete, Advance Concrete creates all structural and reinforcement drawings using a large selection of tools for view creation, dimensions, interactive annotations, symbols, markings and [[automatic layout]] functions. Advance Concrete provides functionalities for automatic drawing updates based on model modifications.

===Specific functionalities===
[[File:AC-ReinfView.png|right|thumb|Reinforcement drawing created in Advance Concrete.]]
One of the features of Advance Concrete is the “dynamic reinforcement” technology for the rapid reinforcement of concrete elements taking into account their context (type, parameters, connection with other elements).
The user creates a so-called dynamic reinforcement solution that integrates the reinforcement cage elements and properties: geometric information, local rules and standards for [[steel grade]], reinforcement bar placement, [[concrete cover]], etc. The reinforcement solutions can be used later for elements that have different sizes. The reinforcement elements adjust to the new dimensions and are taken into account at reinforcement drawing creation and lists.
The user can save the reinforcement solution in an external file, which can be exchanged, downloaded, reused in any other projects etc.

== Software compatibility ==
The application is compatible with the following operating systems and Autodesk platforms: 
* [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows XP]] Pro and [[Windows 7]] (32 and 64 bits)
* AutoCAD 2007, 2008, 2009 32 and 64 bits, 2010 32 and 64 bits 
* ADT 2007,
* AutoCAD Architecture 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.

== Software interoperability ==
Advance Concrete integrates GRAITEC’s “GTC” (GRAITEC Transfer Center) technology, a [[data synchronization]] technology that allows:
*Importing / exporting data to other GRAITEC software and standard formats ([[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] 2.×3)
*Several Advance Concrete users working simultaneously on the same project and synchronizing their models
*Synchronizing in Advance Concrete the modifications made by engineers in other GRAITEC software applications (e.g., section changes, addition of structural elements, etc.).
GTC is the GRAITEC solution for CAD/Design software interoperability and integration specialized in creating and handling a BIM (Building Information Model).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26342">'''Ancestral sequence reconstruction''' ('''ASR''') – also known as '''ancestral gene'''/'''sequence reconstruction'''/'''resurrection''' – is a technique used in the study of [[molecular evolution]]. The method consists of the synthesis of an ancestral [[gene]] and expression of the corresponding ancestral [[protein]].&lt;ref name=thornton/&gt; The idea of protein 'resurrection' was suggested in 1963 by Pauling and Zuckerkandl.&lt;ref&gt;Pauling, L. &amp; Zuckerkandl, E. Chemical paleogenetics: molecular restoration studies of extinct forms of life. Acta Chem. Scand. supl. 17, S9–S16 (1963) [http://actachemscand.dk/volume.php?select1=3&amp;vol=1017 Acta Chemica Scandinavica Online Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Some early efforts were made in the eighties-nineties, led by the laboratory of [[Steven A. Benner]], showing the potential of this technique – one that only started to be fulfilled in the post-genomic era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jermann | first1 = TM | last2 = Opitz | first2 = JG | last3 = Stackhouse | first3 = J | last4 = Benner | first4 = SA | date = Mar 1995 | title = Reconstructing the evolutionaryhistory of the artiodactyl ribonuclease superfamily | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 374 | issue = 6517| pages = 57–9 | doi = 10.1038/374057a0 | pmid = 7532788 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the improvement of algorithms and of better sequencing and synthesis techniques, the method was developed further in the early 2000s to allow the resurrection of a greater variety of and much more ancient genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thornton | first1 = JW | last2 = Need | first2 = E | last3 = Crews | first3 = D | date = Sep 2003 | title = Resurrecting the ancestral steroid receptor:ancient origin of estrogen signaling | url = | journal = Science | volume = 301 | issue = 5640| pages = 1714–7 | pmid = 14500980 | doi=10.1126/science.1086185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last decade, ancestral protein resurrection has developed as a strategy to reveal the mechanisms and dynamics of protein evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Helen (March 21, 2012) "[http://www.nature.com/news/prehistoric-proteins-raising-the-dead-1.10261 Prehistoric proteins: raising the dead]" Nature (London)&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike conventional evolutionary and biochemical approaches to studying proteins, i.e. the so-called ''horizontal'' comparison of related protein [[Sequence homology|homologues]] from different branch ends of the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]; ASR probes the statistically inferred ancestral proteins within the nodes of the tree – in a ''vertical'' manner (see diagram, right). This approach gives access to protein properties that may have transiently arisen over evolutionary time and has recently been used as a way to infer the potential [[Evolutionary pressure|selection pressures]] that resulted in the present day sequences seen today. ASR has been used to probe the causative mutation that resulted in a protein's [[neofunctionalization]] after duplication by first determining that said mutation was located between ancestors '5' and '4' on the diagram (illustratively) using functional assays.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Douglas P.|last2=Whitney|first2=Dustin S.|last3=Hanson-Smith|first3=Victor|last4=Woznica|first4=Arielle|last5=Campodonico-Burnett|first5=William|last6=Volkman|first6=Brian F.|last7=King|first7=Nicole|last8=Thornton|first8=Joseph W.|last9=Prehoda|first9=Kenneth E.|date=2016-01-07|title=Evolution of an ancient protein function involved in organized multicellularity in animals|journal=eLife|volume=5|pages=e10147|doi=10.7554/eLife.10147|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4718807|pmid=26740169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of protein [[biophysics]], ASR has also been used to study the development of a protein's thermodynamic and kinetic landscapes over evolutionary time as well as protein folding pathways by combining many modern day analytical techniques such as [[Protein mass spectrometry|HX/MS]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; These sort of insights are typically inferred from several ancestors reconstructed along a phylogeny – referring to the previous analogy, by studying nodes ''higher and higher'' (further and further back in evolutionary time) within the tree of life.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harms|first=Michael J.|last2=Thornton|first2=Joseph W.|date=2013-08-01|title=Evolutionary biochemistry: revealing the historical and physical causes of protein properties|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v14/n8/full/nrg3540.html|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=14|issue=8|pages=559–571|doi=10.1038/nrg3540|issn=1471-0056|pmc=4418793|pmid=23864121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ASR studies are conducted ''in vitro'', and have revealed ancestral protein properties that seem to be evolutionarily desirable traits – such as increased thermostability, catalytic activity and catalytic promiscuity. These data have been accredited to artifacts of the ASR algorithms, as well as indicative illustrations of ancient Earth's environment – often, ASR research must be complemented with extensive controls (usually alternate ASR experiments) to mitigate algorithmic error. It should also be noted that not all studied ASR proteins exhibit this so-called 'ancestral superiority'.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Shion A.|last2=Hart|first2=Kathryn M.|last3=Harms|first3=Michael J.|last4=Marqusee|first4=Susan|date=2016-11-15|title=Evolutionary trend toward kinetic stability in the folding trajectory of RNases H|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=113|issue=46|pages=13045–13050|doi=10.1073/pnas.1611781113|issn=1091-6490|pmc=5135364|pmid=27799545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nascent field of '[[Biochemistry|evolutionary biochemistry]]' has been bolstered by the recent increase in ASR studies using the ancestors as ways to probe organismal fitness within certain cellular contexts – effectively testing ancestral proteins ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Due to inherent limitations in these sorts of studies – primarily being the lack of suitably ancient genomes to fit these ancestors in to, the small repertoire of well categorised laboratory model systems, and the inability to mimic ancient cellular environments; very few ASR studies ''in vivo'' have been conducted. Despite the above mentioned obstacles, preliminary insights into this avenue of research from a 2015 paper, have revealed that observed 'ancestral superiority' ''in vitro'' were not recapitulated ''in vivo'' of a given protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Joanne K.|last2=Prentice|first2=Erica J.|last3=Groussin|first3=Mathieu|last4=Arcus|first4=Vickery L.|date=2015-10-01|title=Reconstructed Ancestral Enzymes Impose a Fitness Cost upon Modern Bacteria Despite Exhibiting Favourable Biochemical Properties|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Reconstructed+Ancestral+Enzymes+Impose+a+Fitness+Cost+upon+Modern+Bacteria+Despite+Exhibiting+Favourable+Biochemical+Properties|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|volume=81|issue=3-4|pages=110–120|doi=10.1007/s00239-015-9697-5|issn=1432-1432|pmid=26349578}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASR presents one of a few mechanisms to study biochemistry of the [[Precambrian]] era of life (&gt;541[[Millions of years ago|Ma]]) and is hence often used in '[[paleogenetics]]'; indeed Zuckerandl and Pauling originally intended ASR to be the starting point of a field they termed 'Paleobiochemistry'.

==Methodology==

Several related homologues of the protein of interest are selected and aligned in a [[multiple sequence alignment]] (MSA), a '[[phylogenetic tree]]' is constructed with statistically inferred sequences at the nodes of the branches. It is these sequences that are the so-called 'ancestors' – the process of synthesising the corresponding DNA, transforming it into a cell and producing a protein is the so-called 'reconstruction'. Ancestral sequences are typically calculated by [[maximum likelihood]], however [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] methods are also implemented. Because the ancestors are inferred from a phylogeny, the topology and composition of the phylogeny plays a major role in the output ASR sequences. Given that there is much discourse and debate over how to construct phylogenies – for example whether or not thermophilic bacteria are basal or derivative in bacterial evolution – many ASR papers construct several phylogenies with differing topologies and hence differing ASR sequences. These sequences are then compared and often several (~10) are expressed and studied per phylogenetic node. It should be noted that ASR does not claim to recreate the actual sequence of the ancient protein/DNA, but rather a sequence that is likely to be similar to the one that was indeed at the node. This is not considered a shortcoming of ASR as it fits into the '[[Neutral network (evolution)|neutral network]]' model of protein evolution, whereby at evolutionary junctions (nodes) a population of genotypically different but phenotypically similar protein sequences existed in the extant organismal population. Hence, it is possible that ASR would generate one of the sequences of a node's neutral network and while it may not represent the genotype of the last common ancestor of the modern day sequences, it does likely represent the phenotype.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; This is supported by the modern day observation that many mutations in a protein's non-catalytic/functional site cause minor changes in biophysical properties. Hence, ASR allows one to probe the biophysical properties of past proteins and is indicative of ancient genetics.

Maximum likelihood (ML) methods work by generating a sequence where the residue at each position is predicted to be the most likely to occupy said position by the method of inference used – typically this is a [[Position weight matrix|scoring matrix]] (similar to those used in [[BLAST]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or MSAs) calculated from extant sequences. Alternate methods include [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|maximum parsimony]] (MP) that construct a sequence based on a model of sequence evolution – usually the idea that the minimum number of nucleotidal sequence changes represents the most efficient route for evolution to take and by [[Occam's razor]] is the most likely. MP is often considered the least reliable method for reconstruction as it arguably oversimplifies evolution to a degree that is not applicable on the billion year scale. Another method involves the consideration of residue uncertainty – so-called Bayesian methods – this form of ASR is sometimes used to compliment ML methods but typically produces more ambiguous sequences. In ASR, the term 'ambiguity' refers to residue positions where no clear substitution can be predicted – often in these cases, several ASR sequences are produced, encompassing most of the ambiguities and compared to one-another. ML ASR often needs complimenting experiments to indicate that the derived sequences are more than just consensuses of the input sequences. This is particularly necessary in the observation of 'Ancestral Superiority'.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Lucas C.|last2=Lim|first2=Shion A.|last3=Marqusee|first3=Susan|last4=Harms|first4=Michael J.|date=2016-06-01|title=The thermostability and specificity of ancient proteins|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume=38|pages=37–43|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2016.05.015|issn=1879-033X|pmc=5010474|pmid=27288744}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the trend of increasing thermostability, one explanation is that ML ASR creates a consensus sequence of several different, parallel mechanisms evolved to confer minor protein thermostability throughout the phylogeny – leading to an additive effect resulting in 'superior' ancestral thermostability.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Risso|first=Valeria A.|last2=Gavira|first2=Jose A.|last3=Sanchez-Ruiz|first3=Jose M.|date=2014-06-01|title=Thermostable and promiscuous Precambrian proteins|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.12319/abstract|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1485–1489|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12319|issn=1462-2920}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of consensus sequences and parallel ASR via non-ML methods are often required to disband this theory per experiment. One other concern raised by ML methods is that the scoring matrices are derived from modern sequences and particular amino acid frequencies seen today may not be the same as in Precambrian biology, resulting in skewed sequence inference. Several studies have attempted to construct ancient scoring matrices via various methodologies and have compared the resultant sequences and their protein's biophysical properties. While these modified sequences result in somewhat different ASR sequences, the observed biophysical properties did not seem to vary outside from experimental error.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaucher|first=Eric A.|last2=Govindarajan|first2=Sridhar|last3=Ganesh|first3=Omjoy K.|date=2008-02-07|title=Palaeotemperature trend for Precambrian life inferred from resurrected proteins|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7179/abs/nature06510.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=451|issue=7179|pages=704–707|doi=10.1038/nature06510|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the 'holistic' nature of ASR and the intense complexity that arises when one considers all the possible sources of experimental error – the experimental community considers the ultimate measurement of ASR reliability to be the comparison of several alternate ASR reconstructions of the same node and the identification of similar biophysical properties. While this method does not offer a robust statistical, mathematical measure of reliability it does build off of the fundamental idea used in ASR that individual amino acid substitutions do not cause significant biophysical property changes in a protein – a tenant that must be held true in order to be able to overcome the effect of inference ambiguity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ancestral-sequence-reconstruction-9780199299188?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction|date=2007-07-26|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199299188|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates used for ASR are often selected based on the particular property of interest being studied – e.g. thermostability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By selecting sequences from either end of a property's range (e.g., psychrophilic proteins and thermophilic proteins) but ''within'' a protein family, ASR can be used to probe the specific sequence changes that conferred the observed biophysical effect – such as stabilising interactions. Consider in the diagram, if sequence 'A' encoded a protein that was optimally functional at neutral pHs and 'D' in acidic conditions, sequence changes between '5' and '2' may illustrate the precise biophysical explanation for this difference. It should be noted that as ASR experiments can extract ancestors that are likely billions of years old, there are often tens if not hundreds of sequence changes between ancestors themselves and ancestors and extant sequences – because of this, such sequence-function evolutionary studies can take a lot of work and rational direction.&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thornton | first1 = J.W. | year = 2004 | title = Resurrecting ancient genes: experimental analysis of extinct molecules | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 366–375 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1324 | pmid=15143319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v5/n5/fig_tab/nrg1324_F1.html#figure-title Figure 1] from reference {{Cite journal|last=Harms|first=Michael J.|last2=Thornton|first2=Joseph W.|date=2013-08-01|title=Evolutionary biochemistry: revealing the historical and physical causes of protein properties|url=|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=14|issue=8|pages=559–571|doi=10.1038/nrg3540|issn=|pmc=4418793|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurrected proteins==
There are many examples of ancestral proteins that have been computationally reconstructed, expressed in living cell lines, and – in many cases – purified and biochemically studied.

It should be noted that the 'age' of a reconstructed sequence is determined using a [[molecular clock]] model, and often several are employed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battistuzzi|first=Fabia U|last2=Feijao|first2=Andreia|last3=Hedges|first3=S Blair|date=2004-11-09|title=A genomic timescale of prokaryote evolution: insights into the origin of methanogenesis, phototrophy, and the colonization of land|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=4|pages=44|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-44|issn=1471-2148|pmc=533871|pmid=15535883}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dating technique is often calibrated using geological time-points (such as ancient ocean constituents or [[Banded iron formation|BIF]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) and while these clocks offer the only method of inferring a very ancient protein's age, they have sweeping error margins and are diffuclt to defend against contrary data. To this end, ASR 'age' should really be only used as an indicative feature and is often surpassed altogether for a measurement of the number of substitutions between the ancestral and the modern sequences (the fundiment on which the clock is calculated).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That being said, the use of a clock allows one to compare observed biophysical data of an ASR protein to the geological or ecological environment at the time. For example, ASR studies on bacterial [[EF-Tu]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (proteins involved in [[Translation (biology)|translation]], that are likely rarely subject to [[Horizontal gene transfer|HGT]] and typically exhibit [[Protein melting temperature|Tms]] ~2C greater than [[Environmental growth temperature|Tenv]]) indicate a hotter Precambrian earth which fits very closely with geological data on ancient earth ocean temperatures based on [[Oxygen-18]] isotopic levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ASR studies of yeast Adhs reveal that the emergence of [[Subfunctionalization|subfunctionalized]] Adhs for ethanol metabolism (not just waste excretion) arose at a time similar to the dawn of fleshy fruit in the [[Cambrian]] era and that before this emergence, Adh served to excrete ethanol as a byproduct of excess [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of a clock also perhaps indicates that the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] occurred before the earliest molecular fossils indicate (&gt;4.1Ga), but given the debatable reliability of molecular clocks, such observations should be taken with caution.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Boehnke|first2=Patrick|last3=Harrison|first3=T.

==Significance==

These experiments address various important questions in evolutionary biology: does [[evolution]] proceed in small steps or in large leaps; is evolution reversible; how does [[Evolution of biological complexity|complexity]] evolve? It has been shown that slight [[mutations]] in the amino acid sequence of hormone receptors determine an important change in their preferences for hormones. These changes mean huge steps in the evolution of the [[endocrine system]]. Thus very small changes at the molecular level may have enormous consequences. The Thornton lab has also been able to show that evolution is irreversible studying the [[glucocorticoid receptor]]. This receptor was changed by seven mutations in a cortisol receptor, but reversing these mutations didn't give the original receptor back. Indicating that [[epistasis]] plays a major role in protein evolution – an observation that in combination with the observations of several examples of parallel evolution, support the neutral network model mentioned above.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Other earlier [[neutral mutation]]s acted as a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]] and made the changes to the receptor irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bridgham | first1 = JT | last2 = Ortlund | first2 = EA | last3 = Thornton | first3 = JW | year = 2009 | title = An epistatic ratchet constrains the direction of glucocorticoid receptor evolution | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = | pages = 515–519 | doi = 10.1038/nature08249 | pmid=19779450}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different experiments on receptors show that, during their evolution, proteins are greatly differentiated and this explains how complexity may evolve. A closer look at the different ancestral hormone receptors and the various [[hormone]]s shows that at the level of interaction between single amino acid residues and chemical groups of the hormones arise by very small but specific changes. Knowledge about these changes may for example lead to the synthesis of hormonal equivalents capable of mimicking or inhibiting the action of a hormone, which might open possibilities for new therapies.

Given that ASR has revealed a tendency towards ancient thermostability and enzymatic promiscuity, ASR poses as a valuable tool for [[Protein engineering|protein engineers]] who often desire these traits (producing effects sometimes greater than current, rationally lead tools).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; ASR also promises to 'resurrect' phenotipically similar 'ancient organisms' which in turn would allow evolutionary biochemists to probe the story of life. Proponents of ASR such as Benner state that through these and other experiments, the end of the current century will see a level of understanding in biology analogous to the one that arose in classical chemistry in the last century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{about|the entertainment industry|the concept of ancillary markets in power systems|ancillary services (electric power)}}

'''Ancillary markets''' are non-theatrical markets for [[feature films]], like [[home video]], television, [[Pay Per View]], [[Video on demand|VOD]], Internet streaming, airlines and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://indieranch.com/distribute.html |title=Knowing your audience is one thing, reaching them is another. |first=Yuri |last=Koll |work=indieranch.com |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maccs.com/non-theatrical |title=MACCS International Theatrical Film Distribution Software |accessdate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109215530/http://www.maccs.com/non-theatrical |archivedate=January 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Before television, studios played their films in theaters exclusively. However, in 1950 many studios began to sell all their pre-1948 features to television syndicators. The television syndicators then would use these films to fill in their programming schedules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Criticism-Ideology/Distribution-ANCILLARY-MARKETS.html |title=Ancillary markets - Distribution |first= |last= |work=filmreference.com |year=2013 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the 1960s, the first domestic ancillary market for feature films was created. NBC was the first to practice the market on September 23, 1961 by programming "NBC Saturday Night at the Movies." After such success, ABC became the second network ever to program a series of prime time features in 1962. One of the other networks, CBS, followed and added a prime time feature program in 1965.

Today, feature films opens in motion picture theaters to establish its box-office value. After that is established, it is then released to ancillary markets in a particular order as follows:

* Video and [[Pay Per View]] (PPV)
* Premium cable services such as HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax
* Cable television
* Network television
* Television syndication

The sequence is to maximize the full economic potential of each market.

==VCR==
Home video recorders were made public when Sony introduced the half-inch Betamax cassette in 1975. Following Betamax, the company JVC introduced the Video Home System (VHS).  Marketed by RCA and manufactured by Matsushita, VHS soon became known as the video-cassette recorders (VCRs). VCRs, which gave the consumer the option of recording programs from television, were a new form of competition in the demanding consumer market. VCRs revenue contributed to the development of the ancillary market of video and DVD. By the 1980s, five million households owned VCRs. Major studios had not yet adapted to the new video technologies that were being developed for consumers. There were no anticipations of new markets or other opportunities to expand until an entrepreneur, Andre Blay, opened Hollywood film companies’ eyes. Blay wanted the license to transfer and sell their films on tape.  After he succeeded and his approach was beneficial, film companies all around became a part of the video distribution. The film companies could not deny the fact that this new distribution would lead to a new revenue stream.&lt;ref&gt;P., McDonald &amp; J., Wasko. The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD==
As the VHS market saturated, multiple media executives and manufacturers liked the idea of utilizing other home video technologies. In 1993, the film industry upgraded their technology with the creation of several new formats including the DVD, or digital video disc. Many manufacturers such as the Japanese (Hitachi, JVC, Matsushita, Mitsubishi, Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba) and the European (Philips and Thomson) collaborated to facilitate development of the DVD Forum. In March 1997, the US launch of the DVD systems went smoothly due to Hollywood's solidarity. Manufacturers and film studios decided to avoid making the same mistake of the VHS format battles and agreed upon a universal standard of cooperation. When first introduced in 1997, DVDs sold at the low price of $20, for which they offered high-quality image and extra special features. Consumers liked the advantages of the DVDs and soon surpassed VHS sales.&lt;ref&gt;Wasser, Frederick.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video and DVD: Hollywood Retools". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premium television==

The first premium rate television services were [[Phonevision]], [[Telemeter (pay television)|Telemeter]], SubscriberVision, among others. None of them were successful, until the launch of Home Box Office ([[HBO]]) in 1972, considered the first successful premium-rate subscription television service. Other services were launched: [[Z Channel]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[The Movie Channel]], [[Cinemax]], [[Spotlight (TV channel)|Spotlight]] and [[Home Theater Network]]. Only Showtime, The Movie Channel and Cinemax survived through the 1980s. These premium rate services air features unedited, uncut, and commercial-free, the same way they were shown on theaters and/or home video.

==Cable television==
{{Empty section|date=June 2011}}

==Network television==
Out of the many ancillary markets out there, none were more effective and revenue rewarding than network television, and eventually syndication began. [[Amanda D. Lotz]] spoke on the radical change in her book titled ''Television Will Be Revolutionized (2008)."
She mentions how time went on and as the post-network era developed, that the limited ways there were for medium to be distributed was eliminated. What was expanding, and evolving was network television as a whole.&lt;Lotz 85&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lotz|first=Amanda|title=Television Will be Revolutionized|year=2007|publisher=NYU Press|pages=86|url=http://cinema.usc.edu/archivedassets/096/15646.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&gt; At first channels were few, and very limited. But soon came the multi-channel transition, then on with the creation of cable TV. As that later expended cable began to see the 'cash cow' in that and began selling shares to different networks in order to air their studio programs. Not only did Network Television open up ancillary markets for TV, but other markets as well. The VCR then became a hot commodity, because the consumer wanted the option of recording. That slowly transitioned to the DVD that took out the VCR, and finally DVR. Which seems to be just that, a VCR and a DVD combined. Network television took a gigantic step when it later allowed programs to have different showing dates, and even multiple air times. This offered different networks to still be able to ear revenue off of an older film that already has left the box office.

==Making Television Safe for Film==

According to McDonald and Wasko, Hollywood's interest in emerging medium of television dates from the 1920s and includes experiments with the developing technology, an alternative model of television as home theater, applications for television frequencies, as well as investments in broadcasting companies that were exploring television (Anderson, 1994; Hilmes, 1990; Wasko, 1994). The evidence suggests that studios clearly wanted to control the development and implementation of television technology. Securing that control required the assistance of the Federal Communication Commission, which regulated television's development by articulating technical standards and operating rules and through the FCC's exclusive right to license the use of television frequencies for experimentation or broadcast (McDonald and Wasko, p.&amp;nbsp;107).

==Video games==
Video games are a rapidly growing ancillary market for feature films. Video game over-all gross income has consistently surpassed that of movie sales since 2004. Because of the increased interest in video games many major media and communication companies have begun to show interest in video games as a way to market, brand, and advertise for their product.  Some movies that have benefited from this are the ''Harry Potter'', ''Lord of the Rings'', and ''James Bond'' series. Because the video game industry has been able to outplay and outgross many movies, video game manufacturers are beginning to look in the direction of producing their own movies as well. Microsoft's producers of ''Halo'' have decided to pass Hollywood studios and produce their own movie.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 132-133&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollywood has shown interest in the video game industry as an ancillary market almost as far as video games have existed. The film industry's goal within the video game industry is to either seek control and therefore ownership of the video game market or to license products to video game producers. Once the video game profits are high, that is when Hollywood seeks control. On the other hand, when profits are down, that is when Hollywood offers the licensing. The collaboration had always been problematic since the film industry had been uncertain about the development of video games. Hollywood has seen video games as another promotional scheme for a film.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Randy.(2008) "Ancillary Markets - Video Games: Promises and Challenges of an Emerging Industry". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recorded Music==
Hollywood has had interactions with the recorded music industry that dates back as far as the studio system itself.  The interactions between the two include three main periods; 1927-1957: recorded music as a form of promotion, 1957-1977: recorded music as cross-promotion and ancillary revenue, and 1977-1997: recorded music as cross-promotion, ancillary revenue stream, and means of spreading risk.
In addition to music's promotional value, studios realized that, "A chart success was an effective way of generating additional revenue for their companies, both in terms of publishing and performance royalties and, of course, in outright sales."  Recorded music proved to be of great value as an ancillary market to the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Hollywood Film Industry|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=978-1-4051-3388-3|pages=143–151|author=Smith, Jeff|authorlink=Ancillary Markets-Recorded Music: Charting the Rise and Fall of the Soundtrack Album|editor=McDonald &amp; Wasko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">'''Animal protectionism''' is a position within [[animal rights]] theory that favors incremental change in pursuit of non-human animal interests. It is contrasted with [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]], the position that human beings have no moral right to use animals, and ought to have no legal right, no matter how the animals are treated.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;Introduction, Francione and Garner 2010, pp. x–xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal protectionists agree with abolitionists that the [[animal welfare]] model of animal protection—whereby animals may be used as food, clothing, entertainment and in experiments so long as their suffering is regulated—has failed ethically and politically, but argue that its philosophy can be reformulated. [[Robert Garner]] of the University of Leicester, a leading academic protectionist, argues that animal use may in some circumstances be justified, though it should be better regulated, and that the pursuit of better treatment and incremental change is consistent with holding an abolitionist ideology. [[Gary Francione]], professor of law at Rutgers School of Law-Newark and a leading abolitionist, calls this approach "new welfarism." He regards it as counter-productive because it wrongly persuades the public that the animals they use are being treated kindly, and that continued use is therefore justifiable.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; Francione regards the abolitionist position as the only one that can properly be called [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Francione, Gary. "The Abolition of Animal Exploitation," in Francione and Garner 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__

==Arguments==
One of the arguments put forward by [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionists]] against protectionism is that small improvements in animal welfare serve to salve consciences by persuading the public that their use of animals is not unethical. Welfare reform can therefore be counter-productive. Abolitionists also argue that real reform is invariably unsuccessful, because industries that depend on animal use will not implement change that harms their profit margin. That is, the property status of animals prohibits reform that will harm their owners' interests. For that reason, abolitionists argue, it is the property status of animals that must be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Robert. "A Defense of a Broad Animal Protectionism," in Francione and Garner 2010, pp. 120–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Garner argues against this that welfare reform is not simply a staging post on the way to abolition, but is in itself desirable. An approach that is based on the right of animals not to suffer could, in theory, be satisfied with a welfare system in which animal suffering, if not animal use, was minimized, though he concedes that this is unlikely. He also argues that Francione has not shown that improvements in welfare persuade the public that all is well. Rather, he argues, reform has the effect of raising public consciousness about the interests of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Garner 2010, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Can't see where she says this: Lisa Kemmerer argues that animal protectionism is, more broadly, "any ideology or behavior intended to protect nonhuman animals from human beings".&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Kemmerer. ''In Search of Consistency: Ethics And Animals''. Leiden: Brill, 2006, pp. xvi, 542.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

'''Time stretching''' is the process of changing the speed or duration of an [[audio signal processing|audio signal]] without affecting its [[pitch (music)|pitch]].

'''Pitch scaling''' or '''pitch shifting''' is the opposite: the process of changing the pitch without affecting the speed. Similar methods can change speed, pitch, or both at once, in a time-varying way.

These processes are used, for instance, to match the pitches and tempos of two pre-recorded clips for mixing when the clips cannot be reperformed or resampled. They are also used to create effects such as increasing the range of an instrument (like pitch shifting a guitar down an octave).

==Resampling==
The simplest way to change the duration or pitch of a [[digital audio]] clip is through [[sample rate conversion]]. This is a mathematical operation that effectively rebuilds a continuous waveform from its samples and then samples that waveform again at a different rate. When the new samples are played at the original sampling frequency, the audio clip sounds faster or slower. Unfortunately, the frequencies in the sample are always scaled at the same rate as the speed, transposing its perceived pitch up or down in the process. In other words, slowing down the recording lowers the pitch, speeding it up raises the pitch. This is analogous to speeding up or slowing down an [[analog signal|analogue]] recording, like a [[phonograph record]] or [[Sound recording#Magnetic Recording|tape]], creating [[Alvin and the Chipmunks#Recording technique|the Chipmunk effect]]. Using this method the two effects cannot be separated.  A drum track containing no pitched instruments can be moderately sample rate converted for tempo without adverse effects, but a pitched track cannot.

== Time domain ==

=== SOLA ===
{{See also|PSOLA}}

[[Rabiner]] and Schafer in 1978 put forth an alternate solution that works in the [[time domain]]: attempt to find the [[periodic signal|period]] (or equivalently the [[fundamental frequency]]) of a given section of the wave using some [[pitch detection algorithm]] (commonly the peak of the signal's [[autocorrelation]], or sometimes [[cepstrum|cepstral]] processing), and [[fade (audio engineering)|crossfade]] one period into another.

This is called [[time-domain harmonic scaling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = David Malah
 |date=April 1979
 | title = Time-domain algorithms for harmonic bandwidth reduction and time scaling of speech signals

}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the synchronized overlap-add method (SOLA) and performs somewhat faster than the phase vocoder on slower machines but fails when the autocorrelation mis-estimates the period of a signal with complicated harmonics (such as [[orchestra]]l pieces).

[[Adobe Audition]] (formerly Cool Edit Pro) seems to solve this by looking for the period closest to a center period that the user specifies, which should be an integer multiple of the tempo, and between 30 [[hertz|Hz]] and the lowest bass frequency.

This is much more limited in scope than the phase vocoder based processing, but can be made much less processor intensive, for real-time applications. It provides the most coherent results{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} for single-pitched sounds like voice or musically monophonic instrument recordings.

High-end commercial audio processing packages either combine the two techniques (for example by separating the signal into sinusoid and transient waveforms), or use other techniques based on the [[wavelet]] transform, or artificial neural network processing{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}, producing the highest-quality time stretching.

=== Frame-based approach ===
[[File:GeneralizedPrinciple TSM.png|thumb|300x300px|Frame-based approach of many TSM procedures]]

In order to preserve an audio signal's pitch when stretching or compressing its duration, many time-scale modification (TSM) procedures follow a frame-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Jonathan Driedger and Meinard Müller
 | title = A Review of Time-Scale Modification of Music Signals
 | url = http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/6/2/57
 | journal = Applied Sciences
 | volume = 6
 | issue = 2
 | pages = 57
 | year = 2016
 | doi=10.3390/app6020057
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given an original discrete-time audio signal, this strategy's first step is to split the signal 
into short ''analysis frames'' of fixed length.
The analysis frames are spaced by a fixed number of samples, called the ''analysis hopsize'' &lt;math&gt;H_a\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
To achieve the actual time-scale modification, the analysis frames are then temporally relocated
to have a ''synthesis hopsize'' &lt;math&gt;H_s\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
This frame relocation results in a modification of the signal's duration by a ''stretching factor'' of
&lt;math&gt;\alpha=H_s/H_a&lt;/math&gt;.
However, simply superimposing the unmodified analysis frames typically results in undesired artifacts
such as phase discontinuities or amplitude fluctuations.
To prevent these kinds of artifacts, the analysis frames are adapted to form ''synthesis frames'', prior to
the reconstruction of the time-scale modified output signal.

The strategy of how to derive the synthesis frames from the analysis frames is a key difference among
different TSM procedures.

== Frequency domain ==

=== Phase vocoder ===
{{Main|Phase vocoder}}
One way of stretching the length of a signal without affecting the pitch is to build a [[phase vocoder]] after Flanagan, Golden, and Portnoff.

Basic steps:
#compute the instantaneous frequency/amplitude relationship of the signal using the [[Short-time Fourier transform|STFT]], which is the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of a short, overlapping and smoothly windowed block of samples;
#apply some processing to the Fourier transform magnitudes and phases (like resampling the FFT blocks); and
#perform an inverse STFT by taking the inverse Fourier transform on each chunk and adding the resulting waveform chunks, also called overlap and add (OLA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author = Jont B. Allen
 |date=June 1977
 | title = Short Time Spectral Analysis, Synthesis, and Modification by Discrete Fourier Transform
 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing
 | volume = ASSP-25
 | number = 3
 
 | pages = 235–238
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase vocoder handles [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] components well, but early implementations introduced considerable smearing on [[transient (acoustics)|transient]] ("beat") waveforms at all non-integer compression/expansion rates, which renders the results phasey and diffuse. Recent improvements allow better quality results at all compression/expansion ratios but a residual smearing effect still remains.

The phase vocoder technique can also be used to perform pitch shifting, chorusing, timbre manipulation, harmonizing, and other unusual modifications, all of which can be changed as a function of time.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
=== Sinusoidal spectral modeling ===
{{See also|Spectral modeling synthesis}}

Another method for time stretching relies on a [[Spectral modelling synthesis|spectral model]] of the signal.  In this method, peaks are identified in frames using the [[Short-time Fourier transform|STFT]] of the signal, and sinusoidal "tracks" are created by connecting peaks in adjacent frames.  The tracks are then re-synthesized at a new time scale.  This method can yield good results on both polyphonic and percussive material, especially when the signal is separated into sub-bands.  However, this method is more computationally demanding than other methods.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[File:MonophonicSoundCylinderModel.svg|thumb|200px|right|Modelling a monophonic sound as observation along a helix of a function with a cylinder domain]]

== Speed hearing and speed talking==

For the specific case of speech, time stretching can be performed using [[PSOLA]].

While one might expect speeding up to reduce comprehension,
Herb Friedman says that "Experiments have shown that the brain works most efficiently if the information rate through the ears--via speech--is the "average" reading rate, which is about 200-300 wpm (words per minute), yet the average rate of speech is in the neighborhood of 100-150 wpm."
[http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n7/122_Variable_speech.php ]

Speeding up audio is seen as the equivalent of "[[speed reading]]"
[http://www.nevsblog.com/2006/06/23/listen-to-podcasts-in-half-the-time/ ]
[https://web.archive.org/web/20060902102443/http://cid.lib.byu.edu/?p=128 ].

Time stretching is often used to adjust [[Radio commercial]]s
[https://web.archive.org/web/20080527184101/http://www.tvtechnology.com/features/audio_notes/f_audionotes.shtml] and the audio of [[Television advertisement]]s [http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n7/122_Variable_speech.php] to fit exactly into the 30 or 60 seconds available.

}}

These techniques can also be used to [[transposition (music)|transpose]] an audio sample while holding speed or duration constant.  This may be accomplished by time stretching and then resampling back to the original length.  Alternatively, the frequency of the sinusoids in a [[sinusoidal model]] may be altered directly, and the signal reconstructed at the appropriate time scale.

Transposing can be called ''[[frequency]] scaling'' or ''[[pitch shift]]ing'', depending on perspective.

For example, one could move the pitch of every note up by a perfect fifth, keeping the tempo the same.
One can view this transposition as "pitch shifting", "shifting" each note up 7 keys on a piano keyboard, or adding a fixed amount on the [[Mel scale]], or adding a fixed amount in linear [[pitch space]].
One can view the same transposition as "frequency scaling", "scaling" (multiplying) the frequency of every note by 3/2.

Musical transposition preserves the ratios of the [[harmonic]] frequencies that determine the sound's [[timbre]], unlike the ''frequency shift'' performed by [[amplitude modulation]], which adds a fixed frequency offset to the frequency of every note. (In theory one could perform a literal ''pitch scaling'' in which the musical pitch space location is scaled [a higher note would be shifted at a greater interval in linear pitch space than a lower note], but that is highly unusual, and not musical{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}).

Time domain processing works much better here, as smearing is less noticeable, but scaling vocal samples distorts the [[formant]]s into a sort of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]]-like effect, which may be desirable or undesirable.
A process that preserves the formants and character of a voice involves analyzing the signal with a [[vocoder|channel vocoder]] or [[Linear predictive coding|LPC]] vocoder plus any of several [[pitch detection algorithm]]s and then resynthesizing it at a different fundamental frequency.

A detailed description of older analog recording techniques for pitch shifting can be found within the [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] entry.

Audiophile values may be applied at all stages of music reproduction: the initial [[audio recording]], the production process, and the playback, which is usually in a home setting. In general, the values of an audiophile are seen to be antithetical to the growing popularity of more convenient but lower quality music, especially lossy digital file types like [[MP3]], lower definition streaming services, and inexpensive headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Audio and video connector|Signal cables]] (analog audio, speaker, digital audio etc.) are used to link these components. There are also a variety of accessories, including equipment racks, [[power conditioner]]s, devices to reduce or control [[vibration]], record cleaners, anti-static devices, phonograph needle cleaners, [[reverberation]] reducing devices such as speaker pads and stands, sound absorbent foam, and [[soundproofing]].

The interaction between the loudspeakers and the room ([[room acoustics]]) plays an important part in sound quality. Sound vibrations are reflected from walls, floor and ceiling, and are affected by the contents of the room. Room dimensions can create [[standing wave]]s at particular (usually low) frequencies.  There are devices and materials for [[Acoustic treatment#Absorption|room treatment]] that affect sound quality. Soft materials, such as draperies and carpets, can absorb higher frequencies, whereas hard walls and floors can cause excess reverberation.

=== Sound sources ===
Audiophiles play music from a wide variety of sources including [[phonograph record]]s, [[compact disc]]s (CDs), and digital [[audio file format]]s that are uncompressed as well as ones that are compressed using [[lossless data compression]] such as [[FLAC]], [[Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless]] and [[Apple Lossless|Apple Lossless (ALAC)]].  Since the early 1990s, CDs have become the most common source of high-quality music. Nevertheless, [[Phonograph#Turntable technology|turntables]], tonearms, and [[magnetic cartridge]]s are still used, despite the difficulties of keeping records free from dust and the delicate set-up associated with turntables.

The 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz [[sampling rate]] of the CD format, in theory, restricts CD information losses to above the theoretical upper-frequency limit of [[human hearing]] – 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, see [[Nyquist limit]].  Despite this, newer formats such as [[DVD-Audio]] and [[Super Audio CD|Super Audio Compact Disc]] (SACD), have sampling rates of 88.2&amp;nbsp;kHz or 96&amp;nbsp;kHz or even higher.

CD audio signals are encoded in 16-bit values. Some higher-definition consumer formats such as HDCD-encoded CDs contain 20-bit and even 24-bit audio streams. With more bits more [[dynamic range]] is possible; 20 bit dynamic range is theoretically 120&amp;nbsp;dB—the limit of most consumer electronic playback equipment.&lt;ref name="HuberRunstein2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Recording Techniques, Sixth Edition |last=Huber |first=David Miles |author2=Robert E. Runstein |year=2005 |publisher=Focal Press |isbn=0-240-80625-5 |pages=130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mounFTvtYOQC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MP3 encoding, widely used in portable audio devices, is an example of [[Audio compression (data)#Lossy audio compression|lossy compression]].

=== Amplifiers ===
A [[preamplifier]] selects among several audio inputs, amplifies source-level signals (such as those from a turntable), and allows the listener to adjust the sound with volume and tone controls. Many audiophile-oriented preamplifiers lack tone controls. A power [[amplifier]] takes the "line-level" audio signal from the preamplifier and drives the [[loudspeaker]]s. An integrated amplifier combines the functions of power amplification with input switching and volume and tone control.  Both pre/power combinations and integrated amplifiers are widely used by audiophiles.

Audiophile amplifiers are available based on solid-state ([[semiconductor]]) technology, [[vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] (valve) technology, or hybrid technology&amp;mdash;semiconductors and vacuum tubes.

Dedicated amplifiers are also commonly used by audiophiles to drive headphones, especially those with high impedance and/or low sensitivity, or [[electrostatic headphones]].

=== Loudspeakers ===
The cabinet of the loudspeaker is known as the [[loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]].  There are a variety of loudspeaker enclosure designs, including sealed cabinets ([[acoustic suspension]]), ported cabinets ([[bass-reflex]]), transmission line, infinite baffle, and horn loaded. The enclosure plays a major role in the sound of the loudspeaker.

The drivers that produce the sound are referred to as [[tweeter]]s, [[Mid-range speaker|midrange]]s, and [[woofer]]s. Driver designs include dynamic, electrostatic, plasma, ribbon, planar, ionic, and servo-actuated. Drivers are made from a variety of materials including paper pulp, polypropylene, kevlar, aluminum, magnesium, beryllium, and vapor-deposited diamond.

The direction and intensity of the output of a loudspeaker, called dispersion or polar response, has a large effect on its sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=The 'Best' Loudspeaker: Revisiting Dispersion Issues
 |publisher=EnjoyTheMusic.com
 |date=May 1999
 |accessdate=3 July 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various methods are employed to control the dispersion.  These methods include monopolar, bipolar, dipolar, 360-degree, horn, waveguide, and line source. These terms refer to the configuration and arrangement of the various drivers in the enclosure.

The positioning of loudspeakers in the room has a strong influence on the sound experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loudspeaker output is influenced by interaction with room boundaries, particularly bass response, and high frequency transducers are directional, or "beaming".

=== Accessories ===
Audiophiles use a wide variety of accessories and fine-tuning techniques, sometimes referred to as "tweaks", to improve the sound of their systems. These include filters to "clean" the electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.audioholics.com/reviews/power-conditioners
 |title=Power Conditioner Reviews
 |publisher=Audioholics
}}&lt;/ref&gt; equipment racks to isolate components from floor vibrations, specialty power and audio cables, loudspeaker stands (and footers to isolate speakers from stands), and room treatments.

There are several types of room treatment. Sound-absorbing materials may be placed strategically within a listening room to reduce the amplitude of early reflections, and to deal with resonance modes.  Other treatments are designed to produce diffusion, reflection of sound in a scattered fashion. Room treatments can be expensive and difficult to optimize.

=== Headphones ===

Headphones are regularly used by audiophiles.  These products can be remarkably expensive, some over $10,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url        = http://gadgets.luxist.com/2005/12/14/sennheiser-he-90-headphones

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in general are much cheaper than comparable speaker systems. They have the advantage of not requiring room treatment, and being usable without requiring others to listen at the same time.  Newer [[Headphones#In-ear headphones|canalphones]] can be driven by the less powerful outputs found on portable music players.

=== Design variety ===

For music storage, [[digital audio|digital]] formats offer an absence of clicks, pops, [[wow (recording)|wow]], [[Flutter (electronics and communication)|flutter]], [[acoustic feedback]], and [[Rumble (noise)|rumble]], compared to vinyl records.  Depending on the format, digital can also have a higher [[signal-to-noise ratio]], a wider [[dynamic range]], less [[total harmonic distortion]], and a flatter and more extended [[frequency response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mastersonaudio.com/audio/20030101.htm |title=The Decline of Vinyl and Its Timely Death |author=Ian G.

(Note that vinyl records may be mastered differently from their digital versions.)

In the amplification stage, [[vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] electronics remain popular, despite most other applications having since abandoned tubes for [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] amplifiers.  Also vacuum-tube amplifiers often have higher [[total harmonic distortion]], require rebiasing, are less reliable, generate more heat, are less powerful, and cost more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mastersonaudio.com/audio/20020901.htm |title=The Ongoing Debate about Amplifier "Sound" |author=Ian G.

== Controversies ==

There is substantial controversy on the subject of audiophile components; many have asserted that the occasionally high cost  produces no measurable improvement in audio reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/29/lost-in-music-the-world-of-obsessive-audiophilia |title=Lost in music: the world of obsessive audiophilia |publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, skeptic [[James Randi]], through his foundation [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge]], has offered a prize of $1 million to anyone who can demonstrate that $7,250 audio cables "are any better than ordinary audio cables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=James Randi Offers $1 Million If Audiophiles Can Prove $7250 Speaker Cables Are Better | year = 2005 | publisher=Gizmodo | url=https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/calling-bullshit/james-randi-offers-1-million-if-audiophiles-can-prove-7250-speaker-cables-are-better-305549.php | accessdate=6 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090202050901/http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/calling-bullshit/james-randi-offers-1-million-if-audiophiles-can-prove-7250-speaker-cables-are-better-305549.php| archivedate= 2 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, audio reviewer Michael Fremer attempted to claim the prize, and said that Randi declined the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Swift Boating of Audiophiles | year = 2008 | publisher=Stereophile | url=http://www.stereophile.com/thinkpieces/021708swiftboat/ | accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randi said that the cable manufacturer Pear Cables was the one who withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Blake Withdraws from PEAR Cable Challenge | year = 2007 | publisher=JREF | url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/102-blake-withdrawls-from-pear-cable-challenge.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms usually focus on claims around so-called "tweaks" and accessories beyond the core source, amplification, and speaker products. Examples of these accessories include speaker cables, component interconnects, stones, cones, CD markers, and power cables or conditioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kinch |first=Bruce |url=http://www.enjoythemusic.com/Magazine/equipment/1000/cheaptweaks.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730173933/http://www.enjoythemusic.com/Magazine/equipment/1000/cheaptweaks.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 July 2012 |title=Cheap Tweaks That Sound Like a Million Bucks!!! |year=2000 |publisher=Enjoy The Music |accessdate=7 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite web | last=Russell | first=Roger | url=http://www.roger-russell.com/wire/wire.htm | title=Speaker Wire - A History | year=1999–2007 | publisher= Roger Russell | accessdate=7 November 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071105093122/http://www.roger-russell.com/wire/wire.htm#gordongow| archivedate= 5 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is disagreement on how [[Audio equipment testing|equipment testing]] should be conducted and as to its utility.  Audiophile publications frequently describe differences in quality which are not detected by standard [[audio system measurements]] and double blind testing, claiming that they perceive differences in audio quality which cannot be measured by current instrumentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.stereophile.com/features/203/index11.html|title=''God is in the Nuances''
|accessdate=25 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be detected by listeners if listening conditions are [[Scientific control|controlled]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''CALPUFF''' is an advanced, integrated [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian puff]] modeling system for the simulation of [[atmospheric pollution dispersion]] distributed by the Atmospheric Studies Group at TRC Solutions.&lt;ref name=Cleanair&gt;[http://www.cleanairinfo.com/regionalstatelocalmodelingworkshop/documents/CALPUFF.pdf CALPUFF Status and Update]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is maintained by the model developers and distributed by TRC.
The model has been adopted by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in its ''Guideline on Air Quality Models'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/guidance/guide/appw_03.pdf Appendix W] of 40 [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) Part 51&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[List of atmospheric dispersion models#Preferred and recommended models|preferred model]] for assessing long range transport of pollutants and their impacts on Federal Class I areas and on a case-by-case basis for certain near-field applications involving complex meteorological conditions.

The integrated modeling system consists of three main components and a set of preprocessing and postprocessing programs. The main components of the modeling system are CALMET (a diagnostic 3-dimensional [[meteorological]] model), CALPUFF (an [[air dispersion modeling|air quality dispersion model]]), and CALPOST (a postprocessing package). Each of these programs has a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). In addition to these components, there are numerous other processors that may be used to prepare geophysical (land use and terrain) data in many standard formats, meteorological data (surface, upper air, precipitation, and buoy data), and interfaces to other models such as the Penn State/[[National Center for Atmospheric Research|NCAR]] Mesoscale Model (MM5), the [[National Centers for Environmental Prediction]] (NCEP) Eta model and the RAMS meteorological model.

The CALPUFF model is designed to simulate the dispersion of buoyant, puff or continuous point and area pollution sources as well as the dispersion of buoyant, continuous line sources. The model also includes [[algorithms]] for handling the effect of downwash by nearby buildings in the path of the pollution plumes.&lt;ref name=CARB&gt;[http://www.ofcm.gov/atd_dir/pdf/calpuff.pdf General and Specific Characteristics of the model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806135149/http://www.ofcm.gov/atd_dir/pdf/calpuff.pdf |date=2006-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The CALPUFF model was originally developed by the Sigma Research Corporation (SRC) in the late 1980s under contract with the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB)&lt;ref name=CARB/&gt; and it was first issued in about 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arb.ca.gov/research/apr/past/a025-2a.pdf Model Formulation and Users Guide for the CALPUFF model, May 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sigma Research Corporation subsequently became part of Earth Tech, Inc. After the US EPA designated CALPUFF as a preferred model in their ''Guideline on Air Quality Models'', Earth Tech served as the designated distributor of the model.

In April 2006, ownership of the model switched from Earth Tech to the TRC Environmental Corporation.  More recently ownership transferred to E&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;ponent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://src.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; who are currently (December 2015) responsible for maintaining and distributing the model.&lt;ref name=Cleanair/&gt;

'''CISV International''' (''Formerly'' '''''Children's International Summer Villages''''') was founded in 1951&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/about-cisv-int/founder/&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Doris Twitchell Allen]] and aims to educate and inspire action for a more just and peaceful world.

The organisation operates international educational programmes on an annual basis to bring together participants from member countries. CISV also operates in smaller communities through its around 200 local Chapters in 69 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cisv.org/mycisv/national-chapter-officials-directory/about-us/our-world/|title="Our World"|last=|first=|date=1 March 2017|website=CISV International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CISV International is a [[UNESCO]] partner Non Governmental Organization (NGO), holds participatory status with the [[Council of Europe]] and is a candidate member of the [[European Youth Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/our-partners/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
CISV was founded in 1951, after [[World War II]], by [[Doris Twitchell Allen]]. Since then, the organisation has expanded into around 69 countries, and over 150,000 delegates have participated in more than four thousand international CISV activities that delegates have made up over the course of these years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/about-us/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

For Dr. Allen and the CISV organisation, children and youth were seen as the ideal starting point for peace education.  Programmes were developed which offered young people opportunities to meet their peers from other countries and to form intercultural friendships and to learn about what life is really like where they come from. Local programmes give people the chance to learn about the cultures in their own communities and explore important themes related to peace and understanding.

The first village was held in 1951 in Glendale, Ohio; commissioned for its 50th anniversary, the sculpture "How Alike I Am to You” was created in 2000 by Tim Werrell and stands on the property of the Harry Whiting Brown Community Center in Glendale, Ohio.

==CISV programmes==
The CISV International delivers its education through its seven official programmes:

* Village: Today, delegations composed of four children and one adult "Leader" from 10–12 countries come together for a four-week programme for 11-year-old children, who participate in activities based around simple activities that indirectly promote peace and understanding of each other.  Each delegation consists of two boys, two girls, and an adult leader. Additionally, there are five or six Junior Counsellors (JCs, age 16–17) invited, who should be a care-taking "older sibling" for the 11-year-old. There is also a STAFF that takes cares of the camp and it is, usually, a group of 5-6 adults. The staff is responsible for organizing all the structure so the camp can happen.
* Step Up: A three-week programme for participants 14–15 years of age. Delegations include 4 participants and an adult leader. In Step Up's participants can think of new rules for the camp, these will be discussed and voted upon in a so-called 'camp meeting'. Also, the delegates are largely responsible for putting together activities to promote social and leadership skills. Each delegation consists of two boys, two girls, and an adult leader.
* Interchange: Involving only two countries, this programme spans up to two years. A delegation of 6–12 youth, aged 12–14, is selected from each participating country. In the programme one delegation will travel to visit for two or four weeks with the other's family.  After those weeks and a little time in between, the delegations reciprocate. Each delegation has one adult leader, and may also have a Junior Leader.
* Youth Meeting: An 8 or 15 day programme for either 12–13, 14–15, 16–18 or 19+. This programme is based on a specific theme. For youth 12–15 each delegation consists of six young people, and an adult leader. People at the age 16+ travel alone.
* Seminar Camp: A three-week programme for youth 17–18 in which there is one or more (but not more than four) delegates from each participating country.  Seminar Camps have a more direct educational approach, and youth are encouraged to form opinions on various world issues. Usually youth-directed, this program has only thirty participants in total.
* International People's Project:  CISV's newest international programme is open to people aged 19+ and is three weeks long. Participants participate in hands-on work contributing to a community project.
* Mosaic: Mosaic is a programme that consists of projects with educational content, developed by local CISV Chapters worldwide.  These projects empower individuals to be agents of change, reach out, and involve as many people as possible.

The CISV International website provides more detailed information.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cisv.org/cisv-programmes/&lt;/ref&gt;

CISV Chapters also hold activities that aim to share the CISV experience within their local community.

In addition to this CISV International delivers its education through:

* '''Junior Branch (JB)''': Junior Branch is an integral, but self-governing youth-based part of the structure of CISV. Junior Branch develops intercultural skills and attitude through educational and administrative activities consistent with CISV Goals.
* '''Mini Camp''': A weekend long camp within the local chapter. It is planned and run by local Juniors and leaders, often the older members of the chapter. It is a chance for participants to have a camp like experience locally and allows potential delegates and JCs to have a taste what a few days at camp may be like. Often delegate, leader and JC selection takes place at Mini Camps and activities can range from sports, to simulation activities to guest speakers and much more. 
* CISV also has other things you can do, such as being a leader, more commonly meant for the Village, Step-Up, and Interchange (Also for NYM). They are the ones who take the delegations to the Camp/Village. There are also usually 6 Junior Counselors (JC's) on a Village picked from chapters around the world who provide a link between children and adults on Villages. They are age 16-17 and it is common for there to be 2 JCs from the country the camp is being held in. On every programme there is a Staff team, usually from the hosting country although there are sometimes international staff. They are incharge of all the doings of the camp with the help of the JC's and the Leaders. When a camp is being run there is always a need for Host Families. These are families who have participants to stay at their houses when the camp has either not begun yet, has ended and participants have some time to wait before their flights leave or, in the case of a Village, when the leaders weekend off is underway. Another thing which is important is Junior Branch. There are many roles to be taken on throughout your local and national Junior Branch, these vary from country to country and national junior branch roles are usually taken on by Juniors aged 16+, however, you can contribute in many ways; from helping to plan your Junior Branch meetings to helping to raise money to host programmes.

The '''Centro de Relaciones Internacionales''' ('''CRI''', ''International Relations Center'') is an educational and [[research institute]] belonging to [[Mexico]]'s [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (UNAM). Founded in 1970, the CRI is attached to UNAM's [[Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales]] (FCPyS, ''Faculty of Political and Social Sciences'') and offers academic degrees in [[international relations]] studies and theory.

==History==
UNAM was the first academic institution in [[Mexico]] to implement study and research programs in the field of international relations studies. Its first university program in the area was created in 1952, called "Diplomatic Sciences Degree". This degree was created to offer  [[multidisciplinary]] studies combining elements from [[History]], [[Law]] and [[Politics]].

In 1968, a reform transformed the degree program to a dedicated "International Relations Degree". In 1970, the CRI was formed as a distinct research and teaching center under the auspices and administration of the political and social sciences faculty (FCPyS) to coordinate UNAM's programs and research in international relations topics.

==Programs==
Currently the CRI divides its teaching and research programs into six areas:

*[[International relations theory|Theory and Methodology of International relations]]
*[[International politics]]
*[[International law]]
*[[International political economy|International economy]]
*[[Foreign relations of Mexico|Mexican Foreign Policy]]
*[[Area studies|Regional Studies]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">A '''character''' is a [[sign (semiotic)|sign]] or [[symbol]].

==History==
[[Ancient Greek|Greek]]  {{lang|grc|χαρακτήρ}} is a nomen agentis of the verb {{lang|grc|χαράσσω}} (''charassō'') with a meaning "to sharpen, to whet", and also "to make cake",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxara%2Fssw χαράσσω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from a [[PIE root]] ''{{PIE|*g'ʰer-}}'' "cut" also continued in Irish ''gearr'' and English ''gash'', which is perhaps an early loan ultimately from the same Greek root.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gash?rskey=Oftsw6&amp;result=1#m_en_gb0327980 gash], on Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{lang|grc|χαρακτήρ}} is thus an "engraver",  originally in the sense of a craftsman, but then also used for a tool used for engraving, and for a stamp for minting coins. From the stamp, the meaning was extended to the stamp impression, [[Plato]] using the noun in the sense of "engraved mark". In [[Plutarch]], the word could refer to a figure or letter, [[Lucian]] uses it of [[hieroglyph]]s as opposed to Greek ''grammata'' (''Herm''. 44)

Metaphorically, it could refer to a distinctive mark, [[Herodotus]] (1.57) using it of a particular dialect, or (1.116) of a characteristic mark of an individual. The collective noun {{lang|grc|χαρακτηριστικά}} "characteristics" appears later, in [[Dionysius Halicarnassensis]].

Via Latin ''{{lang|la|charactēr}}'', Old French ''{{lang|fr|caracter}}'', the word passed into [[Middle English]] as ''{{lang|und|caracter}}'' in the 14th century. [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe]] (1382) has ''To haue a {{lang|und|caracter}} [...] in her forhedis'' ({{bibleref|Revelation|13:16}}) for the [[mark of the beast]] (translating {{lang|grc|χάραγμα}} "imprinted or branded mark").

==Grapheme==
The word was used in the sense of [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] or [[grapheme]] by [[William Caxton]], referring to the [[Phoenician alphabet]],  ''The Fenyces were the fyrst inuentours of {{lang|und|caracteris}} dyfferencing that one fro{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} that other, of whiche were fourmed lettres for to write'' (''Eneydos'' 6.25). As in Greek, the word was used especially for foreign or mysterious graphemes (such as [[Chinese character|Chinese]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], or [[Runes|Runic]] ones)  as opposed to the familiar ''letters''; in particular of [[shorthand]] (in ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' (chapter 38) sarcastically of [[shorthand]], "a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary characters; the most despotic characters I have ever known"), and since 1949 in computing (see [[character (computing)]].

As a collective noun, the word can refer to writing or printing in general ([[Shakespeare's sonnet]] [[Sonnet 59|nr. 59]]: ''Since minde at first in carrecter was done'', viz. "since  thought was first put in writing").

==Esotericism and magic==
{{see|Diabolical signature}}
The word in [[Renaissance magic]] came to refer to any astrological, cabbalistic or magical sign or symbol. Related is the [[Sacramental character]] of Catholic doctrine.
Famously, [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] designed his ''[[Monas Hieroglyphica]]'' in 1564.

In the  19th century, this sense of the word appears mainly in Romantic poetry, such as  Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''Lay of the last minstrel'' (1805), where "A hallow'd taper shed a glimmering light / On mystic implements of magic might; On cross, and character, and talisman," (6.17).

==Semiotics and epistemology==
{{see|sign (semiotics)}}

From the esoteric or mystical meanings, Early Modern learned authors abstracted a notion of ''Character'' as a code or hierarchical system that embodied all knowledge or all of [[reality]], or a written representation of a [[philosophical language]] that would recover the "[[true name]]s" lost in the [[confusion of tongues]]. 

This idea had currency as a kind of epistemological [[philosophers' stone]] for about a century, from the mid 17th century, with [[Francis Lodwick]] (1642) and [[John Wilkins]]'s  ''Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language''  (1668), to the later 18th century and the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' where in a long entry under the heading ''Charactère'', [[D'Alembert]] critically reviewed such projects of the past century.

A '''corpus manager''' ('''corpus browser''' or '''corpus query system''') is a tool for multilingual [[Corpus linguistics|corpus]] analysis, which allows effective searching in corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.korpus.cz/doku.php/pojmy:korpusovy_manazer |title=Korpusový manažer

 |publisher=Český národní korpus |access-date=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A corpus manager usually represents a complex tool that allows one to perform searches for language forms or sequences. It may provide information about the context or allow the user to search by positional attributes, such as [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]], [[Part-of-speech tagging|tag]], etc. These are called [[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]]. Other features include the ability to search for [[Collocation]]s, frequency statistics as well as metadata information about the processed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kouklakis|first1=George|last2=Mikros|first2=George|last3=Markopoulos|first3=George|last4=Koutsis|first4=Ilias|title=Corpus Manager A Tool for Multilingual Corpus Analysis|journal=Proceedings from Corpus Linguistics Conference|date=2007|pages=1–12|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/college-artslaw/corpus/conference-archives/2007/244Paper.pdf|publisher=University of Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The narrower meaning of corpus manager refers only to the server side or the corpus query engine, whereas the client side is simply called the user interface.

A corpus manager can be software installed on a personal computer or it might be provided as a web service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8316">{{about||the [[data mining]] concept|OLAP cube| database support for datacubes | Array DBMS | spatio-temporal geo datacubes | Coverage data | the Image Processing company|Datacube Inc.}}

In computer programming contexts, a '''data cube''' (or '''datacube''') is a multi-dimensional ("n-D") [[Array data structure|array]] of values. Typically, the term datacube is applied in contexts where these arrays are massively larger than the hosting computer's main memory; examples include multi-terabyte/petabyte data warehouses and [[time series]] of image data.

The data cube is used to represent data along some measure of interest. Even though it is called a 'cube', it can be 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, or higher-dimensional.
Every dimension represents a new measure whereas the cells in the cube represent the facts of interest.

== History ==

Multi-dimensional arrays have long been familiar in programming languages. Fortran offers 1-D arrays and arrays of arrays, which allows the construction higher-dimensional arrays. [[APL_(programming_language)|APL]] supports n-D arrays with a rich set of operations. All these have in common that arrays must fit into main memory and are available only while the particular program maintaining them (such as image processing software) is running.

A series of data exchange formats supports storage and transmission of datacube-like data, often tailored towards particular application domains. Examples include [[MultiDimensional_eXpressions|MDX]] for statistical (in particular, business) data, [[Hierarchical Data Format]] for general scientific data, [[TIFF]] for imagery.

In 1992, [[Peter Baumann (computer scientist)|Peter Baumann]] introduced management of massive datacubes with high-level user functionality combined with an efficient software architecture.&lt;ref&gt;''Language Support for Raster Image Manipulation in Databases'', Peter Baumann, April 1992, ''Int. Workshop on Graphics Modeling, Visualization in Science &amp; Technology'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Datacube operations include subset extraction, processing, fusion, and in general queries in the spirit of [[data manipulation language]]s like [[SQL]].

Some years after, the datacube concept was applied to describe time-varying business data as datacubes by [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]], et al,&lt;ref&gt;''Data Cube: A Relational Aggregation Operator Generalizing Group-By, Cross-Tab, and Sub-Totals'', Jim Gray, Surajit Chaudhuri, Adam Bosworth, Andrew Layman, Don Reichart, Murali Venkatrao, Frank Pellow, Hamid Pirahesh, January 1997, ''Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'': Volume 1 Issue 1, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Venky Harinarayan]], [[Anand Rajaraman]] and [[Jeff Ullman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Venky  | last1 = Harinarayan | author-mask = with | first2 = Anand | last2 = Rajaraman | authorlink2 = Anand Rajaraman | first3 = Jeffrey D. | last3 = Ullman | authorlink3 = Jeffrey D. Ullman| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.1205 | title =''Implementing Data Cubes Efficiently''| year = 1996 | doi = 10.1145/233269.233333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which rank among the top 500 most cited computer science articles over a 25 year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/stats/articles?t=articles&amp;st=''500 Most Cited Computer Science Articles''] (501–600), [[CiteSeer]]. 12 June 2009. Retrieved 21 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around that time, a working group on Multi-Dimensional Databases ("Arbeitskreis Multi-Dimensionale Datenbanken") was established at German [[Gesellschaft für Informatik]].&lt;ref&gt;''Der GI-Arbeitskreis Multidimensionale Datenbanken stellt sich vor'', Peter Baumann, Wolfgang Lehner, 1997, ''Datenbank Rundbrief'' Volume 19, 1997, http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/gidr/gidr19.html#BaumannL97&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;''R&amp;uuml;ckblick auf den GI-Arbeitskreis Multidimensionale Datenbanken'', Peter Baumann, 1999, ''Datenbank Rundbrief'' Volume 23:, 1999, http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/gidr/gidr23.html#Baumann99&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Datacube Inc.]] was an [[image processing]] company selling [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] applications for the [[Personal computer|PC market]] in 1996, however without addressing datacubes as such.

The EarthServer initiative has established geo data cube service requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =''The Database Manifesto''|url = http://www.earthserver.eu/tech/datacube-manifesto|website = www.earthserver.eu|access-date = 2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Standardization ==

In 2018, the [[ISO]] [[SQL]] database language is getting extended with datacube functionality as "SQL -- Part 15: Multi-dimensional arrays (SQL/MDA)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISO/IEC DIS 9075-15 Information technology -- Database languages -- SQL -- Part 15: Multi-dimensional arrays (SQL/MDA) | url = https://www.iso.org/standard/67382.html?browse=tc | access-date = 2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Web Coverage Processing Service]] is a geo datacube analytics language issued by the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] in 2008. In addition to the common datacube operations the language knows about the semantics of space and time and supports both regular and irregular grid datacubes, based on the concept of [[coverage data]]. 

An industry standard for querying business datacubes, originally developed by [[Microsoft]], is [[MultiDimensional eXpressions]].

== Implementation ==

Many high-level computer languages treat data cubes and other large arrays as single entities distinct from their contents.  These languages, of which [[APL programming language|APL]], [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], [[NumPy]], [[Perl Data Language|PDL]], and [[S-Lang]] are examples, allow the programmer to manipulate complete [[film]] clips and other data en masse with simple expressions derived from [[linear algebra]] and [[vector (geometric)|vector]] mathematics. Some languages (such as PDL) distinguish between a [[list (computing)|list]] of images and a data cube, while many (such as IDL) do not.

[[Array DBMS]]s (Database Management Systems) offer a data model which generically supports definition, management, retrieval, and manipulation of n-dimensional datacubes. This database category has been pioneered by the [[rasdaman]] system since 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Management of Multidimensional Discrete Data |url = http://www.vldb.org/journal/VLDBJ3/P401.pdf |website = www.vldb.org|access-date = 2017-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Applications ==

Multi-dimensional arrays can meaningfully represent spatio-temporal sensor, image, and simulation data, but also statistics data where the semantics of dimensions is not necessarily of spatial or temporal nature. Generally, any kind of axis can be combined with any other into a datacube.

=== Mathematics ===
In mathematics, a one-dimensional array corresponds to a vector, a two-dimensional array resembles a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]; more generally, a [[tensor]] may be represented as an n-dimensional data cube.

=== Science and Engineering ===
For a time sequence of color images, the array is generally four-dimensional, with the dimensions representing image X and Y coordinates, time, and [[RGB]] (or other [[color space]]) color plane. For example, the EarthServer initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EarthServer - Big Datacube Analytics at Your Fingertips|url = http://www.earthserver.eu|website = www.earthserver.eu|access-date = 2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; unites data centers from different continents offering 3-D x/y/t satellite image timeseries and 4-D x/y/z/t weather data for retrieval and server-side processing through the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] [[WCPS]] geo datacube query language standard.

A data cube is also used in the field of [[imaging spectroscopy]], since a spectrally-resolved image is represented as a three-dimensional volume.

=== Business Intelligence ===
In [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP), data cubes are a common arrangement of business data suitable for analysis from different perspectives through operations like slicing, dicing, pivoting, and aggregation.

In the study of [[transsexualism]], the [[essentialism|essentialist]] idea of a '''feminine essence''' refers to the proposal that [[Trans woman|male-to-female transsexuals]] are females trapped in male bodies.  This idea has been interpreted in many senses, as a female mind, spirit, soul, personality, etc., as well as in more literal senses such as having a female brain structure; it is also a [[psychological narrative]], that is, a self-description of how some transsexuals see themselves, or of how they may portray themselves to qualify for certain medical treatments.

According to sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] and Kiira Triea, "the predominant cultural understanding of male-to-female transsexualism is that all male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals are, essentially, women trapped in men's bodies."  They reject the idea, claiming that "The persistence of the predominant cultural understanding, while explicable, is damaging to science and to many transsexuals."&lt;ref name=Bailey2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bailey J.

The great majority of patients understand full well that this is a ''[[wikt:façon de parler|façon de parler]],'' not a literal statement of fact, and are not delusional in any normal sense of the word."&lt;ref name="UTorontoRounds2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|title=Psychiatry Rounds: The case for and against publicly funded transsexual surgery|date=April 2000|publisher=Department of Psychiatry, University of Toronto Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; Toronto, Ontario|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304092619/http://www.autogynephilia.org/psychiatry_rounds.pdf|archive-date=2012-03-04|volume=4|issue=2|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminine essence idea has been described under several names, and there is no authoritative, widely accepted definition.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008 /&gt;  It was called the ''feminine essence narrative'' by [[Alice Dreger]] in 2008,&lt;ref name=Dreger2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dreger AD |title=The Controversy Surrounding The Man Who Would Be Queen: A Case History of the Politics of Science, Identity, and Sex in the Internet Age |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=366–421 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18431641 |doi=10.1007/s10508-007-9301-1 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0753m756162q4236/fulltext.pdf |pmc=3170124}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''feminine essence theory'' by Ray Blanchard, who formulated the concept into a set of logical propositions.&lt;ref name=Blanchard2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard R |title=Deconstructing the feminine essence narrative |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=434–8; discussion 505–10 |date=June 2008 |pmid= 18431630|doi=10.1007/s10508-008-9328-y |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include ''[[Harry Benjamin]] syndrome'', after one of the early sexologists whose early writings about the nature of transsexualism, along with those of psychiatrist [[David O. Cauldwell]], are favorably cited by proponents in support of this idea.&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=As the medical literature on transsexuals emerged, the doctors and scientists involved drew, as Ulrichs had, a distinction between the sex in the mind, as seen in the sense of self, and the sex in the body, as generally evidenced in the genitals.  Cauldwell referred to individuals who were "physically of one sex and apparently psychologically of the opposite sex."  Hamburger and his colleagues wrote of a "female personality in a male body" and the "feeling of being a woman."  Benjamin borrowed Ulrichs' formula of "a female soul'... in [a] male body."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is associated with, but separate from the brainsex theory of transsexualism, which is a belief about a neurodevelopmental [[cause of transsexualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey and Triea, 2007.  "The narrative has been extended to an etiological theory, which Lawrence (2007b) has called "the brainsex theory of transsexualism." The transsexual advocacy website, transsexual.org, puts this theory succinctly: 'A transsexual is a person in which the sex-related structures of the brain that define gender identity are exactly opposite the physical sex organs of the body.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the brainsex theory of transsexualism draw a distinction between "brain sex" and "anatomical sex".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |title=Harry Benjamin Syndrome (HBS) |accessdate=6 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202040714/http://www.harrybenjaminsyndrome-nz.co.nz/ |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some proponents reject the term ''transsexual'', as the ''[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]'' prefix implies that their true sex is changing, instead of being affirmed, with treatments like [[sex reassignment surgery]].

==Description==

The "feminine essence" idea predates modern psychological studies,&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed" /&gt; and was supported by some early sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]] ("the father of transsexualism"), who revived the idea of [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]] that a person might have a "female soul trapped in a male body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern researchers classify the common story told by transsexual women about themselves as a [[psychological narrative]], and therefore refer to this idea as the "feminine essence narrative".  In his book ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] gives these statements as a prototypical example of the feminine essence narrative:  "Since I can remember, I have always felt as if I were a member of the other sex. I have felt like a freak with this body and detest my penis. I must get sex reassignment surgery (a "sex change operation") in order to match my external body with my internal mind."&lt;ref name =Dreger2008/&gt;

==Blanchard's deconstruction==

In 2008, [[Ray Blanchard]] presented the idea in the form of a theory in a commentary entitled "Deconstructing the Feminine Essence Narrative" in which he lists what he considers to be "the central tenets of the feminine essence theory", and then refutes each of these tenets:&lt;ref name = Blanchard2008/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

#Male-to-female transsexuals are, in some literal sense and not just in a figurative sense, women inside men’s bodies.
#There is only one type of woman, therefore there can be only one type of (true) male-to-female transsexual.
#Apparent differences among male-to-female transsexuals are relatively superficial and irrelevant to the basic unity of the transsexual syndrome.
#Male-to-female transsexuals have no unique, behavioral or psychological characteristics that are absent in typical men and women.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Neuroanatomic research==

According to Bailey and Triea,&lt;ref name=Bailey2007/&gt; one of the predictions based on the feminine essence theory is that male-to-female transsexuals would possess female rather than male brain anatomy. A widely cited research study of this topic examined the brain anatomy of six deceased male-to-female transsexuals, who had undergone during their lives hormonal treatment and surgical sex reassignment.&lt;ref name=Zhou1995&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhou J. N. |author2=Hofman M. A. |author3=Gooren L. J. G. |author4=Swaab D. F. | year = 1995 | title = A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 378 | issue = 6552| pages = 68–70 | doi = 10.1038/378068a0 | pmid = 7477289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported that a brain structure called the "central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis" (BSTc), which is larger in typical males than in typical females, was in the female range in the transsexual subjects. The interpretation and the methods of that study have been criticized,&lt;ref name=LawrenceWeb&gt;[http://www.annelawrence.com/twr/brain-sex_critique.html Transsexual women’s resources, by Dr. Anne Lawrence]&lt;/ref&gt; and the finding continues to be a matter of debate.

Neurological research has found that the brains of transsexuals differ in a number of ways.  For example, a study done on the brains of non-homosexual transsexuals using MRI and pheromones as stimuli found that transsexuals process smelling androgen and estrogen in the same way that women do. Previous research by the same team found that homosexual males also process smelling the pheromones of the sexes in a way that is similar to that of women.&lt;ref name="pheroMTF"&gt;[http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhm216v1?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;title=transsexual&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT "Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids"], by H. Berglund1,  P. Lindström2,  C. Dhejne-Helmy3 and  I. Savic2, Cerebral Cortex&lt;/ref&gt;   Work done by [[Simon LeVay]] had previously found that the hypothalamus of homosexual males has a region which is similar in size to that of heterosexual females.&lt;ref name="levay"&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/nature-nurture/levay.html A Difference in Hypothalmic Structure Between Heterosexual and Homosexual Men Simon LeVay]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not so in non-homosexual males.&lt;ref name="levay"/&gt; Last but not least a study done by Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol reached the conclusion that the brain does change in overall volume and the volume of its parts with the use of cross-sex hormone supplements.&lt;ref name="CSCB"&gt;[http://www.eje-online.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/suppl_1/S107 Changing your sex changes your brain: influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure] Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol,  Peggy T Cohen-Kettenis1,  Neeltje E M Van Haren,  Jiska S Peper, Rachel G H Brans,  Wiepke Cahn,  Hugo G Schnack,  Louis J G Gooren2 and  René S Kahn&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of male-to-female transsexuals, the brain assumes the proportions of a female brain.&lt;ref name="CSCB"/&gt;

==Other findings==

The main support for the feminine essence narrative is that many male-to-female transsexuals say they feel it to be true; many autobiographical and clinical accounts by or about transsexual individuals contain variations of the statement of having a female soul or needing to make the external body resemble the inner or true self.&lt;ref name=Brown1996&gt;Brown, M. L., &amp; Rounsley, C. A. (1996). ''True selves: Understanding transsexualism.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ettner1999&gt;Ettner, R. (1999). ''Gender loving care: A guide to counseling gender-variant clients.'' New York: W. W. Norton.{{ISBN|0393703045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this narrative consider it to be inconsistent with their research findings.  Blanchard has reported finding that there are two, and not one, types of male-to-female transsexual and that they differ with regard to their sexual interests, whether they were overtly gender atypical in childhood, how easily they pass as female, the ages at which they decide to transition to female, birth order, and their physical height and weight.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1990&gt;Blanchard, R., &amp; Steiner, B. W. (1990). ''Clinical management of gender identity disorders in children and adults.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. {{ISBN|0-88048-187-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2005a&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Smith Y. L. S.|author2= van Goozen S. H. M.|author3= Kuiper A.

==Role of medical community==

Since the medical community has guidelines for what types of individuals qualify for [[sex reassignment surgery]], transsexual persons sometimes adopt and tell the story that they believe will best help them qualify – the "feminine essence narrative" – and representing themselves as "essentially female", which may explain at least part of the prevalence of the feminine essence narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Terminology==

The phrase "feminine soul enclosed in a male body" (''anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa'') was introduced in 1868 by [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]], not to describe male-to-female transsexuals, none of whom existed yet as such, but to describe a type of gay men who self-identified as feminine.&lt;ref name=Ulrichs1868&gt;Ulrichs, Karl-Heinrich (1868). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k-2eOwAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Memnon+inauthor:Ulrichs&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=0_2 "Memnon.": Die Geschlechtsnatur des mannliebenden Urnings, eine naturwissenschaftliche Darstellung: körperlich-seelischer Hermaphroditismus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18701">{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts}}

'''Fictive kinship''' is a term used by [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographers]] to describe forms of [[kinship]] or social ties that are based on neither [[consanguinity|consanguineal]] (blood ties) nor [[Affinity (law)|affinal]] ("by marriage") ties, in contrast to ''true kinship'' ties.

To the extent that consanguineal and affinal kinship ties might be considered ''real'' or ''true'' kinship, the term ''fictive kinship'' has in the past been used to refer to those kinship ties that are ''fictive'', in the sense of ''not-real''. Invoking the concept as a cross-culturally valid anthropological category therefore rests on the presumption that the inverse category of "(true) kinship" built around consanguinity and affinity is similarly cross-culturally valid. Use of the term was common until the mid-to-late twentieth century, when anthropology effectively deconstructed and revised many of the concepts and categories around the study of kinship and social ties. In particular, anthropologists established that a consanguinity basis for kinship ties is not universal across cultures, and that—on the contrary—it may be a culturally specific symbol of kinship only in particular cultures (see the articles on [[kinship]] and [[David M. Schneider]] for more information on the history of kinship studies).

Stemming from anthropology's early connections to legal studies, the term ''fictive kinship'' may also be used in a legal sense, and this use continues in societies where these categories and definitions regarding kinship and social ties have legal currency; e.g. in matters of inheritance.

As part of the deconstruction of kinship mentioned above, anthropologists now recognize that—cross-culturally—the kinds of social ties and relationships formerly treated under the category of "kinship" are very often not necessarily predicated on blood ties or marriage ties, and may rather be based on shared residence, shared economic ties, [[nurture kinship]], or familiarity via other forms of interaction.

In [[sociology of the family]], this idea is referred to as '''chosen kin''', '''fictive kin''' or '''voluntary kin'''. Sociologists define the concept as a form of extended family members who are not related by either blood or marriage. The bonds allowing for chosen kinship may include religious rituals, close friendship ties,&lt;ref name=Ebaugh&gt;Ebaugh, Helen Rose, and Mary Curry. "Fictive kin as social capital in new immigrant communities." ''Sociological Perspectives 43'', no. 2 (2000): 189-209.&lt;/ref&gt; or other essential reciprocal social or economic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Fordham, Signithia. "Racelessness as a factor in Black students' school success: Pragmatic strategy or pyrrhic victory?." ''Harvard educational review 58'', no. 1 (1988): 54-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of chosen kin include [[godparents]], informally adopted children, and close family friends.&lt;ref name=Ciabattari&gt;Ciabattari, Teresa.

== Examples ==
Types of relations often described by anthropologists as ''fictive kinship'' include [[compadrazgo]] relations, [[foster care]], common membership in a unilineal descent group, and legal [[adoption]]. A noted [[Gurung]] tradition is the institution of "Rodi", where teenagers form fictive kinship bonds and become Rodi members to socialize, perform communal tasks, and find marriage partners. In [[Western culture]], a person may refer to close friends of one's parents as "aunt" or "uncle" (and their children as "cousin"), or may refer to close friends as "brother" or "sister", although this is just a mere courtesy treatment and does not represent an actual valuation as such. In particular, college fraternities and sororities in some North American cultures usually use "brother" and "sister" to refer to members of the organization. Monastic, Masonic, and Lodge organisations also use the term "Brother" for members. "Nursing Sister" is used to denote a rank of nurse, and the term "Sisterhood" may be used for feminists. Fictive kinship was discussed by Jenny White in her work on female migrant workers in [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref&gt;White, ''Money Makes Us Relatives''.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, she draws on ideas of production and the women she works with being drawn together through "webs of indebtedness" through which the women refer to each other as kin. These relationships are, however, less frequent than kin relationships, and serve purposes that are not comparable to, nor exclude, a natural [[family]] and, much less, natural and universal parents-having-children reproduction system.

* Compadrazgo is a form of fictive kinship that is rooted in Central Mexico history for many years. Literally meaning "co-parenthood", compadrazgo is a term to describe the set of relationships between a child, their parents, and their godparents. It has been hypothesized that these relationships evolved after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest in 1521]] to help deal with stressful situations.&lt;ref&gt;Horstman, Compadrazgo and Adaptation in Sixteenth Century Central Mexico&lt;/ref&gt; These fictive kinships still exist in modern day Mexican societies, and are established by providing some form of aid throughout the child's life.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos, Fictive Kinship and Modernization in Mexico: A Comparative Analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; Godparents seldom become more important than parents, though, much less in a non-economic fashion.
* Undocumented immigrants have also demonstrated fictive kin relationships. Undocumented restaurant workers are known to form pseudo-families in which they cooperate within living and working situations.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, "Mama's Family": Fictive Kinship and undocumented immigrant restaurant workers.&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships benefit the workers by creating a support system that would otherwise be unavailable to those living far from home. These ties are, however, fictive in a strict sense and mean nothing to the people in such pretenses.
* Some fictive kin relationships have been discovered in [[Israel]] in relation to [[Organ transplantation|organ transplants]]. Hospital committees are formed to assess whether the organ donation is from a true family member or from a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Unknotting fictive kinship and legal process.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to obtain organ transplants, some individuals are forced to find strangers and pay them compensation for the procedure. However, the relationship between the donor and recipient must be invented as a familial relationship in order to pass through the hospital committee. In this case, fictive kinship is created knowingly to both parties in order to achieve their goals, and is mutualistic in nature.
* Adoption and foster care have always been grouped into the fictive kinship category (in cases where the child shares no genetic relatedness to the caregivers). The children are normally treated as the adopters' biological kin, receiving a lot of parental investment despite not having family ties. This view has been chastised by some who claim that notions of kinship are not always based on biological determinants.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Adoption of the Unrelated Child: Some Challenges to the Anthropological Study of Kinship&lt;/ref&gt; But these links do not mean that the adopters would not love more their biological offspring, given the extra natural motivation of survival.
* The [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]] has also been an avenue to propagate fictive kinship, such as the sense of brotherhood felt by the soldiers. Fictive kinship has been demonstrated among the spouses of military men and women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Frese, Anthropology and the United States military: Coming of Age in the Twenty First Century.&lt;/ref&gt; These relationships may facilitate close bonds that are beneficial during times of hardship.
* Other times, relationships can appear from the outside to be fictive kinship relationships, but the reality is that this appearance is just the result of kinship terminology. Members of the Shanti Nagar village in [[North India]] refer to everyone—even strangers—in familial terms.&lt;ref&gt;Freed, Fictive Kinship in a North Indian Village&lt;/ref&gt; A man would address another man of a similar in age as "brother", and would address an older man as "uncle". Although these terms used in addressing one another appear to be indicative of fictive kinship, they do not actually suggest the existence of ritual kin relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Vatuk, Reference, Address, and Fictive Kinship in Urban North India.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques ==
Recently, many anthropologists have abandoned a distinction between "real" and "fictive" kin, because many cultures do not base their notion of kinship on genealogical relations. This was argued most forcefully by [[David M. Schneider]], in his 1984 book ''A critique of the study of kinship''.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, ''A Critique of The Study of Kinship''&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this insight, [[Janet Carsten]] developed the idea of "[[relatedness]]". She developed her initial ideas from studies with the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] in looking at what was socialized and biological. Here she uses the idea of relatedness to move away from a pre-constructed analytics opposition which exists in anthropological thought between the biological and the social.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, ''The substance of kinship and the heat of the hearth; feeding, personhood and relatedness among the Malays in Pulau Langkawi''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carsten argued that relatedness should be described in terms of indigenous statements and practices, some of which fall outside what anthropologists have conventionally understood as kinship.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, ''Cultures of Relatedness''.&lt;/ref&gt;

This does not imply, however, that human non-kin relationships, such as in [[tit-for-tat]] situations, even within a friendship relation, are more important than kin relationships, since their motivation is also related to one's survival and perpetuation, or that people are necessarily bound to the culture they are inserted in, nor can it be generalized to the point of claiming all individuals always undervalue kinship in the absence of nurturing. [[Herbert Gintis]], in his review of the book ''[[Sex at Dawn]]'', critiques the idea that human males were unconcerned with parentage, "which would make us unlike any other species I can think of".&lt;ref name=gintis&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gintis|first1=Herbert|title=Much that is True, but Remember: Is does not Imply Ought,|url=http://smile.amazon.com/review/RKVMPRH1FYL2T/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0061707805&amp;nodeID=283155&amp;store=books#wasThisHelpful|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals can be considered out of the natural tendency of living beings for survival through offspring.

In response to a similar model advanced by [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Rice University]]’s [[David Queller]] said that such new model "involves, and I suspect requires, close kinship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Brandon Keim|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/08/kin-selection-challenged/2/|title=E.O. Wilson proposes new theory of social evolution|date=2010-08-26|website=Wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also overlooks phenomena of survivalist non-kin or not close kin such as the one that can be seen on [[tribalism]] or [[ethnic nationalism]].

== Use in sociobiology ==
{{see also| Social bonding and nurture kinship}}

In the biological and animal behavioural sciences, the term "kinship" has a different meaning from the current anthropological usage of the term, and more in common with the former anthropological usage that assumed that blood ties are ontologically prior to social ties. In these sciences, "kinship" is commonly used as a shorthand for "the regression coefficient of (genetic) relatedness", which is a metric denoting the proportion of shared genetic material between any two individuals relative to average degrees of genetic variance in the population under study. This coefficient of relationship is an important component of the theory of [[inclusive fitness]], a treatment of the evolutionary selective pressures on the emergence of certain forms of social behavior. Confusingly, inclusive fitness theory is more popularly known through its narrower form, [[kin selection]] theory, whose name clearly resonates with former conceptions of "kinship" in anthropology.

Whilst inclusive fitness theory thus describes one of the necessary conditions for the evolutionary emergence of social behaviors, the details of the proximate conditions mediating the expression of social bonding and cooperation have been less investigated in sociobiology. In particular, the question of whether genetic relatedness (or "blood ties") must necessarily be present for social bonding and cooperation to be expressed has been the source of much confusion, partly due to thought experiments in [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s early theoretical treatments. In addition to setting out the details of the evolutionary selection pressure, Hamilton roughly outlined two possible mechanisms by which the expression of social behaviors might be mediated:

{{quote
 | The  selective  advantage  which  makes  behaviour  conditional  in  the  right  sense  on the  discrimination  of  factors  which  correlate  with  the  relationship  of  the  individual concerned  is  therefore  obvious.  It  may  be,  for  instance,  that  in  respect  of  a  certain social  action  performed  towards  neighbours  indiscriminately,  an  individual  is  only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours  who  really  were  close  relatives  and  could  devote  his  beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive  fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind.&lt;ref name="H1964" /&gt;
}}

Traditional sociobiology did not consider the divergent consequences between these basic possibilities for the expression of social behavior, and instead assumed that the expression operates in the "recognition" manner, whereby individuals are behaviorally primed to discriminate which others are their true genetic relatives, and engage in cooperative behavior with them. But when expression has evolved to be primarily location-based or context-based—depending on a society's particular demographics and history—social ties and cooperation may or may not coincide with blood ties. Reviews&lt;ref name="SBNK"/&gt; of the mammal, primate, and human evidence demonstrate that expression of social behaviors in these species are primarily location-based and context-based (see [[nurture kinship]]), and examples of what used to be labeled as "fictive kinship" are readily understood in this perspective. Social cooperation, however, does not mean people see each other as family or family-like, nor that people will value those known not to be related with them more than the ones who are or simply neglect relatedness.

==User Interface==
[[File:Grasshopper FindGUI.png|thumb|200px|The Find Dialog displaying metaball outlines around search results]]
Grasshopper features an advanced [[user interface]]. The main window consist mainly of the component 'palettes' and the 'canvas'. Since Grasshopper is a plug-in to [[Rhinoceros 3D]], the layout of the main window is kept minimal.

GUI elements include:
*'''[[Palette window|Component Palettes]]''' - All installed commands appear within component palettes, with each group of commands in one tab. Additional component palettes may be installed with various grasshopper add-ons. Commands are dragged out of these palettes onto the canvas.
*'''[[Node (computer science)|Node Based Editor]]''' - Programs are edited in grasshopper using a node-based interface. Components are dragged out of palettes, and placed onto the canvas. Each component node represents a certain function, with input and output pins. Pins can be interconnected to form programs.
*'''[[Zooming User Interface]]''' - Some objects drawn on the canvas adjust their display based on the zoom-level. This results in a less detailed view when zoomed out and additional information when zoomed in.
*'''[[Search algorithm|Find Dialog]]''' - The search function lists both exact and similar matches. The Find dialog provides both textual and spatial feedback regarding the search hits. Objects are highlighted on the canvas by a Metaball outline and arrows on the dialog point towards the location of the search results.
*'''[[color picker|Color Picker]]''' - The in-built color picker supports and displays color values and transparency values.
*'''Command Prediction''' - A [[Markov chain]] database is maintained of all the add actions of the user. This enables Grasshopper to predict with a reasonable level of accuracy which command(s) will be called upon next.
*'''[[Multiple document interface|Multi Document Interface]]''' - The multiple document interface menu contains small preview images of the documents currently open
*'''Recently Used Documents''' - The MRU menu maintains not just a large collection of previously used documents, but also checks each file for availability. Files which are no longer present on the system are shown greyed out. In addition, the history of the MRU is categorized into distinct period such as "Just Now", "Today", "Thursday" and "Last Week".

==Node based editor==
The main interface for algorithm design in Grasshopper is the node-based editor. Data is passed from component to component via connecting wires which always connect an output grip with an input grip. Data can either be defined locally as a constant, or it can be imported from the Rhino document or a file on the computer. Data is always stored in parameters, which can either be free-floating or attached to a component as input and outputs objects.

[[File:Grasshopper NodeBasedSubtraction.png]]

In the image above we see three free-floating parameters that are hooked up to a subtraction component. The two yellow boxes on the left both define a set of numeric constants. The top-most panel contains four integers (6, 7, 8 and 12) while the bottom-most panel contains only a single value. These floating parameters supply the subtraction component with input data, which results in four output values (6-5=1, 7-5=2, 8-5=3 and 12-5=7). The same result can be achieved using textual expressions and an evaluator component. In this fashion Grasshopper allows users to combine both visual and textual programming within the same environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20725">The establishment of [[industrial ecology]] as field of scientific research is commonly attributed to an article devoted to industrial ecosystems, written by Frosch and Gallopoulos, which appeared in a 1989 special issue of Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial ecology emerged from several earlier ideas and concepts, some of which date back to the 19th century.

== Before the 1960s ==

The term "[[Industrial Ecology|industrial ecology]]" has been used alongside "[[Industrial Symbiosis|industrial symbiosis]]" at least since the 1940s. [[Economic geography]] was perhaps one of the first fields to use these terms. For example, in an article published in 1947, George T. Renner refers to "The General Principle of Industrial Location" as a "Law of Industrial Ecology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renner | first1 = G.T. | year = 1947 | title = Geography of Industrial Localization | url = | journal = Economic Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 167–189 | doi=10.2307/141510 | jstor = 141510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly stated this is:

{{quote|Any industry tends to locate at a point which provides optimum access to its ingredients or component elements. If all these component elements be juxtaposed, the location of the industry is predetermined. If, however, they occur widely separated, the industry is so located as to be most accessible to that element which would be the most expensive or difficult to transport and which, therefore, becomes the locative factor for the industry in question.}}

In the same article the author defines and describes industrial symbiosis:

{{quote|Often the location of an industry cannot be fully understood solely in terms of its locative ingredient elements. There are relationships between industries, sometimes simple, but often quite complex, which enter into and complicate the analysis. Chief among these is the phenomenon of [[industrial symbiosis]]. By this is meant the consorting together of two or more of dissimilar industries. Industrial Symbiosis, when scrutinized, is seen to be of two kinds, disjunctive and conjunctive.}}

It appears that the concept of Industrial Symbiosis was not new for the field of economic geography, since the same categorization is used by Walter G. Lezius in his 1937 article "Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio", also published in the Journal of Economic Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lezius | first1 = Walter G | year = 1937 | title = Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio | jstor = 141587| journal = Economic Geography | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 402–412 | doi=10.2307/141587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used in a different context, the term "Industrial Ecology" is also found in a 1958 paper concerned with the relationship between the ecological impact from increasing urbanization and value orientations of related peoples. The case study is in Lebanon:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = L. | last2 = Bashshur | first2 = R. | year = 1958 | title = Ecological Patterns and Value Orientations in Lebanon | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 406–415 | jstor=2746350 | doi = 10.1086/266808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The central ecological variable in the present research is ecological mobility, or the movement of men in space. It is patent that modern Industrial Ecology requires more such adaptive mobility than does traditional folk-village organization.}}

== 1960s ==

In 1963, we find the term Industrial Ecology (defined as the "complex ecology of the modern industrial world") being used to describe the social nature and complexity of (and within) industrial systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barnard | first1 = F | year = 1963 | title = Education for management conceived as a study of Industrial Ecology | journal = Journal of Vocational Education &amp; Training | volume = 15 | issue = 30| pages = 22–26 | doi=10.1080/03057876380000041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...industrial organisations are social rather than mechanical systems. A firm is not only a working organisation with a working purpose. It is rather a community with its own 'politics', in so far as it is involved in problems concerned with the proper distribution of power between individuals and groups of individuals and with questions of individual and group prestige, influence, status and standing... [and he concludes that] the understanding which the student of management is expected to gain is no less than the attainment of insight into an [[Industrial Ecology]] of great complexity.}}

In 1967, the President of the American association for the advancement of science writes in "The experimental city"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spilhaus |first1=Athelstan |year=1967 |title=The experimental city |journal=Daedalus |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=1129–41 |jstor=20027108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that "There are examples of [[industrial symbiosis]] where one industry feeds off, or at least neutralizes, the wastes of another..." The same author in 1970 talks about "The Next Industrial Revolution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.167.3926.1673 |pmid=17729610 |title=The Next Industrial Revolution |journal=Science |volume=167 |issue=3926 |pages=1673 |year=1970 |last1=Spilhaus |first1=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of material and energy sharing and reuse is central to his proposal for a new industrial revolution and he cites agro-[[industrial symbiosis]] as a practical way for achieving this:

{{quote|The object of the next industrial revolution is to ensure that there will be no such thing as waste, on the basis that waste is simply some substance that we do not vet have the wit to use... The next industrial revolution is this generating of a huge new [industry that]... will not produce products, it will rather reprocess the things we call wastes so they may be reproduced in the factories into the things we need... Having the city near the rural area will enable waste heat to be used to speed up the biological processes of treating the organic wastes before they go back into the land. This might end in an elegant arrangement-the power plants located close enough to the center of use, to the people who need the power, but also, within the economics, close enough to the agriculture lands so that the waste heat may be used there. This is an example of agro-industrial symbiosis, if you like to call it that.}}

In these early articles, "Industrial Ecology" is used in its literal sense - as a system of interacting industrial entities. The relation to natural ecosystems (through either metaphor or analogy) is not explicit. Industrial Symbiosis on the other hand, is already clearly defined as a type of industrial organization, and the term symbiosis is borrowed from the ecological sciences to describe an analogous phenomenon in industrial systems.

== 1970s ==

Industrial Ecology has been a research subject of the Japan Industrial Policy Research Institute since 1971. Their definition of Industrial Ecology is "research for the prospect of dynamic harmonization between human activities and nature by a systems approach based upon ecology (JIPRI, 1983)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This programme has resulted to a number of reports that are available only in Japanese.

One of the earliest definitions of  Industrial Ecology was proposed by Harry Zvi Evan at a seminar of the Economic Commission of Europe in Warsaw (Poland) in 1973 (an article was subsequently published by Evan in the Journal for International Labour Review in 1974 vol. 110 (3), pp.&amp;nbsp;219–233). Evan defined Industrial Ecology as a systematic analysis of industrial operations including factors like: Technology, environment, natural resources, bio-medical aspects, institutional and legal matters as well as the socio-economic aspects.

In 1974 the term of Industrial Ecology is perhaps for the first time associated with a cyclical production mode (rather than a linear one, resulting to waste). In this article, the necessity for a transition to an "open-world Industrial Ecology", is used as argument for the need to establish lunar industries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ehricke | first1 = K.A. | year = 1974 | title = Lunar industries and their value for the human environment on Earth | journal = Acta Astronautica | volume = 1 | issue = 5–6| pages = 585–622 | doi=10.1016/0094-5765(74)90023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Low living standards provide one strong motive for most developing countries to increase their productivity and grow economically. Population increase (while it lasts) is a still more powerful driver for increased world consumption. Thus the pressure on resources will continue to grow. Instead of deploring it, we better grow with it. Only through transition to an open-world [[Industrial Ecology]] - which includes both benign industrial revolution on Earth and extraterrestrial industrialization - can the present apparent limits to growth be overcome.}}

Many elements of modern Industrial Ecology were commonplace in the industrial sectors of the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sathre | first1 = R. | last2 = Grdzelishvili | first2 = I. | year = 2006 | title = Industrial symbiosis in the former Soviet Union | url = | journal = Progress in Industrial Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 379–392 | doi=10.1504/pie.2006.011743}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “kombinirovanaia produksia” (combined production) was present from the earliest years of the Soviet Union and was instrumental in shaping the patterns of Soviet industrialization. “Bezotkhodnoyi tekhnologii” (waste-free technology) was introduced in the final decades of the USSR as a way to increase industrial production while limiting environmental impact. Fiodor Davitaya, a Soviet scientist from the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Republic of Georgia]], described in 1977 the analogy relating industrial systems to natural systems as a model for a desirable transition to cleaner production:

{{quote|Nature operates without any waste products. What is rejected by some organisms provides food for others. The organisation of industry on this principle—with the waste products of some branches of industry providing raw material for others—means in effect using natural processes as a model, for in them the resolution of all arising contradictions is the motive force of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Davitaya, F. (1977) "Changes in the atmosphere and some problems of its protection" pp. 99–110 in ''Society and the Environment: A Soviet View''; Moscow: Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== 1980s ==

By the 80s Industrial Ecology was already "promoted" to a research subject, which several institutes around the globe embraced. In a 1986 article published in the Journal of Ecological Modeling, there is a full description of Industrial Ecology and the [[analogy]] to natural [[ecosystems]] is clearly stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The structure and inner-working of an industrial society resemble those of a natural ecosystem. The concepts in ecology such as habitat, succession, trophic level, limiting factors and community metabolism can also apply to the study of the ecology of an industrial society. For instance, an industry in a society may grow or decline as a consequence of dynamic changes in exogenous limiting resources and in the hierarchical and/or metabolic structure of that society. When studying the ecology of an industrial society (henceforth termed '[[Industrial Ecology]]'), these concepts and methodologies employed in ecosystems analyses are useful.}}

In fact, in the above article there is an attempt to model an "industrial ecological system". The model is composed of seven major sections: industry, population, labor force, living state, environment and pollution, general health, and occupational health. Notice the rough similarity with Evan's factors as stated in the above section.

During the 80s the emergence of another related term, "[[industrial metabolism]]", is observed. The term is used as a metaphor for the organization and functioning of industrial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hicks | first1 =  | year = 1983 | title = The Property Tax in a New Industrial Era | jstor = 3700958| journal = Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages =  208–221| doi=10.2307/3700958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article defending the "biological modulation of terrestrial carbon cycle", the author includes an extraordinary parenthetical note:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schidlowski | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = Biological modulation of the terrestrial carbon cycle: isotope clues to early organic evolution | url = | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 4 | issue = 12| pages = 183–93 | pmid = 11537773 | doi=10.1016/0273-1177(84)90561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Parenthetically, it should be noted that it is an intrinsic property of life to proliferate exponentially until the encounter of limits set by (I) the availability of biologically utilizable reducing power, or (2) the exhaustion of some critical nutrient, or (3) an autotoxic effect imposed by life on its own environment. These limits are universal, applying to microbial ecosystems as well as to the population dynamics of a seemingly unrestricted biological superdominant such as Homo Sapiens (here, the ultimate limit is likely to be placed by an autotoxic effect exerted by the "extrasomatic" (industrial) metabolism of the human race).}}

=== 1989 – Decisive articles ===

In 1989 two articles were released that played a decisive role in the history of industrial ecology. The first one was titled "Industrial Metabolism" by Robert Ayres. Ayres essentially lays the foundations of Industrial Ecology, although the term is not to be found in this article. In the appendix of the article he includes "a theoretical exploration of the biosphere and the industrial economy as material-transformation systems and lessons that might be learned from their comparison". He proposes that:&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 1989. Industrial Metabolism. In Technology and Environment,J.H. Ausubel and H.E. Sladovich, 23–49. 1st. Washington DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We may think of both the biosphere and the industrial economy as systems for the transformation of materials. The biosphere as it now exists is nearly a perfect system for recycling materials. This was not the case when life on earth began. The industrial system of today resembles the earliest stage of biological evolution, when the most primitive living organisms obtained their energy from a stock of organic molecules accumulated during prebiotic times. It is increasingly urgent for us to learn from the biosphere and modify our industrial metabolism, the energy - and value - yielding process essential to economic development... we should not only postulate, but indeed endorse, a long-run imperative favoring an industrial metabolism that results in reduced extraction of virgin materials, reduced loss of waste materials, and increased recycling of useful ones.}}

The term "Industrial Ecology" gains mainstream attention later the same year (1989) through a "[[Scientific American]]" article named "Strategies for Manufacturing". In this article, R.Frosch and N.Gallopoulos wonder "why would not our industrial system behave like an [[ecosystem]], where the wastes of a species may be [[natural resource|resource]] to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of raw materials, pollution, and saving on [[waste]] treatment?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vision gave birth to the concept of the Eco-industrial Park, the industrial complex that is governed by Industrial Ecology principles. A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of [[Kalundborg]]. There, several linkages of byproducts and waste heat can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;The Kalundborg Centre for [[industrial symbiosis]] (2007) http://www.symbiosis.dk/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Frosch|Frosch's]] and Gallopoulos' thinking was in certain ways simply an extension of earlier ideas, such as the efficiency and waste-reduction thinking annunciated by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and his students (e.g., [[J. Baldwin]]), and parallel ideas about energy [[cogeneration]], such as those of [[Amory Lovins]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]].

== 1990s ==

In 1991, C. Kumar Patel organized a seminal colloquium on Industrial Ecology, held on May 20 and 21, 1991, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. The papers were later published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA, and they form an excellent reference on Industrial Ecology. Papers include:

The ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' (since 1997), the International Society for Industrial Ecology (since 2001), and the journal ''Progress in Industrial Ecology'' (since 2004) have covered [[industrial ecology]] in the international scientific community. Principles of industrial ecology are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the circular economy that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the circular economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using [[waste heat]] from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. This maximizes the efficiency of [[exergy]] use. This strategy aims for a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yuan | first1 = Z | last2 = Bi | first2 = J | last3 = Moriguichi | first3 = Y | year = 2008| title = The Circular Economy: A New Development Strategy in China | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 10 | issue = 1–2| pages = 4–8 | doi=10.1162/108819806775545321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Humanism}}
{{contains Hebrew text}}

'''Humanism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[ethics|ethical]] stance that emphasizes the value and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] of [[Human|human beings]], individually and collectively, and generally prefers [[critical thinking]] and [[evidence]] ([[rationalism]] and  [[empiricism]]) over acceptance of [[dogma]] or [[superstition]]. The meaning of the term ''humanism'' has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it.&lt;ref name="What 2004"&gt;[[Nicolas Walter]]'s ''Humanism{{spaced ndash}}What's in the Word'' (London: [[Rationalist Press Association]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-301-97001-7}}) gives an account of the evolution of the meaning of the word ''humanism'' from the point of view of a modern [[secular humanist]]. A similar perspective, but somewhat less polemical, appears in [[Richard Norman]]'s ''On Humanism (Thinking in Action)'' (London: Routledge: 2004). For a historical and [[philological]]ly oriented view, see Vito Giustiniani's "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 46: 2 (April–June 1985): 167–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by theologian [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer|Friedrich Niethammer]] at the beginning of the [[19th century]] to refer to a system of education based on the study of classical literature ("classical humanism"). Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human [[freedom]] and progress. It views humans as solely responsible for the promotion and development of individuals and emphasizes a concern for man in relation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, “Developing the Spirit of Patriotism and Humanism in Children for Peace and Harmony”, ''Children At Risk: Issues and Challenges'', Jesudason Jeyaraj (Ed.), Bangalore: CFCD/ISPCK, 2009, p.474&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, humanist movements are typically [[secular humanism|non-religious movements]] aligned with [[secularism]], and today humanism typically refers to a [[nontheism|nontheistic]] [[life stance]] centred on human agency and looking to [[science]] rather than [[revelation]] from a [[supernatural]] source to understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 2002 ''[[Amsterdam Declaration]]'' &lt;http://iheu.org/humanism/the-amsterdam-declaration/&gt; issued by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]

==Background==

The word "humanism" is ultimately derived from the Latin concept ''[[humanitas]]''.  It entered English in the nineteenth century. However, historians agree that the concept predates the label invented to describe it, encompassing the various meanings ascribed to ''humanitas'', which included both benevolence toward one's fellow humans and the values imparted by ''bonae litterae'' or humane learning (literally "good letters").

In the second century AD, a Latin grammarian, [[Aulus Gellius]] (c.{{nbsp}}125{{snds}}c.{{nbsp}}180), complained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who have spoken Latin and have used the language correctly do not give to the word ''humanitas'' the meaning which it is commonly thought to have, namely, what the Greeks call φιλανθρωπία ([[philanthropy]]), signifying a kind of friendly spirit and good-feeling towards all men without distinction; but they gave to ''humanitas'' the force of the Greek παιδεία ([[paideia]]); that is, what we call ''eruditionem institutionemque in bonas artes'', or "education and training in the [[liberal arts]]". Those who earnestly desire and seek after these are most highly humanized. For the desire to pursue of that kind of knowledge, and the training given by it, has been granted to humanity alone of all the animals, and for that reason it is termed ''humanitas'', or "humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/13*.html Aulus Gellius], ''Attic Nights'', XIII: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gellius says that in his day ''humanitas'' is commonly used as a synonym for [[philanthropy]]{{snds}}or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call "humane" or "polite" learning, or the Greek equivalent [[Paideia]]. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of ''humanitas'' to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like that to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of [[Antoninus Pius]] (one these reforms,  for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of ''humanitas'', Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge Classical Monographs [1999]), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gellius's writings fell into obscurity during the Middle Ages, but during the Italian Renaissance, Gellius became a favorite author. Teachers and scholars of Greek and Latin grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and poetry were called and called themselves "humanists".&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Nicholas |title=The Origins of Humanism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=1–2 |quote=The term ''umanista'' was used, in fifteenth century Italian academic jargon to describe a teacher or student of classical literature including that of grammar and rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with a similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford-renaissance"&gt;''Humanissime vir'', "most humane man", was the usual Latin way to address scholars. (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 168.)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, however, point out that [[Cicero]] (106{{snds}}43{{nbsp}}BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term ''humanitas'', in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;There was a time when men wandered about in the manner of wild beasts. They conducted their affairs without the least guidance of reason but instead relied on bodily strength. There was no divine religion and the understanding of social duty was in no way cultivated. No one recognized the value inherent in an equitable code of law.(Cicero, ''De Inventione'', I. I: 2, quoted in Quentin Skinner, ''Visions of Politics, Volume 2:  Renaissance Virtues'' [Cambridge University Press, 2002], p. 54.)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''humanitas'' included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, ''humanism'', which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to a method of study and debate involving an accepted group of authors and a careful and accurate use of language.&lt;ref&gt;A noted authority on the subject, [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], identified Renaissance humanism as a cultural and literary movement, which in its substance was not philosophical but which had important philosophical implications and consequences." "I have been unable to discover in the humanist literature any common philosophical doctrine," he wrote, "except a belief in the value of man and the humanities and in the revival of ancient learning." (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought: The Classic, Scholastic, and Humanist Strains'' [New York, Harper and Row, 1961], p. 9). As the late Jacques Barzun has written:&lt;blockquote&gt;The path between the onset of the good letters and the modern humanist as freethinker or simply as scholar is circuitous but unbroken. If we look for what is common to the Humanists over the centuries we find two things: a body of accepted authors and a method of carrying on study and debate. The two go together with the belief that the best guides to the good life are [[Reason]] and [[Nature]]. (Jacques Barzun, ''From Dawn to Decadence :500 years of Western Cultural Life'' [New York: HarperCollins, 2000], p. 45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], and soon after, in Germany (by the [[Left Hegelians]]), ''humanism'' began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind, without attention to the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] or  [[supernatural]]. The designation [[Religious Humanism]] refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is similar to [[Protestantism]], although centered on human needs, interests, and abilities rather than the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genesis of a Humanist Manifesto | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/edwin_wilson/manifesto/ch2.html | accessdate=14 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglophone world, such modern, organized forms of humanism, which are rooted in the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with [[Classics|classical learning]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].

The first ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' was issued by a conference held at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |title=Text of Humanist Manifesto I |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107221355/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included the philosopher [[John Dewey]], but the majority were ministers (chiefly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) and [[Academic theology|theologians]]. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses [[reason]], [[ethics]], and [[social justice|social and economic justice]], and they called for science to replace [[Dogma#In religion|dogma]] and the [[supernatural]] as the basis of [[morality]] and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Although a distinction has often been drawn between secular and religious humanism, the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and similar organizations prefer to describe their life stance without qualification as 'Humanism'. See Nicolas Walter,  ''Humanism: What's in the Word?'' (London: RPA/BHA/Secular Society Ltd, 1937), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanism is Eight Letters, No More|url=http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more|authors=Harold Blackham, Levi Fragell, Corliss Lamont, Harry Stopes-Roe,  Rob Tielman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Isola di Utopia Moro.jpg|thumb|An ideal society as conceived by Renaissance humanist Saint [[Thomas More]] in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'']]

In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]] coined the term ''Humanismus'' to describe the new [[Classics|classical curriculum]] he planned to offer in German secondary schools,&lt;ref&gt;Niethammer's book was entitled ''Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit'' (''The Dispute between Philanthropinism and Humanism in the Educational Theory of our Time''), which directly echoes Aulus Gellius's distinction between "philanthropy" and humane learning. Neithammer and other distinguished members of the movement they called "Neo-Humanism" (who included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]), felt that the curriculum imposed under Napoleon's occupation of Germany had been excessively oriented toward the practical and vocational. They wished to encourage individuals to practice life-long self cultivation and reflection, based on a study of the artistic, philosophical, and cultural masterpieces of (primarily) Greek civilization.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1836 the word "humanism" had been absorbed into the English language in this sense. The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856, when German historian and philologist [[Georg Voigt]] used ''humanism'' to describe [[Renaissance humanism]], the movement that flourished in the Italian [[Renaissance]] to revive classical learning, a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations, especially Italy.&lt;ref name="See 1877"&gt;As J. A. Symonds remarked, "the word humanism has a German sound and is in fact modern" (See ''The Renaissance in Italy'' Vol. 2:71 n, 1877). Vito Giustiniani writes that in the German-speaking world "Humanist" while keeping its specific meaning (as scholar of Classical literature) "gave birth to further derivatives, such as ''humanistisch'' for those schools which later were to be called ''humanistische Gymnasien'', with Latin and Greek as the main subjects of teaching (1784). Finally, ''Humanismus'' was introduced to denote 'classical education in general' (1808) and still later for the epoch and the achievements of the Italian humanists of the fifteenth century (1841). This is to say that 'humanism' for 'classical learning' appeared first in Germany, where it was once and for all sanctioned in this meaning by Georg Voigt (1859)". (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 172.)&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of "The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing".&lt;ref&gt;"''L'amour général de l'humanité ... vertu qui n'a point de nom parmi nous et que nous oserions appeler 'humanisme', puisqu'enfin il est temps de créer un mot pour une chose si belle et nécessaire''"; from the review ''Ephémérides du citoyen ou Bibliothèque raisonée des sciences morales et politiques'', Chapter 16 (Dec, 17, 1765): 247, quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175, note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots "philanthropic" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the [[French Revolution]], the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]'' such as [[Rousseau]], was violently attacked by influential religious and political [[Conservatism|conservatives]], such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]], as a deification or idolatry of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Although Rousseau himself devoutly believed in a personal God, his book, ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'', does attempt to demonstrate that atheists can be virtuous. It was publicly burned. During the Revolution, [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] instituted a cult of the Supreme Being along lines suggested by Rousseau. In the 19th-century French positivist philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) founded a "religion of humanity", whose calendar and catechism echoed the former Revolutionary cult. See [[Comtism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' records the use of the word "humanism" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the "mere humanity" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to [[circle the wagons]] and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist [[Proudhon]] (best known for declaring that "[[property is theft]]") used the word "humanism" to describe a "''culte, déification de l’humanité''" ("worship,  deification of humanity") and [[Ernest Renan]] in ''L’avenir de la science: pensées de 1848'' ("The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848") (1848–49), states: "It is my deep conviction that pure ''humanism'' will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity{{mdash}}all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value."&lt;ref&gt;''"Ma conviction intime est que la religion de l'avenir sera le pur'' humanisme, ''c’est-à-dire le culte de tout ce qui est de l'homme, la vie entière santifiée et éléve a une valeur moral"''. quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, the word "humanism" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the [[Left Hegelians]], [[Arnold Ruge]], and [[Karl Marx]], who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms:&lt;ref name="What 2004"/&gt; philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.

===Predecessors===

====Ancient South Asia====

Human-centered philosophy that rejected the supernatural may also be found circa 1500 BCE in the [[Cārvāka|Lokayata]] system of Indian philosophy. [[Nasadiya Sukta]], a passage in the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], contains one of the first recorded assertions of agnosticism.
In the 6th-century BCE, [[Gautama Buddha]] expressed, in [[Pali literature]] a skeptical attitude toward the supernatural:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesson 1: A brief history of humanist thought|url=http://humanisteducation.com/class.html?module_id=1&amp;page=1|work= Introduction to Humanism: A Primer on the History, Philosophy, and Goals of Humanism|publisher=The Continuum of Humanist Education|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since neither soul, nor aught belonging to soul, can really and truly exist, the view which holds that this I who am 'world', who am 'soul', shall hereafter live permanent, persisting, unchanging, yea abide eternally: is not this utterly and entirely a foolish doctrine?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the [[Gathas]] of [[Zarathustra]], composed between 1,000{{nbsp}}BCE{{snds}}600{{nbsp}}BCE&lt;ref&gt;"Principles of Integral Science of Religion", By Georg Schmid, p. 109, 'As an Example: Yasna 32:8', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greater Iran]]. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings, dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from [[Ahura Mazda]] (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening [[Deism|deistic]] god or [[Great Architect of the Universe]] was combined with a unique eschatology and ethical system which implied that each person is held morally responsible in the afterlife, for their choices they freely made in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Behavior and Good Thinking|url=http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/dgm/vol1.htm#volume1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This importance placed upon thought, action and personal responsibility, and the concept of a non-intervening creator, was a source of inspiration to a number of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] humanist thinkers in Europe such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]].

====Ancient Greece====
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}

6th-century [[BCE]] [[pre-Socratic]] Greek philosophers [[Thales of Miletus]] and [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition, thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists. Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe. These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm. [[Anaxagoras]] brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens. [[Pericles]], the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras. Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include [[Protagoras]] (like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles), known for his famous dictum "man is the measure of all things" and [[Democritus]], who proposed that matter was composed of atoms. Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers, principally [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. The historian [[Thucydides]], noted for his scientific and rational approach to history, is also much admired by later humanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Potter |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Francis Potter |title=Humanism A new Religion |pages=64–69 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1930}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BCE, [[Epicurus]] became known for his concise phrasing of the [[problem of evil]], lack of belief in the afterlife, and human-centred approaches to achieving [[eudaimonia]]. He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule.

====Medieval Islam====
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy}}

Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic, [[Rationalism|rational]] and scientific [[discourse]]s in their search for knowledge, meaning and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. A wide range of Islamic writings on love, poetry, history and [[philosophical theology]] show that medieval Islamic thought was open to the humanistic ideas of [[individualism]], occasional [[secularism]], [[skepticism]], and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, another reason the Islamic world flourished during the Middle Ages was an early emphasis on [[freedom of speech]], as summarised by al-Hashimi (a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]]) in the following letter to one of the religious opponents he was attempting to [[Religious conversion|convert]] through [[reason]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first=I.

According to George Makdisi, certain aspects of [[Renaissance humanism]] has its roots in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], including the "art of ''[[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]]'', called in Latin, ''[[ars dictaminis]]''", and "the humanist attitude toward [[classical language]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Makdisi |first=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |date=April–June 1989 |pages=175–82 |doi=10.2307/604423 |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 109, No. 2 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}

[[File:Ritratto di francesco petrarca, altichiero, 1376 circa, padova.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Petrarch]] painted in 1376]]

Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern]] period. The 19th-century German historian [[Georg Voigt]] (1827–91) identified [[Petrarch]] as the first Renaissance humanist. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] agrees that Petrarch was "the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness". According to Petrarch, what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors. For Petrarch and [[Boccaccio]], the greatest master was [[Cicero]], whose prose became the model for both learned (Latin) and vernacular (Italian) prose.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once the language was mastered grammatically it could be used to attain the second stage, eloquence or rhetoric. This art of persuasion [Cicero had held] was not art for its own sake, but the acquisition of the capacity to persuade others – all men and women – to lead the good life. As Petrarch put it, 'it is better to will the good than to know the truth'. Rhetoric thus led to and embraced philosophy. [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.{{nbsp}}1369–1444), the outstanding scholar of the new generation, insisted that it was Petrarch who "opened the way for us to show how to acquire learning", but it was in Bruni's time that the word ''umanista'' first came into use, and its subjects of study were listed as five: grammar, rhetoric, poetry, moral philosophy, and history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |pages=32–34 and 37 |isbn=0-679-64086-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|Coluccio Salutati, Chancellor of Florence and disciple of Petrarch (1331–1406)]]

The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). One of Petrarch's followers, [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406) was made chancellor of [[Florence]], "whose interests he defended with his literary skill. The Visconti of Milan claimed that Salutati’s pen had done more damage than 'thirty squadrons of Florentine cavalry'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to a still widely held interpretation that originated in Voigt's celebrated contemporary, [[Jacob Burckhardt]],&lt;ref&gt;The influence of Jacob Burckhardt's classic masterpiece of cultural history, [[The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy]] (1860) on subsequent Renaissance historiography is traced in Wallace K. Ferguson's ''The Renaissance in Historical Thought: Five Centuries of Historical Interpretation'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; and which was adopted wholeheartedly – especially by modern thinkers calling themselves "humanists" – &lt;ref&gt;For example the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,'' adhering to the tenacious 19th-century narrative of the Renaissance as a complete break with the past established in 1860 by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], describes the liberating effects of the re-discovery of classical writings this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, one felt no weight of the supernatural pressing on the human mind, demanding homage and allegiance. Humanity{{mdash}}with all its distinct capabilities, talents, worries, problems, possibilities{{mdash}}was the centre of interest. It has been said that medieval thinkers philosophised on their knees, but, bolstered by the new studies, they dared to stand up and to rise to full stature.{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia="The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; most specialists today do not characterise Renaissance humanism as a philosophical movement, nor in any way as anti-Christian or even anti-clerical. A modern historian has this to say:

{{quote|text=Humanism was not an ideological programme but a body of literary knowledge and linguistic skill based on the "revival of good letters", which was a revival of a late-antique philology and grammar, This is how the word "humanist" was understood by contemporaries, and if scholars would agree to accept the word in this sense rather than in the sense in which it was used in the nineteenth century we might be spared a good deal of useless argument. That humanism had profound social and even political consequences of the life of Italian courts is not to be doubted. But the idea that as a movement it was in some way inimical to the Church, or to the conservative social order in general is one that has been put forward for a century and more without any substantial proof being offered.&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;The nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt, in his classic work, ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', noted as a "curious fact" that some men of the new culture were "men of the strictest piety, or even ascetics". If he had meditated more deeply on the meaning of the careers of such humanists as Abrogio Traversari (1386–1439), the General of the Camaldolese Order, perhaps he would not have gone on to describe humanism in unqualified terms as "pagan", and thus helped precipitate a century of infertile debate about the possible existence of something called "Christian humanism" which ought to be opposed to "pagan humanism".|author=Peter Partner|source=''Renaissance Rome, Portrait of a Society 1500–1559'' (University of California Press 1979) pp. 14–15.}}

The ''umanisti'' criticised what they considered the barbarous Latin of the universities, but the revival of the humanities largely did not conflict with the teaching of traditional university subjects, which went on as before.&lt;ref&gt;

"The term ''umanista'' was associated with the revival of the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'' "which included ''grammatica'', ''rhetorica'', poetics, ''historia'', and ''philosophia moralis'', as these terms were understood. Unlike the liberal arts of the eighteenth century, they did not include the visual arts, music, dancing or gardening. The humanities also failed to include the disciplines that were the chief subjects of instruction at the universities during the Later Middle Ages and throughout the Renaissance, such as theology, jurisprudence, and medicine, and the philosophical disciplines other than ethics, such as logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics. In other words, humanism does not represent, as often believed, the sum total of Renaissance thought and learning, but only a well-defined sector of it. Humanism has its proper domain or home territory in the humanities, whereas all other areas of learning, including philosophy (apart from ethics), followed their own course, largely determined by their medieval tradition and by their steady transformation through new observations, problems, or theories. These disciplines were affected by humanism mainly from the outside and in an indirect way, though often quite strongly". ([[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–14, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' [1990].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor did the humanists view themselves as in conflict with Christianity. Some, like Salutati, were the Chancellors of Italian cities, but the majority (including Petrarch) were ordained as priests, and many worked as senior officials of the Papal court. Humanist Renaissance popes [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] wrote books and amassed huge libraries.&lt;ref&gt;See their respective entries in Sir John Hale's ''Concise Encyclopaedia of the Italian Renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], in fact, there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity, including the writings of the Church fathers, the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels, and in some cases even the Jewish [[Kabbalah]], would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement.&lt;ref&gt;To later generations, the Dutch humanist, [[Desiderius Erasmus]], epitomised this reconciling tendency). According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "[[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers remembered Erasmus (not quite accurately) as a precursor of modern intellectual freedom and a foe of both Protestant and Catholic dogmatism". [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/erasmus/. Erasmus himself was not much interested in the Kabbalah, but several other humanists were, notably Pico della Mirandola]. See [[Christian Kabbalah]].)&lt;/ref&gt; With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bergin |first1=Thomas |last2=Speake |first2=Jennifer |title=The Encyclopedia of the Renaissance |year=1987 |publisher=Facts On File Publications |location=Oxford |pages=216–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Only thirteen of Pico della Mirandola's nine hundred theses were thought theologically objectionable by the papal commission that examined them.... [This] suggests that, in spite of his publicly expressed contempt in his ''Apologia'' for their intellectual inadequacies, the Curial authorities hardly saw these theses as the work of a dangerous theological modernist like Luther or Calvin. Unorthodox though they were, most of the issues raised in them had been the subject of theological dispute for centuries and the commission ... condemned him not for innovations but for 'reviving several of the errors of gentile philosophers which are already disproved and obsolete'". Davies (1997), p 103.&lt;/ref&gt; One humanist, the [[Greek Orthodox]] Platonist [[Gemistus Pletho]] (1355–1452), based in [[Mystras]], Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Popkin]] (editor), ''The Columbia History of Western Philosophy'' (1998), pp. 293, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Back to the sources====

[[File:Quentin Massys- Erasmus of Rotterdam.JPG|thumb|Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]

The humanists' close study of [[Latin]] literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods. By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning, seeking out manuscripts of [[Patristic]] literature as well as pagan authors. In 1439, while employed in [[Naples]] at the court of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] used stylistic textual analysis, now called [[philology]], to prove that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery.&lt;ref&gt;More than 100 years earlier, Dante in the [[Divine Comedy]] (c. 1308–1321) had pinpointed the Donation of Constantine (which he accepted as genuine) as a great mistake and the cause of all the political and religious problems of Italy, including the corruption of the Church. Although Dante had thunderously attacked the idea that the Church could have temporal as well as spiritual powers, it remained to Valla to conclusively prove that the legal justification for such powers was spurious.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Hermeticism]], hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, it was a humanist scholar, [[Isaac Casaubon]], in the 17th century, who would use philology to show that the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] was not of great antiquity, as had been asserted in the 4th century by [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Lactantius]], but dated from the Christian era. See Anthony Grafton, ''Defenders of the Text: The Traditions of Scholarship in an Age of Science, 1450–1800'' (Harvard University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.

After 1517, when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available, the Dutch humanist [[Erasmus]], who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]], began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla, comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter. Erasmus, along with the French humanist [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], began issuing new translations, laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Henceforth Renaissance humanism, particularly in the German North, became concerned with religion, while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists, studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith. After the Reformation, critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called [[Higher criticism]] of the 19th-century German [[Tübingen school]].

====Consequences====

The ''ad fontes'' principle also had many applications. The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as [[Epicureanism]], and [[Neoplatonism]], whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the Church fathers of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|page=1733|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=0-9602572-1-7}} "Renaissance humanists rejoiced in the mutual compatibility of much ancient philosophy and Christian truths", M. A. Screech, ''Laughter at the Foot of the Cross'' (1997), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The line from a drama of [[Terence]], ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto'' (or with ''nil'' for ''nihil''), meaning "I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me",&lt;ref&gt;''Homo'' in Latin specifically means "human being", in contrast to ''vir'', "man", and ''mulier'', "woman": Annabel Robinson, ''The Life and Work of Jane Ellen Harrison'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 206; Tore Janson, ''A Natural History of Latin'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 281; Timothy J. Moore, ''Roman Theatre'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 62 (note to the line in Terence); as a "watchword" for humanists, ''Humanism and the Humanities in the Twenty-First Century'', edited by William S. Haney and Peter Malekin (Associated University Presses, 2001), p. 171; similar ''homo sum'' declaration by Seneca, James Ker, ''The Deaths of Seneca'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein{{snds}}as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling{{snds}}but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Richard Bauman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.'', I am a human being: and I deem nothing pertaining to humanity is foreign to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words of the comic playwright P.{{nbsp}}Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond. Terence, an African and a former slave, was well placed to preach the message of universalism, of the essential unity of the human race, that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks, but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality. The influence of Terence's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated. Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one short rule that should regulate human relationships. All that you see, both divine and human, is one. We are parts of the same great body. Nature created us from the same source and to the same end. She imbued us with mutual affection and sociability, she taught us to be fair and just, to suffer injury rather than to inflict it. She bid us extend our hands to all in need of help. Let that well-known line be in our heart and on our lips: ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto''." &lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science (see the [[history of science in the Renaissance]]). This was despite what [[A. C. Crombie]] (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls "a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] concentration on the observable properties of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Crombie]], ''Historians and the Scientific Revolution'', p. 456 in ''Science, Art and Nature in Medieval and Modern Thought'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Just as artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]]{{snds}}partaking of the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' though not himself a humanist{{snds}}advocated study of human [[anatomy]], nature, and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art, so Spanish-born humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] (c. 1493–1540) advocated observation, craft, and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities, helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Anthony |title=The Dream of Reason: a history of western philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=410–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to [[natural philosophy]], based on [[empiricism|empirical]] observations and experimentation of the physical universe, making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alleby |first=Brad |title=Humanism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Religion |volume=1 |edition=2nd |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |year=2003 |pages=426–28 |isbn=0-02-865705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in education that the humanists' program had the most lasting results, their curriculum and methods:

&lt;blockquote&gt;were followed everywhere, serving as models for the Protestant Reformers as well as the Jesuits. The humanistic school, animated by the idea that the study of classical languages and literature provided valuable information and intellectual discipline as well as moral standards and a civilised taste for future rulers, leaders, and professionals of its society, flourished without interruption, through many significant changes, until our own century, surviving many religious, political and social revolutions. It has but recently been replaced, though not yet completely, by other more practical and less demanding forms of education.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeller, "Humanism" in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===From Renaissance to modern humanism===

Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith (see [[Christian Humanism]]). They inveighed against the abuses of the Church, but not against the Church itself, much less against religion. For them, the word [[Secularism#Overview|"secular"]] carried no connotations of disbelief{{snds}}that would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in [[Minor Orders]] and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base,&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet it was from the Renaissance that modern Secular Humanism grew, with the development of an important split between reason and religion. This occurred as the church's complacent authority was exposed in two vital areas. In science, Galileo's support of the Copernican revolution upset the church's adherence to the theories of Aristotle, exposing them as false. In theology, the Dutch scholar Erasmus with his new Greek text showed that the Roman Catholic adherence to Jerome's Vulgate was frequently in error. A tiny wedge was thus forced between reason and authority, as both of them were then understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Guinness]], ''The Dust of Death: A Critique of the Establishment and the Counter Culture and the Proposal for a Third Way'' (Intervarsity Press, 1973) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For some, this meant turning back to the Bible as the source of authority instead of the Catholic Church, for others it was a split from theism altogether. This was the main divisive line between the Reformation and the Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with the same basic problems, supported the same science based on reason and empirical research, but had a different set of presuppositions (theistic versus naturalistic).&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===

The phrase the "religion of humanity" is sometimes attributed to American [[Founding Father]] [[Thomas Paine]], though as yet unattested in his surviving writings. According to Tony Davies: &lt;blockquote&gt;Paine called himself a ''theophilanthropist'', a word combining the Greek for "God", "love", and "humanity", and indicating that while he believed in the existence of a creating intelligence in the universe, he entirely rejected the claims made by and for all existing religious doctrines, especially their miraculous, transcendental and salvationist pretensions. The Parisian "Society of Theophilanthropy" which he sponsored, is described by his biographer as "a forerunner of the ethical and humanist societies that proliferated later" ... [Paine's book] the trenchantly witty ''Age of Reason'' (1793) ... pours scorn on the supernatural pretensions of scripture, combining Voltairean mockery with Paine's own style of taproom ridicule to expose the absurdity of a theology built on a collection of incoherent Levantine folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) pp.{{nbsp}}26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davies identifies Paine's '' [[The Age of Reason]]'' as "the link between the two major narratives of what [[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;In [[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls the narrative of legitimation": the rationalism of the 18th-century ''[[Philosophes]]'' and the radical, historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the [[Hegelian]]s [[David Friedrich Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. "The first is political, largely French in inspiration, and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty'. The second is philosophical, German, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses ''understanding'' rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation. The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homo homini deus est'' ("The human being  is a god to humanity" or "god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself"), Feuerbach had written.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian novelist Mary Ann Evans, known to the world as [[George Eliot]], translated Strauss's ''Das Leben Jesu'' (''"The Life of Jesus"'', 1846) and Ludwig Feuerbach's ''Das Wesen Christianismus'' ("The Essence of Christianity"). She wrote to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the fellowship between man and man which has been the principle of development, social and moral, is not dependent on conceptions of what is not man ... the idea of God, so far as it has been a high spiritual influence, is the ideal of goodness entirely human (i.e., an exaltation of the human).&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliot and her circle, who included her companion [[George Henry Lewes]] (the biographer of [[Goethe]]) and the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] and social theorist [[Harriet Martineau]], were much influenced by the positivism of [[Auguste Comte]], whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic ''culte'' founded on human principles{{snds}}a secular [[Religion of Humanity]] (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organised around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)". According to Davies (pp. 28–29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity. Comte's austere vision of the universe, his injunction to "''vivre pour altrui''" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]"),&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and his idealisation of women inform the works of Victorian novelists and poets from George Eliot and [[Matthew Arnold]] to [[Thomas Hardy]].

The British Humanistic Religious Association was formed as one of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered Humanist organisations in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership, and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Morain |first1=Lloyd |last2=Morain |first2=Mary |title=Humanism as the Next Step |publisher=Humanist Press |year=2007 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=109 |url=http://aha-files.s3.amazonaws.com/63/226/Hum_as_the_Next_Step.pdf |isbn=978-0931779091 |lccn=97-74611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1877, the word was used pejoratively, apparently for the first time in America, to describe [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]]. Adler, however, did not embrace the term, and instead coined the name "[[Ethical Culture]]" for his new movement {{snds}}a movement which still exists in the now Humanist-affiliated New York Society for Ethical Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysec.org/sitemap/about-ethical-culture/history/ |title=History: New York Society for Ethical Culture |accessdate=6 March 2009 |year=2008 |publisher=New York Society for Ethical Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ethical Culture Leaders wrote: "Today, the historic identification, Ethical Culture, and the modern description, Ethical Humanism, are used interchangeably."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical Culture |publisher=American Ethical Union |url=http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf |accessdate=23 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226081725/http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf|archive-date=26 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active in the early 1920s, [[F.C.S. Schiller]] labelled his work "humanism" but for Schiller the term referred to the [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy he shared with [[William James]]. In 1929, [[Charles Francis Potter]] founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included [[Julian Huxley]], [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. Potter was a minister from the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published ''Humanism: A New Religion''. Throughout the 1930s, Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as, [[women’s rights]], access to [[birth control]], "civil divorce laws", and an end to capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stringer-Hye |first=Richard |title=Charles Francis Potter |work=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Historical Society |url=http://wWorldWarII5.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charlesfrancispotter.html |accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond B. Bragg]], the associate editor of ''The New Humanist'', sought to consolidate the input of [[Leon Milton Birkhead]], [[Charles Francis Potter]], and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference. Bragg asked [[Roy Wood Sellars]] to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' in 1933. Potter's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, the latter declaring a new religion by saying, "any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present." It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.

In 1941, the [[American Humanist Association]] was organised. Noted members of The AHA included [[Isaac Asimov]], who was the president from 1985 until his death in 1992, and writer [[Kurt Vonnegut]], who followed as honorary president until his death in 2007. [[Gore Vidal]] became honorary president in 2009. [[Robert Buckman]] was the head of the association in Canada, and is now an honorary president.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

After World War II, three prominent Humanists became the first directors of major divisions of the United Nations: [[Julian Huxley]] of [[UNESCO]], [[Brock Chisholm]] of the [[World Health Organization]], and [[John Boyd-Orr]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html American Humanist Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020812090133/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |date=12 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[American Humanist Association]], along with other groups representing agnostics, atheists, and other freethinkers, joined to create the [[Secular Coalition for America]] which advocates in Washington, D.C., for [[separation of church and state]] and nationally for the greater acceptance of nontheistic Americans. The Executive Director of Secular Coalition for America is Larry T. Decker.

"Renaissance humanism" is the name later given to a tradition of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors, book collectors, educators, and writers, who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as ''umanisti''{{snds}}"humanists".&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education, which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic. [[Scholasticism]] focused on preparing men to be doctors, lawyers or professional theologians, and was taught from approved textbooks in logic, natural philosophy, medicine, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; There were important centres of humanism at [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].

Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it. They sought to create a citizenry (frequently including women) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' [New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965], p. 178.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's ''Renaissance Thought I'', "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion'' 17 (1944–45):  346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As a program to revive the cultural{{snds}}and particularly the literary{{snds}}legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity, Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] or [[Erasmus]] as is still sometimes popularly believed.&lt;ref&gt;Vito Giustiniani gives as an example of an out-dated, but still pervasive view, that of Corliss Lamont, who described Renaissance Humanism as, "first and foremost a revolt against the otherworldliness of mediaeval Christianity, a turning away from preoccupation with personal immortality to make the best of life in this world. Renaissance writers like Rabelais and Erasmus gave eloquent voice to this new joy of living and to the sheer exuberance of existence. For the Renaissance the ideal human being was no longer the ascetic monk, but a new type – the universal man  the many-sided personality delighting in every kind of this-earthly achievements. The great Italian artists, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, typified this ideal." (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism": 192.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-theistic worldviews===
====Secular humanists====
{{main|Secular humanism}}

[[File:Happyman.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.25|The Humanist "happy human" logo]]

Secular humanism is a comprehensive [[life stance]] or [[world view]] which embraces human [[reason]], [[metaphysical naturalism]], [[altruism|altruistic]] [[morality]] and [[distributive justice]], and consciously rejects [[supernatural]] claims, [[ethical monotheism|theistic]] [[faith]] and [[religiosity]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="americanhumanist"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwords |first=Fred |title=What Is Humanism? |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |year=1989 |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=19 August 2009 |quote=Secular Humanism is an outgrowth of eighteenth century enlightenment rationalism and nineteenth century freethought... Secular and Religious Humanists both share the same worldview and the same basic principles... From the standpoint of philosophy alone, there is no difference between the two. It is only in the definition of religion and in the practice of the philosophy that Religious and Secular Humanists effectively disagree. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130233229/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |archivedate=30 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }} A decidedly anti-theistic version of secular humanism, however, is developed by Adolf Grünbaum, 'In Defense of Secular Humanism' (1995), in his ''Collected Works'' (edited by Thomas Kupka), vol. I, New York: Oxford University Press 2013, ch. 6 (pp. 115{{ndash}}48)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humaniststudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection)|publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies|url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html|archive-date=18 January 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as Humanism (with a capital H and no [[grammatical modifier|qualifying]] adjective).

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] ([[IHEU]]) is the world union of 117 Humanist, rationalist, [[irreligious]], [[atheistic]], [[Brights movement|Bright]], [[secular]], [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]], and [[freethought]] organisations in 38 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/story/humanist-movement-hits-new-high-membership |title=Humanist movement hits new high in membership. |publisher=iheu.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Happy Human]]" is the official symbol of the IHEU as well as being regarded as a universally recognised symbol for secular humanism.

According to the IHEU's bylaw 5.1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/bylaws |title=IHEU's Bylaws |accessdate=5 July 2008 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the [[natural and legal rights|right]] and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not [[theism|theistic]], and it does not accept [[supernatural]] views of reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Religious humanists====
{{main|Religious humanism}}
"Religious humanists" are non-superstitious people who nevertheless see ethical humanism as their religion, and who seek to integrate (secular) humanist ethical philosophy with congregational [[ritual]]s centred on human needs, interests, and abilities. Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of "humanism" until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history. A unified [[Ethical Culture]] movement was first founded in 1876; its founder, [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]] was a former member of the [[Free Religious Association]], and conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern. Nowadays religious humanists in the United States are represented by organisations such as the [[American Ethical Union]], and will simply describe themselves as "ethical humanists" or "humanists". Secular humanists and religious humanists organise together as part of larger national and international groupings, and differentiate themselves primarily in their attitude to the promotion of humanist thinking.

Earlier attempts at inventing a secular religious tradition informed the Ethical Culture movement. The [[Cult of Reason]] ({{lang-fr|Culte de la Raison}}) was a religion based on [[deism]] devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was turned into a "[[Temple of Reason]]" and for a time [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]] replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.&lt;ref name="Herrick"&gt;James A. Herrick, "The Making of the New Spirituality", InterVarsity Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8308-3279-3}}, p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, [[Auguste Comte]], the Father of Sociology, founded [[Positivism]], a "religion of humanity".&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"&gt;{{cite web | title=Humanism as the Next Step | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html | accessdate=25 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195856/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |archivedate = 14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"/&gt;

The distinction between so-called "ethical" humanists and "secular" humanists is most pronounced in the United States, although it is becoming less so over time. The philosophical distinction is not reflected at all in Canada, Latin America, Africa, or Asia, or most of Europe. In the UK, where the humanist movement was strongly influenced by Americans in the 19th century, the leading "ethical societies" and "ethical churches" evolved into secular humanist charities (e.g. the British Ethical Union became the British Humanist Association and later [[Humanists UK]]). In Scandinavian countries, "Human-etik" or "[[:no:humanetikk|humanetikk]]" (roughly synonymous with ethical humanism) is a popular strand within humanism, originating from the works of Danish philosopher [[Harald Høffding]]. The Norwegian Humanist Association belongs to this tendency, known as [[Human-Etisk Forbund]] (literally "Human-Ethical League"). Over time, the emphasis on ''human-etisk'' has become less pronounced, and today HEF promotes both "humanisme" and "human-etisk". In Sweden, the main Swedish humanist group [[Humanisterna]] ("Humanists") began as a "human-ethical association", like the Norwegian humanists, before adopting the more prevalent secular humanist model popular in most of Europe. Today the distinction in Europe is mostly superficial.

The modern Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai International practices what has been called "Nichiren Humanism", based on txhe Lotus Sutra's focus on self-development and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seagar |first1=Richard |title=Buddhism In America |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia Uniiversity Press |isbn=978-0-231-15973-9 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns. Early 20th century critics such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[T.&amp;nbsp;E. Hulme]], and [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]] considered humanism to be sentimental "slop" (Hulme){{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--double check please--&gt; or "an old bitch gone in the teeth" (Pound).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] critics who are self-described [[antihumanism|anti-humanists]], such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Michel Foucault]], have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal [[human nature]], which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. "Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal", suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls "a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, philosopher [[Kate Soper]]&lt;ref&gt;in ''Humanism and Anti-humanism (Problems of Modern European Thought)'' (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Press, 1986, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently "secretes a humanist rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Humanism'' (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics "humanist anti-humanists". Critics of antihumanism, most notably [[Jürgen Habermas]], counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas accepts some criticisms leveled at traditional humanism but believes that humanism must be rethought and revised rather than simply abandoned.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like the German philosopher [[Heidegger]] considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German "race" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists.&lt;ref&gt;"The antihhumanist Humanism of Heidegger and the humanist antihumanism of Foucault and Althusser" (Davies [1997]), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century "it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them". For "it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason". Yet, he continues, "it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1997), pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern humanists, such as [[Corliss Lamont]] or [[Carl Sagan]], hold that humanity must seek for truth through reason and the best observable evidence and endorse [[scientific skepticism]] and the [[scientific method]]. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong must be based on the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human.&lt;ref&gt;"Conscience, the sense of right and wrong and the insistent call of one's better, more idealistic, more social-minded self, is a social product. Feelings of right and wrong that at first have their locus within the family gradually develop into a pattern for the tribe or city, then spread to the larger unit of the nation, and finally from the nation to humanity as a whole. Humanism sees no need for resorting to supernatural explanations, or sanctions at any point in the ethical process" ({{Cite book |last=Lamont |first=Corliss |authorlink=Corliss Lamont |title=The Philosophy of Humanism, Eighth Edition |pages=252–53 |publisher=Humanist Press: Amherst, New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-931779-07-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book |last=Kurtz |first=Paul |title=Humanist manifesto 2000 : a call for a new planetary humanism |year=2000 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=157392783X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] cautioned: "The prophecy of [[Francis Bacon]] has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts".&lt;ref&gt;''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, [1925] 1997) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentientist philosophers criticise humanism for focusing too strongly, sometimes even exclusively, on the human species. They propose [[Sentientism]] as an extension of humanism that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings - those capable of experiencing. Sentient beings include humans and most non-human animals and could potentially include artificial or alien intelligences.

== Humanistic psychology ==
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}

Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic theory and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism]]. The approach emphasizes an individual's inherent drive towards [[self-actualization]] and creativity.  Psychologists [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]] introduced a positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s. Other sources include the philosophies of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

[[File:IfU Logo.jpg|right|thumb|400px]]
'''''Institut für Unternehmenskybernetik''''' (abbreviated '''''IfU'''''), is a German research institution dedicated to advancing the study of [[Entrepreneurial cybernetics]] and [[management cybernetics]], founded in 1988 and located in [[Aachen]], Germany.

== Overview ==
[[File:rwth.png|left|thumb|200px]]
The IfU is a widely dispersed networked institute, composed of members from exceedingly differentiated disciplines. As an affiliated institute of the [[RWTH Aachen University]] since 2003, the IfU is in constant contact with numerous other institutes associated with the university (e.g. Textile Technologies, the Research Institute for Rationalisation, and the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology). Moreover, the IfU is a member association of the AiF (German Federation of Industrial Research Associations), representing the 'management cybernetics' sector, and is therefore a contact partner for many interdisciplinary research projects. As an application orientated research institute, the IfU has been developing methods and tools specifically designed to fit the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises since 1988. In doing so it pursues the principal ‘out of the practice for the practice’ with an inductive research paradigm:{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

:''"In interdisciplinary research projects we seek to develop practical solutions with the aid of our research partners.  These solutions will be implemented and evaluated in all enterprises concerned.  The theories of [[Stafford Beer]], [[Frederic Vester]], [[Fredmund Malik]], [[Klaus Henning]] as well as [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] (amongst others) form the scientific bases of our work."''

== Entrepreneurial Cybernetics ==
Introducing the institute, IfU focuses on the interaction between people, technology and organisations taking place within small to medium-sized enterprises. The Institute for Management of Cybernetics regards businesses as living systems, which convert information and resources into products or services through a series of compound processes. As a practice orientated and interdisciplinary science, the IfU aims to optimize these business processes by means of development and publishing of scientifically proven methods. The procedures implemented are always based on cybernetic principles- and in particular on the idea of a control loop, or feedback. This means that internal business processes are not straightforward input-output relationships but are constantly being influenced and changed by their own outcomes, i.e. they are recursive. Such a principal can have both aiding and debilitating effects but the IfU aims to help businesses implement and use it profitably.

Being able to recognise enterprises as open, socio-technological, economic, multifaceted and networked systems, the IfU helps to describe and explain the complex phenomena which occur within these contexts.

== Cooperation ==

The Institute for Management Cybernetics e.V. (IfU) forms an institute cluster with the Center for Learning and Knowledge Management and the Department of Information Management in Mechanical Engineering at the RWTH Aachen University.

The IfU carried out projects in several areas of expertise; these cover cost-effectiveness, micro and start-up enterprises, co-operations processes and change management and are explained below in more detail.

===Cost Effectiveness===

When estimating cost-effectiveness, the IfU places emphasis on both hard factors (e.g. costs, time) and soft factors (e.g. employee motivation and the communication culture) in its approach to economic appraisal. Following this initiative, an extensive overview of a business can be achieved. The NOWS technique (use-orientated cost-effectiveness evaluation) is one of the main software tools developed by IfU, as a means of helping enterprises make a profitability analysis. Because falsely estimated investments can steer companies towards crisis situations, it is very important that every decision maker considers all factors before making an investment. The software tool creates a graph based on all the factors integrated into the system, and as a result presents the enterprises with the best possible option of investment. Diverse aspects are considered in the analysis, leaving little to no room for insecurities; a stable investment scenario is presented.

Consequently, several projects profited from this method; NowBITs - investments in computing services were valued and a code of practice was compiled. AutoPreforms - the efficient manufacture of fibre reinforced composites in the car industry.

===Micro and start-up enterprises===

For over ten years, the IfU has been aiming to find solutions in helping micro and start-up enterprises with the management of resources. Once the start-up incentives have phased-out, many young businesses reach a critical stage which is marked by a high number of bankruptcies. The reasons for failure of young businesses are multifaceted but are often associated with lack of experience. An exemplary undertaking is the Jungunternehmen Project - a method map was developed to provide the enterprises that reach this critical stage with the necessary support.

===Co-operation Processes===

Additionally, with the intent to help enterprises use limited resources more efficiently by converting relevant information into applicable knowledge, the IfU researches success factors in co-operations processes and co-ordinates corresponding joint projects. To illustrate the work carried out in this field, in project SENEKA (Service networks for Education and Further Education ) the IfU has co-ordinated the cross-sectional task of innovation management.

===Change Management===

As stipulated previously, the IfU carried out several projects in the field of change management to help organisations adapt to the fluctuating market conditions. CuBa Change is one of the newer developments. The project’s objective is to develop a practical and easy process of quality-orientated safeguard and adoption of Changes Processes for SMEs, whilst abiding by the more fundamental features of corporate culture. In this way a management-specific situational analysis of Change-Proposals will be enabled, increasing the likelihood of success and the ability to cope with the constant need to adapt to change.

'''Katoptronophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] for [[mirror]]s (the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for ''mirror'' is ''katoptron'').  It may include activities such as [[sexual intercourse|having sex]] in front of mirrors, [[masturbating]] in front of mirrors, enacting other paraphilias in front of a mirror, having an [[Group sex|orgy]] in front of a mirror, or enacting stripping fetishism in front of mirrors.

Enacting katoptronophiliac fantasies may involve constructing environments for erotic activity in which one is completely surrounded by mirrors, sometimes including even on the ceiling.  A person who is a ''katoptronophiliac'' may put mirrors all over their house so they can have sex in any room in the house.

Many [[pornographic films]] show [[porn stars]] having sex in front of mirrors.
Many people enjoy having sex in front of mirrors and have mirrors in their bedrooms in which they can watch themselves have sex. They sometimes engage in this activity for their personal enjoyment. On a deeper level this could relate to the person's need to reflect and critique themselves, and also being on a mental state of [[narcissism]].  The person often is solely absorbed in themselves and likes to watch their actions so as to admire.

==Katoptronophilia in popular culture==
'''[[Music]]'''

* [[Rhythm and blues|RnB]] singer [[Ne-Yo]] included a song on his debut album ''[[In My Own Words]]'' entitled "Mirror", describing the fetish.
* In the film, ''[[The Dreamers (film)|The Dreamers]]'', from Bernardo Bertolucci, there is a scene in which one of the main characters practices the fetish.
*The film [[American Psycho (film)]] also contains a scene in which the protagonist, [[Patrick Bateman]] admires himself in the mirror whilst having intercourse with two escort girls, one of whom tries to get his attention shortly afterwards, apparently unsuccessfully, implying Bateman's fixation on his own image.

'''Manipulation check''' is a term in [[experimental research]] in the [[social science]]s which refers to certain kinds of secondary evaluations of an experiment.

== Overview ==
Manipulation checks are measured variables that show what the manipulated variables concurrently affect besides the dependent variable of interest.

In experiments, an experimenter manipulates some aspect of a process or task and [[Random assignment|randomly assigns]] subjects to different levels of the manipulation ("experimental conditions"). The experimenter then observes whether variation in the manipulated variables cause differences in the [[dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]. Manipulation checks are targeted at variables beside the dependent variable of interest.

Manipulations are not intended to verify that the manipulated factor caused variation in the dependent variable.  This is verified by random assignment, manipulation before measurement of the dependent variable, and [[statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]] of effect of the manipulated variable on the dependent variable.  Thus, a failed manipulation check does not refute the hypothesis that the manipulation caused variation in the dependent variable.

In contrast, a successful manipulation check can help an experimenter rule out reasons that a manipulation may have failed to influence a dependent variable.  When a manipulation creates significant differences between experimental conditions in both (1) the dependent variable and (2) the measured manipulation check variable, the interpretation is that (1) the manipulation "causes" variation in the dependent variable (the "effect") and (2) the manipulation also explains variation in some other, more theoretically obvious measured variable that it is expected to concurrently influence, which assists in ''interpreting'' the "cause" (i.e., it only help interpret the "cause"; it is not necessary to ''affirm'' that the "cause" ''causes'' an effect).{{Clarify|date=August 2016}}

'''Marine ecoregions''' are [[ecoregion]]s (ecological regions) of the [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s identified and defined based on [[biogeographic]] characteristics.

==Introduction==
A more complete definition describes them as “Areas of relatively homogeneous species composition, clearly distinct from adjacent systems” dominated by “a small number of ecosystems and/or a distinct suite of oceanographic or topographic features”. Ecologically they “are strongly cohesive units, sufficiently large to encompass ecological or life history processes for most sedentary species.”&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;Spalding, Mark D., Helen E. Fox, Gerald R. Allen, Nick Davidson et al. "Marine Ecoregions of the World: A Bioregionalization of Coastal and Shelf Areas". Bioscience Vol. 57 No. 7, July/August 2007, pp. 573–583.[http://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/bioscience/57/7/10.1641_B570707/3/57-7-573.pdf?Expires=1484610727&amp;Signature=XYF4SP8EUihI-sTDvmf65b0NlH9f2XUORgslN8hcINKG08LsR1~j09N1Ore6Uxb6KpvLzoqZm-DTCwJIqojSKm-EUdzTDGXjG4X0528teZe7KpEhwBxIE3MsBSgurcuDVnCUVewcgFXchiQIiOTMPxMGh58PynDEy9js8suNnww9f-CvmAUVB~CYOjM2XY~qSO3njZx4q5tJZrqhoqWy3wAT52hmK7vcAgyLMFNnzB7rAoMp2UDoixN5FKgPWbL9l-pK6nZvMriyRFqHbEurd8-QoDhYgZm5NsQDkbhHuTKZ4av5y9lXCxRnTylJbpnbe9qIdiUncnT9eHfTLu69Zg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine Ecoregions of the World—MEOW==
The global classification system '''Marine Ecoregions of the World—MEOW''' was devised by an international team, including major conservation organizations, academic institutions and intergovernmental organizations.&lt;ref name="Spalding" /&gt;  The digital ecoregions layer is available for download as an ArcGIS Shapefile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/ecoregional.shapefile/MEOW/view.html MEOW digital ecoregions layer: ArcGIS Shapefile download link]&lt;/ref&gt;

This system has a strong biogeographic basis, but was designed to aid in [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] activities for [[marine ecosystems]]. 

===Subdivisions===
====Ecoregions====
The Marine Ecoregions of the World classification defines 232 marine ecoregions (e.g. [[Adriatic Sea]], [[Cortezian]], [[Ningaloo]], [[Ross Sea]]) for the coastal and [[Continental shelf|shelf]] waters of the world. 

====Provinces====
These marine ecoregions form part of a nested system and are grouped into 62 provinces (e.g. the [[South China Sea]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Indian Ocean|Central Indian Ocean Islands]]).

====Realms====
The provinces in turn, are grouped into 12 major realms. The latter are considered analogous to the eight terrestrial [[ecozones]], represent large regions of the ocean basins: 
# [[Arctic realm|Arctic]]
# Temperate Northern Atlantic
# [[Temperate Northern Pacific]]
# [[Tropical Atlantic]]
# [[Western Indo-Pacific]]
# [[Central Indo-Pacific]]
# Eastern Indo-Pacific
# [[Tropical Eastern Pacific]]
# Temperate South America
# Temperate Southern Africa
# Temperate Australasia
# [[Southern Ocean]]

==Other marine ecoregion classifications==
Other classifications of marine ecoregions or equivalent areas have been widely developed at national and regional levels, as well as a small number of global schemes. 

Each of these systems, along with numerous regional biogeographic classifications, was used to inform the MEOW system. The WWF Global 200 work also identifies a number of major habitat types that correspond to the terrestrial [[biomes]]: polar, temperate shelves and seas, temperate upwelling, tropical upwelling, tropical coral, pelagic (trades and westerlies), abyssal, and hadal (ocean trench).

;Briggs Coastal Provinces
One of the most comprehensive early classifications was the system of 53 coastal provinces developed by Briggs in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs JC (1974) Marine Zoogeography. McGraw-Hill, New York, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The near-global system of 64 [[large marine ecosystem]]s has a partial biogeographic basis. 

;WWF Global 200
The [[World Wildlife Fund]]—WWF identified 43 [[List of marine ecoregions|priority marine ecoregions]], as part of its Global 200 efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Olson DM, Dinerstein E. 2002; "The Global 200: priority ecoregions for conservation"; Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 89: 199-224&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DSC04629 Istanbul - Sehzade camii - Foto G. Dall'Orto 29-5-2006.jpg|thumb|The later plain type hanging in [[Istanbul]]]]

'''Mosque lamps''' of [[enamelled glass]], often with [[gilding]], survive in considerable numbers from the [[Islamic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], especially the 13th and 14th centuries, with [[Cairo]] in Egypt and [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] in Syria the most important centres of production.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 134&lt;/ref&gt;  They are [[oil lamp]]s, usually with a large round bulbous body rising to a narrower waist, above which the top section is flared.  There is usually a foot so they can be placed on a surface, but they were normally used suspended by chains that went through a number of loops on the outside of the body.  They were used to light mosques and other buildings in mosque complexes, in large spaces in groups hanging from a circular metal frame.  The circular frames continue to be used in many mosques today, but with plain or frosted glass lamps for electric lighting.

==Manufacture==
The techniques used are typical of contemporary [[Islamic glass]], with the enamel decoration applied to a pre-fired plain body, and the whole then fired for a second time. 
The coloured decoration may include [[Qur'anic]] verses, especially the first part of the ''[[Ayat an-Nur]]'' or "Verse of Light" (24:35, see below), inscriptions and heraldic emblems recording the donor, as well as purely decorative motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Mitchell, 134; [http://www.wallacecollection.org/whatson/treasure/38 A mid-14th-century Islamic glass mosque lamp from Cairo (XXVB94)] [[Wallace Collection]]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 15th century production of all types of fine glass was in steep decline, a sign of which is that in 1569 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Grand Vizier]] [[Sokullu Mehmed Pacha]] ordered 600 plain lamps of [[Venetian glass]], perhaps to be decorated elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O821/mosque-lamp/ Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottomans]] also made lamps of similar form in [[Iznik pottery]], and [[Shah Abbas I]] of Persia gave plain silver lamps to hang by the tomb of [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili|Shaykh Safi]] at [[Ardabil]]; [[Persian miniature]]s show other examples from the 16th century in gold or brass and silver.  Such opaque materials were much less effective as lighting, but the purpose of the lamp was symbolic as well as practical, related to the "Verse of Light".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/m/ottoman_mosque_lamp.aspx Lamp for the Ottoman restoration of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem], British Museum; Canby, 85, 180; Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosque lamps are often shown in profile at the head of a [[prayer rug]] for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  The decoration of the lamps often includes either the name or the symbol from [[Islamic heraldry]] of the donor, who usually gave a group of lamps.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Jones &amp; Mitchell, 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;  Other types of lighting in mosques were large metal lamp stands, like very wide candlesticks, which were also used in secular buildings.  These could be very intricately decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later types==
[[File:Amman BW 33.JPG|thumb|Modern electric lighting in [[Amman]]]]
The elaborate decorated types were mostly succeeded by plain glass oil lamps with a simple rim at the top, by which they were attached to (typically) a circular metal bar. Often these hang in tiers. Mosques today typically retain the hanging circular fittings, but use electric lights and glass shades of various sorts, not essentially different from other glass [[lampshade]]s used in lighting other buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26713">The concept of '''motor cognition''' grasps the notion that [[cognition]] is embodied in action, and that the [[motor system]] participates in what is usually considered as mental processing, including those involved in [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Sommerville 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Sommerville | first1 = JA. | last2 = Decety | first2 = J. | title = Weaving the fabric of social interaction: articulating developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience in the domain of motor cognition. | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–200 |date=Apr 2006 | doi = 10.3758/BF03193831 | pmid = 16892982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental unit of the motor cognition paradigm is action, defined as the movements produced to satisfy an intention towards a specific [[motor goal]], or in reaction to a meaningful event in the physical and social environments. Motor cognition takes into account the preparation and production of actions, as well as the processes involved in recognizing, predicting, mimicking and understanding the behavior of other people. This paradigm has received a great deal of attention and empirical support in recent years from a variety of research domains including [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[social psychology]].

==Perception-action coupling==
The idea of a continuity between the different aspects of motor cognition is not new. In fact, this idea can be traced to the work of the American psychologist [[William James]] and more recently, American neurophysiologist and Nobel prize winner [[Roger Sperry]]. Sperry argued that the perception–action cycle is the fundamental logic of the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sperry | first1 = R.W. | year = 1952 | title = Neurology and the mind-brain problem | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 291–312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perception and action processes are functionally intertwined: [[perception]] is a means to action and [[Action (philosophy)|action]] is a means to perception. Indeed, the vertebrate brain has evolved for governing motor activity with the basic function to transform sensory patterns into patterns of motor coordination.

More recently, there is growing empirical evidence from cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, [[Cognitive model#Behavioral dynamics|cognitive science]], as well as social psychology which demonstrates that perception and action share common computational codes and underlying neural architectures. This evidence has been marshaled in the "[[common coding theory]]" put forward by [[Wolfgang Prinz]] and his colleagues at the [[Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prinz | first1 = W. | year = 1997 | title = Perception and action planning | url = | journal = European Journal of Cognitive Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 129–154 | doi=10.1080/713752551}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory claims parity between perception and action. Its core assumption is that actions are coded in terms of the perceivable effects (i.e., the distal perceptual events) they should generate.&lt;ref name="Hommel 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Hommel | first1 = B. | last2 = Müsseler | first2 = J. | last3 = Aschersleben | first3 = G. | last4 = Prinz | first4 = W. | title = The Theory of Event Coding (TEC): a framework for perception and action planning. | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 849–78; discussion 878–937 |date=Oct 2001 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.77.9446  | pmid = 12239891 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x01000103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performing a [[Motion (physics)|movement]] leaves behind a bidirectional association between the motor pattern it has generated by and the sensory effects that it produces. Such an association can then be used backwards to retrieve a movement by anticipating its effects. These perception/action codes are also accessible during action observation. Other authors suggest a new notion of the phylogenetic and ontogenetic origin of action understanding that utilizes the motor system; motor cognition hypothesis. This states that motor cognition provides both human and nonhuman primates with a direct, prereflexive understanding of biological actions that match their own action catalog.&lt;ref name="Gallese 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gallese | first1 = V. | last2 = Rochat | first2 = M. | last3 = Cossu | first3 = G. | last4 = Sinigaglia | first4 = C. | title = Motor cognition and its role in the phylogeny and ontogeny of action understanding. | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–13 |date=Jan 2009 | doi = 10.1037/a0014436 | pmid = 19209994 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.379.8550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of [[mirror neurons]] in the ventral premotor and parietal cortices of the macaque monkey that fire both when it carries out a goal-directed action and when it observes the same action performed by another individual provides [[neurophysiological]] evidence for a direct matching between action perception and action production.&lt;ref name="Rizzolatti 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Craighero | first2 = L. | title = The mirror-neuron system. | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue =  | pages = 169–92 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144230 | pmid = 15217330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such coupling is the ease with which people can engage in [[speech repetition]] when asked to [[speech shadowing|shadow]] words heard in earphones.&lt;ref name="Marslen-Wilson 1973"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Marslen-Wilson | first1 = W. | title = Linguistic structure and speech shadowing at very short latencies. | journal = Nature | volume = 244 | issue = 5417 | pages = 522–3 |date=Aug 1973 | doi =  10.1038/244522a0| pmid = 4621131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, common neural activation during action observation and execution has been well documented. A variety of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), positron emission tomography, and [[magnetoencephalography]] have demonstrated that a motor resonance mechanism in the premotor and posterior parietal cortices occurs when participants observe or produce goal directed actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grèzes | first1 = J. | last2 = Armony | first2 = J.

==Shared representations between other and self==
The common coding theory also states that perception of an action should activate action representations to the degree that the perceived and the represented action are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knoblich | first1 = G. | last2 = Flach | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = Predicting the effects of actions: interactions of perception and action | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 467–472 | doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00387| pmid = 11760133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, these representations may be shared between individuals. Indeed, the meaning of a given object, action, or social situation may be common to several people and activate corresponding distributed patterns of neural activity in their respective brains.&lt;ref name="Decety 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Sommerville | first2 = JA. | title = Shared representations between self and other: a social cognitive neuroscience view. | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 12 | pages = 527–33 |date=Dec 2003 | doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2003.10.004 | pmid = 14643368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an impressive number of behavioral and neurophysiological studies demonstrating that perception and action have a common neuronal coding and that this leads to shared representations between self and others, which can lead to host of phenomena such as [[emotional contagion]], [[empathy]], social facilitation, and understanding others minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blakemore | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Frith | first2 = C.D. | year = 2005 | title = The role of motor contagion in the prediction of action | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 260–267 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.11.012 | pmid=15707910| citeseerx = 10.1.1.130.2472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motor priming==
One consequence of the functional equivalence between perception and action is that watching an action performed by another person facilitates the later reproduction of that action in the observer. For instance, in one study, participants executed arm movements while observing either a robot or another human producing the same or qualitatively different arm movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kilner | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Paulignan | first2 = Y. | last3 = Blakemore | first3 = S.J. | year = 2003 | title = An interference effect of observed biological movement on action | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 522–525 | doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(03)00165-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that observing another human make incongruent movements interferes with movement execution but observing a robotic arm making incongruent movements does not.

==Social facilitation==
The fact that the observation of action can prime a similar response in the observer, and that the degree to which the observed action facilitates a similar response in the observer cast some light into the phenomenon called [[social facilitation]], first described by [[Robert Zajonc]], which accounts for the demonstration that the presence of other people can affect individual performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chartrand | first1 = T.L. | last2 = Bargh | first2 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = The chameleon effect: The perception-behavior link and social interaction | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 76 | issue = 6| pages = 893–910 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.76.6.893 | pmid=10402679}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies have demonstrated that watching facial expression of emotions prompts the observer to resonate with the state of another individual, with the observer activating the motor representations and associated autonomic and somatic responses that stem from the observed target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hatfield | first1 = E. | last2 = Cacioppo | first2 = J.T. | last3 = Rapson | first3 = R.L. | year = 1993 | title = Emotional contagion | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 96–99 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental state understanding==
Humans have a tendency to interpret the actions of others with respect to underlying mental states. One important question is whether the perception-action matching mechanism and its product, shared motor representations, can account (or to what extent it does) for the attribution of mental states to others (often dubbed [[theory of mind]] mechanism). Some authors have suggested that the shared representations network that stems from the perception-action matching mechanism may support mental state attribution via covert (i.e., non conscious) mental simulation.&lt;ref name="Gallese 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Gallese | first1 = V. | last2 = Goldman | first2 = A. | title = Mirror neurons and the simulation theory of mind-reading | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 493–501 |date=Dec 1998 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01262-5 | pmid = 21227300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, some other scholars have argued that the mirror system and the theory of mind system are two distinct processes and it’s likely that the former cannot account for mental state understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saxe | first1 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Against simulation: the argument from error | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 174–179 | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2005.01.012 | pmid=15808499| citeseerx = 10.1.1.318.3655 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Decety 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Michalska | first2 = KJ. | last3 = Akitsuki | first3 = Y. | title = Who caused the pain?

==Cognition and action==
To understand the relationship between cognition and action, Cherie L. Gerstadt, Yoon Joo Hong and Adele Diamond of University of Pennsylvania carried out a ''Stroop like day-night test'' &lt;ref name = "Stroop"&gt;{{Cite journal | editor=C. Brainerd | title = A review of the day–night task: The Stroop paradigm and interference control in young children| volume = 30 | issue = 3| year = 2010 | pages = 257–330 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273229710000298 | doi=10.1016/j.dr.2010.07.001 | journal=Developmental Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; on children between the age of 3&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; - 7 years. They tested one hundred and sixty children on a task that requires inhibitory control of action plus learning and remembering two rules. They found that the response latency decreased from 3&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; to 4&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; years. They concluded that the requirement to learn and remember two rules is not in itself sufficient to account for the poor performance of the younger children.&lt;ref name = "Cognition and Action"&gt;{{Cite journal | editor=Gerry T. M Altmann | title = The relationship between cognition and action: performance of children 312–7 years old on a stroop- like day-night test| volume = 53 | issue = 2| year = 1994 | pages = 91–180 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002779490068X | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(94)90068-X | journal=Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vygotsky’s Theory of Cognitive Development tells us that children are more likely to be cognitively advanced if they are more physically active. This is because playing and physical activity allows children to branch out into new situations and helps them learn strategies for learning new information&lt;ref name="Simply Psychology"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul|title=Lev Vygotsky|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/vygotsky.html|website=Simply Psychology|publisher=Simply Psychology|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasoning==
A series of experiments demonstrated the interrelation between motor experience and high-level reasoning. For example, although most individuals recruit visual processes when presented with spatial problems such as mental rotation tasks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyun | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Luck | first2 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Visual working memory as the substrate for mental rotation | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 154–158 | doi=10.3758/bf03194043}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor experts favor motor processes to perform the same tasks, with higher overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;"Moreau, D. (2012). The role of motor processes in three-dimensional mental rotation: Shaping cognitive processing via sensorimotor experience. ''Learning and Individual Differences'', 22(3), 354-359"&lt;/ref&gt; A related study showed that motor experts use similar processes for the mental rotation of body parts and polygons, whereas non-experts treated these stimuli differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | year = 2013a | title = Constraining movement alters the recruitment of motor processes in mental rotation | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 224 | issue = 3| pages = 447–454 | doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3324-0| pmid = 23138523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results were not due to underlying confounds, as demonstrated by a training study which showed mental rotation improvements after a one-year motor training, compared with controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | last2 = Clerc | first2 = J. | last3 = Mansy-Dannay | first3 = A. | last4 = Guerrien | first4 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Enhancing spatial ability through sport practice: Evidence for an effect of motor training on mental rotation performance | url = | journal = Journal of Individual Differences | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 83–88 | doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns were also found in working memory tasks, with the ability to remember movements being greatly disrupted by a secondary verbal task in controls and by a motor task in motor experts, suggesting the involvement of different processes to store movements depending on motor experience, namely verbal for controls and motor for experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | year = 2013b | title = Motor expertise modulates movement processing in working memory | url = | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 142 | issue = 3| pages = 356–361 | doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.01.011| pmid = 23422289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mirror neurons==
Recent discoveries in the field of [[social neuroscience]] have heavily implicated [[mirror neuron]]s and their related systems as a possible neurological basis for [[social cognition]] specifically factors which involve motor cognition. In chimpanzees (the closest living relative to humans) mirror neuron systems have been shown to be highly active when the ape is observing another individual (ape or human) perform a physical action such as grasping, holding, or hitting.&lt;ref name="Marco"&gt;{{Cite journal

A study by Spunt and Liberman (2013) used an fMRI study to observe mirror neurons in the brain. Participants observed a video of an action being performed under a high or low cognitive load. While watching, they were instructed to observe for why the action was being performed, what action was being performed, or how the action was being performed. The end result provided direct evidence for activation and more importantly automaticity of the mirror neurons in the dorsal premotor cortex, ventral premotor cortex and anterior Intraparietal sulcus.&lt;ref name="Spunt 80–86"/&gt;

Although there are large amounts of supporting evidence which indicate mirror neurons activate in situations where one is analyzing oneself to the actions of others,&lt;ref name="Sinigaglia 3–29"/&gt; there is still debate as to whether these activations should be interpreted as intentional understanding. Shannon Spaulding (2013) argues that the neuroscientists who offer up mirror neurons as a physiological answer to social cognition are misinterpreting their results and not using the correct philosophical definitions of goal and intention. Rather than being interchangeable or one leading to the other, she argues they need to be thought of two separate actions.&lt;ref name="Spaulding 233–257"/&gt;

The discovery of the link between mirror neurons and social cognition provides further links to a neurological basis found in other social phenomena such as [[social learning theory]], [[empathy]], and [[observational learning]].&lt;ref name="Marco"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Nathalie Bondil''' (February 19, 1967), who holds both Canadian and French citizenship, has been Director General and Chief Curator of the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] since 2007. She has worked at the museum since 1999, and is the first woman to be the museum's director.

== Quote ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am convinced that in the twenty-first century, culture will be to health what sports were in the twenthieth century: cultural experiences will be seen to contribute to our well-being the same way sports do to our physical conditioning... Art does one good. I am convinced."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Biography ==
Nathalie Bondil holds a degree in art history from the [[École du Louvre]]. She successfully passed the entry examination for the École nationale du Patrimoine de Paris in 1994, then graduated in 1996, thereby becoming ''Conservateur du patrimoine d'État''.

From 1996 to 1998, she worked at the [[Musée des Monuments Français]] (which now forms part of the [[Cité de l'architecture et du patrimoine]]) as curator in charge of museography for the galeries dedicated to the 17th to 20th centuries, as part of the museum's renovation.

In 1999, she was hired as curator for European art from 1800 to 1945, and in 2000, promoted to chief curator, taking charge of the Curatorial Department, Conservation, the Library, Archives, Publishing and Ehxibitions. She has been the Director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and its Chief Curator since 2007.

When she took over the helm of the MMFA, she launched a series of exhibitions that have distinguished the Museum on the international scene (exported in 35 cities over the last ten years) and innovative multidisciplinary programming: she invited fashion to the Museum (first retrospectives on ''Yves Saint Laurent'' and ''The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier,'' presented in 12 cities around the world); opened it up to world cultures (''Peru: Kingdoms of the Sun and the Moon''); revamped contemporary art programming (''1+1=1''; ''Peter Doig''); and has introduced music through exhibitions (''Warhol Live; Imagine; We Want Miles''), an ongoing collaboration with foundation-in-residence Arte Musica and the daring conversion of a heritage church into a 462-seat professional concert hall, Bourgie Hall, which presents around 150 concerts and welcomes around 50,000 spectators each year.

In 2011, with the addition of a 4th building, '''The Claire and Marc Bourgie Quebec and Canadian art Pavilion''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/museum-district/claire-and-marc-bourgie-pavilion/|title=Claire and Marc Bourgie Pavilion|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathalie Bondil and her team undertook the restoration and reinstallation of some 4,000 works from the collection, from world cultures to Old Masters and Canadian and contemporary art. This "reinvented Museum" includes an impressive Pavilion of Decorative Arts and Design that was recently reinstalled and an expanded '''sculpture garden'''.

In 2012, she also led the expansion of the new educational facilities for school groups and families – '''the Studios Art &amp; Education Michel de la Chenelière'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/education/studio-art-education-michel-de-la-cheneliere/|title=Studios Art &amp; Education Michel de la Chenelières|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the major gift of Michal and Renata Hornstein’s collection of 100 Old Masters, the Museum expanded again allowing for the overhaul of over 3,000 additional works: a fifth building, '''the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/museum-district/future-michal-and-renata-hornstein-pavilion-for-peace/|title=Pavilion for Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101005529/http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/museum-district/future-michal-and-renata-hornstein-pavilion-for-peace/|archivedate=2015-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to international art and education, was inaugurated in 2016. It houses '''the Michel de la Chenelière International Atelier for Education and Art Therapy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/frontpage-article/michel-de-la-cheneliere-international-atelier-for-education-and-art-therapy/|title=Michel de la Chenelière International Atelier for Education and Art-Therapy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will give unparalleled impulse to the Museum’s educational and social mission. The MMFA comprises the largest educational complex at a North American art museum.

Over the past 10 years, Nathalie Bondil has sought to assert the MMFA's social relevance through its culture of innovation, with its bold multidisciplinary approach, a focus on education and respect for the audiences, unifying values and innovative forms of cooperation. She has been striving to make the MMFA empathetic and humanist in its contributions to the education and well-being of citizens and their society; a pioneer in anticipating future needs and a laboratory for innovation.

Along with working with 450 community organizations, schools, universities and associations to become an accessible and democratic hub for the arts, the MMFA's Art and Health Advisory Committee chaired by Quebec’s Chief Scientist, Rémi Quirion (a first in a Canadian museum!), was set up to oversee all pilot projects and partnerships with hospitals and the scientific research community (Alzheimer Society, Heart Institute, Douglas Hospital Research Institute, CHU Sainte-Justine.). Under Nathalie Bondil's leadership, the MMFA has also hired a full-time art therapist (a first in a museum), opened two art therapy offices in the new Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace (another first) as well as an art hive (another first in a museum yet again) in partnership with Concordia University to provide a place for artistic expression that is free and open to all.

Nathalie Bondil is Vice-Chair of the Canada Council for the Arts; and a member of the boards of the Chambre de commerce du Montréal Métropolitain and the Council for Canadian American Relations, of the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), of the French &amp; American Museum Exchange (FRAME), the Canadian Art Museum Directors Organization (CAMDO), Fonderie Darling, Comité conseil - Chaire de recherche de l'UQÀM sur la gouvernance des musées et le droit de la culture, and Comité consultatif national des HEC (Montréal). She was Vice-Chair and a member of the programming Committee of the Société des célébrations du &lt;abbr&gt;375&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/abbr&gt; anniversaire de Montréal.

'''Norvaline''' (abbreviated as '''Nva''') is an [[amino acid]] with the formula CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H.  The compound is an isomer of the more common amino acid [[valine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/norvaline Merriam-Webster]  Retrieved 4 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Like most other [[α-amino acid]]s, norvaline is [[chiral]]. It is a white, water-soluble solid.

==Occurrence==
Norvaline is a [[Non-proteinogenic amino acids|non-proteinogenic]] unbranched-chain amino acid. It has previously been reported to be a natural component of an antifungal peptide of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''. Norvaline and other modified unbranched chain amino acids have received attention because they appear to be incorporated in some recombinant proteins found in ''[[E. coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soini J, Falschlehner C, Liedert C, Bernhardt J, Vuoristo J, Neubauer P |title=Norvaline is accumulated after a down-shift of oxygen in Escherichia coli W3110 |journal=Microbial Cell Factories |volume=7 |issue= |pages=30 |year=2008 |pmid=18940002 |pmc=2579280 |doi=10.1186/1475-2859-7-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[biosynthesis]] has been examined. The incorporation of Nva into peptides reflects the imperfect selectivity of the associated [[aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase]].  In [[Miller–Urey experiment]]s probing prebiotic synthesis of amino acids, norvaline, but also [[norleucine]], are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarez-Carreño C, Becerra A, Lazcano A |title=Norvaline and norleucine may have been more abundant protein components during early stages of cell evolution |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere |volume=43 |issue=4-5 |pages=363–75 | date=October  2013 |pmid=24013929 |doi=10.1007/s11084-013-9344-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norvaline is known to promote [[tissue regeneration]] and [[muscle growth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ming XF, Rajapakse AG, Carvas JM, Ruffieux J, Yang Z |title=Inhibition of S6K1 accounts partially for the anti-inflammatory effects of the arginase inhibitor L-norvaline |journal=BMC Cardiovascular Disorders |volume=9 |issue= |pages=12 |year=2009 |pmid=19284655 |pmc=2664787 |doi=10.1186/1471-2261-9-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to become a precursor in the penicillin biosynthetic pathway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reference.md/files/C005/mC005313.html reference.md]  Retrieved 4 September 2010{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kisumi M, Sugiura M, Chibata I |title=Biosynthesis of norvaline, norleucine, and homoisoleucine in Serratia marcescens |journal=Journal of Biochemistry |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=333–9 | date=August  1976 |pmid=794063 |url=http://jb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=794063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Norvaline and [[norleucine]] (one hydrocarbon group longer) both possess the [[Nor-|nor- prefix]] for historical reason, despite current conventional usage of the prefix to denote a missing hydrocarbon group (under which they would theoretically be called "dihomoalanine" and "trihomoalanine").  The name is not systematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Nomenclature and Symbolism For Amino Acids and Peptides | journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 595–624 | date = 1984|doi=10.1351/pac198456050595 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oculolinctus''', also known as '''"worming"''' or '''eyeball-licking fetishism''', refers to the  [[Paraphilia|paraphilic]] practice of licking [[eyeball]]s for erotic gratification. In mid-2013, English-language newspapers reported that this fetish had allegedly become popular in [[Japan]], where it was referred to as {{nihongo|''Gankyū name purei''|眼球舐めプレイ|4 = "eyeball licking play"}}.&lt;ref&gt;2013-06-07, [http://news.merumo.ne.jp/article/genre/1249531 小学生に眼球なめ変態プレイが大流行], 読めるモ&lt;/ref&gt; However, other media have reported that the existence of this practice is a [[hoax]] based on a story in a Japanese [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://no1.fccj.ne.jp/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=954 LICK THIS! Mark Schreiber ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57597395-1/blind-spot-how-a-hoax-about-eye-licking-went-global/|title=Blind spot: How a hoax about eye licking went global|publisher=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the originally reporting articles were corrected&lt;ref name="Moye" /&gt; or [[Retraction|retracted]]&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; as being possibly a hoax.

==Characteristics==
In 2013, oculolinctus reportedly became popular among teenagers in Japan, causing a significant rise in eye infections. According to a retracted article by ''[[The Guardian]]'', eyeball-licking was "seen as a new [[Baseball metaphors for sex|second-base]]; the thing you graduate to when kissing gets boring", possibly due to it being featured in a music video by the Japanese band [[Born (band)|Born]].&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heritage|first=Stuart|title=Eyeball-licking: the fetish that is making Japanese teenagers sick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/jun/14/eyeball-licking-fetish-japanese-teenagers-sick|accessdate=14 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further reports, e.g. in an article by the Huffington Post later corrected as a possible hoax, showed an increase in Japanese schoolchildren wearing eyepatches due to eye infections arising from the act, with one school finding one third of 12-year-old students admitting to engaging in oculolinctus.&lt;ref name="Moye"&gt;David Moye, 2013-06-12, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/eyeball-licking-pinkeye_n_3423985.html Eyeball Licking Causing Pinkeye In Japan]", ''The Huffington Post'' (later corrected as a hoax)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also accounts of this practice in the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=Waxman&gt;{{cite web|last=Waxman|first=Olivia B.|title=Eyeball-Licking Fetish Isn’t Just Disgusting, It Spreads Pink Eye|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/06/14/eyeball-licking-fetish-isnt-just-disgusting-it-spreads-pink-eye-too/|publisher=[[TIME]]|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks of licking an eyeball==
The practice is associated with significant health risks, as [[tongue]]s are coated with a film of microorganisms, which may cause infections in the eye, such as [[conjunctivitis]], [[herpes]] and [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]]. It also carries the risk of [[corneal abrasion]]&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; and corneal ulcers.&lt;ref name=Narcisse&gt;{{cite web|last=Narcisse|first=Quenton|title=Eyeball Licking: Japan's Craziest New Fetish|url=http://mashable.com/2013/06/14/eyeball-licking/|publisher=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral bacteria on the tongue can potentially enter corneal scratches caused by licking the eye, which then lead to infection.&lt;ref&gt;Ashik Siddique, 2013-06-12, "[http://www.medicaldaily.com/articles/16481/20130612/eyeball-licking-oculolinctus-japanese-teenagers-spreads-pink-eye.htm Eyeball Licking ‘Oculolinctus’ Fetish Spreads Pink Eye Among Japanese Preteens]", ''Medical Daily''&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is also the risk of [[blindness]] from the resulting infections, as well as [[styes]]. The difference in bacteria between the eye and mouth is why it is no longer recommended to lick [[contact lens]]es before they are inserted into one's eye.&lt;ref name="Waxman" /&gt;

The petals and sepals are above the ovary; such a flower is said to have an inferior ovary, or the flower is said to be epigynous.]]
[[File:Ovary (botany) (255 30) Tulip; cross-section.jpg|thumb|Cross section of ''[[Tulip]]'' ovary]]

In the [[flowering plant]]s, an '''ovary''' is a part of the female reproductive organ of the flower or [[gynoecium]]. Specifically, it is the part of the [[pistil]] which holds the [[ovule]](s) and is located above or below or at the point of connection with the base of the [[petals]] and [[sepals]]. The pistil may be made up of one [[carpel]] or of several fused carpels (e.g. dicarpel or tricarpel), and therefore the ovary can contain part of one carpel or parts of several fused carpels.  Above the ovary is the [[Style (botany)|style]] and the stigma, which is where the [[pollen]] lands and germinates to grow down through the style to the ovary, and, for each individual [[pollen grain]], to fertilize one individual ovule.  Some wind pollinated flowers have much reduced and modified ovaries.

== Fruits ==
A [[fruit]] is the ripened ovary or ovaries—together with [[seed]]s—from one or more flowers. The fruits of a plant are responsible for dispersing the seeds that contain the embryo and protecting the seeds as well. In many species, the fruit incorporates some surrounding tissues, or is dispersed with some non-fruit tissues.

== Parts of the ovary==
[[Locule]]s are chambers within the ovary of the flower and fruits. The locules contain the ovules (seeds), and may or may not be filled with fruit flesh. Depending on the number of locules in the ovary, fruits can be classified as uni-locular (unilocular), bi-locular, tri-locular or multi-locular. Some plants have [[septum|septa]] between the carpels; the number of locules present in a gynoecium may be equal to or less than the number of carpels, depending on whether septa are present.

The ovules are attached to parts of the interior ovary walls called the placentae. Placental areas occur in various positions, corresponding to various parts of the carpels that make up the ovary. See [[Ovule#Location within the plant]]. An obturator is present in the ovary of some plants, near the [[Micropyle (botany)|micropyle]] of each ovule. It is an outgrowth of the placenta, important in nourishing and guiding [[pollen tube]]s to the micropyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Hickey, M. |author2=King, C. |year=2001  |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ovary of some types of fruit is [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscent]]; the ovary wall splits into sections called valves. There is no standard correspondence between the valves and the position of the septa; the valves may separate by splitting the septa (septicidal dehiscence) or by spitting between them (loculicidal dehiscence), or the ovary may open in other ways such as through pores or because a cap falls off.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Classification based on position ==
[[image:Ovary position.svg|300px|right|thumb|Ovary insertion: I superior II half-inferior III inferior. ''a'' androecium ''g'' gynoecium ''p'' petals ''s'' sepals ''r'' receptacle. The insertion point is where ''a'', ''p'', and ''s'' converge.]]

The terminology of the positions of ovaries is determined by the '''insertion point''', where the other floral parts ([[perianth]] and [[androecium]]) come together and attach to the surface of the ovary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Soltis |first1=Douglas E. |authorlink1=Douglas E. Soltis | last2=Fishbein | first2=Mark | last3=Kuzoff | first3=Robert K. | year=2003 | title=Evolution of Epigyny | journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences | volume=164 | issue=S5 | pages=S251–S264 | doi=10.1086/376876}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the ovary is situated above the insertion point, it is superior; if below, inferior.

=== Superior ovary ===
A '''superior ovary''' is an ovary attached to the receptacle above the attachment of other floral parts.  A superior ovary is found in types of fleshy fruits such as [[Berry (botany)|true berries]], [[drupe]]s, etc.  A flower with this arrangement is described as '''hypogynous'''.  Examples of this ovary type include the legumes (beans and peas and their relatives).

=== Half-inferior ovary ===
A '''half-inferior ovary''' (also known as “half-superior”, “subinferior,” or “partially inferior,”) is embedded or surrounded by the receptacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Soltis |first1=Douglas E. |authorlink1=Douglas E. Soltis | last2=Hufford | first2=Larry | year=2002 | title=Ovary Position Diversity in Saxifragaceae | journal=International Journal of Plant Sciences | volume=163 | issue=2 | pages=277–293 | doi=10.1086/324528}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This occurs in flowers of the [[Lythraceae]] family, which includes the [[Crape Myrtle]]s. Such flowers are termed '''perigynous''' or '''half-epigynous'''. In some classifications, half-inferior ovaries are not recognized and are instead grouped with either the superior or inferior ovaries.

More specifically, a half-inferior ovary has nearly equal portions of ovary above and below the insertion point. Other varying degrees of inferiority can be described by other fractions. For instance, a "one-fifth inferior ovary" has approximately one fifth of its length under the insertion point. Likewise, only one quarter portion of a "three-quarters inferior ovary" is above the insertion.

=== Inferior ovary ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cucurbitaceae]] --&gt;
An '''inferior ovary''' lies below the attachment of other floral parts. A [[pome]] is a type of fleshy fruit that is often cited as an example, but close inspection of some pomes (such as ''[[Pyracantha]]'') will show that it is really a half-inferior ovary.  
Flowers with inferior ovaries are termed '''epigynous'''. Some examples of flowers with an inferior ovary are [[orchids]] (inferior capsule), ''[[Fuchsia]]'' (inferior berry), banana (inferior berry), [[Asteraceae]] (inferior achene-like fruit, called a [[Asteraceae#Fruits and seeds|cypsela]]) and the [[pepo (botany)|pepo]] of the squash, melon and gourd ([[Cucurbitaceae]]) family.

{{Paleontology}}
'''Paleoecology''' (also spelled '''palaeoecology''') is the study of interactions between organisms and/or interactions between organisms and their environments across geologic timescales. As a discipline, paleoecology interacts with, depends on and informs a variety of fields including [[paleontology]], [[ecology]], [[climatology]] and [[biology]].

Paleoecology emerged out of the field of paleontology in the 1950s, though paleontologists have conducted paleoecological studies since the creation of paleontology in the 1700s and 1800s. Combining the investigative approach of searching for fossils with the theoretical approach of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]], paleoecology began as paleontologists began examining both the ancient organisms they discovered and the reconstructed environments in which they lived. Visual depictions of past marine and terrestrial communities has been considered an early form of paleoecology.

== Overview of paleoecological approaches ==

* Classic paleoecology uses data from [[fossil]]s and [[subfossil]]s to reconstruct the [[ecosystem]]s of the past. It involves the study of fossil organisms and their associated remains (such as shells, teeth, pollen, and seeds), which can help in the interpretation of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], living interactions, [[natural environment]], communities, and manner of death and burial. Such interpretations aid the reconstruction of past environments (i.e., paleoenvironments). Paleoecologists have studied the [[fossil record]] to try to clarify the relationship animals have to their environment, in part to help understand the current state of [[biodiversity]]. They have identified close links between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity, that is, between the diversity of animals and the [[Ecological niche|niche]]s they occupy.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=4|pages=544–547|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024|pmc=2936204|pmid=20106856|author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical paleoecology is a primarily reductionist approach: scientists conduct detailed analysis of relatively small groups of organisms within shorter geologic timeframes.
* Evolutionary paleoecology uses data from fossils and other evidence to examine how organisms and their environments change throughout time. Evolutionary paleoecologists take the holistic approach of looking at both organism and environmental change, accounting for physical and chemical changes in the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere across time. By studying patterns of evolution and extinction in the context of environmental change, evolutionary paleoecologists are able to examine concepts of vulnerability and resilience in species and environments.
* Community paleoecology uses statistical analysis to examine the composition and distribution of groups of plants or animals. By quantifying how plants or animals are associated, community paleoecologists are able to investigate the structures of ancient communities of organisms. Advances in technology have helped propel the field, through the use of physical models and computer-based analysis.

== Major principles ==
While the functions and relationships of fossil organisms may not be observed directly (as in ecology), scientists can describe and analyze both individuals and communities over time. To do so, paleoecologists make the following assumptions:

*All organisms are adapted and restricted to a particular environment, and are usually adapted to a particular lifestyle.
*Essentially all organisms depend on another organism, whether directly or indirectly.
*The fossil or physical records are inherently incomplete - the geologic record is selective and some environments are more likely to be preserved than others. [[Taphonomy]], affecting the over- and underrepresentation of fossils, is an extremely important consideration in interpreting fossil assemblages.
*[[Uniformitarianism]] is the concept that processes that took place in the geologic past are the same as the ones that are observed taking place today. In paleoecology, uniformitarianism is used as a methodology: paleoecologists make inferences about ancient organisms and environments based on analogies they find in the present.

==Paleoecological methods==
[[Image:ZygospiraAttached.jpg|thumb|left|''Zygospira modesta'', atrypid [[brachiopods]], preserved in their original positions on a trepostome [[bryozoa]]n; Cincinnatian (Upper [[Ordovician]]) of southeastern [[Indiana]]]]
The aim of paleoecology is to build the most detailed model possible of the [[Ecology|life environment]] of previously living organisms found today as fossils. The process of reconstructing past environments requires the use of ''archives'' (e.g., sediment sequences), ''proxies'' (e.g., the micro or mega-fossils and other sediment characteristics that provide the evidence of the biota and the physical environment), and ''chronology'' (e.g., obtaining absolute (or relative) dating of events in the archive). Such reconstruction takes into consideration complex interactions among environmental factors such as temperatures, food supplies, and degree of solar illumination. Often much of this information is lost or distorted by the fossilization process or diagenesis of the enclosing sediments, making interpretation difficult.  

Some other proxies for reconstructing past environments include charcoal and pollen, which synthesize fire and vegetation data, respectively. Both of these alternates can be found in lakes and peat settings, and can provide moderate to high resolution information &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/NZFires/predict_future.html|title=Paleoecology: a window into the past|website=Exploring the Past to Understand the Future|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These are well studied methods often utilized in the paleoecological field.  
 
The environmental complexity factor is normally tackled through [[statistics|statistical]] analysis of the available numerical data (quantitative [[paleontology]] or [[paleostatistics]]), while the study of post-mortem processes is known as the field of [[taphonomy]].

==Quaternary==
Much of the original paleoecological research has focused on the last two million years (the [[Quaternary]] period), because older environments are less well represented in the fossil [[timeline of evolution]]. Indeed, many studies concentrate on the [[Holocene]] epoch (the last 11,500 years), or the last glacial stage of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch (the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin/Weichsel/Devensian/Würm glaciation]] of the [[ice age]], from 50,000 to 11,500 years ago).  Such studies are useful&lt;ref name="Charlesetal1987acidificationbigmooselake"&gt;Charles D.F.; Whitehead D. R.; Engstrom D. R.; et al. (1987) Paleoliminological evidence for recent acidification of Big Moose Lake, Adirondack Mountains, New-York (USA). ''Biogeochemistry'', 3, 267-296, doi=10.1007/BF02185196.&lt;/ref&gt; for understanding the dynamics of ecosystem change and for reconstructing pre-industrialization ecosystems.

== Applications of paleoecology ==
Paleoecological studies are used to inform conservation, management and restoration efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoonmaker|first=Peter K.|last2=Foster|first2=David R.|date=1991|title=Some implications of paleoecology for contemporary ecology|url=|journal=The Botanical Review|volume=57|pages=204–245|doi=10.1007/BF02858563|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seddon|first=Alistair|date=2013|title=Looking forward through the past: identification of 50 priority research questions in palaeoecology|url=|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=102|pages=256–267|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12195|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, fire-focused paleoecology is an informative field of study to land managers seeking to restore ecosystem fire regimes.

'''Perforate leaves''', sometimes called '''[[wikt:fenestrate#Adjective|fenestrate]]''', occur naturally in some species of plants. Holes develop as a leaf grows.

The size, shape, and quantity of holes in each leaf can vary greatly depending on the species and can even vary greatly within a given species. Perforation is caused by sections of leaf ceasing cell growth or by dying during an early stage in the development of the leaf. These deformations that are created earliest in the leaf development end up looking more like slashes whereas those that develop later end up looking more like holes. This trait is found in only one species in [[Aponogetonaceae]] and a few genera in [[Araceae]].

It is not fully known what evolutionary purpose perforation serves, but there are several possibilities. Perforation could serve the purpose of reducing the chances of leaves tearing in high winds or it could help to maximize the amount of rain that's able to reach the plant's roots. It could help to cool the plant by producing turbulence around the leaf. Another possibility is that perforation is a defense against herbivory. The holes might make the leaf look less enticing to herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, Christopher D. "How Did the Swiss Cheese Plant Get Its Holes?" The American Naturalist 181.2 (2013): 273-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maurice Benoit''' (3 August 1906 – 23 April 1987), better known as '''Pierre Benoit''', was a French [[Catholicism|Catholic]] priest, [[Exegesis|exegete]], and [[theology|theologian]].

==Biography==

A [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], Pierre Benoit studied the [[New Testament]] at the [[École Biblique]] from 1934, and directed the École from 1964 to 1972. An expert on the [[Second Vatican Council]], he became a member of the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]].

His work was principally composed of the translation of biblical texts written in [[Koine Greek]], and the co-ordination of the translation of the [[Jerusalem Bible]]. In particular he was the author of the translation of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in this edition, as well as the [[Epistle to the Philippians]], [[Epistle to Philemon]], [[Epistle to the Colossians]], and the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]].

Pierre Benoit also was the author of four volumes of a work entitled ''Exegesis and Theology'', created between 1961 and 1982 at [[éditions du Cerf]].

In the 1970s he became involved in [[archaeology|archaeological]] investigations carried out at Christian sites in [[Jerusalem]]. One of his most extensive pieces of archaeological work was the thorough and definitive excavation at the site of the [[Antonia Fortress]], and the surrounding area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5905">'''Policy studies''' is a subdisicipline of [[political science]] that includes the analysis of the process of policymaking (the policy process) and the contents of policy ([[policy analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ascher|first1=William|title=The evolution of the policy sciences: Understanding the rise and avoiding the fall|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|volume=5|issue=2|pages=365|date=1986|doi=10.2307/3323551|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/stable/3323551|jstor=3323551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy analysis includes substantive area research (such as health or education policy), [[program evaluation]] and impact studies, and policy design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=419922|title=Political Science and Public Policy|first1=Paul|last1=Sabatier|date=1 June 1991|journal=Political Science &amp; Politics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=144–147|doi=10.2307/419922}}&lt;/ref&gt; It "involves systematically studying the nature, causes, and effects of alternative [[public policies]], with particular emphasis on determining the [[policies]] that will achieve given goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3110267|title=The Policy Studies Perspective|first1=Stuart S.|last1=Nagel|first2=Duncan|last2=MacRae|editor-first1=Robert L.|editor-last1=Lineberry|editor-first2=Theodore J.|editor-last2=Lowi|editor-first3=Alan|editor-last3=Stone|editor-first4=Charles O.|editor-last4=Jones|editor-first5=James A.|editor-last5=Wilde|editor-first6=R.

Policy Studies also examines the conflicts and conflict resolution that arise from the making of policies in civil society, the private sector, or more commonly, in the public sector (e.g. government).

It frequently focuses on the [[public sector]] but is equally applicable to other kinds of organizations (e.g., the not-for-profit sector).  Some policy study experts graduate from [[public policy school]]s with [[public policy degrees]]. Alternatively, experts may have backgrounds in [[policy analysis]], [[program evaluation]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]], [[geography]], [[law]], [[political science]], [[social work]], [[environmental planning]] and [[public administration]].

Traditionally, the field of policy studies focused on [[domestic policy]], with the notable exceptions of [[foreign policy|foreign]] and [[defense policy|defense policies]]. However, the wave of [[economic globalization]], which ensued in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, created a need for a subset of policy studies that focuses on [[global governance]], especially as it relates to issues that transcend [[national borders]] such as [[climate change]], [[terrorism]], [[nuclear proliferation]], and [[economic development]]. This subset of policy studies, which is often referred to as international policy studies, typically requires mastery of a [[second language]] and attention to [[cross-cultural]] issues in order to address [[nation]]al and [[cultural bias]]es. For example, the [[Monterey Institute of International Studies]] at [[Middlebury College]] offers Master of Arts programs that focus exclusively on [[international]] policy through a mix of [[interdisciplinary]] and [[cross-cultural]] analysis called the "Monterey Way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miis.edu/academics/courses|title=Courses - Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of academic programs in policy studies include the [[Harvard Kennedy School]] and the [[LBJ School of Public Affairs]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4227">'''Postmodern Communication''' is used to describe the communication and messaging format, styles, guides, technologies and media used in a postmodernist world. Due to its non-traditional means; postmodern communication is also referred to as the information society.&lt;ref name="sbramab-pg110"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From the Modern to the Postmodern:  The future of global communications theory and research in a pandemonic age|last=Braman |first=Sandra |year=2003 |publisher=Sage Publications, Thousand Hills, CA, |pages=109–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Driven by the need to reach influential audiences and to cut through a cluttered promotional marketplace, brands are reaching out to new communication methods to deliver their advertising message. Furthermore, many marketing practitioners are cited as saying that in order to create successful marketing strategies in the twenty-first century, "more creative thinking allied to an integrated approach to all communication activities are needed".&lt;ref name="tproctor-pg144"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Communication in postmodern integrated marketing",|last= Proctor |first= Tony |year=2002 |publisher=Corporate Communications: An International Journal, Vol. 7 Iss: 3|pages=144–154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The origin of postmodern communication is linked to the development of communication theory.  As communication theory studies the technical process of information and the process of human communication,  postmodern communications are the newly created tools and marketplaces that allow these communications to happen.&lt;ref  name="mdainton-pg247"&gt;{{Cite book|title="Communication In Postmodern Integrated Marketing",|last1= Dainton |first1= Marianne |last2= Zellei |first2= Elain | year=2011 |publisher=Sage Publications.|page= 247 |isbn= 1-4129-7691-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most thinking around the postmodern communication and marketing model is driven from an early 90's scholastic journal article created by Stephen Brown and posted to the England Journal of Marketing.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg31"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postmodern Marketing?|last=Brown |first=Steven |year=1993 |publisher=European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 27 Iss: 4|pages=19–34 |issn=0309-0566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it Brown writes, one who approaches marketing from postmodern style should in many ways reject attempts to impost order and working in silos.  Instead markers should work collectively from with artistic attributes of intuition, creativity, spontaneity, speculation, emotion and involvement.&lt;ref name="sbrown-pg31"/&gt;

== Postmodern Communication Models ==
With the raise of the internet in the early 1960s and the explosive growth of social networking and mobile phones in the 1980 era, many more tactical postmodern communication models have from.  Below is a short list on these new emerging messaging/communication models.

&lt;br&gt;
In adherence with postmodern communications one can assume that the current trend around marketing communication is within the real time model.  Although this may be the case it is important to realize that these communication models do not accurately depict how brands and advertisers are spending in the space. According to leading advertising spending and research provider, spending around new aged "response" media is set at around 20% of total media spend, while unidirectional models make up roughly 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/PressRelease.aspx?R=1008432 |title= Online Advertising Market Poised to Grow 20% in 2011 |publisher=emarketer.com |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preadolescence''', also known as '''pre-teen''' or '''tween''', is a stage of [[Human development (biology)|human development]] following [[early childhood]] and preceding [[adolescence]].&lt;ref name="NOAD2"&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary. 2nd Edition. 2005. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly ends with the beginning of [[puberty]],&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Frank D. Cox, Kevin Demmitt|title=Human Intimacy: Marriage, the Family, and Its Meaning|isbn=1285633040|page=76|year=2013|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pccWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be defined as ending with the start of the teenage years.&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Puberty and adolescence|publisher=[[MedlinePlus]]|accessdate=July 22, 2014|archivedate=April 3, 2013|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403080324/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, dictionary definitions generally designate it as 10–13 years.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/preadolescence?qsrc=2446 Dictionary.com --&gt; Definition of preadolescence] (Based on the Random House Dictionary, 2009) Retrieved on July 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Preadolescence can bring its own challenges and [[anxiety|anxieties]].

==Prepubescence, puberty and range==
{{See also|Tanner scale}}
Being prepubescent is not the same thing as being preadolescent. Instead, ''prepubescent'' (and sometimes ''[[child]]'') is a term for boys and girls who have not developed [[secondary sex characteristic]]s,&lt;ref name="Manske"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C. Manske|title=Fundamental Orthopedic Management for the Physical Therapist Assistant|isbn=0323291376|page=110|year=2015|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NszECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''preadolescent'' is generally defined as those ranging from age 10 to 13 years.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hatfield"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy T. Hatfield|title=Broadribb's Introductory Pediatric Nursing|isbn=0781777062|page=588|year=2007|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMsWpXjnWWYC&amp;pg=PA588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preadolescence may also be defined as the period from 9 to 14 years.&lt;ref name="Corsaro"&gt;William A. Corsaro, ''The Sociology of Childhood'' (2005) p. 191 and p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Donald C. Freeman, ''Essays in Modern Stylistics'' (1981) p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; 

The point at which a child becomes an adolescent is defined by the onset of [[puberty]] or the beginning of the teenage stage.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nlm.nih.gov/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manske"/&gt; Adolescence is also viewed as ending with the teenage stage.&lt;ref name=nlm.nih.gov/&gt; However, in some individuals (particularly females), puberty begins in the preadolescence years.&lt;ref name="Breinbauer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cecilia Breinbauer|title=Youth: Choices and Change : Promoting Healthy Behaviors in Adolescents|isbn=927511594X|page=303|year=2005|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Pan American Health Organization]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goqyfO8KkFIC&amp;pg=PT303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather L. Appelbaum|title=Abnormal Female Puberty: A Clinical Casebook|isbn=331927225X|pages=23–24|year=2016|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9j7CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies indicate that the onset of puberty has been one year earlier with each generation since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;G. Ryan et al., ''Juvenile Sexual Offending'' (2010) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also distinguish middle childhood and preadolescence&lt;ref name=" Corsaro"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– middle childhood from approximately 5–8 years, as opposed to the time children are generally considered to reach preadolescence.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt; There is no exact agreement as to when preadolescence starts and ends, and research by Gesell et al. suggests that "chronological time...is by no means identical with developmental time"&amp;nbsp;– the duration of the "inner" stages of growth'&amp;nbsp;– or with physiological time.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gesell et al., ''Youth'' (London 1956) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

While known as ''preadolescent'' in psychology, the terms ''preteen'', ''preteenager'' or ''tween ''are common in everyday use. A preteen or preteenager&lt;ref name="NOAD2" /&gt; is a person 12 and under.&lt;ref name="MWCD11" /&gt; Generally, the term is restricted to those close to reaching age 12,&lt;ref name="NOAD2" /&gt; especially age 11.&lt;ref name="AHDEL4" /&gt; ''Tween'' is an American [[neologism]] and [[marketing]] term&lt;ref name="FamiliarWithTweens"&gt;[http://tourismintelligence.ca/author/maithe/ Levasseur, Maïthé] (2007-02-09).

Retrieved on 2007-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt; for ''preteen'', which is a [[Blend word|blend]] of ''between'' and ''teen''.&lt;ref name="MWCD11"&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. Eleventh Edition. 2003. Merriam-Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHDEL4"&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Fourth Edition. 2000. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; People within this age range are variously described as tweens, preadolescents{{self-contradictory inline}}, tweenies, preteens, pubescents, [[junior highers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krafft|first1=Bob|title=Coping With Your Feelings: Five Active Meetings for Your Junior Highers|date=1994|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tweenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornburg|first1=Hershel|title=Preadolescent development|date=1974|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hjarvard|first1=Stif Prof|title=The Mediatization of Culture and Society|date=2013|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''tween'' was previously used in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s 1954 novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to refer to [[hobbits]] in their twenties: "''tweens'' as hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and the coming of age at thirty-three."&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. ''The Lord of the Rings; The Fellowship of the Ring '' Copyright 1965 by J.R.R Tolkien; Ballantine Books, A Division of Random House Inc. SBN 345-24032-4-150&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, the word is really either a shortened version of ''between'' or a portmanteau of ''teen'' and ''twenty'', and in either case has no connection to teens, preteens or the American marketing niche.

==Psychological development==
{{Main article|Developmental psychology}}

Of the 'two major [[socialization|socializing]] agents in children's lives: the family environment...and formal educational institutions,'&lt;ref&gt;Dafna Lemish, ''Children and Television'' (Oxford 2007) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; it is 'the family in its function a primary socializer of the child'&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; that predominates in the first five years of life: middle childhood by contrast is characterized by 'a child's readiness for school...being self-assured and interested; knowing what kind of behavior is expected...being able to wait, to follow directions, and getting along with other children.'&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Preadolescent children in fact have a different view of the world from younger children in many significant ways. Typically, theirs is a more realistic view of life than the intense, fantasy-oriented world of earliest childhood. Preadolescents have more mature, sensible, realistic thoughts and actions: 'the most "sensible" stage of development...the child is a much ''less emotional being'' now.'&lt;ref&gt;Mavis Klein, ''Okay Parenting'' (1991) p. 13 and p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; They will often have developed a sense of ' ''intentionality''. The wish and capacity to have an impact, and to act upon that with persistence';&lt;ref&gt;daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; and will have a more developed sense of looking into the future and seeing effects of their actions (as opposed to early childhood where children often do not worry about their future). This can include more realistic [[job (role)|job]] expectations ("I want to be an engineer when I grow up", as opposed to "I want to be a wizard"). Middle children generally show more investment 'in ''control over external reality'' through the acquisition of knowledge and competence':&lt;ref&gt;Mavis Klein, ''Okay Parenting'' (1991) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; where they do have worries, these may be more a [[fear]] of [[kidnapping]]s, [[rape]]s, and scary media events, as opposed to fantasy things (e.g., witches, [[monster]]s, ghosts).

Preadolescents may well view human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s differently (e.g. they may notice the flawed, human side of [[authority]] figures). Alongside that, they may begin to develop a sense of [[self (psychology)|self]]-[[Identity (social science)|identity]], and to have increased feelings of [[independence]]: 'may feel an individual, no longer "just one of the family."'&lt;ref&gt;E. Fenwick/T. Smith, ''Adolescence'' (London 1993) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; A different view on [[morality]] can emerge; and the middle child will also show more ''cooperativeness''. The ability to balance one's own needs with those of others in group activities'.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Many preadolescents will often start to question their home life and surroundings around this time and they may also start to form opinions that may differ from their upbringing in regards to issues such as [[politics]], [[religion]], [[sexuality]], and [[gender roles]].

Greater responsibility within the family can also appear, as middle children become responsible for younger siblings and relatives, as with [[babysitting]]; while preadolescents may start caring about what they look like and what they are wearing.

Middle children often begin to experience [[infatuation]], [[limerence]], [[puppy love]], or [[love]] itself, though arguably at least with 'girls carrying out all the romantic interest....preadolescent girls' romantic pursuits often seem to be more aggressive than affectionate.'&lt;ref&gt;Giselle Liza Anatol, ''Reading Harry Potter: Critical Essays'' (2003) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Preadolescents may still suffer [[tantrum]]s at the age of 13, sometimes leading to rash decisions regarding risky actions. Such decisions may in rare cases result in grave situations such as accidental death.&lt;ref name="dailymail 2008"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-180677267.html | title=Boy aged 13 killed himself over Wii ban | work=[[Daily Mail]] | date=June 27, 2008 | accessdate=January 9, 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home from home===
Where development has been optimal, preadolescents 'come to school for something to be added to their lives; they want to learn lessons...which can lead to their eventually working in a job like their parents.'&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Penguin 1973) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; When earlier developmental stages have gone astray, however, then, on the principle that 'if you miss a stage, you can always go through it later,'&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; some middle children 'come to school for another purpose...[not] to learn but to find a home from home...a stable emotional situation in which they can exercise their own emotional liability, a group of which they can gradually become a part.'&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce===
Children at the threshold of adolescence in the nine-to-twelve-year-old group&lt;ref&gt;Ann Charlton, ''Caught in the Middle'' (London 2003) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; would seem to have particular vulnerabilities to parental separation. Among such problems were the very 'eagerness of these youngsters to be co-opted into the parental battling; their willingness to take sides...and the intense, compassionate, caretaking relations which led these youngsters to attempt to rescue a distressed parent often to their own detriment.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
Preadolescents may well be more exposed to [[popular culture]] than younger children and have interests based on internet trends, television shows and movies (no longer just cartoons), fashion, technology, music and social media. Preadolescents generally prefer certain [[brand]]s, and are a heavily targeted market of many advertisers. Their tendency to buy brand-name items may be due to a desire to fit in, although the desire is not as strong as it is with teenagers.

Some scholars suggest that 'pre-adolescents&amp;nbsp;... reported frequent encounters with sexual material in the media, valued the information received from it, and used it as a learning resource&amp;nbsp;... and evaluated such content through what they perceived to be sexual morality.'&lt;ref&gt;Dafna Lemish, ''Children and Television'' (Oxford 2007) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other research has suggested that sexual media influences on preadolescent and adolescent sexual behavior is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L., &amp; Monahan, K.  2010.  Developmental Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud==
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] called this stage the ''[[latency stage|latency]]'' period to indicate that sexual feelings and interest went underground&amp;nbsp;... the ''feelings'' that create that first "eternal triangle" with the parents fade, and free energy for other interests and activities.'&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 271 and p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik H. Erikson]] confirmed that 'violent drives are normally dormant&amp;nbsp;... a lull before the storm of [[puberty]], when all the earlier drives re-emerge in a new combination, to be brought under the dominance of genitality.'&lt;ref&gt;Erik H Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Penguin 1973) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Latency period children can then direct more of their energy into asexual pursuits such as school, athletics, and same-sex friendships: middle childhood especially is marked by 'the importance of school, teams, classes, friends, gangs and organised activities&amp;nbsp;... and the adults who run those.'&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Miller, ''Understanding Your 8 year old'' (London 1993) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, recent research suggests that "most children do not cease sexual development, interest and behavior" at this time: rather, they "cease to share their interest with adults and are less frequently observed."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, ''Juvenile'' p. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; Because "they've learned the rules&amp;nbsp;... [they] fit in with the grown-up's ''belief'' that they're not interested. But the curiosity about it all continues, and there's quite a lot of experimenting going on between them.'&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, ''Families'' p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other pursuits

But while the eight-year-old still has "years to wait until puberty, adolescence and finally sexual maturity&amp;nbsp;... a sort of lull before puberty arrives,'&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 23 and p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; with preadolescence proper (9–12), and the move forward from middle childhood, what have been called 'the introspective and social concerns of the prepubescent'&lt;ref&gt;Michell Landsberg, ''The World of Children's Books'' (London 1988) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; tend to come more to the fore. Clearly "few experiences are more prominent in the lives of preadolescents than the onset of puberty";&lt;ref&gt;Anatol, ''Potter'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; so that "at eleven or twelve you're just reaching the end of a long period during which change was steady and incremental":&lt;ref&gt;Francis Spufford, ''The Child that Books Built'' (London 2002) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Freud's latency years.

[[Image:Quail chick 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[California quail]] chick (''Callipepla californica''), a precocial chick]]

In [[biology]], '''precocial''' species are those in which the young are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth or hatching. The opposite developmental strategy is called  "[[altricial]]," where the young are born or hatched helpless. These categories form a continuum, without distinct gaps between them. Precocial species are normally [[nidifugous]], meaning that they leave the nest shortly after birth or hatching.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Aix galericulata -Richmond Park, London, England -mother and ducklings-8.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Mandarin duck]] (''Aix galericulata'') and her ducklings. Like other [[anseriformes]], ducks are precocial animals; within two hours of hatching, the ducklings are normally led to the nearest area of water.]]
The span between precocial and altricial species is particularly broad in [[bird]]s. Precocial birds hatch with their eyes open and are covered with downy feathers that are soon replaced by adult-type feathers.&lt;ref name=creatures&gt;{{cite book |title= Creatures of the Air and Sea|author=Edward S. Brinkley|year= 2000|publisher= Reader's Digest Children's Books|location= Singapore|isbn= 0-7944-0353-0|pages= 34, 35|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birds of this kind can also swim and run much sooner after hatching than altricial young, such as songbirds.&lt;ref name=creatures/&gt; Very precocial birds can be ready to leave the nest in a short period of time following hatching (e.g. 24 hours). Many precocial chicks are not independent in [[thermoregulation]] (the ability to regulate their own body temperatures), and they depend on the attending parent(s) to brood them with body heat for a short period of time.  Precocial birds find their own food, sometimes with help or instruction from the parents. Examples of precocial birds include the domestic [[chicken]], many species of [[duck]]s and [[goose|geese]], [[wader]]s, [[rail (bird)|rail]]s, and the [[hoatzin]].

[[File:Foal-three-hours-old.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Horse]]s are known for being precocial, and [[foals]] can walk as fast as their parents within hours.]]
Precociality is found in many other animal groups. Familiar examples of precocial [[mammal]]s are most [[ungulate]]s, the [[guinea pig]], and most species of [[hare]]. This last example is significant as it illustrates that precociality is not a particularly conservative characteristic, in the evolutionary sense, since the closely related [[rabbit]] is highly [[altricial]].

Precocial species typically have a longer [[gestation]] or [[incubate (biology)|incubation]] period than related altricial species, and smaller [[litter (animal)|litter]]s or clutches, since each offspring has to be brought to a relatively advanced (and large) state before birth or hatching.

The phenomenon of [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] studied by [[Konrad Lorenz]] is characteristic of precocial birds.

==Superprecociality==
Extremely precocial species are called "superprecocial". Examples are the [[Megapode]] birds, which have full flight feathers and which, in some species, can fly on the same day they hatch from their eggs.&lt;ref name="Starck&amp;Ricklefs98"&gt;{{cite book |title=Avian Growth and Development. Evolution within the altricial precocial spectrum. |author=Starck, J.M.; Ricklefs, R.E. |year=1998 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=New York |ISBN=0-19-510608-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[blue wildebeest]], whose calves can stand within an average of six minutes from birth and walk within thirty minutes;&lt;ref&gt; Estes, R., and [[E. O. Wilson]] (1992). ''The behavior guide to African mammals: Including hoofed mammals, carnivores, primates''. Los Angeles: University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Sinclair, A.R.E., Simon A.R. Mduma, and Peter Arcese (2000). "What determines phenology and synchrony of ungulate breeding in Serengeti?" ''Ecology'' 81 (8): 2100–211&lt;/ref&gt; they can outrun a hyena within a day.&lt;ref&gt; Kruuk, H. (1972). ''The spotted hyena: A study of predation and social behavior''. Chicago: University

''Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie'' 50 (1):45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hopcraft2013wildebeest"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hopcraft, J.G.C.; Sinclair, A.; Holdo, R.M.; Mwangomo, E.; Mduma, S.; Thirgood, S.; Borner, M.; Fryxell, J.M.; Olff, H. |year=2013 |url=http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/science/2010/j.g.c.hopcraft/02_c2.pdf |title=Why are wildebeest the most abundant herbivore in the Serengeti ecosystem? |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207015239/http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/science/2010/j.g.c.hopcraft/02_c2.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-07 |journal=Serengeti IV: Sustaining Biodiversity in a Coupled Human – Natural System |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such behavior gives them an advantage over other herbivore species; they are 100 times more abundant in the Serengeti ecosystem than hartebeests, their closest taxonomic relative. [[Hartebeest]] calves are not as precocial as wildebeest calves and take up to thirty minutes or more before they stand, and as long as forty-five minutes before they can follow their mothers for short distances. They are unable to keep up with their mothers until they are more than a week old.&lt;ref name="hopcraft2013wildebeest" /&gt;

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|precocial}}
The word "precocial" is derived from the same root as ''precocious'', implying in both cases early maturity.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary''. David B. Guralnik, Editor in Chief. New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phylogeny==
Precociality is thought to be ancestral in birds. Thus, altricial birds tend to be found in the most derived groups. There is some evidence for precociality in [[Protobird]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andrzej |last1=Elzanowski |first2=Michael K. |last2=Brett-Surman |date=July 1995 |title=Avian Premaxilla and Tarsometatarsus from the Uppermost Cretaceous of Montana |journal=The Auk |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=762–67 |jstor=4088693}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Troodontid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David J. |last1=Varricchio |first2=John R. |last2=Horner |first3=Frankie D. |last3=Jackson |date=September 19, 2002 |title=Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=564–76 |jstor=4524250 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''process-data diagram (PDD)''', also known as '''process-deliverable diagram''' is a [[diagram]] that describes [[process (computing)|process]]es and [[data]] that act as output of these processes. On the left side the [[meta-process model]] can be viewed and on the right side the [[metadata modeling|meta-data model]] can be viewed.&lt;ref name="WSVB"&gt;I. Van de Weerd, J. Souer, J. Versendaal and [[Sjaak Brinkkemper]] (2005). ''Situational Requirements Engineering of Web Content Management Implementations''. SREP2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A process-data diagram can be seen as combination of a [[business process model]] and [[data model]].

== Overview ==
[[Image:SAP Implementation process-data diagram.png|240px|right|thumbnail|SAP Implementation process-data diagram]] 
The process-data diagram that is depicted at the right, gives an overview of all of these activities/processes and deliverables. The four gray boxes depict the four main [[implementation]] phases, which each contain several processes that are in this case all sequential. The boxes at the right show all the deliverables/[[concept]]s that result from the processes. Boxes without a shadow have no further sub-concepts. Boxes with a black shadow depict complex closed concepts, so concepts that have sub-concepts, which however will not be described in any more detail. Boxes with a white shadow (a box behind it) depict open closed concepts, where the sub-concepts are expanded in greater detail. The lines with diamonds show a has-a relationship between concepts.

The [[SAP Implementation]] process is made up out of four main phases, i.e. the project preparation where a vision of the future-state of the SAP solution is being created, a sizing and blueprinting phase where a [[solution stack|software stack]] is acquired and [[training]] is being performuued, a functional development phase and finally a final preparation phase, when the last [[Software testing|tests]] are being performed before the actual go live. For each phase, the vital activities are addressed and the [[deliverable]]s/[[Product (business)|product]]s are explained.

== Process-data diagram building blocks ==

=== Sequential activities ===
{{main article|Activity diagram}}
Sequential activities are activities that need to be carried out in a pre-defined order. The activities are connected with an arrow, implying that they have to be followed in that sequence. Both activities and sub-activities can be modeled in a sequential way. In Figure 1 an activity diagram is illustrated with one activity and two sequential sub-activities. A special kind of sequential activities are the start and stop states, which are also illustrated in Figure 1.

In Figure 2 an example from practice is illustrated. The example is taken from the requirements capturing workflow in UML-based Web Engineering. The main activity, user &amp; domain modeling, consists of three activities that need to be carried out in a predefined order.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Process-Data Diagram 21.gif|1: Sequential activities
Image:Process-Data Diagram 22.gif|2: Example 
Image:Process-Data Diagram 23.gif|3: Unordered activities
Image:Process-Data Diagram 24.gif|4: Example  
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Unordered activities ===
Unordered activities are used when sub-activities of an activity do not have a pre-defined sequence in which they need to be carried out. Only sub-activities can be unordered. Unordered activities are represented as sub-activities without transitions within an activity, as is represented in Figure 3.

Sometimes an activity consists of both sequential and unordered sub-activities. The solution to this modeling issue is to divide the main activity in different parts. In Figure 4 an example is illustrated, which clarifies the necessity to be able to model unordered activities. The example is taken from the requirements analysis workflow of the Unified Process. The main activity, “describe candidate requirements”, is divided into two parts. The first part is a sequential activity. The second part consists of four activities that do not need any sequence in order to be carried out correctly.

=== Concurrent activities ===
Activities can occur concurrently. This is handled with forking and joining. By drawing the activities parallel in the diagram, connected with a synchronization bar, one can fork several activities. Later on these concurrent activities can join again by using the same synchronization bar. Both activities and sub-activities can occur concurrently. In the example of Figure 5, Activity 2 and Activity 3 are concurrent activities.

In Figure 6, a fragment of a requirements capturing process is depicted. Two activities, defining the actors and defining the use cases, are carried out concurrently. The reason for carrying out these activities concurrently is that defining the actors influences the use cases greatly, and vice versa.

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Process-Data Diagram 25.gif|5: Concurrent activities
Image:Process-Data Diagram 26.gif|6: Example 
Image:Process-Data Diagram 27.gif|7: Conditional activities
Image:Process-Data Diagram 28.gif|8: Example 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Conditional activities ===
Conditional activities are activities that are only carried out if a pre-defined condition is met. This is graphically represented by using a branch. Branches are illustrated with a diamond and can have incoming and outgoing transitions. Every outgoing transition has a guard expression, the condition. This guard expression is actually a Boolean expression, used to make a choice which direction to go. Both activities and sub-activities can be modeled as conditional activities. In Figure 7 two conditional activities are illustrated.

In Figure 8 an example from practice is illustrated. A requirements analysis starts with studying the material. Based on this study, the decision is taken whether to do an extensive requirements elicitation session or not. The condition for not carrying out this requirements session is represented at the left of the branch, namely [requirements clear]. If this condition is not met, [else], the other arrow is followed.

The integration of both types of diagrams is quite straightforward. Each action or activity results in a concept. They are connected with a dotted arrow to the produced artifacts, as is demonstrated in Figure 9.  The concepts and activities are abstract in this picture.

::[[Image:Mm41.gif|frame|left|Figure 9: Process-Data Diagram]]{{clear|left}}

In Table 1 a generic table is presented with the description of activities, sub-activities and their relations to the concepts. In section 5 examples are given of both process-data diagram and activity table.

== Example of a process-data diagram ==
In Figure 10 an example of a process-data diagram is illustrated. It concerns an example from the orientation phase of complex project in a WebEngineering method.&lt;ref name="WSVB"/&gt;

Notable is the use of open and closed concepts. Since project management is actually not within the scope of this research, the concept CONTROL MANAGEMENT has not been expanded. However, in a complex project is RISK MANAGEMENT of great importance. Therefore, the choice is made to expand the RISK MANAGEMENT concept.

'''Rae Linda Brown''' (1953 &amp;ndash; 2017) was an American [[musicologist]].

As a scholar, archivist and editor Rae Linda Brown conducted research on topics in [[American classical music]], [[Black Music]] and African-American classical music. Brown authored books and academic treatises on [[Florence Price]] and [[William Grant Still]]. As a professor and administrator Brown led in the creation of new academic programs at the [[University of California, Irvine]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], and [[Pacific Lutheran University]].

Brown grew up in Hartford Connecticut and earned degrees at the [[University of Connecticut]] and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Rae Linda Brown|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/latimes/obituary.aspx?n=rae-linda-brown&amp;pid=186557965|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=23 March 2018|ref=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's doctoral work at Yale catalogued sheet music and scores in the [[James Weldon Johnson]] memorial collection at the [[Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]] and comprises Volume 23 of the Garland Critical Studies on Black Life and Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Rae Linda|title=Music, printed and manuscript, in the James Weldon Johnson Memorial Collection of Negro Arts and Letters: an annotated catalog|date=1982|publisher=Garland|isbn=978-0824093198|url=https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780824093198|accessdate=23 March 2018|ref=Dissertation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s Brown rediscovered, edited, and published critical analyses of [[Florence Price]]'s music. Brown's work in this area became the basis for a wider recognition of Price's role in and contribution to American music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Florence|title=Price: Symphonies Nos. 1 and 3|date=2007|publisher=A-R Editions|isbn=978-0-89579-638-7|url=https://www.areditions.com/price-symphonies-nos-1-and-3-mu19-a066.html|accessdate=23 March 2018|ref=Price: Symphonies Nos. 1 and 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Woman's Symphony Orchestra of Chicago and Florence B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11982">'''Regulatory science''' is the scientific and technical foundations upon which regulations are based in various industries – particularly those involving health or safety.  Regulatory bodies employing such principles in the US include for example the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for food and medical products, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] for the environment, and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] for work safety.

"Regulatory science" is contrasted with [[regulatory affairs]] and [[regulatory law]], which refer to the administrative or legal aspects of regulation, in that the former is focused on the regulations' ''scientific'' underpinnings and concerns – rather than the regulations' promulgation, implementation, compliance, or enforcement.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==History==
Probably the first investigator who recognized the nature of regulatory science was Alvin Weinberg &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=AM|title=Science and trans science|journal=Minerva|date=1970|volume=10|pages=209–222|doi=10.1007/BF01682418}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described the scientific process used to evaluate effects of ionizing radiation as trans science.  The origin of the term '''regulatory science''' is unknown. It was probably coined sometimes in the late 1970s in an undated memorandum prepared by [[A. Alan Moghissi]] who was describing scientific issues that the newly formed US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was facing. During that period the EPA was forced to meet legally mandated deadlines to make decisions that would require reliance upon science that was not meeting conventional scientific requirements. At that time the prevailing view was that there was no need to establish a new [[scientific discipline]] because “science is science” regardless of how its application. In the spring of 1985 Moghissi established the Institute for Regulatory Science in the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] as a non-profit organization with the objective to perform scientific studies “at the interface between science and the regulatory system”  Moghissi et al.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have provided an extensive description of history of regulatory science including various perception of regulatory science leading to the acceptance of regulatory science by the FDA

==Definition==
Moghissi ''et al''.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have described the history of regulatory science and provide two definitions. The first definition is the generalized definition provided by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) “Regulatory science is a scientific discipline consisting of the development and application of scientific methods, tools, approaches, and other relevant processes derived from various scientific disciplines used to support regulatory and other policy objectives”. An abbreviated definition consists of “regulatory science consists of the application of science to support policy notably regulatory objectives”

The objectives, stated by the FDA in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/scienceresearch/specialtopics/regulatoryscience/ucm228444.pdf|title=Advancing Regulatory Science for Public Health|last=|first=FDA|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will provide a basis to: 

* Improve capacity for safety and efficacy evaluations and monitoring of candidate and licensed products,
* Modernize current regulatory pathways,
* Develop new regulatory pathways where there are currently none.

There have been several attempts to define regulatory science. In many cases there are claims that there is a difference between regulatory science and “normal science”, “academic science”, “research science”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jasanoff|first1=S|title=The fifth branch: science advisors as policy makers|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; or compliance with regulations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gad|first1=SC|title=Regulatory Toxicology|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Philadelphia, PA|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary problem is the lack of appreciation that many branches of science are evolving and much of the evolving science includes inherent uncertainties.

==Application of regulatory science==
Regulatory science is included in every regulation that includes science. The regulatory science community&lt;ref name="j1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Straja|first2=Sorin R.|last3=Love|first3=Betty R.|last4=McBride|first4=Dennis K.|last5=Stough|first5=Roger R.|date=2014|title=Innovation in Regulatory Science: Evolution of a new scientific discipline|journal=Technology and Innovation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=155–165|doi=10.3727/194982414X14096821477027|last1=Moghissi|first1=AA}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of three groups of regulatory scientists: 
*Those who are involved in development of regulations. Typically this group is employed by regulatory agencies 
*Those who must comply with regulations. Typically this group consists of employees or contractors of regulated community.
*Those segments of the scientific community who perform research and development in areas relevant to the relevant regulated community.

The third group is of particular significance as they consist of organizations and individuals who support the first two groups. Included in this group are members of numerous advisory panels, organizations that provide peer reviews, and members of peer review panels. An example of this group is the National Academies consisting of the National Academy of Science, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council.   
The application of regulatory science occurs in three phases. During the first phase the regulators must meet a legislative or court- mandated deadline and promulgate regulations using their best judgment. The second phase provides opportunity to develop regulatory science tools. These include human health and ecological risk assessment procedures and post marketing evaluation method d processes for drugs ad medical devices. The third Standard Operating phase, used tools developed during the second phase to improve the initial decision. ( Moghissi et al.)

==Regulatory engineering==
[[Engineering]] is the development of new products and processes, hence regulatory engineering encompasses principally the development of products and processes to facilitate or better examine regulations or their scientific foundations.  Another related segment of regulatory science deal with the application of engineering design or analysis to operations such as the safety of nuclear and other power plants, chemical production facilities, mining operations, and air transportation.

Sometimes the term "regulatory engineer(ing)" is misused to refer to essentially administrative or regulatory roles dealing with organizing or coordinating regulatory matters for an organization; however, "engineering" refers only to functional design of products and processes, and in many jurisdictions this definition is legally enforced (see [[Regulation and licensure in engineering]]).

==Areas of focus==

===Regulatory pharmaceutical medicine===
Consistent with its mission, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that “Regulatory science is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality and performance of FDA-regulated products.”
Based on several decades of experience regulatory science is logically defined as a distinct scientific discipline constituting the scientific foundation of regulatory, legislative, and judicial decisions. Much like many scientific disciplines that have evolved within the last several decades, regulatory science is both [[interdisciplinary]] and [[multidisciplinary]] and relies upon a large number of basic and applied scientific disciplines.

Regulatory science is an emerging area of interest within pharmaceutical medicine as the shaping and implementation of legislation and guidelines. One definition of “regulatory science” is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to evaluate the efficacy, safety, quality and performance of medical products in order to assess benefit-risk and facilitate a sound and transparent regulatory decision-making. It has been recognized as having a significant impact on the industry’s ability to bring new medicines and medical devices to patients in need. Regulatory science challenges current concepts of benefit/risk assessment, submission and approval strategies, patient’s involvement and ethical aspects. It creates the platform for launching new ideas – not only by the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities, but also by, for example, academia, who wants to contribute to better use of their research activities within medical aspects. Regulatory science &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FDA (Food and Drug Administration)|title=The Promise of regulatory science|url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm228206.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the potential as an enabler for directing companies towards more efficient global development of medical products as well as more robust quality decision-making processes.

===Human health===
By far the predominant foci of Regulatory Science pertain to human health and well-being. This realm covers a broad range of scientific areas – including pollution and [[toxicology]], work safety, food, drugs, and numerous others.

===Ecology===
Regulatory [[ecology]] covers resources the [[Protected species|protection of various species]], [[Wetland conservation|protection of wetlands]], and numerous other regulated areas including [[ecotoxicology]].

For example, the US Clean Water Act is based upon an interest in protecting water quality for its own sake, in contrast with the Clean Air Act which is premised upon protecting air quality only for the sake of human health; however, these are ideological policy premises rather than scientific matters themselves.

The US Department of Agriculture regulates animal care, and the FDA regulates humaneness for animal studies.

The US Department of Interior, [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS), and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], implement the development and enforcement of policies required by the [[Endangered Species Act|Federal Endangered Species Act]] (FESA), [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]], and other biological resources laws. The FESA requires that the decisions to list a species as endangered or threatened are based on the best available scientific data. To that end, the USFWS, and other government agencies fund research to determine the conservation status of proposed species. Regulatory scientists within the Services review, evaluate, and incorporate data from these studies of proposed species in their published regulations. Survey protocols for listed species are also developed from scientific studies of their target species. The purpose of the protocols is to reliably and accurately determine the residency of the target species in a given study area.

==Regulatory economics==
There are numerous [[Regulatory economics|economic decisions]] in the regulatory process including the [[economics]] part of [[cost-benefit analysis]].

==Science in legislation and in courts==
Although often less than fully recognized the scientific foundation of [[Legislation|legislative]] decisions are included in regulatory science and should be based on reliable science. Similarly [[Court of law|courts]] have recognized the need to rely upon information that meets scientific requirements.

[[File:Albi (2012.08) 02.jpg|thumb|[[Albi Cathedral]]]]
'''Southern French Gothic''' ({{lang-fr|gothique méridional}}) is a specific style of [[Gothic architecture]] developed in the south of France. It arose in the early 13th century following the victory of the [[Catholic church]] over the [[Cathar heresy|Cathars]], as the church sought to re-establish its authority in the region, and as a result church buildings typically present features drawn from military architecture.  Southern French Gothic is simpler and less ornate than [[French Gothic architecture|northern French Gothic]], and differs also in that the construction material is typically brick rather than stone. In time the style came to influence secular buildings as well as churches, and spread beyond the area where Catharism had flourished.

== Origins ==
During the rise of [[Cathar heresy|Catharism]], the luxury of Roman Catholic Church was constantly criticized by the Cathar ecclesiastics. After the political eradication of the Cathar aristocracy during the [[Albigensian crusade]] (1209-1229), the clergy of southern France understood that after having won the war, it was necessary for them to win back the minds of the population. In addition to setting up the [[Medieval Inquisition]], they adopted a more austere and uncluttered architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;fr:La cathédrale Sainte-Cécile, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical area ==
Southern French Gothic, as its name suggests, is found in the southern part of France, mainly in the regions where [[Catharism]] had developed, and which were subjected to religious and military repression from the North. The reconquest by the Catholic hierarchy gave rise to the construction or reconstruction of many religious buildings, but also of secular ones. The regions concerned are therefore the current départements of the Haute-Garonne ([[Toulouse]]), the Tarn ([[Albi]]), the Tarn-et-Garonne ([[Montauban]]), the Ariège, the Gers, the Aude, the Pyrénées-Orientales, the Hérault, with instances in neighboring départements as well.

== Characteristics == 
Southern French Gothic is characterized by the austerity of the constructions, such as the use of solid [[buttresses]] rather than [[flying buttresses]], while the openings are few and narrow. [[Romanesque architecture]] persisted for longer in the south of France than in the north, and the transition to Gothic was progressive. Many of the buildings in the Southern Gothic style are thus built with a single nave, and are covered by roof-frames resting on diaphragm arches.

=== Brick construction ===

[[Image:ArcMitre.jpg|thumb|180px|Bell Tower of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins of Toulouse]], illustration from the '' Dictionary '' of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]]]]
In an area poor in stone, the typical construction material was brick, whose use in the Southern French Gothic of the regions of Toulouse, Montauban, and Albi became one of its distinguishing marks. The builders used techniques adapted to this material, such as the mitre arches typical of this style. Brick lends itself to geometric decorative compositions, and consequently there are few sculptures integrated into the architecture. Depending on the type of clay used, the bricks can be molded or rounded by abrasion. Some buildings use stone sparingly to create colour contrasts.

Neighbouring regions coming under this influence but dominated by stone construction often adopted the same architectural vocabulary.

=== Single nave ===
After the Cathar episode, one goal of the Catholic church was the recovery of the faithful through preaching (hence the foundation by [[Saint Dominic|Dominique de Guzmán]] of the [[Dominican Order|order of the Friars Preachers]]). To this end the preference was for the single nave, which promotes acoustics and places all the faithful under the gaze of the preacher. The nave is lined with side chapels, lodged between the buttresses, and surmounted by large windows that illuminate it.

However, the presence of a single nave is not necessarily related to this desire, but may be related to other considerationssuch as a single pre-existing nave. Conversely, the very wide nave of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins of Toulouse]] is divided by a row of pillars, but is nevertheless a single entity.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Bell tower ===

The bell towers can be of all types, but two forms stand out: the "Toulouse" bell tower, and the wall belfry.

==== Octagonal "Toulouse" bell tower ====
In the Toulouse region the typical bell tower appeared in the Romanesque period, with an octagonal floor plan and storeys progressively decreasing in size. In the transition to Gothic, only the shape of the bays changed. Bell towers are usually surmounted by a spire, but a certain number of these are missing, either because they have been destroyed, or because the construction was interrupted. The typical example is the bell tower of [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Saint-Sernin of Toulouse]], enhanced in the Gothic period with mitre arches succeeding the Romanesque arched windows, but there are also ogival bays.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== Wall belfry ====
The other form of bell tower, more common in smaller buildings, is the wall belfry, also frequently characterised by mitre arches, and often resembling fortifications in having elements such as battlements and machicolations.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Fortification elements ===

Defensive elements such as battlements, machicolations, walkways, and watchtowers are frequent in Southern Gothic churches. Most of the time, except in cases where the church is included in a defensive system, these elements have only a decorative and especially a symbolic role, tending to assert the power of the Church. At the church of Notre-Dame de Simorre, it was the 19th-century architect and conservationist [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] who added battlements and watchtowers to the top of the buttresses.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Secular buildings ==

The term "Southern French Gothic" is applied mainly to buildings of worship, churches and cathedrals. The same architectural principles of sobriety of construction, absence or limitation of carved decoration, massive appearance, and defensive elements can however be found in buildings used for other purposes. Examples in Toulouse include mansions and the [[Saint-Raymond Museum|Saint-Raymond College]]; in Albi, the [[Musée Toulouse-Lautrec|Berbie Palace]], etc ...

'''Space weather''' is a branch of [[space physics]] and [[aeronomy]] concerned with the time varying conditions within the Solar System, including the [[solar wind]], emphasizing the space surrounding the Earth, including conditions in the [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]], [[thermosphere]], and [[exosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Barbara B. |last1=Poppe |first2=Kristen P. |last2=Jorden |year=2006 |publisher=Johnson Books, Boulder, Colorado |title=Sentinels of the Sun: Forecasting Space Weather|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sentinels_of_the_Sun.html?id=WMh4REf3iZQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space weather is distinct from the terrestrial [[weather]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] ([[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]]). The term ''space weather'' was first used in the 1950s and came into common usage in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Cade III |first = William B. |author2 = Christina Chan-Park |title = The Origin of "Space Weather" |journal = Space Weather |volume = |issue = |pages = |date = 2015 |doi = 10.1002/2014SW001141 |bibcode = 2015SpWea..13...99C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
For many centuries, the effects of space weather were noticed but not understood. Displays of [[aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] light have long been observed at high latitudes.

=== Genesis ===
In 1724, [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] reported that the needle of a [[magnetic compass]] was regularly deflected from [[magnetic north]] over the course of each day. This effect was eventually attributed to overhead electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere by [[Balfour Stewart]] in 1882, and confirmed by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1889 from analysis of magnetic observatory data.

In 1852, astronomer and British major general [[Edward Sabine]] showed that the probability of the occurrence of magnetic storms on Earth was correlated with the number of [[sunspots]], thus demonstrating a novel solar-terrestrial interaction. In 1859, a great [[Solar storm of 1859|magnetic storm]] caused brilliant auroral displays and disrupted global [[telegraph]] operations. [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] correctly connected the storm with a [[solar flare]] that he had observed the day before in the vicinity of a large sunspot group—thus demonstrating that specific solar events could affect the Earth.

[[Kristian Birkeland]] explained the physics of aurora by creating artificial aurora in his laboratory and predicted the [[solar wind]]. The introduction of radio revealed that periods of extreme static or noise occurred. Severe [[radar jamming]] during a large solar event in 1942 led to the discovery of solar radio bursts (radio waves which cover a broad frequency range created by a [[solar flare]]), another aspect of space weather.

=== Twentieth century ===
In the 20th century the interest in space weather expanded as military and commercial systems came to depend on systems affected by space weather. [[Communications satellites]] are a vital part of global commerce. [[Weather satellite]] systems provide information about terrestrial weather. The signals from satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) are used in a wide variety of applications. Space weather phenomena can interfere with or damage these satellites or interfere with the radio signals with which they operate. Space weather phenomena can cause damaging surges in long distance [[Overhead power line|transmission lines]] and expose passengers and crew of aircraft travel to [[radiation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = Genene M | title = ''Integrating Space Weather and Meteorological Products for Aviation'', (2003) | url = | journal = Bull.

The [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) increased research into space weather. Ground-based data obtained during IGY demonstrated that the aurora occurred in an ''auroral oval'', a permanent region of luminescence 15 to 25 degrees in latitude from the magnetic poles and 5 to 20 degrees wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldstein | first1 = Y.

(Toronto: MacFarlane Walter &amp; Ross, 2001), 190.&lt;/ref&gt; regions of radiation particles trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. In January 1959, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[satellite]] [[Luna 1]] first directly observed the solar wind and measured its strength.

In 1969, INJUN-5 (a.k.a. Explorer 40&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1968-066B NASA NSSDC INJUN-5 page]&lt;/ref&gt;) made the first direct observation of the electric field impressed on the Earth's high latitude [[ionosphere]] by the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;Cauffman, D., and D. Gurnett (1971), Double-Probe Measurements of Convection Electric Fields with the Injun-5 Satellite, J. Geophys. Res., 76(25), 6014-6027&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, Triad data demonstrated that permanent electric currents flowed between the auroral oval and the [[magnetosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Zmuda and J. C. Armstrong, ''The Diurnal Flow Pattern of Field-Aligned Currents'', J. Geophys. Res., 79, 31, 4611pp, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The term space weather came into usage in the 1990s along with the belief that space's impact on human systems demanded a more coordinated research and application framework.&lt;ref name="nas1997"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Space Weather: A Research Perspective {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12272|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24 |publisher=National Academy of Science |year=1997 |quote=Space weather describes the conditions in space that affect Earth and its technological systems.

== US National Space Weather Program ==
The purpose of the US National Space Weather Program is to focus research on the needs of the affected commercial and military communities, to connect the research and user communities, to create coordination between operational data centers and to better define user community needs.

The concept was turned into an action plan in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-ip/pdf/nswpip.pdf |title=The National Space Weather Program: Strategic Plan, Implementation Plan and Space Weather Architecture Transition Plan and Report of the Assessment Committee for the NSWP |publisher=Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030417130810/http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-ip/pdf/nswpip.pdf |archivedate=2003-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an implementation plan in 2002, an assessment in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nswp.gov/nswp_acreport0706.pdf|title = Report of the Assessment Committee for the National Space Weather Program|date = 2006|accessdate = July 24, 2015|website = |publisher = Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185726/http://www.nswp.gov/nswp_acreport0706.pdf|archivedate = March 3, 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a revised strategic plan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2010 National Space Weather Program Strategic Plan|url = http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-sp/fcm-p30.htm|website = www.ofcm.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140404153245/http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-sp/fcm-p30.htm|archivedate = 2014-04-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised action plan was scheduled to be released in 2011 followed by a revised implementation plan in 2012.

One part of the National Space Weather Program is to show users that space weather affects their business.&lt;ref name="nap.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Severe Space Weather Events--Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts: A Workshop Report {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12507.html|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private companies now acknowledge space weather "is a real risk for today's businesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hapgood|first=Mike|title=Space Weather:  Its impact on Earth and implications for business|url=http://www.lloyds.com/~/media/Lloyds/Reports/360/360%20Space%20Weather/7311_Lloyds_360_Space%20Weather_03.pdf|work=Lloyd's 360 Risk Insight|publisher=[[Lloyd's of London]]|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenomena==
Within the [[solar system]], space weather is influenced by the [[solar wind]] and the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) carried by the solar wind [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A variety of physical phenomena are associated with space weather, including [[geomagnetic storm]]s and substorms, energization of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, ionospheric disturbances and [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]] of satellite-to-ground radio signals and long-range radar signals, [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[geomagnetically induced current]]s at Earth's surface. [[Coronal mass ejection]]s and their associated [[shock wave]]s are also important drivers of space weather as they can compress the [[magnetosphere]] and trigger [[geomagnetic storm]]s. [[Solar energetic particles]] (SEP), accelerated by coronal mass ejections or [[solar flare]]s, are also an important driver of space weather as they can damage electronics onboard spacecraft (e.g. [[Galaxy 15]] failure), and threaten the lives of [[astronaut]]s.

==Effects==

===Spacecraft electronics===
[[File:ExtremeEvent 20031026-00h 20031106-24h.jpg|thumb|right|320px|GOES-11 and GOES-12 monitored space weather conditions during the October 2003 solar activity.&lt;ref name="Extreme Space Weather Events"&gt;{{cite web | title=Extreme Space Weather Events | publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]] | url=http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Some spacecraft failures can be directly attributed to space weather; many more are thought to have a space weather component. For example, 46 of the 70 failures reported in 2003 occurred during the October 2003 geomagnetic storm. The two most common adverse space weather effects on spacecraft are [[radiation damage]] and [[spacecraft charging]].

Radiation (high energy particles) passes through the skin of the spacecraft and into the electronic components. In most cases the radiation causes an erroneous signal or changes one bit in memory of a spacecraft's electronics ([[single event upset]]s). In a few cases, the radiation destroys a section of the electronics ([[latchup|single-event latchup]]).

Spacecraft charging is the accumulation of an [[electrostatic charge]] on a non-conducting material on the spacecraft's surface by low energy particles. If enough charge is built up, a discharge (spark) occurs. This can cause an erroneous signal to be detected and acted on by the spacecraft computer. A recent study indicates that spacecraft charging is the predominant space weather effect on spacecraft in [[geosynchronous orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=Ho-Sung |author2=J. Lee |author3=K.-S. Cho |author4=Y.-S. Kwak |author5=I.-H. Cho |author6=Y.-D. Park |author7=Y.-H. Kim |author8=[[Daniel N. Baker|D. N. Baker]] |author9=G. D. Reeves |author10=D.-K. Lee |title=Analysis of GEO spacecraft anomalies: Space weather relationships|journal=Space Weather|year=2011|volume=9|issue=S06001|page=12|doi=10.1029/2010SW000597|bibcode = 2011SpWea...906001C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spacecraft orbit changes===
The orbits of spacecraft in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) decay to lower and lower altitudes due to the resistance from the friction between the spacecraft's surface (''i.e. '', drag) and the outer layer of the Earth's atmosphere (a.k.a. the [[thermosphere]] and [[exosphere]]). Eventually, a LEO spacecraft falls out of orbit and towards the Earth's surface. Many spacecraft launched in the past couple of decades have the ability to fire a small rocket to manage their orbits. The rocket can increase altitude to extend lifetime, to direct the reentry towards a particular (marine) site, or route the satellite to avoid collision with other spacecraft. Such maneuvers require precise information about the orbit. A [[geomagnetic storm]] can cause an orbit change over a couple of days that otherwise would occur over a year or more. The [[geomagnetic storm]] adds heat to the thermosphere, causing the thermosphere to expand and rise, increasing the drag on spacecraft. The [[2009 satellite collision]] between the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 demonstrated the importance of having precise knowledge of all objects in orbit. Iridium 33 had the capability to maneuver out of the path of Cosmos 2251 and could have evaded the crash, if a credible collision prediction had been available,

===Humans in space===
{{main article|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}
The exposure of a human body to [[ionizing radiation]] has the same [[acute radiation syndrome|harmful effects]] whether the source of the radiation is a medical [[X-ray machine]], a [[nuclear power plant]] or radiation in space. The degree of the harmful effect depends on the length of exposure and the radiation's [[energy density]]. The ever-present [[radiation belt]]s extend down to the altitude of manned spacecraft such as the [[International Space Station#Radiation|International Space Station]] (ISS) and the [[Space Shuttle]], but the amount of exposure is within the [[Spaceflight radiation carcinogenesis#Current Permissible Exposure Limits|acceptable lifetime exposure limit]] under normal conditions. During a major space weather event that includes an SEP burst, the flux can increase by orders of magnitude. Areas within ISS provide shielding that can keep the total dose within safe limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Space station radiation shields 'disappointing' - New Scientist|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2956-space-station-radiation-shields-disappointing.html|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Space Shuttle]], such an event would have required immediate mission termination.

===Ground systems===
[[Image:SpaceWeather-artl.jpg|thumb|Art inspired from the concept of space weather]]

====Spacecraft signals====
The [[ionosphere]] bends radio waves in the same manner that water in a swimming pool bends visible light. When the medium through which such waves travel is disturbed, the light image or radio information is distorted and can become unrecognizable. The degree of distortion (scintillation) of a radio wave by the ionosphere depends on the signal frequency. Radio signals in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band (30 to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz) can be distorted beyond recognition by a disturbed ionosphere. Radio signals in the [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] band (300&amp;nbsp;MHz to 3&amp;nbsp;GHz) transit a disturbed ionosphere, but a receiver may not be able to keep locked to the carrier frequency. GPS uses signals at 1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz (L1) and 1227.6&amp;nbsp;MHz (L2) that can be distorted by a disturbed ionosphere. Space weather events that corrupt GPS signals can significantly impact society. For example, the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) operated by the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] is used as a navigation tool for North American commercial aviation. It is disabled by every major space weather event. Outages can range from minutes to days. Major space weather events can push the disturbed polar ionosphere 10° to 30° of latitude toward the equator and can cause large ionospheric gradients (changes in density over distance of hundreds of km) at mid and low latitude. Both of these factors can distort GPS signals.

===Long-distance radio signals===
Radio wave in the [[high frequency|HF]] band (3 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) (also known as the [[shortwave]] band) are reflected by the ionosphere. Since the ground also reflects HF waves, a signal can be transmitted around the curvature of the Earth beyond the line of sight. During the 20th century, HF communications was the only method for a ship or aircraft far from land or a base station to communicate. The advent of systems such as [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]] brought other methods of communications, but HF remains critical for vessels that do not carry the newer equipment and as a critical backup system for others. Space weather events can create irregularities in the ionosphere that scatter HF signals instead of reflecting them, preventing HF communications. At auroral and polar latitudes, small space weather events that occur frequently disrupt HF communications. At mid-latitudes, HF communications are disrupted by solar radio bursts, by X-rays from solar flares (which enhance and disturb the ionospheric D-layer) and by [[Total Electron Content|TEC]] enhancements and irregularities during major geomagnetic storms.

Trans[[polar route|polar airline route]]s are particularly sensitive to space weather, in part because [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] require reliable communication over the entire flight.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Advisory Circular 120-42B, June 6, 2008, Extended Operations (ETOPS and Polar Operations)&lt;/ref&gt; Diverting such a flight is estimated to cost about $100,000.&lt;ref name="nap.edu"/&gt;

[[File:Aviation radiation environment.png|thumbnail|All passengers in commercial aircraft flying above 26,000 feet will typically experience some exposure in this aviation radiation environment.]]

===Humans in commercial aviation ===
The magnetosphere guides cosmic ray and [[solar energetic particles]] to polar latitudes, while high energy charged particles enter the mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere. These energetic particles at the top of the atmosphere shatter atmospheric atoms and molecules, creating harmful lower energy particles that penetrate deep into the atmosphere and create measurable radiation. All aircraft flying above 8&amp;nbsp;km (26,200 feet) altitude are exposed to these particles. The dose exposure is greater in polar regions than at mid-latitude and equatorial regions. Many commercial aircraft fly over the polar region. When a space weather event causes radiation exposure to exceed the safe level set by aviation authorities,&lt;ref&gt;FAA Advisory Circular 120-52, March 5, 1990, Radiation exposure of air carrier crew members&lt;/ref&gt; the aircraft's flight path is diverted.

While the most significant, but highly unlikely, health consequences to atmospheric radiation exposure include death from cancer due to long-term exposure, many lifestyle-degrading and career-impacting cancer forms can also occur.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J.W., P. Goldhagen, V. Rafnsson, J.M. Clem, and G. De Angelis (2002), Overview of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation (AIR) Research: SST-Present, COSPAR, Houston, TX.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. K., Tobiska, W. Atwell, P. Beck, E. Benton, K. Copeland, C. Dyer, B. Gersey, I. Getley, A. Hands, M. Holland, S. Hong, J. Hwang, B. Jones, K. Malone, M. M. Meier, C. Mertens, T. Phillips, K. Ryden, N. Schwadron, S. A. Wender, R. Wilkins, M. A. Xapsos, Advances in Atmospheric Radiation Measurements and Modeling Needed to Improve Air Safety, Space Weather, 13, 202-210 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; A cancer diagnosis can have significant career impact for a commercial pilot. A cancer diagnosis can ground a pilot temporarily or permanently. International guidelines from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) have been developed to mitigate this statistical risk.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP, 1991. 1990 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. ICRP Publication 60. Ann. ICRP 21 (1-3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP, 2005. Low-dose Extrapolation of Radiation-related Cancer Risk. ICRP Publication 99. Ann. ICRP 35 (4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP, 2007. The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiologi-cal Protection. ICRP Publication 103. Ann. ICRP 37 (2-4).&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRP recommends effective dose limits of a 5-year average of 20 [[sievert|mSv]] per year with no more than 50&amp;nbsp;mSv in a single year for non-pregnant, occupationally exposed persons, and 1&amp;nbsp;mSv per year for the general public. Radiation dose limits are not engineering limits. In the U.S., they are treated as an upper limit of acceptability and not a regulatory limit.&lt;ref&gt;NCRP Report No. 116 - Limitation of Exposure to Ionizing Radiation, National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurements of the radiation environment at commercial aircraft altitudes above 8&amp;nbsp;km (26,000&amp;nbsp;ft) have historically been done by instruments that record the data on board where the data are then processed later on the ground. However, a system of real-time radiation measurements on-board aircraft has been developed through the NASA Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) program.&lt;ref&gt;W. K., Tobiska, D. Bouwer, D. Smart, M. Shea, J. Bailey, L. Didkovsky, K. Judge, H. Garrett, W. Atwell, B. Gersey, R. Wilkins, D. Rice, R. Schunk, D. Bell, C. Mertens, X. Xu, M. Wiltberger, S. Wiley, E. Teets, B. Jones, S. Hong, K. Yoon, Global real-time dose measurements using the Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) system, Space Weather, 14, 1053-1080 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; [http://sol.spacenvironment.net/~ARMAS/ ARMAS] has flown hundreds of flights since 2013, mostly on research aircraft, and sent the data to the ground through Iridium satellite links. The eventual goal of these types of measurements is to data assimilate them into physics-based global radiation models, e.g., NASA's Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System ([http://sol.spacenvironment.net/~nairas/index.html NAIRAS]), so as to provide the weather of the radiation environment rather than the climatology.

===Ground-induced electric fields===
[[Geomagnetic storm|Magnetic storm activity]] can induce geoelectric fields in the Earth's conducting [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Geomagnetically induced currents during magnetic storms, Pirjola, R., IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci., 28, 6, 1867-73, 2000, {{doi|10.1109/27.902215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding voltage differentials can [[Geomagnetically induced current|find their way into electric power grids through ground connections]], driving uncontrolled electric currents that interfere with grid operation, damage transformers, trip protective relays and sometimes cause blackouts.&lt;ref&gt;Extreme Space Weather: Impacts on Engineered Systems and Infrastructure, pp. 1-68.

EOS Trans. Am. Geophys. Union 70, 1479,1486-1488 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; which caused the complete collapse of the [[Hydro-Québec]] electric-power grid in Canada, temporarily leaving nine million people without electricity. The possible occurrence of an even more intense storm&lt;ref&gt;Baker, D.N., Balstad, R., Bodeau, J.M., Cameron, E., Fennell, J.E., Fisher, G.M., Forbes, K.F., Kintner, P.M., Leffler, L.G., Lewis, W.S., Reagan, J.B., Small, A.A., Stansell, T.A., Strachan, L.: Severe Space Weather Events: Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts, pp. 1-144, The National Academy Press, Washington, DC (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; led to operational standards intended to mitigate induction-hazard risks, while [[reinsurance]] companies commissioned revised [[risk assessments]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd's: Emerging Risk Report: Solar Storm Risk to the North American Electric Grid, pp. 1--22. Lloyd's of London, London, UK (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geophysical exploration===
Air- and ship-borne [[aeromagnetic survey|magnetic surveys]] can be affected by rapid magnetic field variations during geomagnetic storms. Such storms cause data interpretation problems because the space-weather-related magnetic field changes are similar in magnitude to those of the sub-surface crustal magnetic field in the survey area. Accurate geomagnetic storm warnings, including an assessment of storm magnitude and duration allows for an economic use of survey equipment.

===Geophysics and hydrocarbon production===
For economic and other reasons, oil and gas production often involves [[directional drilling|horizontal drilling]] of well paths many kilometers from a single wellhead. Accuracy requirements are strict, due to target size – reservoirs may only be a few tens to hundreds of meters across – and safety, because of the proximity of other boreholes. The most accurate gyroscopic method is expensive, since it can stop drilling for hours. An alternative is to use a magnetic survey, which enables [[MWD (measurement while drilling)|measurement while drilling (MWD)]]. Near real-time magnetic data can be used to correct drilling direction.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, T.D.G., Clarke, E. Space weather services for the offshore drilling industry, in: Proceedings of the ESA Space Weather Workshop, ESTEC, the Netherlands, 17–19 Dec, 2001, ESA WPP-194, 2001.; Reay et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Large-magnitude geomagnetic disturbances in the North Sea region: Statistics, causes, and forecasting, H. Gleisner, O. Rasmussen, J. Watermann, (2006), Adv. Space Res. 37, 1169–117, {{doi|10.1016/j.asr.2005.04.082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic data and space weather forecasts can help to clarify unknown sources of drilling error.

===Terrestrial weather===
The amount of energy entering the troposphere and stratosphere from space weather phenomena is trivial compared to the solar [[insolation]] in the visible and infra-red portions of the solar electromagnetic spectrum. However, some linkage between the 11-year sunspot cycle and the Earth's [[climate]] has been claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Variability of the solar cycle length during the past five centuries and the apparent association with terrestrial climate, K. Lassen and E. Friis-Christensen, 57, 8, pp. 835–845, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Maunder minimum]], a 70-year period almost devoid of sunspots, allegedly correlated to a cooler climate. One suggestion for the linkage between space and terrestrial weather is that changes in [[cosmic ray]] flux cause changes in the amount of cloud formation.&lt;ref&gt;What do we really know about the Sun-climate connection?, E. Friis-Christensen and H. Svensmark, Adv. Space Res., 20, 4/5, pp. 913–921, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion is that variations in the EUV flux subtly influence existing drivers of the climate and tip the balance between [[El Niño]]/[[La Niña]] events.&lt;ref&gt;Amplifying the Pacific climate system response to a small 11-year solar cycle forcing, Meehl, G.A.; Arblaster, J.M.; Matthes, K.; Sassi, F.; van Loon, H., ''Science'', 325, 5944, 1114-18, 28 Aug. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, a linkage between space weather and the climate has not been demonstrated conclusively.

==Observation==
Observation of space weather is done both for scientific research and for applications. Scientific observation has evolved with the state of knowledge, while application-related observation expanded with the ability to exploit such data.

===Ground-based===
Space weather is monitored at ground level by observing changes in the Earth's magnetic field over periods of seconds to days, by observing the surface of the Sun and by observing radio noise created in the Sun's atmosphere.

The [[Wolf number|Sunspot Number]] (SSN) is the number of [[sunspot]]s on the Sun's photosphere in visible light on the side of the Sun visible to an Earth observer. The number and total area of sunspots are related to the brightness of the Sun in the [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) and X-ray portions of the [[sunlight|solar spectrum]] and to solar activity such as [[solar flare]]s and [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs).

10.7&amp;nbsp;cm radio flux (F10.7) is a measurement of RF emissions from the Sun and is approximately correlated with the solar EUV flux. Since this RF emission is easily obtained from the ground and EUV flux is not, this value has been measured and disseminated continuously since 1947. The world standard measurements are made by the [[Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory]] at Penticton, B.C., Canada and reported once a day at local noon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/lists/radio/7day_rad.txt |title=Last 7 days of solar radio flux |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071524/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/lists/radio/7day_rad.txt |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in solar flux units (10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt;J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). F10.7 is archived by the National Geophysical Data Center.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/SOLAR_DATA/SOLAR_RADIO/FLUX/  NOAA/NGDC F10.7 archive]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental space weather monitoring data are provided by ground-based magnetometers and magnetic observatories. Magnetic storms were first discovered by ground-based measurement of occasional magnetic disturbance. Ground magnetometer data provide real-time situational awareness for post-event analysis. Magnetic observatories have been in continuous operations for decades to centuries, providing data to inform studies of long-term changes in space climatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Love, J.

[[Disturbance storm time index|Dst index]] is an estimate of the magnetic field change at the Earth's magnetic equator due to a ring of electric current at and just earthward of the [[geosynchronous orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulletin 40 |first1=Masahisa |last1=SUGIURA |first2=Toyohisa |last2=KAMEI|url = http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstdir/dst2/onDstindex.html|website = wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index is based on data from four ground-based magnetic observatories between 21° and 33° magnetic latitude during a one-hour period. Stations closer to the magnetic equator are not used due to ionospheric effects. The Dst index is compiled and archived by the World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto.&lt;ref name="kyoto"&gt;[http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wdc/Sec3.html Geomagnetic Data Service] World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K-index|Kp/ap]] Index: 'a' is an index created from the geomagnetic disturbance at one mid-latitude (40° to 50° latitude) geomagnetic observatory during a 3-hour period. 'K' is the quasi-logarithmic counterpart of the 'a' index. Kp and ap are the average of K and an over 13 geomagnetic observatories to represent planetary-wide geomagnetic disturbances. The Kp/ap index&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/kp-index Helmholtz Centre PotsdamGFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]&lt;/ref&gt; indicates both [[geomagnetic storm]]s and [[substorm]]s (auroral disturbance). Kp/ap is available from 1932 onward.

AE index is compiled from geomagnetic disturbances at 12 geomagnetic observatories in and near the auroral zones and is recorded at 1-minute intervals.&lt;ref name="kyoto" /&gt; The public AE index is available with a lag of two to three days that limits its utility for space weather applications. The AE index indicates the intensity of geomagnetic [[substorm]]s except during a major [[geomagnetic storm]] when the auroral zones expand equatorward from the observatories.

Radio noise bursts are reported by the Radio Solar Telescope Network to the U.S. Air Force and to NOAA. The radio bursts are associated with solar flare plasma that interacts with the ambient solar atmosphere.

The Sun's photosphere is observed continuously&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/solar_sites.html List of solar observatories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410190312/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/solar_sites.html |date=2011-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for activity that can be the precursors to solar flares and CMEs. The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)&lt;ref&gt;[http://gong.nso.org Global Oscillation Network Group home page]&lt;/ref&gt; project monitors both the surface and the interior of the Sun by using [[helioseismology]], the study of sound waves propagating through the Sun and observed as ripples on the solar surface. GONG can detect sunspot groups on the far side of the Sun. This ability has recently been verified by visual observations from the [[STEREO]] spacecraft.

[[Neutron monitor]]s on the ground indirectly monitor cosmic rays from the Sun and galactic sources. When cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere, atomic interactions occur that cause a shower of lower energy particles to descend into the atmosphere and to ground level. The presence of cosmic rays in the near-Earth space environment can be detected by monitoring high energy neutrons at ground level. Small fluxes of cosmic rays are present continuously. Large fluxes are produced by the Sun during events related to energetic solar flares.

[[Total Electron Content]] (TEC) is a measure of the ionosphere over a given location. TEC is the number of electrons in a column one meter square from the base of the ionosphere (approximately 90&amp;nbsp;km altitude) to the top of the ionosphere (approximately 1000&amp;nbsp;km altitude). Many TEC measurements are made by monitoring the two frequencies transmitted by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] spacecraft. Presently GPS TEC is monitored and distributed in real time from more than 360 stations maintained by agencies in many countries.

Geoeffectiveness is a measure of how strongly space weather magnetic fields, such as coronal mass ejections, couple with the Earth's magnetic field. This is determined by the direction of the magnetic field held within the plasma that originates from the Sun. New techniques measuring [[Faraday effect|Faraday Rotation]] in radio waves are in development to measure field direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Under Sunveillance|url=http://www.physics.org/featuredetail.asp?id=73|publisher=physics.org|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar-Heliospheric-Ionospheric Science|url=http://www.haystack.mit.edu/mwa/Science%20Goal/Solar-Heliospheric-Ionospheric%20Science/solar.html|publisher=MIT Haystack Observatory|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E.|editor-last = Trümper}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orbiting Geophysical Observatory]] series were among the first spacecraft with the mission of analyzing the space environment. Recent spacecraft include the NASA-ESA Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) pair of spacecraft launched in 2006 into solar orbit and the [[Van Allen Probes]], launched in 2012 into a highly [[elliptical]] Earth-orbit. The two STEREO spacecraft drift away from the Earth by about 22° per year, one leading and the other trailing the Earth in its orbit. Together they compile information about the solar surface and atmosphere in three dimensions. The Van Allen probes record detailed information about the radiation belts, geomagnetic storms and the relationship between the two.

Some spacecraft with other primary missions have carried auxiliary instruments for solar observation. Among the earliest such spacecraft were the [[Applications Technology Satellite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASA -  ATS|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/missions/ats.html|website = www.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ATS) series at GEO that were precursors to the modern [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] (GOES) weather satellite and many communication satellites. The ATS spacecraft carried environmental particle sensors as auxiliary payloads and had their navigational magnetic field sensor used for sensing the environment.

Many of the early instruments were research spacecraft that were re-purposed for space weather applications. One of the first of these was the IMP-8 (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMP-8 Project Information|url = http://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/imp8/project.html|website = spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It orbited the Earth at 35 Earth Radii and observed the solar wind for two-thirds of its 12-day orbits from 1973 to 2006. Since the solar wind carries disturbances that affect the magnetosphere and ionosphere, IMP-8 demonstrated the utility of continuous solar wind monitoring. IMP-8 was followed by [[International Cometary Explorer|ISEE-3]], which was placed near the {{L1}} [[Sun]]-[[Earth]] [[Lagrangian point]], 235 Earth radii above the surface (about 1.5 million km, or 924,000 miles) and continuously monitored the solar wind from 1978 to 1982. The next spacecraft to monitor the solar wind at the {{L1}} point was [[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND]] from 1994 to 1998. After April 1998, the WIND spacecraft orbit was changed to circle the Earth and occasionally pass the {{L1}} point. The NASA [[Advanced Composition Explorer]] (ACE) has monitored the solar wind at the {{L1}} point from 1997 to present.

In addition to monitoring the solar wind, monitoring the Sun is important to space weather. Because the solar EUV cannot be monitored from the ground, the joint [[NASA]]-[[ESA]] [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) spacecraft was launched and has provided solar EUV images beginning in 1995. SOHO is a main source of near-real time solar data for both research and space weather prediction and inspired the [[STEREO]] mission. The [[Yohkoh]] spacecraft at LEO observed the Sun from 1991 to 2001 in the X-ray portion of the solar spectrum and was useful for both research and space weather prediction. Data from Yohkoh inspired the [[Solar X-ray Imager]] on GOES.

[[File:ExtremeEvent 19891018-00h 19891031-24h.jpg|thumb|right|320px|GOES-7 monitors space weather conditions during the October 1989 solar activity resulted in a Forbush Decrease, Ground Level Enhancements, and many satellite anomalies.&lt;ref name="Extreme Space Weather Events"/&gt;]]

Spacecraft with instruments whose primary purpose is to provide data for space weather predictions and applications include the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] (GOES) series of spacecraft, the [[Polar Operational Environmental Satellites|POES]] series, the [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP]] series, and the [[Meteosat]] series. The GOES spacecraft have carried an X-ray sensor (XRS) which measures the flux from the whole solar disk in two bands – 0.05 to 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm and 0.1 to 0.8&amp;nbsp;nm – since 1974, an X-ray imager (SXI) since 2004, a magnetometer which measures the distortions of the Earth’s magnetic field due to space weather, a whole disk [[extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] sensor since 2004, and particle sensors (EPS/HEPAD) which measure ions and electrons in the energy range of 50 keV to 500 MeV. Starting sometime after 2015, the GOES-R generation of GOES spacecraft will replace the SXI with a solar EUV image (SUVI) similar to the one on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and [[STEREO]] and the particle sensor will be augmented with a component to extend the energy range down to 30&amp;nbsp;eV.

The [[Deep Space Climate Observatory]] (DSCOVR) satellite is a [[NOAA]] Earth observation and space weather satellite that launched in February 2015. Among its features is advance warning of coronal mass ejections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/nasa-set-to-launch-satellite-t/40450948 | title = NOAA's DSCOVR Satellite Launch Attempt Delayed by Technical Issues | first = Mark | last = Leberfinger | work = AccuWeather.com | publisher = AccuWeather, Inc. | date = February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Space weather models are simulations of the space weather environment. Models use sets of mathematical equations to describe physical processes.

These models take a limited data set and attempt to describe all or part of the space weather environment in or to predict how weather evolves over time. Early models were heuristic; i.e''., '' they did not directly employ physics. These models take less resources than their more sophisticated descendants.

Later models use physics to account for as many phenomena as possible. No model can yet reliably predict the environment from the surface of the Sun to the bottom of the Earth's ionosphere. Space weather models differ from meteorological models in that the amount of input is vastly smaller.

A significant portion of space weather model research and development in the past two decades has been done as part of the [[outer space#Geospace|Geospace]] Environmental Model (GEM) program of the [[National Science Foundation]]. The two major modeling centers are the Center for Space Environment Modeling (CSEM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CSEM - Center for Space Environment Modeling|url = http://csem.engin.umich.edu/|website = csem.engin.umich.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Center for Integrated Space weather Modeling (CISM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CISM // Home|url = http://www.bu.edu/cism/|website = www.bu.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Community Coordinated Modeling Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/|title = NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CCMC) at the NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] is a facility for coordinating the development and testing of research models, for improving and preparing models for use in space weather prediction and application.&lt;ref&gt;Wang-Sheeley-Arge-Enlil Cone Model Transitions to Operations, Pizzo, V., G. Millward, A. Parsons, D. Biesecker, S. Hill, and D. Odstrcil (2011), Space Weather, 9, S03004, {{doi|10.1029/2011SW000663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modeling techniques include (a) [[magnetohydrodynamics]], in which the environment is treated as a fluid, (b) particle in cell, in which non-fluid interactions are handled within a cell and then cells are connected to describe the environment, (c) first principles, in which physical processes are in balance (or equilibrium) with one another, (d) semi-static modeling, in which a statistical or empirical relationship is described, or a combination of multiple methods.

== Commercial space weather development ==
During the first decade of the 21st Century, a commercial sector emerged that engaged in space weather, serving agencies, commercial and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;National Academies Press, "Solar and Space Physics: A Science for a Technological Society," Committee on a Decadal Strategy for Solar and Space Physics (Heliophysics); Space Studies Board; Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board; Division of Earth and Physical Sciences; National Research Council {{ISBN|978-0-309-16428-3}}, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Space weather providers are mostly small companies that provide space weather data, models, derivative products and service distribution.

The commercial sector includes scientific and engineering researchers as well as users. Activities are primarily directed toward the impacts of space weather upon technology. These include, for example: 
* Atmospheric drag on LEO satellites caused by energy inputs into the thermosphere from solar UV, FUV, [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]], [[EUV]], [[Extreme ultraviolet|XUV]] and X-ray photons as well as by charged particle precipitation and [[Joule heating]] at high latitudes; 
* Surface and internal charging from increased energetic particle fluxes, leading to effects such as discharges, single event upsets and latch-up, on LEO to GEO satellites; 
* Disrupted GPS signals caused by ionospheric scintillation leading to increased uncertainty in navigation systems such as aviation’s [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS);
* Lost HF, UHF and L-band radio communications due to ionosphere scintillation, solar flares and geomagnetic storms; 
* Increased radiation to human tissue and avionics from [[galactic cosmic rays]] and SEP, especially during large solar flares, at altitudes above 8&amp;nbsp;km;&lt;ref&gt;Tobiska, et al., Advances in atmospheric radiation measurements and modeling needed to improve international air safety, Space Weather Journal, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Increased inaccuracy in surveying and oil/gas exploration that uses the Earth’s main magnetic field when it is disturbed by geomagnetic storms;
* Loss of power transmission from GIC surges in the electrical power grid and transformer shutdowns during large geomagnetic storms. 
Many of these disturbances result in societal impacts that account for a significant part of the national GDP.

The concept of a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone stems from the work of the American Commercial Space Weather Association (ACSWA) in 2015. The establishment of this economic innovation zone would encourage expanded economic activity developing applications to manage the risks space weather and would encourage broader research activities related to space weather by universities. The formation of a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone would: encourage U.S. business investment in space weather services and products; support U.S. business innovation in space weather services and products; require U.S. government purchases of U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services where no suitable government capability pre-exists; promote U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services to international partners; designate U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products as “Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone” activities; and track U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products as Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone contributions within agency reports. In 2015 HR1561 provided groundwork where social and environmental impacts from a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone could be far-reaching. U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products can prevent economic disruptions and loss-of-life from societal risks resulting from space weather and an innovation zone would encourage the research and investment needed for this success. In 2016, the Space Weather Research and Forecasting Act (S. 2817) would potentially build on that legacy.

=== American Commercial Space Weather Association ===
On April 29, 2010, the commercial space weather community created the American Commercial Space Weather Association ([http://acswa.us ACSWA]) an industry association. ACSWA promotes space weather risk mitigation for national infrastructure, economic strength and national security. It seeks to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACSWA Capabilities|url = http://www.acswa.us/capabilities.html|website = www.acswa.us|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* provide quality space weather data and services to help mitigate risks to technology;
* provide advisory services to government agencies;
* provide guidance on the best task division between commercial providers and government agencies;
* represent the interests of commercial providers;
* represent commercial capabilities in the national and international arena; 
* develop best-practices.

A summary of the broad technical capabilities in space weather that are available from the association can be found on their web site http://www.acswa.us.

'''''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down: A Hmong Child, Her American Doctors, and the Collision of Two Cultures''''' is a 1997 book by [[Anne Fadiman]] that chronicles the struggles of a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] refugee family from Houaysouy, [[Sainyabuli Province]], [[Laos]],&lt;ref name="Fadiman103"&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman]]. "Foua and Nao Kao." ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DUHAXXvSUeYC&amp;pg=PA103 103]. "[...]I asked her to describe a typical day in Houaysouy, the village in the northwestern province of Sayaboury where the Lee family had lived."&lt;/ref&gt; the Lees, and their interactions with the health care system in [[Merced, California]]. In 2005 Robert Entenmann, [[Ph.D.]], of [[St. Olaf College]] wrote that the book is "certainly the most widely read book on the Hmong experience in America."&lt;ref name=Entenmannp1&gt;Entenmann, Robert. "[http://hmongstudies.org/EntenmannHSJ6.pdf The Myth of Sonom, the Hmong King]." ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QyjDhsaM?url=http://hmongstudies.org/EntenmannHSJ6.pdf |date=2014-07-11 }}) ''[[Hmong Studies Journal]]'', Volume 6, 2005. p. 1. Retrieved on July 11, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the most basic level, the book tells the story of the family's second youngest and favored daughter, Lia Lee, who was diagnosed with a severe form of [[epilepsy]] named [[Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome]]  and the culture conflict that obstructs her treatment.

Through miscommunications about medical dosages and parental refusal to give certain medicines due to mistrust, misunderstandings, and behavioral side effects, and the inability of the doctors to develop more empathy with the traditional Hmong lifestyle or try to learn more about the Hmong culture, Lia's condition worsens. The dichotomy between the Hmong's perceived spiritual factors and the Americans' perceived scientific factors comprises the overall theme of the book.

The book is written in a unique style, with every other chapter returning to Lia's story and the chapters in-between discussing broader themes of [[Hmong customs and culture|Hmong culture, customs, and history]]; American involvement in and responsibility for the war in Laos; and the many problems of immigration, especially assimilation and discrimination. While particularly sympathetic to the Hmong, Fadiman presents the situation from the perspectives of both the doctors and the family. An example of [[medical anthropology]], the book has been cited by medical journals and lecturers as an argument for greater [[cultural competence]], and often assigned to medical, pharmaceutic, and anthropological students in the US. In 1997, it won the [[National Book Critics Circle]] Award for General Nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/page_2 National Book Critics Circle - past awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

She had seizures due to ''[[Lennox–Gastaut syndrome|Lennox-Gastaut]]'' [[Lennox–Gastaut syndrome|syndrome]], a severe form of ''epilepsy''.

'''Anne Fadiman''': She is an author and narrator of ‘The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down’. She wrote about her experience with Lia and her family. Through this experience, she learned the importance of understanding about diversity of culture between doctor, patient, and family.

'''Neil Ernst and Peggy Philp''': They are Lia’s doctors at MCMC. There is conflict between them and Lia's parents because of Hmong shamanism culture versus western medicine.  This leads to great misunderstandings between each other.

'''Foua Yang and Nao Kao Lee''': They are Lia’s parents, and they love Lia very much. They only believe in their traditional approach to medical treatment, with a strong influence from shamanism.

'''Jeanine Hilt''': A [[social work]]er who makes Lia her personal cause. She fights against the medical establishment on Lia’s behalf and cares for the Hmong as a significant culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Clapsaddle|first=Diane|title=The Spirit Catches You Study Guide02|url=http://thebestnotes.com/booknotes/Spirit_Catches_You_Fadiman/The_Spirit_Catches_You_Study_Guide02.html|website=TheBestNotes.com|date=20 Mar 2015|accessdate=12 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fadiman/&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Merced, Mercy General.JPG|thumb|[[Mercy Medical Center Merced]], previously the Merced Community Medical Center; this is a new building and not the previous building where Lia Lee was taken]]
Lia experienced her first [[seizure]] at three months of age, but a resident at [[Merced Community Medical Center]] misdiagnosed her condition, and the hospital was unable to communicate with her parents since the hospital had no [[Hmong language|Hmong]] interpreters. [[Anne Fadiman]] wrote that Lia's parents did not give her medication as it was prescribed because they believed that Lia Lee's state showed a sense of spiritual giftedness, and they did not want to take that away. The American doctors did not understand the Hmong traditional remedies that the Lee family used. The doctors treating Lia Lee, Neil and Peggy Ernst, had her removed from her home when she was almost three years of age, and placed into [[foster care]] for one year, causing friction with her parents. By age 4½ Lia Lee had been admitted to hospital care 17 times and had made over 100 outpatient visits.&lt;ref name=Foxdead2&gt;Fox, Margalit. "Lia Lee Dies; Life Went On Around Her, Redefining Care." ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 14, 2012. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/us/life-went-on-around-her-redefining-care-by-bridging-a-divide.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;ref=obituaries 2]. Retrieved on October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The worst seizure Lia had put her onto the verge of death. She went to the emergency room and Dr. Neil Ernst could not do anything. He talked to Lia's parents about transferring her to Fresno, California because Lia would need further treatment that Dr. Ernst could not provide.  Lia's parents ". . .  believed their daughter was transferred not because of her critical condition but because of the Ernst's vacation plans".
Lia Lee slipped into a coma after suffering from a [[grand mal seizure]] in 1986, when she was four years of age. Lia Lee's doctors believed she would die, but Lia Lee remained alive but with no higher brain functions.&lt;ref name=Foxdead2/&gt;

==Research==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
Fadiman's sources for information about the history of the Hmong include ''[[Hmong: History of a People]]'' by Keith Quincy. She stated "Were I citing the source of each detail, Quincy's name would attach itself to nearly every sentence in the pages on the Hmong in China."&lt;ref name=fadiman&gt;{{citation|last=Fadiman|title=The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down|date=September 30, 1998|isbn=9781429931113|url=http://anthropology.msu.edu/anp370-us15/files/2015/05/The-Spirit-Catches-You-and-You-Anne-Fadiman.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fadiman's book cited the Quincy theory that the Hmong people originated from Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Pfeifer|Pfeifer, Mark E.]] ([[Hmong Cultural and Resource Center]]). "[http://hmongstudies.org/PremodernHmongHistory.pdf Overview of Recent Scholarship on Premodern Hmong History]" ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qz49SIUA?url=http://hmongstudies.org/PremodernHmongHistory.pdf |date=2014-07-11 }}). ''[[Hmong Studies Journal]]'' at ''Hmong Studies Internet Resource Center''. Presentation at the "[http://www.hmongstudies.com/HmongWomensConference.html “Building on Hmong Women’s Assets: Past, Present, and Future” September 16-17, 2005, St. Paul/Minneapolis, MN]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6Qz7GBp6m?url=http://www.hmongstudies.com/HmongWomensConference.html Archive]).&lt;/ref&gt; Entenmann wrote that because of the reliance on Quincy's book, Fadiman's book propagates the idea that [[Sonom]] was a Hmong king, a concept that Entenmann says is inaccurate.&lt;ref name=Entenmannp1/&gt;

==Legacy==
Marilyn Mochel, a nurse and clinical educator at Sutter Merced Medical Center&lt;!--This is the hospital which treated Lia Lee!!!!--&gt; (now [[Mercy Medical Center Merced]]), who heads the hospital's cross-cultural program, said in 1999 that "The book has allowed more dialogue. There's certainly more awareness and dialogue than before. Both sides are teachers and learners."&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;Jennings, Ralph. "[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MS&amp;p_theme=ms&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F1D5920117213F7&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM MERCED HOSPITAL FILLS CULTURAL PRESCRIPTION]." ''[[The Modesto Bee]]''. Sunday March 21, 1999. B3. Retrieved on March 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lia Lee lived in a persistent vegetative state for 26 years. She died in [[Sacramento, California]], on August 31, 2012 at the age of 30.&lt;ref name="Foxdead1"/&gt; At that age she weighed {{convert|47|lbs|kg}} and was {{convert|4|ft|7|in|m}} tall; many children with severe brain damage have limited growth as they age.&lt;ref name=Foxdead3&gt;Fox, Margalit. "Lia Lee Dies; Life Went On Around Her, Redefining Care." ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 14, 2012. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/us/life-went-on-around-her-redefining-care-by-bridging-a-divide.html?pagewanted=3&amp;ref=obituaries 3]. Retrieved on October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the [[State of California]] Lia Lee's death was not widely reported. Fadiman said that [[pneumonia]] was the immediate cause of death. Margalit Fox of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "[b]ut Lia’s underlying medical issues were more complex still" because she had lived in a persistent vegetative state for such a long period of time. As of 2012 most individuals who go into that state die three to five years afterwards.&lt;ref name=Foxdead1/&gt;

==Reception==
Ralph Jennings of ''[[The Modesto Bee]]'' said "Hmong, including some among the 2,000 in [[Modesto, California|Modesto]], say the book typified conflicts between their culture and American institutions. But some say it didn't capture the complexity of the Hmong culture."&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

Cheng Lee, a brother of Lia Lee, said that his father and mother liked Fadiman's book.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

“Compellingly written, from the heart and from the trenches. I couldn’t wait to finish it, then reread it and ponder it again. It is a powerful case study of a medical tragedy.” - David H. Mark, Journal of the American Medical Association

Anne Fadiman's essay "Hmong Odyssey," adapted from the book, was published in the March–April 1998 ''[[Via (magazine)|Via]]''. The Hmong community leaders in [[Fresno, California]] praised the essay, saying that it was thoughtful and accurate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FB&amp;p_theme=fb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAE8A732D83B82C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM ESSAY VS.

[[File:Tree line.jpg|thumb|In this view of an alpine tree line, the distant line looks particularly sharp. The foreground shows the transition from trees to no trees. These trees are stunted in growth and one-sided because of cold and constant wind.]]

The '''tree line''' is the edge of the habitat at which [[tree]]s are capable of growing. It is found at high elevations and high latitudes. Beyond the tree line, trees cannot tolerate the environmental conditions (usually cold temperatures or associated lack of available moisture).&lt;ref name=taiga&gt;{{cite book|first=D.L.|last=Elliott-Fisk|chapter=The Taiga and Boreal Forest|editor1-first=M.G.|editor1-last=Barbour|editor2-first=M.D.|editor2-last=Billings|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-55986-7|title=North American Terrestrial Vegetation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} The tree line is sometimes distinguished from a lower  '''timberline''' or '''forest line''', which is the line where trees form a forest with a closed [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]].&lt;ref name=ecosystem&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecosystem Ecology|first=S.E.|last=Jørgensen|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-444-53466-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|151}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alpine Treelines: Functional Ecology of the Global High Elevation Tree Limits|first1=C.|last1=Körner|first2=S.|last2=Riedl|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=9783034803960}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

At the tree line, tree growth is often sparse, stunted, and deformed by wind and cold [[krummholz]] (German for "crooked wood").&lt;ref name=landabove&gt;{{cite book|title=Land Above the Trees: A Guide to American Alpine Tundra|first1=A.|last1=Zwinger|first2=B. E.|last2=Willard|publisher=Big Earth Publishing|year=1996|isbn=1-55566-171-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58}}

The tree line often appears well-defined, but it can be a more gradual transition. Trees grow shorter and often at lower densities as they approach tree line, above which they cease to exist.&lt;ref name=landabove/&gt;{{rp|55}}

It shows tree lines of the [[Andes]], [[Himalaya]], [[Alps]] and [[Pyrenees]]]]
There are several types of tree lines defined in [[ecology]] and [[geography]]:

===Alpine===
[[File:Treeline In The Tararuas.JPG|thumb|220px|An alpine tree line in the [[Tararua Range]]]]
An alpine tree line is the highest elevation that sustains trees; higher up it is too cold, or the snow cover lasts for too much of the year to sustain trees.&lt;ref name=ecosystem/&gt;{{rp|151}} The climate above the tree line of [[mountain]]s is called an [[alpine climate]],&lt;ref name=plantlife&gt;{{cite book|title=Alpine plant life: functional plant ecology of high mountain ecosystems|first=C|last=Körner|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=3-540-00347-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} and the terrain can be described as [[alpine tundra]].&lt;ref name=romo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/romo/naturescience/alpine_tundra_ecosystem.htm|title=Alpine Tundra Ecosystem|work=Rocky Mountain National Park|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern hemisphere treelines on north-facing slopes are lower than on south-facing slopes because the increased shade on north-facing slopes means the [[snowpack]] takes longer to melt. This shortens the growing season for trees.&lt;ref name=rockymtns&gt;{{cite book|first=R.K.|last=Peet|chapter=Forests and Meadows of the Rocky Mountains|editor1-first=M.G.|editor1-last=Barbour|editor2-first=M.D.|editor2-last=Billings|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-55986-7|title=North American Terrestrial Vegetation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|109}} In the southern hemisphere, the south-facing slopes have the shorter growing season.

The alpine tree line boundary is seldom abrupt: it usually forms a transition zone between closed forest below and treeless alpine tundra above. This zone of transition occurs “near the top of the tallest peaks in the northeastern United States, high up on the giant [[volcano]]es in central Mexico, and on mountains in each of the 11 western states and throughout much of Canada and Alaska”.&lt;ref name="arno" /&gt; Environmentally dwarfed shrubs ([[krummholz]]) commonly forms the upper limit.

The decrease in air temperature due to increasing elevation causes the alpine climate. The rate of decrease can vary in different mountain chains, from {{convert|3.5|F-change|C-change}} per {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of elevation gain in the dry mountains of the Western United States,&lt;ref name="arno" /&gt; to {{convert|1.4|F-change|C-change}} per {{convert|1000|ft|m}} in the moister mountains of the Eastern United States.&lt;ref name="baker"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=F.S.|year=1944|title=Mountain climates of the western United States|journal=Ecol. Monogr.|volume=14|issue=2|pages=223–254|jstor=1943534|doi=10.2307/1943534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skin effects and [[topography]] can create [[microclimate]]s that alter the general cooling trend.&lt;ref name="gei"&gt;{{cite book|last=Geiger|first=R.|year=1950|title=The Climate near the Ground|journal=Harvard Univ. Press|location=Cambridge MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with arctic timberlines, alpine timberlines may receive fewer than half of the number of degree days (&gt;10&amp;nbsp;°C) based on air temperature, but because solar radiation intensities are greater at alpine than at arctic timberlines the number of degree days calculated from leaf temperatures may be very similar.&lt;ref name="arno" /&gt;

Summer warmth generally sets the limit to which tree growth can occur, for while timberline [[Pinophyta|conifers]] are very frost-hardy during most of the year, they become sensitive to just 1 or 2 degrees of frost in mid-summer.&lt;ref name="tran"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tranquillini|first=W.|year=1979|title= Physiological Ecology of the Alpine Timberline: tree existence at high altitudes with special reference to the European Alps|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York NY|isbn=3642671071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coates|first1=K.D.|last2=Haeussler|first2=S.|last3=Lindeburgh|first3=S|last4=Pojar|first4=R.|last5=Stock|first5=A.J.|year=1994|title=Ecology and silviculture of interior spruce in British Columbia|oclc=66824523}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of warm summers in the 1940s seems to have permitted the establishment of “significant numbers” of spruce seedlings above the previous treeline in the hills near [[Fairbanks, Alaska]].&lt;ref name="vier4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viereck|first=L.A.|year=1979|title=Characteristics of treeline plant communities in Alaska|journal=Holarctic Ecol.|volume=2|pages=228–238|jstor=3682417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vier8"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Viereck|first1=L.A.|last2=Van Cleve|first2=K.|last3=Dyrness|first3=C.T|year=1986|chapter=Forest ecosystem distribution in the taiga environment|pages=22–43|title=Forest Ecosystems in the Alaskan Taiga|editor-last1=Van Cleve|editor-first1=K.|editor-last2=Chapin|editor-first2=F.S.|editor-last3=Flanagan|editor-first3=P.W.|editor-last4=Viereck|editor-first4=L.A.|editor-last5=Dyrness|editor-first5=C.T.|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York NY|doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4902-3_3|isbn=1461249023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survival depends on a sufficiency of new growth to support the tree. The windiness of high-elevation sites is also a potent determinant of the distribution of tree growth. Wind can [[flag tree|mechanically damage tree tissues directly]], including blasting with wind-borne particles, and may also contribute to the desiccation of [[leaf|foliage]], especially of shoots that project above snow cover.

At the alpine timberline, tree growth is inhibited when excessive snow lingers and shortens the growing season to the point where new growth would not have time to harden before the onset of fall frost. Moderate snowpack, however, may promote tree growth by insulating the trees from extreme cold during the winter, curtailing water loss,&lt;ref name="sowell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sowell|first1=J.B.|last2=McNulty|first2=S.P.|last3=Schilling|first3=B.K.|year=1996|title=The role of stem recharge in reducing the winter desiccation of ''Picea engelmannii'' (Pinaceae) needles at alpine timberline|journal=Am. J. Bot.|volume=83|issue=10|pages=1351–1355|jstor=2446122|doi=10.2307/2446122}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prolonging a supply of moisture through the early part of the growing season. However, snow accumulation in sheltered gullies in the Selkirk Mountains of southeastern British Columbia causes timberline to be {{convert|400|m|ft}} lower than on exposed intervening shoulders.&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=C.H.|year=1909|title=The causes of timberline on mountains: the role of snow|journal=Plant World|volume=12|pages=169–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desert===
In a desert, the tree line marks the driest places where trees can grow; drier [[desert]] areas having insufficient [[rainfall]] to sustain them. These tend to be called the "lower" tree line and occur below about {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}} elevation in the Desert of the [[Southwestern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paleoclimatology: reconstructing climates of the Quaternary|volume=68|first=Raymond S.|last=Bradley|page=344|publisher=Academic Press|year=1999|isbn=0123869951}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desert treeline tends to be lower on pole-facing slopes than equator-facing slopes, because the increased shade on the former keeps those cooler and prevents moisture from evaporating as quickly, giving trees a longer growing season and more access to water.

===Desert-alpine===
In some mountainous areas, higher elevations above the [[condensation]] line or on equator-facing and leeward slopes can result in low rainfall and increased exposure to solar radiation. This dries out the soil, resulting in a localized arid environment unsuitable for trees. Many south-facing ridges of the mountains of the Western U.S. have a lower treeline than the northern faces because of increased sun exposure and aridity.

===Double tree line===
Different tree species have different tolerances to drought and cold.  Mountain ranges isolated by oceans or deserts may have restricted repertoires of tree species with gaps that are above the alpine tree line for some species yet below the desert tree line for others.  For example, several mountain ranges in the [[Great Basin]] of [[North America]] have lower belts of [[Single-leaf Pinyon|Pinyon Pines]] and [[Juniperus osteosperma|Junipers]] separated by intermediate brushy but treeless zones from upper belts of [[Limber pine|Limber]] and [[Great Basin Bristlecone Pine|Bristlecone Pines]].&lt;ref name=jepsondesert&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jepson desert manual: vascular plants of southeastern California|first=B.G.|last=Baldwin|publisher=University of California Press|year=2002|isbn=0-520-22775-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}}

===Exposure===
On [[coast]]s and isolated mountains the tree line is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong [[wind]]s reduce tree growth. In addition the lack of suitable soil, such as along [[scree|talus slopes]] or exposed rock formations, prevents trees from gaining an adequate foothold and exposes them to drought and sun.

===Arctic===
[[File:Treeline on mountain over Firth River in Ivvavik National Park, YT.jpg|thumb|right|Treeline on a mountain in the [[Canadian Arctic]]|alt=A mountain rising from a river with brownish water at its base. Its lower slopes are green with scattered evergreen trees, giving way to much denser forest cover midway up. At the top it yields abruptly to bare rock with some green ground cover. Above it is a partly cloudy sky.]]
The arctic tree line is the northernmost [[latitude]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] where trees can grow; farther north, it is too cold all year round to sustain trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Long-term environmental change in Arctic and Antarctic lakes|first1=Reinhard|last1=Pienitz|first2=Marianne S. V.|last2=Douglas|first3=John P.|last3=Smol|page=102|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=1402021267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely cold temperatures, especially when prolonged, can freeze the internal sap of trees, killing them. In addition, [[permafrost]] in the soil can prevent trees from getting their roots deep enough for the necessary structural support.

Unlike alpine timberlines, the northern timberline occurs at low elevations. The arctic forest–tundra transition zone in northwestern Canada varies in width, perhaps averaging {{convert|145|km|mi}} and widening markedly from west to east,&lt;ref name="timoney"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Timoney|first1=K.P.|last2=La Roi|first2=G.H.|last3=Zoltai|first3=S.C.|last4=Robinson|first4=A.L.|year=1992|title=The high subarctic forest–tundra of northwestern Canada: position, width, and vegetation gradients in relation to climate|journal=Arctic|volume=45|pages=1–9|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/viewFile/1367/1392|jstor=40511186|doi=10.14430/arctic1367}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast with the telescoped alpine timberlines.&lt;ref name="arno"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arno|first=S.F.|year=1984|title=Timberline: Mountain and Arctic Forest Frontiers|publisher=The Mountaineers|location=Seattle, WA|isbn=0-89886-085-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; North of the arctic timberline lies the low-growing [[tundra]], and southwards lies the [[Taiga|boreal forest]].

Two zones can be distinguished in the arctic timberline:&lt;ref name="love"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Löve|first=Dd|year=1970|title=Subarctic and subalpine: where and what?|journal=Arctic and Alpine Res.|volume=2|pages=63–73|jstor=1550141|doi=10.2307/1550141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hare2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hare|first1=F.K.|last2=Ritchie|first2=J|year=1972|title=The boreal bioclimates|journal=Geogr. Rev.|volume=62|issue=3|pages=333–365|jstor=213287|doi=10.2307/213287}}&lt;/ref&gt; a forest–tundra zone of scattered patches of krummholz or stunted trees, with larger trees along rivers and on sheltered sites set in a matrix of tundra; and “open boreal forest” or “lichen woodland”, consisting of open groves of erect trees underlain by carpet of ''Cladonia'' spp. [[lichen]]s.&lt;ref name="love" /&gt; The proportion of trees to lichen mat increases southwards towards the “forest line”, where trees cover 50 percent or more of the landscape.&lt;ref name="arno" /&gt;&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Black|last1=R.A.|last2=Bliss|first2=L.C.|year=1978|title=Recovery sequence of ''Picea mariana–Vaccinium uliginosum'' forests after burning near Inuvik, Northwest Territories, Canada|journal=Can. J. Bot.|volume=56|issue=6|pages=2020–2030|doi=10.1139/b78-243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antarctic===
{{Further|Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra|Tierra del Fuego}}

A southern treeline exists in the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands]] and the Australian [[Macquarie Island]], with places where mean annual temperatures above {{convert|5|C|F}} support trees and woody plants, and those below {{convert|5|C|F}} don't.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1101|name=Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another treeline exists in the southwestern most parts of the [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregion, where the forest merges into the subantarctic tundra (termed Magellanic moorland or Magellanic tundra).&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=nt0402|name=Magellanic subpolar Nothofagus forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the northern halves of [[Hoste Island|Hoste]] and [[Navarino Island|Navarino]] Islands have [[Nothofagus antarctica]] forests but the southern parts consist of moorlands and tundra.

===Other tree lines===
Several other reasons may cause the environment to be too extreme for trees to grow. This can include geothermal exposure associated with hot springs or volcanoes, such as at [[Yellowstone]]; high soil acidity near [[bog]]s; high salinity associated with [[Dry lake|playas]] or [[salt lakes]]; or ground that is saturated with groundwater that excludes oxygen from the soil, which most tree roots need for growth. The margins of [[muskeg]]s and bogs are common examples of these types of open area. However, no such line exists for [[swamp]]s, where trees, such as [[Taxodium|Bald cypress]] and the many [[mangrove]] species, have adapted to growing in permanently waterlogged soil. In some colder parts of the world there are tree lines around swamps, where there are no local tree species that can develop. There are also man-made pollution tree lines in weather-exposed areas, where new tree lines have developed because of the increased stress of pollution. Examples are found around [[Nikel]] in Russia and previously in the [[Erzgebirge]].

===Alpine tree lines===
The alpine tree line at a location is dependent on local variables, such as [[aspect (geography)|aspect]] of slope, [[rain shadow]] and proximity to either [[geographical pole]]. In addition, in some tropical or island localities, the lack of biogeographical access to species that have evolved in a [[subalpine zone|subalpine]] environment can result in lower tree lines than one might expect by climate alone.

Averaging over many locations and local [[microclimate]]s, the treeline rises {{convert|75|m|ft|round=5}} when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and {{convert|130|m|ft}} per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between {{convert|3500|and|4000|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=korner/&gt;

===Arctic tree lines===
Like the alpine tree lines shown above, polar tree lines are heavily influenced by local variables such as [[aspect (geography)|aspect]] of slope and degree of shelter. In addition, [[permafrost]] has a major impact on the ability of trees to place roots into the ground. When roots are too shallow, trees are susceptible to [[windthrow]] and erosion. Trees can often grow in river [[valleys]] at latitudes where they could not grow on a more exposed site. Maritime influences such as [[ocean currents]] also play a major role in determining how far from the equator trees can grow as well as the warm summers experienced in extreme continental climates. In northern inland [[Scandinavia]] there is substantial maritime influence on high parallels that keep winters relatively mild, but enough inland effect to have summers well above the threshold for the tree line. Here are some typical polar treelines:

===Antarctic tree lines===
Trees exist on [[Tierra del Fuego]] (55°S) at the southern end of South America, but generally not on [[List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands|subantarctic islands]] and not in Antarctica. Therefore, there is no explicit Antarctic tree line.

[[Kerguelen Island]] (49°S), [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] (54°S), and other subantarctic islands are all so heavily wind exposed and with a too cold summer climate (tundra) that none have any indigenous tree species. The [[Wildlife of the Falkland Islands|Falkland Islands]] (51°S) summer temperature is near the limit, but the islands are also treeless although some planted trees exist.

[[Antarctic Peninsula]] is the northernmost point in Antarctica (63°S) and has the mildest weather. It is located {{convert|1080|km|mi}} from [[Cape Horn]] on [[Tierra del Fuego]]. But no trees live in Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of grass, mosses, and lichens survive on the peninsula. In addition, no trees survive on any of the subantarctic islands near the peninsula.

[[File:BeagleChannelGlacier.jpg|thumb|Trees growing along the north shore of the [[Beagle Channel]], 55°S.]]
Southern [[Metrosideros|Rata]] forests exist on [[Enderby Island]] and [[Auckland Islands]] (both 50°S) and these grow up to an elevation of {{convert|1200|ft|m|order=flip}} in sheltered valleys. These trees seldom grow above {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and they get smaller as one gains altitude, so that by {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}  they are waist high. These islands have only 600 – 800 hours of sun annually. [[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]] (52°S) further south is treeless, except for one stunted pine, planted by scientists. The climate on these islands is not severe, but tree growth is limited by almost continual rain and wind. Summers are very cold with an average January temperature of {{convert|9|C|F|abbr=on}}. Winters are mild {{convert|5|C|F|abbr=on}} but wet. [[Macquarie Island]] (Australia) is located at 54°S and has no vegetation beyond snow grass and alpine grasses and mosses.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

{{Dormancy}}'''Winter rest''' (from the [[German language|German]] term ''Winterruhe'') is a state of reduced activity of [[plant]]s and [[warm-blooded]] [[animal]]s living in extratropical regions of the [[Earth|world]] during the more hostile environmental conditions of [[winter]]. In this state, they save energy during cold weather while they have limited access to food sources.

==Plants==
[[Deciduous]] trees lose their foliage in the winter. Tree [[growth rings]] are a result of winter rest, as there is rapid growth in the warmer [[spring (season)|spring]], then slower growth later in the year.

[[Perennial plant|Perennial]] and [[Biennial plant|biennial]] [[herbaceous plants]] lose their frost-sensitive, above-ground parts before the winter, and regrow in the spring. Herbaceous plants that are [[Annual plant|annual]], producing seeds before the winter, can also be considered to have winter rest in some form, because their seeds may stay inactive over the winter before [[germinating]]. Annual plants which have seeds that germinate before winter also have winter rest. [[Winter cereals]], for example, which are sown in the [[fall]] and germinate before the frost, become dormant during the winter and actually require a few weeks of cold before they are able to flower.

==Animals==
Winter rest in an animal is different from true [[hibernation]], since the [[metabolism]] is not reduced drastically. The body temperature is not significantly lowered, however the [[heart rate]] is reduced. This means that animals like the [[raccoon]] can quickly become active again if temperatures rise or the snow melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=MacClintock | first=Dorcas | title=A Natural History of Raccoons | publisher=The Blackburn Press | location=Caldwell, New Jersey | year=1981 | isbn=978-1-930665-67-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals that winter rest are [[European badger|badgers]] and [[brown bear]]s.
