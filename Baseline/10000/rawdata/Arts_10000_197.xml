'''''Afterimage: The Journal of Media Arts and Cultural Criticism''''' is a bimonthly journal of contemporary art, culture, and politics. It publishes features, essays, local and international reportage, exhibition reviews, and book reviews with an emphasis on [[social dialogue]], politically engaged artistic practices, and the role of the artist as [[cultural critic]] and [[curator]].

The journal is published by the [[Visual Studies Workshop]], a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[artist-run space|artist-run]], education center for [[photography]] and other [[media arts]] based in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Abrash|title=Mediating History: The Map Guide to Independent Video by and About African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino, and Native American People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F90TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|accessdate=February 28, 2016|date=August 1, 1992|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-0620-6|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Afterimage'' was founded in 1972 by photographer and curator [[Nathan Lyons]], who had previously served as assistant director and chief curator of the international museum of photography known as [[George Eastman House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Art, Activism, and Oppositionality: Essays from Afterimage |last=Kester |first=Grant H. |year=1998 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, North Carolina |isbn=978-0-8223-2081-4 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eu5cm9iuewC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inaugural issue, the magazine aimed to pose "a challenge to existing centres of practice and education" as well as "to [[institutional hierarchy|institutional hierarchies]], widening the remit of art criticism and theoretical debate and engaging directly with context, community and issues of [[accountability]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 5, 2012|url=http://www.variant.org.uk/8texts/Ann_Vance.html|title= Review of Art Activism and Oppositionality: Essays From Afterimage|work=Variant|publisher=Variant |first=Ann  |last=Vance |date=Summer 1999|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ''Afterimage'' editor Grant H. Kester described the ethos of the magazine in terms of two primary modes of resistance:

* "an attempt to contest the then dominant tendency to view art photography as a form of pure expression that must remain uncontaminated by more mundane or quotidian uses of the medium"&lt;ref name=artc&gt;{{cite book |title=Art, Activism, and Oppositionality: Essays from Afterimage |last=Kester |first=Grant H. |year=1998 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, North Carolina |isbn=978-0-8223-2081-4 |page=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-eu5cm9iuewC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "a desire to break down the division between the practicing artist and the historian or critic, resulting in new hybrid figures such as the 'artist/curator' or the 'artist/critic'"&lt;ref name=artc/&gt;

==Contributors==
The journal's list of contributors has included notable artists such as [[Coco Fusco]] and [[Martha Rosler]].

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 82.103a-b Kneeling Female Figure Arugba.jpg|thumbnail|This kneeling figure was probably carved by Maku, the master carver of the town of Erin, or by Toibo, his son. The elongated oval head, set on a slightly curved neck, the stylized ears, and the incised lines across and below the half-closed eyes are characteristic of these carvers.

'''Agere ifa''' (àgéré Ifá) is a container for storing sacred palm nuts for [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] [[divination]].

Given its ritual and aesthetic functions, àgéré Ifá  provides the Yoruba carver with a unique opportunity to display his artistic talents.

Usually carved from wood and measuring between five and sixteen inches in height, a typical container is in the form of an animal or human figure bearing a small bowl. In some cases, the metaphysical attribute of a given animal motif (such as a snake or mudfish) may be used to further empower the sacred palm nuts inside the bowl. But when the motif assumes a human form, it frequently has a votive significance, especially since some àgéré Ifá are given by clients to a diviner to thank [[Orunmila|Òrúnmìlà]] for a blessing or to implore the deity to bestow more favors on the donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drewal|first=Henry John|title=Yoruba : nine centuries of African art and thought|year=1989|publisher=Center for African Art in Association with H.N.

The '''Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming''' is a [[British Army]] training establishment that provides instructions of [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[bagpipe]] music to military pipers, drummers and [[pipe bands]].

==History==

Founded in 1910 as the '''Army School of Piping''' (later renamed the '''Army School of Bagpipe Music'''), the School is located at Inchdrewer House near [[Redford Barracks]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] and is administered by the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]], it is also affiliated with the [[Corps of Army Music]].  Generally regarded as the smallest unit in the British Army, the School is now commanded by a Director who is a qualified army [[Pipe Major]] and who usually holds the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] or [[Major]] (usually being commissioned from [[Warrant Officer]] rank on appointment).  The Director is assisted by a Chief Instructor, who is the Senior Pipe Major of the British Army.

The School provides courses at different levels to pipers and drummers of the [[British Armed Forces]] throughout the year, and qualified instructors are drawn from the [[pipes and drums]] of various units in the [[British Army]].  The School accepts students from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] armed forces, but not civilians.  It has in the past provided instruction to various [[police]] band members, but this has not taken place for a number of years.

The School forms part of the Piping and Drumming Qualifications Board, which is a collaboration among the [[Piobaireachd Society]], the [[Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association]], the [[College of Piping in Glasgow, Scotland|College of Piping]], and the [[Piping Centre]]. Together, the Institute sets a standardised piping certificate programme for students from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdqb.org/|title=The Piping and Drumming Qualifications Board|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bingham Canyon Reclamation Project''', in Utah, was a 1973 [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] [[mine reclamation]] design that artist [[Robert Smithson]] submitted to the mine's management company, [[Kennecott Copper Corporation]]. The design re-imagined [[Bingham Canyon Mine]], the world's largest [[open pit mine]], as a monumental work of [[land art]].

==The mine's beginnings==
Sixty million years ago, a gigantic explosion from within the earth blasted through the area's sedimentary layers to the surface.&lt;ref name=upstairs&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first=Violet|title=Upstairs to a Mine|year=1976|publisher=[[Utah State University Press]]|location=[[Logan, Utah]]|isbn=0-87421-085-2|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incoming flow of lava filled the cracks and fissures in the stone and formed into a plug of molten rock. Beginning in 1848, the resultant metallic veins were mined for [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]],and [[molybdenite]].&lt;ref name="utah encyclopedia"&gt;{{citation |first= Scott |last= Crump |contribution-url= http://www.uen.org/utah_history_encyclopedia/b/BINGHAM_CANYON.html |contribution= Bingham Canyon |editor-last= Powell |editor-first= Allan Kent |year= 1994 |title= Utah History Encyclopedia |location= Salt Lake City, Utah |publisher= [[University of Utah Press]] |isbn= 0874804256 |oclc= 30473917 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investments in the mine by the [[Guggenheim family]] contributed to the early growth of the mine.&lt;ref name=arrington&gt;{{cite book|last=Arrington|first=Leonard|title="The Richest Hole on Earth:" A History of the Bingham Copper Mine|year=1963|publisher=Utah State University Press|location=Logan, Utah|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The town of [[Bingham, Utah]] was eventually swallowed by the expanding man-made chasm, which would come to be known as "The Richest Hole on Earth" and the largest man-made excavation in the world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bingham Copper Mining Pit—Utah / Reclamation Project Robert Smithson(American, Passaic, New Jersey 1938–1973 Amarillo, Texas)|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/190037821?img=0|work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mine was active when Smithson submitted his reclamation design and it remains so today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bingham Canyon, United States of America|url=http://www.mining-technology.com/projects/bingham/|work=mining-technology.com|publisher=Net Resources International|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Clean Air Act Extension of 1970 and push for remediation==
In 1970, cultural changes following the [[civil rights movement]] and federal policies such as the [[Clean Air Act Extension]]  led to a growing [[environmental consciousness]] in the United States and placed pressure on mining companies to devise methods of controlling the toxic by-products of extraction. At the time of Smithson's unsolicited proposal in 1973, Kennecott Copper Corporation was contemplating different remediation projects in anticipation of federally imposed regulations.&lt;ref name=graziani&gt;{{cite book|last=Graziani|first=Ron|title=Robert Smithson and the American Landscape|year=2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521827553|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bingham Canyon, Utah, in 1914.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Bingham, Utah]] in 1914.]]

==Proposal==
The proposal to Kennecott Copper Corporation was one of a portfolio that Smithson submitted to mining companies in the early 1970s. He hoped to capitalize on the mining companies' growing receptiveness to reclamation and remediation projects that dealt with waste land in new, innovative ways. Also, the companies possessed the sort of earth-moving equipment necessary for Smithson's increasingly ambitious land art projects since the late 1960s, such as 1970's [[Spiral Jetty]].

For the proposal, Smithson submitted a design in the form of a [[photostat]] with plastic overlay on which he marked with wax pencil.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;  The mine's massive spiraling cavity was already sympathetic to Smithson's aesthetics and he did not plan to alter it. At the circular bottom of the open pit, the proposal called for four dividing crescent rises. During heavy rains, these would turn into jetties rising from the collected pool of water.&lt;ref name=graziani2&gt;{{cite book|last=Graziani|first=Ron|title=Robert Smithson and the American Landscape|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521827553|pages=155, 156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smithson designed the collected pool of water at the bottom as the most striking color element in the pit because it would be bright yellow due to the toxic runoff, or [[acid rock drainage]] (also known as ''yellow boy''). Smithson further suggested that the circular base of the pit rotate, invoking a 19th-century [[cyclorama]], so that the visiting pilgrim would be able to observe a 360 degree view of the man-made spiraling canyon while standing in one position.

==Response from Kennecott==
Kennecott did not immediately respond to the proposal, and the artist's untimely death on July 20, 1973 effectively brought an end to any potential negotiations between mining corporation and artist.

The project, had it been realized, would have been by far the largest of Smithson's land works.

==The mine today==
The Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine is on the List of [[National Historic Landmarks]]. The mine claims success in ongoing reclamation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mining Reclamation Success&amp;nbsp;– Bingham Canyon Copper Mine|url=http://www.mii.org/Rec/BinghamCanyon/BinghamCanyon.html|publisher=[[Mineral Information Institute]]|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is open to visitors from April to October, weather permitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennecott's Bingham Canyon Mine|url=http://www.utahoutdooractivities.com/kennecott.html|work=Utah Outdoor Activities|publisher=Utah Outdoor Activities|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
'''Bosnia and Herzegovina art''' is art from the region of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and its constituent ethno-religious groups ([[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]]) from [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times to today.

==Ancient heritage==

=== Prehistory===
[[Image:Badanj.jpg|thumb|left|"Horse attacked by arrows", engraving in cave Badanj near [[Stolac]], c. 14000 BC.]]In the boundaries of today’s [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] there have been many layers of prehistory cultures and their creation and disappearance is linked to migrations of unidentified ethnic groups.

[[Paleolithic]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina is marked with the oldest monument of Paleolithic in southeastern Europe - [[engraving]]s in a cave named ''Badanj'' near [[Stolac]] in [[Herzegovina]]. Most famous being the ''Horse attacked by arrows'', preserved in fragments and dated around 14500-12000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Lovrenović 2001. Bosnia: a cultural history. New York. New York University Press. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time when [[Neolithic]] and [[Copper]] cultures were starting to appear, in Bosnia and Herzegovina began interesting mixture of [[Mediterranean]] cultures and those of [[Panonian]] cultures.
Herzegovina was under the influence of impresso ceramics from western Mediterranean as seen in ''Green Cave'' near [[Mostar]], ''Čairi'' near [[Stolac]], ''Lisičići'' near [[Konjic]] and ''Peć Mlini'' near [[Grude]]. People used to live in caves or simple settlements on hilltops.
In the upper mainstream of Bosna river and northeast parts of Bosnia (''Obra I'' near [[Kakanj]]) people used to live in wooden houses built along rivers. In that culture we can see influences from Adriatic cultures on south and ''Starčević culture'' on northeast. Original expressions of that culture are ceramic pots on four legs, so called – [[Rhyton]]. We can find the also in ''Danilo culture'' on the Croatian coast. Thanks to these pieces, Kakanj culture is considered a part of wide circle of Neolithic nations that followed a ''cult of life force'' (from northern [[Italy]], [[Dalmatia]] and [[Epirus]] to [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]).
[[Butmir Culture]] near [[Sarajevo]] is distinctive with fine glazed ceramics with miscellaneous geometrical decorations (often spirals).&lt;ref&gt;W. Radymský / M. Hoernes, Die neolithische Station von Butmir bei Sarajevo in Bosnien. Ausgrabungen im Jahre 1893 (Wien 1895).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z. Kujundzič-Vejzagič / J. Müller / K. Rassmann / T. Schüler, Okolište – Grabung und Geomagnetik eines zentralbosnischen Tells aus der ersten Hälfte des 5. vorchristlichen Jahrtausends. In: B. Hänsel (Hrsg.), Parerga Praehistorica: Jubiläumsschrift zur Prähistorischen Archäologie. 15 Jahre UPA. Universitätsforsch. Prähist. Arch. 100 (Bonn 2004) 69–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from Butmir are unique sculptures modeled with hand; heads are almost like portraits with emphasized parts of body.

[[Image:Daorson.jpg|thumb|260 px|right|Monumental city walls of [[Daorson]] near Stolac, 4th century BC.]][[Bronze Age]] settlements in Herzegovina were built like [[citadel]]s (natively called - ''gradina''), and in Bosnia we have necropolises with stone [[tumuli]]. During that time, bronze arms, decorated plates, flat necklaces and fibulas were decorated with specific geometrical style of engraved ornaments.
From 7th century BC bronze is replaced by iron, and only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Bronze culture of [[Illyrians]], ethnic group with distinct culture and art form started to organize itself on today’s Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Different Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Halstat]] cultures from north, formed original regional centers. With the notable exception of [[Pod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pod]] near [[Bugojno]] in the upper valley of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas River]], nothing is known of their settlements. In eastern Bosnia in the cemeteries of ''Belotić'' and ''Bela Crkva'', the rites of inhumation and [[cremation]] are attested, with skeletons in stone [[cists]] and cremations in [[urns]]. Metal implements appear here side-by-side with stone implements. Most of the remains belong to the fully developed Middle Bronze Age.
Very important role in their life was ''the cult of the dead'', which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as richness of the burial sites. In northern parts there was long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone, or earth tumuli (natively called – ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50&amp;nbsp;m wide and 5&amp;nbsp;m high.
''Japodian'' tribes (found around [[Bihać]]) have had affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil.

In 4th century BC first outbreak of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the pottery wheel, new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to Greece, so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible.

===Antiquity===

[[Image:Drinovci-starokršćanska krstionica.jpg|thumb|right|Stone baptistery from ''Drinovci'' near [[Grude]], 4th century.]]
In the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south there was important [[Hellenistic]] influence of Illyrian tribe [[Daors]]. Their capital was [[Daorson]] in ''Ošanići'' near [[Stolac]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stolac.org/4images/categories.php?cat_id=10 Images of antiquities from Daorson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207182903/http://www.stolac.org/4images/categories.php?cat_id=10 |date=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to date, main center of Ancient culture in B&amp;H. Daorson in 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} stonewalls (large as those of [[Mycenae]] in [[Greece]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piramidasunca.ba/en/index.php/DAORSON-CITY-FALSE-INTERPRETATIONS-UP-TO-THE-PRESENT.html Daorson City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004112814/http://www.piramidasunca.ba/en/index.php/DAORSON-CITY-FALSE-INTERPRETATIONS-UP-TO-THE-PRESENT.html |date=October 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; composed out of large trapeze stones blocks. Daors have made their unique bronze coins and sculptures.
Finally, [[Roman Empire|Romans]] subdued the Illyrians in first century BC, and after that the history of these parts is history of [[Illyria]]n provinces of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]].

In Bosnia and Herzegovina Romans built several small [[temples]] decorated with [[reliefs]]. The complex of ''step sanctuary in Gradac'' near [[Posušje]] from year 184 AD had [[marble]] temple dedicated to recently deceased emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]].
On the reliefs we can feel [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] of native craftsmen, and in [[mosaics]] the Hellenistic influence, especially in those found in [[villa]]s near [[Stolac]] (second half of the 3rd century).
Late Roman art in B&amp;H is marked with building of villas, Christian [[mausoleum]]s, [[basilicas]] and [[oratories]] like: ''Mausoleum in Šipovo'' near [[Jajce]] and ''Villa [[Mogorjelo]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/mogorjelo Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Čapljina]] (early 4th century).
Sculptures that we inherited are ones like: ''Hellenistic relief of Minerva, Jupiter and genius-protector from Šipovo'' (2nd century) and extremely barbarically stylized relief of ''four friends from [[Zenica]]'' (end of the 4th century).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zemaljskimuzej.ba/arheologija/antika.php Ancient monuments - National archeological museum in Sarajevo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506005533/http://www.zemaljskimuzej.ba/arheologija/antika.php |date=May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval art in Bosnia and Herzegovina==
[[Image:Stecak iz Radimlje.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Stećak]] from Radimlja, 13th century.]]
[[Image:Hrvojev misal.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Illumination from [[Hrvoje's Missal]], Split, 1404.]]
In Bosnia and Herzegovina the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] influence came from [[Croatia]] and it was never accepted in full, only in use of some elements. Those few monuments with Romanesque elements that were preserved are dating from later times. For example: in the motifs from tombstones in Bosnia – natively called [[stećak]] (14th century), or the high parts of ''Tower of [[St. Luke]]'' in [[Jajce]] (15th century).

Influences of [[Gothic art]] in the 14th century are supported by culture of urban cities, [[preaching]] orders, and [[knight]]ly culture. On Bosnian culture there was slight influence of religion and the strong one of Nobility. That is recognizable in the organization of a city that is actually a settlement close to [[feudal]] [[fortress]]. Feudal fortress is of thick roughly cut stonewalls, shape is following the terrain, buildings have steppe roofs and towers are often and high. The most beautiful one is perhaps ''Royal Court in [[Kraljeva Sutjeska]]''; it has [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] and windows, [[buttresses]], and high rooftops (very practical because of snow).

The way some Bosnian nobility treated its dead is somewhat special. From the earliest times of [[Bosnian Kingdom]] the nobility was buried in large necropolises near the roads with graves marked by a monumental tombstone called stećak. [[Stećak]] (or ''mramor'' or ''bilig'') comes in several different shapes and was sometimes engraved with [[reliefs]] showing all sorts of motifs, from figurative to symbols, and sometimes writings in [[Bosnian Cyrillic]]. Their existence is strongly linked with heretical [[Bosnian Church]] and most of the motifs are derived from their beliefs, but some derived from Romanesque (crosses, arcades with semi-circular arches, son, half-moon etc.) and Gothic (arcades with sharp arches, knight riders, shields, swords, lilies etc.) art of the West.

There are two beautiful examples of [[illuminated manuscript]]s from medieval Bosnia. ''Hval’s missionary'', kept in Zagreb, is ravishingly decorated manuscript with many miniatures. ''Misal Hrvoja Vukčića Hrvatinića'' - a [[liturgical book]] of the Bosnian duke and ruler of Dalmatia - [[Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić]], today in [[Istanbul]], is colourfully painted with many details of knightly culture (knights, crests etc.). Both were painted in [[Split (city)|Split]], Croatia.

==Ottoman art in Bosnia and Herzegovina==
[[Image:Svrzo house.jpg|thumb|right|''Svrzo house'' in [[Sarajevo]], the typical Bosnian house from Ottoman period.]]

In the 16th century, entire Bosnia was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule so the influences of renaissance and later baroque from west were extinguished. The only places where some western art could be fined were lonesome [[Franciscan]] monasteries in [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], [[Kreševo]], [[Franciscan monastery in Fojnica]], [[Franciscan monastery in Kraljeva Sutjeska]] etc.

However, that opened a new era in B&amp;H art, that of [[Islamic Art]] and it flourished until the 19th century. Actually there were three constant art traditions in B&amp;H living side by side: Catholic-Western one, Orthodox-Byzantine (unique illuminated manuscripts and painted icons) and one and Ottoman-Islamic that was the most powerful one.

Ottomans were developing urban cities very fast upon their conquest of B&amp;H. Enriched by [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] experiences they build so much that it can be compared only with medieval building in Dalmatian cities. For example, in [[Foča]] in 16th century Ottomans build 17 [[mosque]]s, 29 public [[fountain]]s, 6 [[public bathing|public baths]] (''hamam'') and 13 caravanserai motels (han).
[[Sarajevo]] is an example of a non-urban open city where the most important buildings are organized around one veining street – ''čaršija'' (Persian chahar-su meaning all four sides). In Sarajevo the largest is famous [[Baščaršija]] with shops of 50 different crafts from the 15th century. Also in Baščaršija is most impressive ''Gazi Husrev-beg’s mosque'', also known as ''Beg’s mosque'', built in 1531. Founded on Byzantine central square plan it has dome on large drum, two smaller domes leaning on both sides of drum and a semi-dome behind; in addition, above entrance is a porch with five tiny domes. Inside it is filled with rich wall ornaments in wood and Arabic [[calligraphic]] writings. The complex is complete with a high tower (''munara'') and fountain (''šedrvan'') in the courtyard.

Islamic [[manuscript]]s, decorated in the [[Persian people|Persian]] style with beautiful [[Islamic calligraphy]], were often in B&amp;H so now we have numerous examples in the Bosnian libraries.
In the 16th century the [[Jews]] expelled from Spain came to Sarajevo, where they were allowed to settle. Beside important influence on Bosnian culture, they brought with them luxury decorated manuscript called [[Sarajevo Haggadah]] from the 14th century, now in the Sarajevo museum.

The bridge in Islamic art was very important, not only because it request great skill of an architect, but also because of symbolic meaning of a bridge in [[Islam]] where it is a mediator between heaven and earth. That’s why there is no surprise that the high point of [[Islamic architecture]] in B&amp;H is a bridge. Bridge of artisan ''Hajredin'' (pupil of the famous architect [[Mimar Sinan]] from [[Istanbul]]) in [[Mostar]] (so called: [[Stari Most|Old Bridge]]) with its arch over river Neretva is 29&amp;nbsp;m long and 19.5&amp;nbsp;m high. With subtle parabola it looks higher and more fragile than it is, an effect seen only in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]].

In Bosnian Islamic architecture, stone is reserved for religious, public buildings and fortifications, while private houses were built out of wood and ''ćerpić'' (native simple bonding material made of clay and straw). With often consol constructions of the upper floors they could be more open with large windows.
When the power of Ottomans started to descend in the middle of the 17th century, so did the influence of Islamic art in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==Art in Austro-Hungarian Period==
[[Image:Sarajevo Rathaus05.jpg|thumb|left|National Library in Sarajevo]]
[[Image:Sarajevo Academy of arts 02.jpg|thumb|right|The Sarajevo Academy of Arts, on the bank of the [[Miljacka]]]]
Right after the [[Austro-Hungarian]] occupation the art scene in Bosnia comes alive. Intense building is represented in modernisation and structural transformation of cities. Architecture is in [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] [[pseudo]] styles like [[classicism]], [[neo-renaissance]], [[neo-baroque]], and even [[neo-Romanesque]], and [[neo-gothic]]. Unique pseudo style is ''“oriental eclectic”'' style (also "[[Pseudo-Moorish style]]") based on [[Islamic architecture#Moorish architecture|Moorish architecture]] of southern [[Spain]] and [[Egypt]]. That style, was quite foreign to urban ambient of Bosnian cities as can be seen in [[Sarajevo]] (National Library and City Hall), [[Mostar Gymnasium]] and [[Travnik]] (Retirement Home).

The first Bosnian artists were educated in large European academies ([[Vienna]], [[München]], [[Prague|Prag]], [[Krakow]], [[Budapest]] and [[Paris]]) thanks to scholarships of cultural societies like “[[Prosvjeta]]” and “[[HKD Napredak|Napredak]]”. All those artists like [[Atanasije Popović]], [[Lazar Draljča|Lazar Drljača]], [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], [[Branko Radulović]], [[Petar Šain]] etc., are marked with [[academism]] with slight touches of [[impressionism]], [[art nouveau]], and [[pointillism]]. After the Great Exhibition of Bosnian Artists in 1917, the native born artists have prevailed. Modern styles that entered B&amp;H were [[expressionism]] and [[Cézanne]]s-ism.

==Art in the Yugoslavian Kingdom==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MIJIC Mountain landscape.jpg|thumb|right|260 px|"Mountain landscape" by Karlo Mijić, 1924.]] --&gt;After the end of [[World War I]], the society of artists from [[Kingdom of SHS|SHS]] (state of Serbians, Croats and Slovenians) was organized and they held numerous exhibitions and artistic gatherings like ''the Blažuj colony'' of [[Vladimir Becić]]. Participants of that colony were [[Roman Petrović]] and [[Jovan Bijelić]] that derived their art to abstract form (c. 1920), while [[Karlo Mijić]] is devoted to colouristic landscapes. Karlo Mijić, with art nouveau and impressionistic influences was probably the best painter of 20s and 30s in the entire [[Yugoslavia]].

Sadly, the art production in B&amp;H was reduced to crumbs by the Yugoslavian government, so lots of artist never returned to B&amp;H from their studies in [[Zagreb]] and [[Beograd]], while many were also leaving the country.
First renewal happened with the ''“Group of Four”'' and ''“engaged art”'' of Roman Petrović and his cycle called ''“The children of the Street”.''
Mijić and ''Đoko Mazalić'' founded the art association called ''“Krug”'' (The Circle) with strong urban aesthetics of nature.
[[Vojo Dimitrijević]] painted ''“Spain in ‘37”''; a representative artwork of colouristic expression with traces of Picasso and Chagall.

In thirties the architects were influenced by ideas of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]], humane architecture and [[Bauhaus]]. Those buildings were uniting a function, content and form, without unnecessary plastic decoration, and with simple rhythm of windows and modern constructions (former ''Social Security Building'' in Mostar by [[Drago Ibler]], 1935.).

==Art in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia==

Right after [[World War II]], and founding the new country of all south Slavs [[Communist Yugoslavia]], the artist have found new expression through themes of [[Revolution]] and War. Ismet Mujezinović draws numerous expressionistic figures in his cycle ''“The [[Battle of Sutjeska]]”'', and Branko Šotra made powerful almost abstract engravings.
Architecture was also under the direct influence of Socialistic architecture, but never reached the monumentality of the original works.

In the fifties, careful and slow, the transformation of art through economy and decoration toward abstraction happened.  The first was sculptor ''Mirko Ostoja'' who replaced classical modeling with iron welding. Even the Communist State changed its feeling toward modern art by commissioning large abstract monuments dedicated to famous battles in The War ([[Battle of Sutjeska|Sutjeska]], [[Kozara]], Makljen etc.).
Young architects, gathered around professor ''Juraj Neidhardt'', were trying to achieve connections of modern architecture and B&amp;H tradition and surroundings. Those were buildings like The Mostar Mall - ''“Razvitak”'' in 1970 by ''A. Paljaga'' or ''[[Jajce]] Mall'' in 1976 by ''R. Jadrić, Dž. Karić and N. Kurto''.

In the sixties many architects were leaving traditional boundaries and made important buildings in manner of functionalism: The telecommunication building in [[Addis Abeba]] by Ivan Štraus and Zdravko Kovacević, or ''“[[Skenderija]]” Hall'' in Sarajevo by Živorad Janković and Halid Muhasilović&lt;ref&gt;http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/4/4.175/OldFiles/www/center_home_sarajevo_contemporary.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventies, the rewarded architectural plans were ''[[Zenica]] Theatre'' in 1977 by ''Jahiel Finci'' and ''Zlatko Ugljen'', ''Hotel Rose'' in Mostar (1979, by Zlatko Ugljen) and ''[[Arena Gripe|Gripe Hall]]'' in [[Split (city)|Split]] (1980, by Živorad Janković and S. Rozić).

An art expression inspired by old Bosnian culture and tradition appeared in the [[graphic]] work of Dževad Hozo and in paintings of ''Mehmed Zaimović, Seid Hasanefendić and [[Mersad Berber]]''. Quite opposite to that, the urban expression of ''Ismar Mujezinović'' is more related to modern film montage and [[photo]]-[[optics]], while [[Braco Dimitrijević]] is a [[Conceptual art]]ist who works mainly outside B&amp;H.

An example of architecture in the eighties is ''[[Holiday Inn]] Hotel'' built in 1983 and the ''“Unis” Twin Towers'' built in [[Sarajevo]] in 1986 and designed by [[Ivan Štraus]]. Among the people of the city, the twin towers are commonly called Momo (Serbian name) and Uzeir (Bosniak name).

==Art after the Bosnian War==

Cultural preservation is under way in Bosnia and Herzegovina which can be seen with the most recent reconstruction of Stari most in Mostar and many other structures of cultural and historical significance which were damaged or destroyed in the recent war. Many other projects, unfortunately, are still stifled by political disputes and lack of funds.

Commercial construction in the years following the Bosnian War has seen a boom in Sarajevo. Sarajevo is one of the cities with the most construction in southeastern Europe. ''The Unis Twin Towers'' have been renovated completely. On the site of the former ''Oslobodjenje Towers'', ''the Avaz towers'' have now been constructed. In the ''Hrasno'' residential area, the Bosnian Company Bosmal has constructed the [[Bosmal City Center]], which includes the tallest set of twin towers in the Balkans at 120 meters each.

The [[Avaz Twist Tower]] located in Marijin Dvor, Sarajevo is the tallest tower in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the new headquarters for Avaz, the most popular Bosnia and Herzegovina newspaper company.

Earlier, these paintings were prevalent across Andhra, as also various other parts of the country, albeit flavoured with their distinct styles and other local peculiarities dictated by the local customs and traditions. In the same way, [[Cheriyal]] scrolls must have been popular across [[Telangana]] in earlier times, though with the advent of television, cinemas and computers it has been fenced into its last outpost, the [[Cheriyal]] town.

[[File:Cherial 1.jpg|thumbnail|A contemporary Cheriyal Scroll painting]]

==History==
Scroll paintings have a rich history and play an important role in the Asian artistic tradition. In China, scroll paintings were part of the sophisticated traditions of the nobility and the courts. In India however, the scroll painting was the prerogative of the itinerant bard and the village artist, in essence a folk tradition of the villages.

In India, each region and village developed its own scroll painting traditions, marked by characteristic content, form and technique depending on the local ethos, patronage and socio-economic conditions. Rajasthan is known for its ''Pabuji ki Pad'', ''Devenarayana katha'' as also stories from the legend of ''Dhola and Maru''. Goa evolved the ''Dasavathara'', as Maharashtra did ''Pinguli'' and the ''Chitra Katha'' traditions. Maharashtra and Gujarat are also known for a sophisticated scroll painting tradition called the ''Prasasti Patra''. Orissa and Bengal are famous for their ''Patachitra'' traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Scroll Paintings of Bengal: Art in the Village By Amitabh Sengupta published by AuthorHouse&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above-mentioned traditions could have significantly influenced the Cheriyal scroll paintings and artists, the [[Cheriyal]] paintings were and continue to be a distinctly local invention, peculiar to the [[Telangana]] region, drawing mainly on local traditions. It can safely be said that the local temple art traditions and the [[Kalamkari]] tradition across [[Telangana]] in particular, and the graphic art traditions of the Deccan and South India in general were the major influences that shaped and guided the art of scroll paintings. However, it should also be remembered that the sphere of activity, subject and artistic idiom of every scroll painting including that of Cheriyal is peculiar and confined to the village or habitment.

To quote from A. L. Dallaiccola's South Indian Paintings- A catalogue of the British Museum collection - ''Although in the past the majority of Indian people might have been illiterate, they were not uneducated. They were taught the principles ruling their religious and social life through the recitation of stories drawn from the epics, the puranas and other religious texts... In the past, the retelling of these stories provided the education of the unlettered, and the discourses were accompanied by visual aids: scrolls, painted cloth hangings, sets of paintings, and wooden boxes with folding, concertina-like doors painted with scenes from the 'career' of a deity, such as the portable shrine from [[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] that is now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]... The earliest known reference to the picture showmen is found in [[Patanjali]]'s ''Mahabhashya'' (2nd century BC). Commenting on the passage on the historic present in [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma|Panini]]'s grammar, the ''Ashtadhyayi'' (c. 5th century BC), [[Patanjali]] takes as an example some picture showmen who are discussing the killing of Kamsa at the hands of Krishna... There is also a specific mention of a picture showing Kamsa being dragged by the hair and beaten by Krishna. Numerous references to picture showmen and painted scrolls occur in literary sources. The scrolls showing the torments of hell, ''yamapattaka'', seem to have been particularly popular.''&lt;ref name="MuseumDallapiccola2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&amp;pg=PA78|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandhets were the itinerant bards and performers of Andhra Pradesh while the Nakashis were the artists. The Nakashis of [[Telangana]] also made dolls, much like the [[Kinnal]] dolls of Karnataka, in addition to the painted scrolls. These scrolls were a very important part of the sociological and cultural setting of [[Telangana]]. As these paintings are now confined to [[Cheriyal]] village, they are called [[Cheriyal]] scrolls. In earlier times, the scrolls were a colourful backdrop to the equally interesting oral traditions of the common people, - the village hajjam-barber, toddy tapper, dhobhi-washerman, chamar-leatherworker, fisherman, weaver and farmer: (''Madiga, Goud, Mudiraju, Malas, Padmashali, Chakala and Mangali''&lt;ref&gt;Folk Painting Traditions of India by Sarita Chauhan Booklet series - 52 published by Institute for Social Democracy http://www.isd.net.in/Publication/Booklet/2012/Booklet_52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) the seven working and marginalised castes and communities of the village. The scrolls set out the adventures and exploits of local folk heroes who performed on the fringes of the epics, Puranas, etc. of the Hindu 'Greater Tradition'. Each community had its peculiarities and its favourite heroes and heroines as also selection of stories from local Mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://jigyasa0.tripod.com/folk.html Jagdish and Kamla Mittal Museum of Indian Art&lt;/ref&gt; It was also customary to sacrifice a goat after the recitation of the story from the scroll in some communities.

==Present times==
At present, Cheriyal painting work is continuing  by
the families of D. Vaikuntam, D.Nageshar, D.Venkataramana,
D.Pavan Kumar.
Dhanalokota Vaikuntam started learning work
from his father Venkataramiah and elder brother Chandraiah at
the age of 12. He studied intermediate and at present he is
living at Hyderabad. He got married with vanaja at the age of
20. After the marriage with Vaikuntam, vanaja also started
doing Cherial painting. He trained to his children Sarika,
Rakesh and Vinay Kumar. He received many awards and
certificates for his excellency in Cherial painting.

Today the long stories from the local mythologies have been cut short, as the traditional patrons for the long scrolls no longer exist. The artists have been forced to adapt and nowadays they paint smaller versions of the scrolls, depicting a single episode or character from the traditional stories. These are amenable to framing and can be hung on walls in modern homes. Further, the colours are no longer prepared in the traditional manner. While earlier, they used natural white extracted from sea shells, black from lampsoot and yellow from turmeric. However, the traditional art continues to linger and survive and even has been a source of inspiration to contemporary artists like Laxman Aelay&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/2013-10-06/Painting-a-new--narrative-73269&lt;/ref&gt; of Kadirengudam village of Andhra Pradesh.

==The Tradition==
[[File:Cherial 5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]
The traditional art form became an inseparable part of the profession of the story-telling, balladeer community known as ''Kaki Padagollu''. They displayed the scrolls and accompanied by music and dance went from village to village narrating and singing their ballads based from their rich folklore which was rooted in the [[Puranas]] and Indian Epics, enlivening many a lazy village evening.

In a typical recitation, the storyteller-balladeer would  wander from village to village in a team of usually five people, with two to narrate the story while the others would provide a simple but hectic musical accompaniment with the harmonium, tabala and castanets. The stage would also be a simple affair (many times even to the extent of being a rough and ready fixture), erected on four poles with a horizontal bar on which the scrolls could be displayed.
 
[[File:Cheriyal painting - toddy tappers.jpg|thumb|A traditional Cheriyal scroll painting depicting the legends of the toddy tapper community. Circa 18th - 19th century.]]

The scroll would flow like a film roll. It was generally about 
three feet in width and went up to 40 – 45 feet in length, depending upon the story. The traditional scrolls are normally in vertical format, illustrating stories in a series of horizontal panels. A floral border in the middle separates the two panels, while the linear narrative is demonstrated by holding in both hands or suspending it from a tree or a building and continually rolling it. Like large sized comic strips, each panel of the scroll depicted one part of the story. Hence, a scroll would easily have around 50 panels. As the bard would narrate the story, the panel depicting that particular part of the story would be displayed. The choice of episodes and iconography of each deity was painted, keeping in mind the caste for which the scroll was made.

[[File:Cherial 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|A modern Cheriyal painting in making]]

By virtue of its distinct traditional style and characteristics [[Cheriyal]] Paintings were recently given a Geographical Indications (GI) tag. There are very few artists remaining who continue to paint using this unique technique. A recent innovation has been the painting of single pictures (as opposed to a continuous scroll) meant for wall decorations.

== Process ==
The making of the canvas is a very elaborate procedure. The [[Khadi]] cotton is treated with a mixture of starch (from rice), suddha matti (white mud), a paste of boiled tamarind seeds and gum water thrice. It has to be ensured that every coating is thoroughly dried before the next one is applied.
Once the canvas is ready, the artists sketch the outline directly onto the canvas using a brush. The outlines are very well defined and sharply reflecting the quality and experience of the craftsman.
The colors are made by the artists from natural sources. Brushes are made with hair of squirrels tied to a stick.
Dolls and masks are made of wood, saw dust and tamarind paste. Masks are made even with coconut shells.

[[File:Cherial 4.jpg|thumbnail|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]

== Characteristics ==
Cheriyal Paintings can be easily recognised by the following peculiarities and unique characteristics:

• Painted in vivid hues, mostly primary colors, with a predominance of red in the background, the paintings are characterised by the unbridled imagination of the local artisans who were not constrained by the academic rigour that characterised the more classical [[Tanjore painting]] and [[Mysore painting]]. For example, the artist hardly bothers about perspective in Cheriyal paintings and sets out the narrative by placing the relevant figures in appropriate order and position in the relevant background. The iconography of even the major deities like Shiva, Vishnu, etc. has a strong local idiom.

•The subjects of these scroll paintings are easy to relate to – as the themes and stories are familiar – drawn from ancient literary, mythological and folk traditions. The common themes are from the Krishna Leela, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Shiva Puranam, Markandeya Puranam interspersed with the ballads and folk-stories of communities like Gauda, Madiga and so on.

• The main narrative is spiced up with scenes from simple rural life - Women doing chores in the kitchen, men working in the paddy fields or boozing away in merry abandon, festival scenes, etc. are endearingly depicted.

• The costumes and settings in which the figures are depicted are typical and  reflect the culture of Andhra, where these paintings originated.

• Within the narrow panels, proportion is created by depicting trees, or a building, a pillar with drawn curtains, etc. However more often than not, the proportion of individual characters is determined by their relative importance in that particular scene, with the most important character being the largest and most detailed and the lesser characters being smaller and less detailed.

==GI rights==
Cheriyal scroll painting received  Intellectual Property Rights Protection or [[Geographical Indication]] (GI) status in 2007.

'''The coat of arms of [[Bolivia]]''' has a central [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] surrounded by [[Flag of Bolivia|Bolivian flags]], [[musket]]s, laurel branches, and has an [[Andean condor]] on top.

==Description==
[[File:224.Escudo Bolivia en Tupiza (21).JPG|thumb|250px|Coat of arms of Bolivia in a police station in the city of [[Tupiza]].]]
The central cartouche has a border with ten stars in the bottom, which symbolize the nine ''Departamentos'' and the former province [[Litoral Department|Litoral]] that was taken over by Chile in 1879, and the name of Bolivia in the top section.  Within the border [[Cerro Rico|Potosí mountain]] — recognized by a mine entrance — is depicted,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/samerica/bolivia/bosymbols.htm&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Inti]] in form of a sun rising above it, and with an [[alpaca]] standing next to a palm tree and some wheat. The alpaca stands on a plain that contrasts with the mountain. The mountain and its contrast with the plains are indicative of the [[geography of Bolivia]]. The llama is the national animal, related to the alpaca and the items next to it are symbolic of the resources of the nation.

Around the shield there are three Bolivian flags on each side. Behind these are two pairs of crossed [[rifles]] that symbolize the struggle for independence. Next to the muskets there are an axe and a red [[Phrygian cap|Phrygian]] hood, which is the  symbol of liberty and freedom. The laurel branches are symbolic of peace, and the condor perched upon the shield is symbolic of a willingness to defend the nation and its liberty.

In some depictions of these coat of arms, the two pairs of muskets are replaced by two cannons.  Other depictions also have more realistic symbols in the shield.

In the [[visual art]]s, '''creative peacebuilding''' offers a creative means to bring about peace within conflicted contexts. The use of the visual arts for effective [[peacebuilding]] emphasizes a consideration of the nature of the context where the tool is applied by not necessarily following a set format or paradigm. It reflects the potential to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, and interpretations geared towards establishing and sustaining peace.

Generally speaking, ''[[the arts]]'' refers to the theory and the physical expressions of creativity found in human societies and cultures. The major constituents of the arts include [[literature]] (poetry, novels, short stories, and epic poetry), [[performing arts]] (music, dance, and theatre), and the [[visual arts]], the last of which includes creations that can be seen. According to the [[Merriam-Webster dictionary]], the term "creative" describes a quality of something created rather than imitated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/creative|title=Definition of Creative|website=Merriam-Webster|language=en|access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this, [[creative peacebuilding]] is a broad term for creative therapeutic strategies to create peace, within individuals, groups, and societies in conflict situations. Although used primarily to overcome violence, creative peacebuilding is also a preventative measure explored to establish stronger foundations of peaceful initiatives, especially when used with children.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |date=12 August 2013 |title=Selected Definitions of Peacebuilding |url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/08/selected-definitions-of-peacebuilding/ |location=Washington |publisher=Alliance for Peacebuilding |access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions of peacebuilding ==
[[Peacebuilding]] is a process that facilitates the establishment of sustainable peace by preventing the recurrence of violence through different approaches which address the root causes and effects of conflict. Peacebuilding is an alternative to violence through reconciliation, and economic and social transformation.

The term ''peacebuilding'' has been widely used since 1992,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} when it was used by the former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] in his ''[[An Agenda for Peace]]''. Boutros-Ghali described peacebuilding as "action to identify and support structures, which will tend to strengthen and solidify peace in order to avoid a relapse into conflict."{{sfn|Boutros-Ghali|1992|p=6}}

According to [[Johan Galtung]], peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that "remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For [[John Paul Lederach]], peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.{{sfn|Lederach|2005}}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}

== Peacebuilding through the visual arts ==
If [[visual arts]] are artistic expressions that can be seen in their diversity rather than heard, then the relationship between visual arts and creative peacebuilding is reflected in the felt experience of [[creative peacebuilding]] in conflict situations. Visual arts are created to stimulate visual experiences. They are employed to help individuals cope with their feelings and treat [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Creative peacebuilding through the visual arts is a process that facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. [[Jolyon Mitchell]] argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.{{sfn|Mitchell|2012}}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Photography ===
[[Photography]] is the science and art of creating durable images with light or other electromagnetic radiation, either through the use of an image sensor or chemical means of a light-sensitive. Susan Sontag opines that a photographer has the ability to create a reality by examining pictures.{{sfn|Sontag|2001}}{{page needed|date=November 2017}} Photography is one of the forms of [[new media]] that changes perceptions and changes the structure of society. The objectivity and subjectivity of a photograph is sometimes problematic. Sontag argues, "To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting one's self into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge, and therefore like power."{{sfn|Sontag|2001}}{{page needed|date=November 2017}} Photographers decide what to photograph, what elements to exclude, and what angle to frame the photo, and these factors may reflect a particular socio-historical context.

Along these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation. The visual quality of photographic images is particularly effective in grabbing, maintaining, and retaining viewers' attention. It is commonly stated that [[a picture is worth a thousand words]]. In the context of creative peacebuilding, the visual qualities of photographic images provide specific benefits. The power of an image to establish an objective work is the sole judge of the message the viewer's read. Subjective truth makes it an effective tool for peacebuilding. Images span generations, languages, and cultural differences. Different people can easily engage with the characters or situations presented to them, regardless of their background. Pictures are both cognitively and emotionally compelling – a process that is essential to peacebuilding mechanism. The power of image is also condition by its design and purpose. Furthermore, photographic contents and images are employed to negotiate issues of the past in creative ways highlighting the incidents, experiences, emotions, and themes thus fostering alternative imagination of the future that will help to sustain peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bidey |first=Tim |date=31 December 2014 |title=Picturing Peace: Using Photography in Conflict Transformation |url=https://www.peaceinsight.org/blog/2014/12/photography-conflict-transformation-balkans/ |website=Peace Insight |publisher=Peace Direct |access-date=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography promotes freedom of participation, access, and engagement, which is within the control of the viewer, and also opens up process for peacebuilding. At their discretion and their pace, the viewer engages and reflects on their experiences, while seeing and dwelling in the experience of others. Such an experience often creates the need to revisit the picture.

=== Websites ===
Jolyon Mitchell has written about how [[websites]] have been used as a medium for promoting peace on the screen. Through the web, the world has become a [[global village]]. Therefore, websites can be created to facilitate peacebuilding. It offers a virtual location whereby individuals can login, get information, take action, and post and share issues to aid in peacebuilding.{{sfn|Mitchell|2012|pp=189–215}}

[[File:Der_junge_Richard_Strauss.JPG|thumb|Richard Strauss in 1888]]
'''''Death and Transfiguration''''' ('''''{{Lang|de|Tod und Verklärung}}'''''), [[Opus number|Op.]] 24, is a [[tone poem]] for large orchestra by [[Richard Strauss]]. Strauss began composition in the late summer of 1888 and completed the work on 18 November 1889. The work is dedicated to the composer's friend Friedrich Rosch.

The music depicts the death of an artist. At Strauss's request, this was described in a poem by the composer's friend [[Alexander Ritter]] as an interpretation of Death and Transfiguration, after it was composed.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliam, ''Grove''&lt;/ref&gt; As the man lies dying, thoughts of his life pass through his head: his childhood innocence, the struggles of his manhood, the attainment of his worldly goals; and at the end, he receives the longed-for transfiguration "from the infinite reaches of heaven".

==Performance history==
Strauss conducted the premiere on 21 June 1890 at the [[Eisenach]] Festival (on the same program with the premiere of his ''[[Burleske|Burleske in D minor]]'' for piano and orchestra). He also conducted this work for his first appearance in England, at the Wagner Concert with the Philharmonic Society on 15 June 1897 at the [[Queen's Hall]] in London.

==Critical reaction==
English music critic [[Ernest Newman]] described this as music to which one would not want to die or awaken. "It is too spectacular, too brilliantly lit, too full of pageantry of a crowd; whereas this is a journey one must make very quietly, and alone".

French critic [[Romain Rolland]] in his ''Musiciens d'aujourd'hui'' (1908) called the piece "one of the most moving works of Strauss, and that which is constructed with the noblest utility".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Mason, Daniel Gregory (1918), ''Contemporary Composers'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
There are four parts (with Ritter's poetic thoughts condensed):

{{ordered list|type=upper-roman
| Largo (The sick man, near death)
| Allegro molto agitato (The battle between life and death offers no respite to the man)
| Meno mosso (The dying man's life passes before him)
| Moderato (The sought-after transfiguration)
}}
A typical performance lasts about 25 minutes.

&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c { \clef bass \key ees \major \time 4/4 r4^"Transfiguration theme" f,-. bes( c | d d' c2) } &lt;/score&gt;

== Instrumentation ==
The work is scored for a large orchestra: 3 [[western concert flute|flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B-flat]], [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horn]]s in F, 3 [[trumpet]]s in F and C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[tam-tam]], and [[string section|strings]]: 2 [[harp]]s, [[violin]]s i, ii, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, [[double bass]]es.

==Quoted==
In one of Strauss's last compositions, "Im Abendrot" from the ''[[Four Last Songs]]'', Strauss poignantly quotes the "transfiguration theme" from his tone poem of 60 years earlier, during and after the soprano's final line, "Ist dies etwa der Tod?" (Is this perhaps death?).
&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; { \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt; \new Staff \relative c { \clef bass \key ees \major \time 4/4 \partial 2*1 s2 | r4 a( d2~ | d4 e fis fis') | s1 | s1 | s1 | s1 } \new Staff \relative c' { \clef treble \key ees \major \time 4/4 fis2 | fis r | r a | a r | r bes | ces1~ | ces2 } \addlyrics { ist dies et- wa der Tod? } &gt;&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;
Just before his own death, he remarked that his music was absolutely correct; his feelings mirrored those of the artist depicted within; Strauss said to his daughter-in-law as he lay on his deathbed in 1949: "It's a funny thing, Alice, dying is just the way I composed it in ''Tod und Verklärung''."&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Puffett's comments on DG disc 447 762-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cinematography]], the '''dolly grip''' is a dedicated technician trained to operate the [[camera dolly]]. This technician places, levels, and moves the dolly track, then pushes and pulls the dolly and usually a [[camera operator]] and [[camera assistant]] as riders. If the dolly has a moveable vertical axis, such as a hydraulic arm, then the dolly grip also operates the "boom". If both axes are used simultaneously, this type of [[tracking shot|dolly shot]] is known as a compound move.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmproductionroles11med23.wikispaces.com/Grip filmproductionroles.com Grip]&lt;/ref&gt;

A dolly grip must work closely with the camera crew to perfect these complex movements ([[cinematic techniques]]) during rehearsals. Focusing the lens is critical to capturing a sharp image, so a dolly grip must hit his or her marks in concert with a camera assistant who pulls focus. It is a skill that experience can hone to a point, but the best dolly grips are known for their "touch," and that makes them highly sought-after.

A dolly grip is also employed when the camera is operated in handheld mode (on the operator's shoulders or literally in their hands). While the camera operator is moving with the camera, the dolly grip is responsible for the operator's safety, helping the operator to "blindly" negotiate sometimes complicated environments. The dolly grip silently directs the operator (through gentle touches, nudges, pulls and pushes) away from walls and other obstacles that the operator cannot see while concentrating on the image in the camera viewfinder. The same is true when the camera is operated with a [[Steadicam]] or similar body-mounted stabilization tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dollygrippery.net/ dollygrippery.net Dollygrippery, The definitive site on camera movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although dolly grips are hired by and under a [[key grip]], they are paid the same as (or more than) a [[best boy|best boy grip]], who is the second-in-command.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dollygrippery.net/2010/01/dolly-grip-job-description.html dollygrippery.net Dollygrippery, Dolly Grip Job Description, January 03, 2010 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly grips may also push a wheeled platform holding the microphone and boom operator.

Crane operators in the film industry are specially trained film crew. They are normally [[Grip (job)|grips]].

Some [[Shot (filmmaking)|shot]]s require the [[camera]] to move. This can be done several ways, one of which is to use a [[camera crane]]. There are many types of camera cranes, most being a [[counterbalance]]d arm on a pivot, whilst others are hydraulic. Cranes can be used to lift the camera, and often the camera operator and assistant also, quickly into the air. The crane operator sets up and operates the camera crane so that the camera arrives at the right spot. This can be difficult since the camera may be a long distance from the operator.

[[File:Fontana dell'Acqua Paola03.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Fontana dell'Acqua Paola (detail)]]
The '''Fontana dell'Acqua Paola''' also known as '''Il Fontanone''' ("The big fountain") is a monumental [[fountain]] located on the [[Janiculum]] Hill, near the church of [[San Pietro in Montorio]], in Rome, Italy.  It was built in 1612 to mark the end of the [[Acqua Paola]] aqueduct, restored by [[Pope Paul V]], and took its name from him.  It was the first major fountain on the right bank of the [[River Tiber]].&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Symmes with Maria Ann Conelli,  Fountains as Refreshment" in Fountains, Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present. pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Fontana dell'Acqua Paola was inspired by the popularity of the [[Fontana dell'Acqua Felice]], built in 1585-88 by [[Pope Sixtus V]].  Pope Paul V decided to rebuild and extend the ruined Acqua Traiana aqueduct built by the [[Emperor Trajan]] in order to create a source of clean drinking water for the residents of the Janiculum Hill, who were forced to take their water from brackish springs or from the polluted Tiber.   He raised funds for his project in part by imposing a tax upon wine, which caused complaints among some residents.&lt;ref&gt;D'Onofrio, 1962, pg. 141-148&lt;/ref&gt;  The funding from this tax and other sources allowed him to purchase the rights to the water of a spring near Lake Bracciano, not far from Rome, as the source for the fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Symmes, pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The fountain was designed by [[Giovanni Fontana (Dominican)|Giovanni Fontana]], whose brother had worked on the Fontana dell'Acqua Felice, and [[Flaminio Ponzio]].  They used white marble from the nearby ruins of the Roman Temple of [[Minerva]] in the [[Forum of Nerva]], and constructed a massive gateway of five arches for the arrival of the water.   At the top of the fountain are the papal tiara and keys, above the Borghese family coat of arms of an eagle and a dragon, supported by angels. The inscription praises Pope Paul in poetic terms for bringing water to the residents of the district.

Unlike the Fontana dell'Acqua Felice, which had an abundance of statues on biblical themes, the theme of the Fontana dell'Acqua Paola was water. Five abundant streams poured through the arches into five marble basins.  In 1690 Carlo Fontana designed an additional semcircular pool for the water which overflowed from the marble basins.  Marble posts were put in place to keep coachmen from watering their animals in the fountain, but the pool was tempting to many local residents, who bathed in the water. An ordinance was issued in 1707 forbidding residents to bathe in the fountain.&lt;ref&gt;The ordinance forbade greengrocers, gardeners and vineyard workers from bathing or washing their fruit or vegetables in the fountain. Later decrees banned swimming or bathing.  Cited by Marilyn Symmes, pg. 190.  See also Sanfilippo, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of the fountain served as an inspiration for the later [[Trevi Fountain]].

==Dedication==
The Latin dedicatory inscription atop the fountain reads:

::PAVLVS • QVINTVS • PONTIFEX • MAXIMVS&lt;br&gt;
::AQVAM • IN • AGRO • BRACCIANENSIS&lt;br&gt;
::SALVBERRIMIS • E • FONTIBVS • COLLECTAM&lt;br&gt;
::VETERIBVS • AQVAE • ALSIETINAE • DVCTIBVS • RESTITVTIS&lt;br&gt;
::NOVISQVE • ADDITIS&lt;br&gt;
::XXXV • AB • MILLIARIO • DVXIT&lt;br&gt;
::ANNO • DOMINI • MDCXII • PONTIFICATVS • SVI • SEPTIMO&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;The English line-for-line translation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

::Paul the Fifth, Supreme Pontiff [brought]&lt;br&gt;
::Water from the region of Bracciano,&lt;br&gt;
::Gathered from the most healthy sources,&lt;br&gt;
::By restoring old channels of the Alsietina* Aqueduct&lt;br&gt;
::and adding new ones,&lt;br&gt;
::from 35 mile-stones away.&lt;br&gt;
::In the year of the lord 1612, the seventh year of his pontificate.

*Note: the dedication misidentifies the restored aqueduct as the Alsietina aqueduct, build by the emperor Augustus in 2 B.C.E. to supply a Naumachia, a large artificial lake used to stage mock naval combat for entertainment. However, the quality of the water from the Alsietina was poor, and Pope Paul instead restored the aqueduct Traiana, built by the emperor Trajan around 109 C.E. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lansford |first=Tyler |date=Jan 14, 2011 |title=The Latin Inscriptions of Rome: A Walking Guide |url= |location= |publisher=JHU Press |page=485 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==

The American composer [[Charles T. Griffes]] wrote a character piece for piano entitled "The Fountains of Acqua Paola" as part of his ''Roman Sketches'', Op. 7 (composed 1915-16).  Griffes never visited Rome or Italy.  Rather, the pieces in his collection were inspired by a collection of poems by [[William Sharp (writer)|William Sharp]] entitled ''Sospiri di Roma'' (1891).

==In film==

The opening scene of the 2013 Italian [[Paolo Sorrentino]] film ''[[La Grande Bellezza]]'' is filmed at the Fontana dell'Acqua Paola.

In the 2015 film ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', during the car chase in Rome, [[James Bond]] drives by the Fontana dell'Acqua Paola.

'''Franceska Mann''' (or Franciszka Mann in [[Polish language|Polish]], a.k.a. Rosenberg-Manheimer, also: Franciszka Mannówna, or Man; February 4, 1917 – October 23, 1943) was a [[Polish-Jewish]] dancer mentioned by Jewish Holocaust survivors in the context of her actions in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] during [[the Holocaust in occupied Poland]]. Along with a group of new arrivals, Mann was meant to be taken to the gas chamber for immediate death. During the incident, which was either at the selection ramp, a work area or at the gas chamber, depending on the telling, she managed to shoot and fatally wound roll call officer Josef Schillinger and injure Work Service Leader Sergeant Wilhelm Emmerich, before her own subsequent death.

==Life==
Franciszka Mann was a young dancer residing in Warsaw before the Second World War. She studied dance in the dance school of Irena Prusicka. Her friends at that time included [[Wiera Gran]] and [[Stefania Grodzieńska]]. In 1939 she was placed 4th during the international dance competition in Brussels among 125 other young ballet dancers.&lt;ref name=mamontowicz&gt;Terpsychora i lekkie muzy, Bożena Mamontowicz-Łojek, Polskie Wydawn. Muzyczne, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JON, Kurier Poranny, 31 V 1939&lt;/ref&gt;  She was considered one of the most beautiful and promising dancers of her generation in Poland&lt;ref&gt;H. Liński, 1935, Kino, nr 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Liński, Światowid, 1938, nr. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Liński, Światowid, 1938, nr. 18&lt;/ref&gt; both in classical and modern repertoire.

At the beginning of the Second World War she was a performer at the Melody Palace nightclub in [[Warsaw]]. She was a prisoner in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. In several publications she is mentioned as a German collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Reichter, W ostrym świetle dnia. Dziennik żydowskiego lekarza 1939-1945, Londyn, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tuszynska_ksiazka&gt;Agata Tuszyńska, Oskarżona – Wiera Gran, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Turkow, C´etait ainsi. 1939-1943 la vie dans le ghetto de Varsovie, Paryż, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muzyka ocalona: judaica polskie. Marian Fuks, Wydawnictwa Radia i Telewizji, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Her name is associated with the "[[Hotel Polski|Hotel Polski affair]]". 

She is mentioned in [[Filip Mueller]]'s eyewitness account ''Eyewitness Auschwitz'' as well as in the account of Jerzey Tabau, a former [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]] prisoner. Tabau's report was filed for the [[International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg]] as Document L-022.

On October 23, 1943 a transport of around 1,700 Polish Jews arrived on passenger trains at the death camp at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], although they had been told that they were being taken to a transfer camp called Bergau near Dresden, from where they would continue on to Switzerland to be exchanged for German [[POW]]s. One of the passengers was Franceska Mann. She had probably obtained her foreign passport from the Hotel Polski on the [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe#Aryan side|Aryan side]]. In July 1943 the Germans arrested the 600 Jewish inhabitants of the hotel and some of them were sent to Bergen-Belsen as exchange Jews. Others were sent to [[Vittel]] in [[France]] to await transfer to South America.

According to some versions, the new arrivals were not registered but were told that they had to be disinfected before crossing the border into Switzerland. They were taken into the undressing room next to the gas chamber and ordered to undress. Other versions of the story mention the events that follow taking place at either the selection ramp or a labor area of the camp. Regardless of location, what is confirmed is that she fatally wounded the roll call officer Josef Schillinger,&lt;ref name="CS"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Vixen Who Shot A Nazi: The story of Franceska Mann, who shot SS Guard Josef Schillinger, in Auschwitz-Birkenau |work=Kindle Edition |publisher=Amazon |author=Cynthia Southern |ASIN=B00KUZY0UQ |url=https://www.amazon.ca/The-Vixen-Shot-Nazi-Auschwitz-Birkenau-ebook/dp/B00KUZY0UQ#reader_B00KUZY0UQ |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a pistol (many accounts say his own) and fired two shots, wounding him in the stomach. Then she fired a third shot which wounded another SS Sergeant named Emmerich.

According to Tabau, the shots served as a signal for the other women to attack the SS men; one SS man had his nose torn off, and another was scalped. However, accounts vary: in some Schillinger and Emmerich are the only casualties. Reinforcements were summoned and the camp commander, [[Rudolf Höss]], came with other SS men carrying machine guns and grenades. According to [[Filip Mueller]], all people not yet inside the gas chamber were mowed down by machine guns. Other mentioned outcomes are the Jewish women being herded into the gas chamber, taken outside and executed, or Franceska taking her own life with the stolen pistol. Due to various conflicting accounts, it is unclear what truly happened next; the only things that are certain are on that day Schillinger died, Emmerich was wounded, and all the Jewish women were killed.

{{Data Visualization}}
'''Information design''' is the practice of presenting information in a way that fosters efficient and effective understanding of it. The term has come to be used specifically for [[graphic design]] for displaying information effectively, rather than just attractively or for artistic expression. Information design is closely related to the field of [[data visualization]] and is often taught as part of graphic design courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.design.ccsu.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Information design is explanation design. It explains facts of the universe and leads to knowledge and informed action.&lt;ref&gt;Per Mollerup,  Data Design: Visualising quantities, locations, connections, Bloomsbury Academic, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term 'information design' emerged as a [[interdisciplinary|multidisciplinary]] area of study in the 1970s. Some [[graphic designer]]s started to use the term, and it was consolidated with the publication of the ''Information Design Journal'' in 1979, and later with the setting up of the related International Institute for Information Design (IIID) in 1987 and  [[Information Design Association]] (IDA) in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robwaller.org/IDA_origins_RW.pdf |title=The Origins of the Information Design Association |publisher=University of Reading |year=2008 |accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1982, [[Edward Tufte]] produced a book on information design called ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''.
The term [[information graphics]] tends to be used by those primarily concerned with diagramming and display of quantitative information.

In [[technical communication]], information design refers to creating an information structure for a set of information aimed at specified audiences. It can be practiced on different scales.
* On a large scale, it implies choosing relevant content and dividing it into separate manuals by audience and purpose.
* On a medium scale, it means organizing the content in each manual and making sure that overviews, concepts, examples, references, and definitions are included and that topics follow an organizing principle.
* On a fine scale, it includes logical development of topics, emphasis on what's important, clear writing, navigational clues, and even page design, choice of font, and use of white space.
Similar skills for organization and structure are brought to bear in designing [[web site]]s, with additional constraints and functions that earn a designer the title information architect.
In [[computer science]] and [[information technology]], 'information design' is sometimes a rough synonym for (but is not necessarily the same discipline as) [[information architecture]], the design of [[information system]]s, [[database]]s, or [[data structure]]s.  This sense includes [[data modeling]] and [[process analysis]].
{{Citation needed span|text=In the United States, the title of information designer is sometimes used by graphic designers who specialize in creating websites.|date=April 2018|reason=}} The skill set of the information designer, as the title is applied more globally, is closer to that of the [[information architecture|information architect]] in the U.S.

==Early examples==
[[Image:Minard.png|thumb|350px|[[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram of [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's March]] - an early example of an information graphic.]]
Information design is associated with the age of technology but it does have historical roots. Early instances of modern information design include these effective examples:
* [[William Playfair]]'s [[line chart|line]], [[bar chart|bar]], [[pie chart|pie]], and [[area chart]]s illustrating England's trade (1786 and 1801)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anychart.com/blog/2015/12/23/first-area-charts-history/ |title=First Ever Area Charts Created 200+ Years Ago |publisher=AnyChart|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tufte&gt;{{cite book|last=Tufte|first=Edward|author-link=Edward Tufte|title=The Visual Display of Quantitative Information|year=1983|publisher=Graphics Press|location=Cheshire, Connecticut|ISBN=0961392142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s spot maps, which pinpointed the source of a deadly cholera outbreak in 1850s London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crosier|first1=Scott|title=John Snow: The London Cholera Epidemic of 1854|url=http://webprojects.oit.ncsu.edu/project/bio183de/Black/science/science_reading/8.html|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles Joseph Minard]]'s 1861 diagram depicting Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Charles Joseph Minard: Mapping Napoleon's March, 1861|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/58|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[Isotype (pictograms)|International Picture Language]] of the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Popova|first=Maria|title=The Invention of ISOTYPE: How a Vintage Visual Language Paved the Way for the Infographics Age|url=https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/03/08/the-transformer-isotype/|publisher=Brain Pickings|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Florence Nightingale]]'s information graphic depicting army mortality rates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Small|first1=Hugh|title=Florence Nightingale's statistical diagrams|url=http://www.florence-nightingale-avenging-angel.co.uk/GraphicsPaper/Graphics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minard diagram shows the losses suffered by Napoleon's army in the 1812-1813 period. Six variables are plotted: the size of the army, its location on a two-dimensional surface (x and y), time, direction of movement, and temperature. This multivariate display on a two dimensional surface tells a story that can be grasped immediately while identifying the source data to build credibility.  [[Edward Tufte]] wrote in 1983 that: "It may well be the best statistical graphic ever drawn."&lt;ref name=Tufte /&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:DALY disability affected life year infographic.svg|thumb|A visual definition of [[Disability Adjusted Life Year]]]]
[[File:Bangalore Outbound Trains Frequency Chart.png|thumb|350px|Visualization of the frequency of outbound trains from [[Bangalore]], [[India]]. Based on the work of [[Étienne-Jules Marey]]]]
Information design can be used for broad audiences (such as signs in airports) or specific audiences (such as personalized telephone bills).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information Design FAQ|url=http://www.bogieland.com/infodesign_faq.htm|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting work often seeks to improve a user's trust of a product (such as medicine packaging inserts, operational instructions for industrial machinery and information for emergencies).

Governments and regulatory authorities have legislated about a number of information design issues, such as the minimum size of type in financial small print, the labeling of ingredients in processed food, and the testing of medicine labeling. Examples of this are the [[Truth in Lending Act]] in the USA, which introduced the [[Schumer box]] (a concise summary of charges for people applying for a credit card), and the Guideline on the Readability of the Labelling and Package Leaflet of Medicinal Products for Human Use (European Commission, Revision 1, 12 January 2009).

Professor [[Edward Tufte]] explained that users of information displays are executing particular ''analytical tasks''  such as making comparisons or determining causality. The ''design principle'' of the information graphic should support the analytical task, showing the comparison or causality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9Y4SxgfGCg Edward Tufte-Presentation-August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Simplicity ==
Simplicity is a major concern in information design. The aim is clarity. Simplification of messages may imply quantitative reduction but is not restricted to that. Sometimes more
information means more clarity. Also, simplicity is a highly subjective matter and should always be evaluated with the information user in mind. Simplicity can be easy when following five simple steps when it comes to information design: 1. Tell the truth, 2. Get to the point, 3. Pick the right tool for the job, 4. Highlight what is important, 5. Of course, keep it simple. These steps will help an information designer narrow down results, as well as keeping their audience engaged. &lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Nancy.

'''Jumblies Theatre''' is a Canadian [[community art|Community Arts]] [[Theatre]] Company with the overall concept of [[social]] [[inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]].

==Origins==
{{peacock|date=June 2016}}
'''Jumblies Theatre''' was founded in 2001 by its [[Artistic Director]], [[Ruth Howard (artist)|Ruth Howard]]. Ruth’s work is inspired by various artistic traditions, including the British [[community theatre|Community Play]] form, pioneered by the Colway Theatre Trust, and brought to [[Canada]] in the 1990s by Dale Hamilton.

In bringing the [[community theatre|community play]] form to [[Toronto]],  [[Ruth Howard (artist)|Ruth Howard]] and '''Jumblies Theatre''', adapted it  to reflect her evolving artistic interests and Toronto’s  [[Urban culture|urban community]] realities. The company maintains [[community art]]s’ guiding principles of inclusive [[community]] engagement, a value that ‘everyone is welcome’, and a focus on artistic quality and respect for process and product.

==Mandate==

"Jumblies makes art in everyday and unexpected places, with, for and about the people and stories found there. Our art weaves into and grows out of life’s details and rituals; our community is open-ended and based on people doing something together. We dismantle boundaries and connect disparate elements. We create fleeting utopias with lasting ripples. We say 'everyone is welcome', and grapple with the implications – aesthetic, social and practical – of meaning it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumblies Theatre|url=http://www.jumbliestheatre.org/|accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==

Jumblies has three intertwining strands: '''Jumblies Projects''', creating new works through multi-year residencies, passing through phases of research, creation, production and legacy; '''Jumblies Studio''', training and mentoring artists and providing opportunities for professional development and hands-on learning; '''Jumblies Offshoots''', maintaining relationships with communities, artists, and past projects; '''Jumblies At Large''', collaborating with mainstream arts organizations and infiltrating community arts practice in to mainstream arts.

'''Jumblies Projects''' are typically [[artist residency|residencies]], which involve hundreds of community participants and dozens of  professional [[artist]]s from a range of disciplines and cultural traditions. [[Toronto]] residency neighbourhoods to date include [[Riverdale, Toronto|South Riverdale]], [[Lawrence Heights]], Davenport-Perth and [[Etobicoke, Ontario|Central Etobicoke]], [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]].

Jumblies makes art with, for and about people and places, forms cross-sectoral partnerships, employs diverse artists, and engages local people to create new works.

The '''Jumblies Studio''' has several components, including mentorship, consultancy, seminars and symposia, print and digital resources and Artfare Essentials, an intensive week-long course on the principles and practices of art that engages with and creates community. The Studio has delivered Artfare Essentiasl in Toronto and across Canada, including in Vancouver, Nipissing First Nation, Regina and Montreal; trained many interns; held additional professional development workshops and seminars; published two collection of essays (Out of Place); and supported and incubated new projects.

Former Jumblies Studio Interns have gone on to establish independent '''Offshoot''' organizations as legacies of Jumblies' former residencies in the Davenport West area of Toronto (Arts4All), Central Etobicoke (MABELLEarts), Scarborough (The Community Arts Guild), as well as other community arts projects and organizations in Toronto and Ontario, including Aanmitaagzi Storymakers in Nipissing First Nation, Edge of the Woods Festival (Huntsville), and Making Room Community Arts (Parkdale, Toronto).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5477">{{For|the Persian architectural style|Khorasani style}}
'''Khorāsānī style''' (Persian: ''sabk-i Khorāsānī'' 'the style of Khurāsān', also known as ''sabk-i Turkistānī'' 'the style of Turkistan', also transliterated ''Khurāsānī'') was a movement in Persian poetry associated with the court of the [[Ghaznavids]], associated with [[Greater Khorasan]] (now divided between Iran, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan).

==History==

The term was coined in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;'Persian Poetry', in ''The Princeton Handbook of World Poetries'', ed. by Roland Greene and Stephen Cushman (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017), p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; It is traditionally considered to characterise the first period of [[New Persian]] poetry, running from the ninth century CE into the second half of the twelfth. It is characterized by its plain poetic technique, concrete images and metaphors, and some archaic linguistic features. While showing limited use of Arabic loan-words, poetry in this style was influenced by Arabic verse, particularly in terms of its prosody, and the dominant genre was the praise-poem.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 20; Angela Sadeghi Tehrani, 'Modernist Poetry in Iran and the Pioneers', ''Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies'', 2.7 (July 2014), 167-69 (p. 167).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khurāsānī period was succeeded by the ''[[sabk-i ‘Irāqī]]'' ('style of Iraq'), with its greater use of Arabisms, more elaborate metaphors and imagery, and turn towards spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the transition between the periods was not a sharp one.&lt;ref&gt;Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, 'Stylistic Continuities in Classical Persian Poetry: Reflections on Manuchehri from Dāmghān and Amir Mo‘ezzi', in ''The Age of the Seljuqs, ed. by Edmund Herzig and Sarah Stewart, The Idea of Iran, 6 (I. B. Tauris).&lt;/ref&gt; The style saw a return to popularity with the so-called literary revival (''bazgasht-e abadi'') of the eighteenth to twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Sadeghi Tehrani, 'Modernist Poetry in Iran and the Pioneers', ''Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies'', 2.7 (July 2014), 167-69 (p. 168).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exponents==

The pre-eminent study of the style was by Muḥammad Jaʻfar Maḥjūb in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''Sabk-i Khurāsānī dar shiʻr-i Fārsī : barrasī-i mukhtaṣṣāt-i sabkī-i shiʻr-i Fārsī az āghāz-i ẓuhūr tā pāyān-i qarn-i panjum hijrī'' [The Khorasani style in Persian poetry: studies of the stylistic character of Persian poetry from its origins to the end of the fifth century of the Hegira] ([Tihrān]: Intishārāt-i Firdaws, 199-? [first publ. 1971]).&lt;/ref&gt; The chief representatives of this lyricism are [[Asjadi]], [[Farrukhi Sistani]], [[Unsuri]], and [[Manuchihri|Manuchehri]]. Panegyric masters such as [[Rudaki]] were known for their love of nature, their verse abounding with evocative descriptions.

==Example==

A. A. Seyed-Gohrab contrasts the following passages to illustrate the Khorāsānī style.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, ''Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry'' (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 39-42, drawing on Julie Scott Meisami, 'Palaces and Paradises: Palace Description in Medieval Persian Poetry', in ''Islamic Art and Literature'', ed. by O. Grabar and C. Robinson (Princeton, 2001), pp. 21-54.&lt;/ref&gt; The first is a description of a palace from ''Qaṣīda 31'' by Farrukhī Sistānī, writing in the earlier eleventh century. It is plain and concrete in its description:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
: There was a kingly palace in the middle of the garden
: The top of the parapets was situated between two turrets
: Within the palace, there were decorated porticoes
: Each opening towards a belvedere
: One was adorned like Chinese brocade
: The other contained pictures as in Mani's ''Artang''
: In this palace, the images of the King of the East
: Were carved/painted in several places:
: In one place, he is fighting, holding in his hand a small javelin
: In another place, he is feasting, holding in his hand a cup of wine.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second is from the end of the ''sabk-i Khurāsānī'' period, near to the ''sabk-i ‘Irāqī'' period: a description of a palace built by [[Arslan-Shah of Ghazna|Arslān Shah of Ghazna]], composed by [[‘Uthmān Mukhtārī]] in the vicinity of 1100. This description is far less concrete and much more spiritual in tone:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
: The ancient sphere established the centre of the world's empire
: Through this place, through which Jupiter exercises its heavenly influence.
: When the sun saw its parapets from the sky,
: It bowed its head to the ground, and its eyes to the threshold.
: [When] the virgins of paradise beheld it from their gardens,
: They took this palace for gold, and paradise as the mine.
: They considered the earth insignificant because of its firm structure;
: The air in this palace was so fine that the air (outside) was heavy.
: The architect used his intellect and soul to design this edifice
: Through the firmness of his intellect and the grace of his soul.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The formation aid crucial to making hanji is the mucilage that oozes from the roots of [[Abelmoschus manihot|Hibiscus manihot]]. This substance helps suspend the individual fibers in water.

Poking, Kapangan, the Philippines: Asa Press (CP), 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of creating hanji also employs ''dochim'', a method of pounding finished sheets to compact fibers and lessen ink bleed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.cornell.edu/preservation/publications/koreanpapermaking.html Traditional Korean Papermaking: analytical examination of historic Korean papers and research into history, materials and techniques of traditional papermaking of Korea, 2003, the research paper of the Getty Postgraduate Fellow, Hyejung Yum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifides.com/images/LOCHanjiTest.pdf Permanence, Durability and Unique Properties of Hanji by Minah Song and Jesse Munn]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifides.com/what00.html What's Hanji by FIDES International]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifides.com/making00.html Making Hanji by FIDES International]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifides.com/history00.html History of Hanji by FIDES International]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient===
In Korea, [[papermaking]] started not long after its birth in China. At first, made crudely out of hemp and ramie scraps (called maji; {{lang-ko|마지}}), hanji developed to the point that it was renowned{{Citation needed|reason=according to whom?|date=November 2017}}as the highest quality paper available in East Asia{{Citation needed|reason=according to whom?|date=May 2017}}. Its origins in Korea are believed to fall somewhere between the 3rd century and the end of the 6th century{{Citation needed|reason=according to whom?|date=May 2017}}. In 1931, a piece of hanji was found at an archeological dig at a tomb site from the Lelang period (108 BCE–313 CE){{Citation needed|reason=according to whom?|date=May 2017}}.

During the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period (57 BCE–668 CE), each kingdom used paper to record their official histories. In 610, The Buddhist monk [[Damjing]] whom [[Goguryeo]] presented to Japan was able to make the production method of paper and ink.&lt;ref&gt;『[[Nihon Shoki|日本書紀(Nihon Shoki)]]』巻二十二 推古紀 "十八年春三月 高麗王貢上僧 曇徵 法定 曇徵知五經 且能作彩色及紙墨 并造碾磑 蓋造碾磑 始于是時歟"&lt;/ref&gt; The world’s oldest surviving wood block print is the [[Buddhist]] [[Dharani Sutra]] called the [[Pure Light Dharani Sutra]] ({{lang-ko|무구정광대다라니경}}; [[Revised Romanization]]: Mugujeonggwangdaedaranigyeong). Listed as Korea's National Treasure No. 126, it was printed onto hanji c. 704 and is still in good condition, bearing the papermaker’s name. Paper crafts were also developed in the Three Kingdoms period, such as kites and other household items, and continued to flourish as hanji production increased. Silla Kingdom, one of the Three Kingdoms, settled the paper industry deeply into Korean culture, and called it Gyerimji, instead of Hanji (“Hanji’s History”).

===Goryeo period===
[[File:ArghunLetterToPhilippeLeBelExtract1289.jpg|thumb|1289 letter of 4th ilkhan [[Arghun]] to [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], in Mongolian language and classical [[Mongolian script]], with detail of the introduction. The letter was remitted to the French king by [[Buscarel of Gisolfe]]. The seal is that of the Great Khan, with Chinese Script: “輔國安民之寶”, which means "Seal of the upholder of the State and the purveyor of peace to the People". The paper is [[Korea]]n manufacture, in the Goryeo period. 182x25 cm. [[French National Archives]].]]

Hanji’s golden age peaked in the [[Goryeo]] period (918–1392), which saw the rise in quality and use of hanji in conjunction with printmaking. Paper was used to make money, Buddhist texts, and medical and history books. The government encouraged dak cultivation and paper production, and dak was planted countrywide in the 12th century. Often called Goryeoji, hanji became famous in Asia for its strength and luster, and became a heavy trade item to China.

The Goryeo period is famous for two major landmarks in Korean [[printmaking]] and paper history. One was the carving of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] onto over 80,000 wooden blocks, which contain no errors and are still extant in their original home at [[Haeinsa]], a Buddhist temple in [[Gyeongsangnam-do]]. It was carved twice, due to its destruction by Mongol invasions in 1232; the final version was completed in 1251. The second accomplishment was the printing in 1377 of [[Jikji]], a guide for students of Buddhism, and the world’s oldest extant book printed using metal movable type. Printed onto hanji, it is housed today in the National Library of France, and displays proof of movable metal type well before Gutenberg’s time.

===Joseon period===
The beginning of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] period (1392–1910) saw continued flourishing of the hanji industry as paper permeated daily lives of Koreans through books, household items, and popular items such as fans and tobacco pouches. From the start of the Joseon period in an effort to promote austerity, artificial flowers that had been made from wax and silk were replaced by paper versions. Later, paper flowers were also used to replace other versions for Buddhist rites and festivals.

Variations of hanji became common, such as colored paper, and paper made from mixed fibers including pine bark, rice straw, and bamboo. This came partly from a need to find new materials beyond dak due to the huge demand for books. The government created an administrative agency devoted to paper production, and also supplied troops with paper armor, which was waterproof, a good insulator, and provided protection against arrows and swords. Oiled hanji was used to make greenhouses c. 1450 because the paper, made of natural materials, could control temperature, humidity, and light effectively. However, the Joseon government pressured Buddhist monks to increase their production of hanji that they were already making for Buddhist scriptures since the 15th century.

As the final blow to hanji, western methods of paper mass production were introduced in 1884.

===After liberation===
In the 1970s, the [[New Community Movement|New Village Movement]] that aimed to modernize Korea rapidly also led to further decimation of the hanji industry, as it eradicated traditional straw-thatched homes that used hanji to cover floors, walls, ceilings, windows, and doors. The most recent threat to the Korean paper industry is the rise of inexpensive paper made in China, where labor costs and overhead are significantly lower than in Korea.

As of 2009, twenty-six hanji mills remain operational in South Korea. They make hanji for artists, calligraphers, conservators, temples, and laypeople.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Aimee. “Buddhist Illumination of Korean Papermaking’s Past and Present”, ''Buddhism and Culture Magazine'', No. 5, April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amlie, Lynn.

==Manufacturing Process==

=== Materials ===
The two materials mainly used when making Hanji is the [[Paper Mulberry]] (called the Dak tree) and the [[Sunset Hibiscus]]. More than 6 steps of the manufacturing process deal with mending and preparing these two materials (Seo).

The [[Paper Mulberry]] is a commonly grown plant in Asia, growing in the feet of mountains that gets a lot of sunlight, reaching a growth height of usually 3 meters. In Korean history, people used the fibers from these trees to make clothes, and they began to use it as the source for paper during the Goryeo dynasty. The Joseon dynasty, which came after Goryeo, recommended people to grow more of these mulberry trees.

The [[Sunset Hibiscus]] usually finishes growing in October. Their roots contain a slimy mucus (called Dak Pul) which helps hold the paper together and give viscosity to the bark.

=== Process ===
Ancient Koreans usually started making Hanji during the winter, because the mucus from ''[[Abelmoschus manihot]]'' became easily fermented due to the summer heat. Ancient Koreans believed that it was important to choose a good day with a nice sky to start making Hanji, and often gave religious rituals to the spirits in order to wish for a favorable condition and a smooth process.

The process of making Hanji differs by what ingredients the Hanji makers choose, and what methods of sheet formation they take to make the final product. However, the most traditional and basic process follows eight steps:

#Hanji makers gather clean and strong barks of mulberry trees.
#The bark is skinned and dried. The result is called Heukpi (흑피, hanja: 黑皮). The Heukpi is kept in flowing water for at least 10 hours. This eases the process of skinning the bark, turning Heukpi into Baekpi (백피, hanja: 白皮).
#Bean or buckwheat stems are burned, and their ashes are put into water to boil the Baekpi for 4-5 hours.
#The Baekpi is washed, removing any remaining bark and soil.
#The skinned and cleaned Baekpi is placed on a flat stone board and pounded (''Gohae'') for about an hour.
#The mucus from [[abelmoschus manihot]] (Dakpul) is applied onto the bark. This helps the paper stay together for a long time, and does not contain any harmful chemicals.
#Sheets of the mixture are formed next, while pouring more Dakpul onto the sheet. It is stirred with a long and wooden stick, and they call this ''Puldaejil''.  The final substance is put on a flat bamboo outline, where the surface is made smooth and even. This process is where the skill of the craftsman is truly revealed, as it requires years of experience and practice to achieve good Hanji, determining the thickness, texture, and overall quality of Hanji. Many methods of this procedure exist, including ''Hullim,'' ''Gadum,'' ''Webal,'' and ''Jangpan,'' each producing slightly different types of Hanji. Traditional methods of sheet forming is different from the modern day method, which use machinery to make it even. 
#One single sheet of Hanji is now made, which is pressed between heavy stones to dry, and placed in a warm room. They do not dry them near fire, because gradually drying them with a warm temperature causes the paper to be more tough and durable.

The overall process of making Hanji was very strenuous. One had to dedicate all of his or her life to making Hanji, and traditional Hanji makers would say “I will not let my son be a container man (the person who strains the fiber through a bamboo screen) even if I am driven to the worst”.&lt;ref&gt;The Story&lt;/ref&gt; It requires a lifelong practice to create perfect Hanji, and this is the reason why Hanji holds a great cultural value in Korea. These days, people use various technology to improve the process. For example, the Hanji makers use a heated stainless steel drum, brushing every part of the paper. This is the method that they take to dry the papers evenly, which is adapted from how traditional Hanji makers dried them on the floor of a warm room.&lt;ref&gt;Song and Munn&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics of Hanji ==

=== Durability ===
Hanji is a very reputable paper among Asians, and it is famous for its durability{{Citation needed|reason=according to whom?|date=May 2017}}. The fact that other historical print papers have to be preserved in special containers when Hanji papers can still be displayed in museums proves this fact{{Citation needed|reason=according to whom?|date=May 2017}}. The oldest text made of Hanji currently existing in Korea, Muggujungwang, is still well preserved after about 800 years (Seo).

=== Ventilation/Temperature Control ===
Hanji is a good ventilator, but it also keeps the temperature of the room warm. Traditional Koreans covered their wooden doors with Hanji because it would cool down in the summer and make them warm during winter (Hanji’s History).

=== Waterproof ===
In March 2006, there was a lamp festival in Paris, France. Many sizes and colors of lamps were lighted in the Boulogne park. Soon after the festival started, there was a sudden rain, and people panicked. They were worried that all the lamps would turn off. However, lamps made out of traditional Hanji did not turn off. It did not let the rain through, protecting candle lights within, and it portrayed one of the many advantages of Hanji (Seo).

=== Scientific Principles ===
The bark from mulberry trees contain lignin and holocellulose, which contribute to the durability of Hanji. The ordinary papers that people commonly use have a pH level of 4~5.5. The neutral level that is not harmful to the humans is pH 7, meaning that these papers are acidic. If papers have low pH level (more acidic), they are completely decomposed in 100 years. Hanji, however, uses Hibiscus Manihot, which has a pH level of 7 and does not get dismantled easily (“The Significance”).

== Use of Hanji ==
{{main article|Korean art}}

=== Ancient Uses ===
Ever since paper was first introduced to the commoners in ancient Koreans, its uses have been adapted into various and unique ways. Hanji was used to help people in the daily lives. They covered their door frame with Hanji and controlled the room temperature. The high social class people, called Yangbans, recorded various documents on Hanji. This is one of the main reasons why Korea’s ancient records are well preserved. China’s Dynasty also only used Hanji to record their emperor’s achievements. It was one of the main export products that Korean dynasties used in trading (Seo). Another unique usage of Hanji is that people made armors out of Hanji. Even though Hanji is just a paper, it was very durable and tough. It was waterproof, and didn’t rip easily. There is a record in Korea saying that people made armors and suits with Hanji, and called them Jigap (“Jigap”).

=== Hanji art and craft forms ===
There are two divisions of hanji art: two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Two-dimensional hanji art uses paper of various colors to create an image in a similar format as a painting. However, the paper itself is folded and crumpled to make the image stick up from the paper it is adhered to. People make various shapes with Hanji and frame it to exhibit on their wall. Three-dimensional hanji art is similar to paper mache, in that it can make sculptural objects that may stand unsupported. Traditional hanji craft forms include jiho, jido, and jiseung. Jiho is a method that uses hanji scraps soaked in water and then added to glue, making a clay-like paste that can be molded into lidded bowls. Jido is the craft of pasting many layers of hanji onto a pre-made frame, which can be made into sewing baskets and trunks. Ancient Koreans commonly put their sewing materials in small boxes decorated with colorful Hanji (“Hanji Crafting”). Jiseung is a method of cording and weaving strips of hanji to make a wide array of household goods, including trays, baskets, mats, quivers, shoes, washbasins, and chamberpots. Other than these, Hanji was made into various flowers to decorate Buddhist temples (“Hanji Crafting”).

It measures 153.5 cm in height, 58.7 cm in width, dates from the 12th to 13th centuries, and depicts a solitary [[nimbate]] figure on a dark-brown medieval Chinese silk. According to the Hungarian historian [[Zsuzsanna Gulácsi]], this painting is one of the six documented [[Chinese Manichaeism|Chinese Manichaean]] hanging scrolls from [[Zhejiang]] province from the early 12th century, which titled {{transl|zh|Yishu fo zhen}} (lit. "Silk Painting of the Buddha [Prophet] Jesus").{{refn|group=note|"{{lang|zh-Hant|夷數}}" ({{lang-zh|w=I-shu|p=Yíshù}}) is the Chinese translation of the name ''Jesus'' by the Manichaeans.}}&lt;ref name="AMPBJ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academia.edu/27929108/_A_Manichaean_Portrait_of_the_Buddha_Jesus_Identifying_a_Twelfth-Thirteenth-century_Chinese_Painting_from_the_Collection_of_Seiun-ji_Zen_Temple._Artibus_Asiae_69_1_2009_91-145 |title=A Manichaean Portrait of the Buddha Jesus |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |date=2009 |website=academia.edu |access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Manichaean Painting of the Buddha Jesus (detail).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Detail: Cross of Light.]]
The painting depicts a monumental, solitary figure, with glittering lines of gold and various colours. The upper half is occupied by a cloaked deity seated in [[lotus position]] and hands held close to one another in front of the chest. He is holding in his left hand a red lotus pedestal on where a small gold cross (Cross of Light) is seated. In addition to the [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] around the head, there is a faint outline of a large [[mandorla]] that frames the body and reaches the upwards, where a [[Tassel|tasselled]] [[Chatra (umbrella)|canopy]] hung above the nimbus. The lower half is filled by an elaborate pedestal, which is a multilayered hexagonal stand supporting a lotus with lush sets of petals that open in five orderly rings. Each petal evokes the form of a miniature altar.

== Background ==
According to the ''[[Song Huiyao Jigao]]'', there were six paintings in the possession of a Chinese Manichaean church used as objects of learning and veneration:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cciv.cityu.edu.hk/publication/jiuzhou/txt/15-2-190.txt |title=摩尼教華名辨異 |last=Lin |first=Wushu |website=cciv.cityu.edu.hk |language=zh-Hant |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of this hanging scroll represents a unique case of religious metamorphosis, for it has been used by three religions. It can be divided into three episodes: before ca. 1552, the image was venerated by [[Chinese Manichaeism|Manichaeans]] from southern China. From 1552 (or 1608) to 1612, during this period of sixty years (at most), the painting functioned as a [[Kirishitan|Christian]] object in Japan. No written records, only legend at [[Seiunji Temple]], suggests that the painting belonged to an executed Christian [[daimyō]] [[Arima Harunobu]], before it ended up in the Buddhist temple. The most recent, which has lasted approximately four hundred years, when the scroll has been used as a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] work of art in the Seiunji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="AMPBJ" /&gt; The Japanese Buddhists considered it a depiction of [[Ākāśagarbha]] ({{lang-ja|虚空蔵菩薩}}), a celestial [[bodhisattva]] worshipped in [[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/28622189/_A_Song_Dynasty_Manichaean_Painting_of_the_Buddha_Jesus_%E5%B9%85%E5%AE%8B%E4%BB%A3%E6%91%A9%E5%B0%BC%E6%95%99_%E5%A4%B7%E6%95%B0%E4%BD%9B%E5%B8%A7_Yifu_Songdai_Monijiao_Yishufozheng_._Journal_for_the_Study_of_Art_History_%E8%89%BA%E6%9C%AF%E5%8F%B2%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6_Yishushi_Yanjiu_2008_139-189_in_Chinese_ |title=一幅宋代摩尼敎《夷數佛幀》 |last=Gulácsi |first=Zsuzsanna |translator-last=Wang |translator-first=Yuanyuan |date=2008 |website=academia.edu |language=zh-Hant |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
The painting was identified earlier by the Japanese art historian {{ill|Takeo Izumi|ja|泉武夫 (美術史学者)}} as a [[Yuan dynasty]] [[Church of the East in China|Nestorian Christian]] work of art. [[Zsuzsanna Gulácsi]] notes that the highly [[Sinicization|sinicised]] character of this painting weakens this idea, "since [[Church of the East|Nestorian Christianity]] in China maintained a foreign identity and produced art with relatively small degree of integration compared to the arts of other originally foreign but later fully integrated religions, such as Buddhism and Manichaeism."&lt;ref name="AMPBJ" /&gt;

After studying and comparing the scroll with a number of Buddhist, Nestorian Christian and Manichaean works of art, Gulácsi concluded in her article ''A Manichaean Portrait of the Buddha Jesus: Identifying a Twelfth-Thirteenth-century Chinese Painting from the Collection of Seiun-ji Zen Temple'', that the painting is a Manichaean work of art: {{Quote|text=Despite the fact that it features a figure seated on a lotus pedestal with a cross statuette in his left hand, this painting is neither a Buddhist nor a Christian work of art for three reasons: first, it can be linked with contemporaneous Chinese textual and visual sources that support its creation and used in a Manichaean context; second, it displays iconographic and compositional continuity with earlier Manichaean art; and third, it depicts a Manichaean subject (the prophet Jesus) with symbols that allude to two fundamental Manichaean teachings ([[Dualistic cosmology|Dualism]] and the Cross of Light) that are well documented throughout the history of this religion. Based on a contemporaneous inventory of paintings in the possession of a Manichaean temple in [[Wenzhou]], this hanging scroll may be titled {{transl|zh|Yishu fo zhen}} (Silk Painting of the Buddha ["Prophet"] Jesus).

The '''Mold cape''' is a solid sheet-[[gold]] object dating from about 1900–1600 BC in the European [[Bronze Age]]. It was found at [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] in [[Flintshire]], [[Wales]], in [[1833 in archaeology|1833]].

The cape is thought to have formed part of a ceremonial dress, perhaps with religious connections. It is housed at the [[British Museum]] in London.

==Discovery==

The gold cape was found in 1833 by workmen (accounts vary: either during the filling of a gravel pit&lt;ref&gt;Clarke ''et al.'' 278&lt;/ref&gt; or while they were quarrying for stone&lt;ref name=bmcape&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The cape was within a Bronze Age burial mound in a field named ''Bryn yr Ellyllon'', the Fairies' or Goblins' Hill. The gold cape had been placed on the body of a person who was interred in a rough [[cist]] (stone-lined grave) within a burial mound. The preserved remains of the skeleton were fragmentary, and the cape was badly crushed. An estimated 200–300 [[amber]] beads, in rows, were on the cape originally, but only a single bead survives at the British Museum. Also associated with the cape were remains of coarse cloth and 16 fragments of sheet [[bronze]] which are likely to have been the backing for the gold: in places the gold was riveted onto the bronze sheeting with bronze rivets. There also were two gold 'straps' among the artefacts found. An [[urn]] with large quantities of burnt bone and ash was 0.6–0.9 m from the grave.

The cape's breadth is 458&amp;nbsp;mm, just over 18 inches. It was designed to fit someone of a very slight build and although the gender of the person buried in this grave remains unclear, the associated finds are likely, by comparison with similar contemporary graves discovered, to be those accompanying the burial of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrexham.gov.uk/assets/pdfs/museum/treasures/moldcape_e.pdf British Museum and National Museums and Galleries of Wales information&lt;/ref&gt;

==The cape==
The cape is considered to be one of the most spectacular examples of prehistoric sheet-gold working yet discovered.  It is of particular interest as both its form and its design are unparalleled. The cape is oval in shape and would cover the shoulders, upper arms, and upper chest of the person wearing it, being higher at the back and lower in the front.

The craftsmanship with which the cape was constructed is exceptional. The object was beaten out of a single ingot of gold, a task which would have taken considerable time and skill, and was then intensely decorated with [[repoussé]] concentric rings of ribs and bosses.  The decoration almost totally fills the object's outer surface, so that very little "plain" gold remains. It has been suggested that this decorative motif may mimic multiple strings of beads and/or the folds of cloth.&lt;ref name=bmcape/&gt;

The value of the metal and the quality of the craftmanship suggests that the cape was produced by a wealthy culture.  Scholars speculate that the makers and owners of the cape were associated with the mine on the [[Great Orme]], north Wales, the largest copper mine in north-west Europe at that time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/okZT5JiCTn6lYFR0Gs9Tbg&lt;/ref&gt;

As the cape extends so far down the upper body, it would have severely restricted arm movement by pinning them to the wearer's side, so that only the lower arms were usable.  For this reason, it has been concluded that the cape would not have been suitable for everyday wear. It seems most probable that the cape was used for ceremonial purposes, and may have signified the wearer as a person of spiritual or temporal power: the Bronze Age equivalent of a [[chasuble]], perhaps.

===The decorative motifs===
[[File:Mold cape detail.jpg|thumb|Detail image showing decoration bands and tool marks.]]
Around the neck and base are a line of perforations. There are three zones of decoration on the cape: a band running around the base, a curving panel which dips at the neck and rises over the shoulders, and two matching panels to fill in the upper arm area. Above the perforations at the base are two high ridges and a deep groove. Above the groove is a line of conical bosses which runs around the whole cape, but bifurcates at the front to rise up over the triangular panels at the upper arm. The bosses at the front are enlarged.

At the front the sequence of decoration above the bosses is, from bottom to top: ridge, three rows of small domed bosses, ridge, row of square-based pyramids, ridge, row of small domed bosses, ridge, row of lentoid bosses, ridge, three rows of small domed bosses, ridge, row of conical bosses and finally, three ridges.

The back has the same sequence with the addition, from bottom to top, of ridge, row of lentoid bosses, ridge, three rows of small domed bosses, ridge and, a row of lentoid bosses.

The two triangular areas on the upper arm are bounded at the front by a ridge, row of lentoid bosses and a ridge. At the front and back it is then bounded by three rows of small domed bosses. Inside this is a ridge, a row of conical bosses, and two ridges with a groove. The central area is filled with small domed bosses. At the base of each ridge and the large bosses are fine punched indentations (pointillé). In places the perforations at the base are double. In areas where parts of the cape are missing there are perforations (possibly from a previous repair).

Perforations along the upper and lower edges may indicate that it was once attached to a lining, perhaps of leather, which has decayed. The bronze strips may have served to strengthen the adornment further.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke ''et al.'' 277-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels==

The [[Wessex]] region of England [[Wessex culture|during the Bronze Age]] was noted for the wealth of its grave goods, particularly the exquisite goldwork in up to 15% of its graves. Fifteen findspots of goldwork are known for Wessex, compared to five in four other southern English counties ([[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Essex]], and [[Norfolk]]) with an apparent complete absence in the rest of the country.  It is thought that much of this Wessex goldwork was the product of a single master craftsman, and that all may have been a product of his workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 46–48&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mold cape is the only other piece of Bronze Age goldwork which challenges the Wessex material in its richness; however, the decorative motifs employed in the cape are dissimilar to those found in the Wessex material.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke ''et al.'', 113-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mold cape shows both indigenous and Continental influences. Similar treatment of decorative motifs may be found in other pieces of Bronze Age metalwork, such as a bowl found at Rongères in eastern France (which itself draws from Central European sources), and also with the lenticular bosses found on the Migdale (Sutherland, Scotland) bronze "spacer-plate" (a device to hold apart the separate strands of a necklace) and the bronze armlets found at Melfort in Argyll, Scotland. This distinctive boss motif, surrounded by fine dots outlining the lenticular shape, has a long duration in [[Scotland]] and obviously survived in the indigenous repertoire to re-appear on this unusual cape.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke ''et al.'', 111-4, 192, 288, 302&lt;/ref&gt;

With its fine [[repoussé and chasing|repoussé]] work the Mold cape represents the last major piece of second millennium BC sheetwork so far discovered. Thereafter, the dominant preference for sheetwork in the British Isles is eclipsed and the evidence is more of massive goldwork in the form of solid bracelets, twisted bar-flanged [[torc]]s, and solid rings.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke ''et al.'' 192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavation and display==
Since its backing had decayed, the fragile cape broke up during recovery. The pieces were dispersed among various people. Although the British Museum acquired the greater proportion in 1836, small fragments have come to light intermittently over the years and have been reunited with the larger portion.

Later, detailed study and restoration revealed the full form of the cape, which at one time had been misinterpreted as a peytrel (chest ornament) for a horse. It also became apparent that a second, smaller object in matching embossed style, was present in the grave. The cape is now mounted on cloth.

The cape was number 6 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the [[British Museum]] for the [[2003 in television|2003]] [[BBC Television]] [[Documentary television series|documentary]] ''[[Our Top Ten Treasures]]'' presented by [[Adam Hart-Davis]]. It also featured in the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[A History of the World in 100 Objects]]'', as object number 19 in February 2010.

The cape was on display at the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff until 4 August 2013, but was transferred to Wrexham for the period 7 August to 14 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/whatson/?event_id=6735|title=The Mold Gold Cape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23606310|title=Mold Gold Cape on display at Wrexham Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The cape is referenced in the bluegrass song, "King of Boys," by [[Steve Martin]] and [[Edie Brickell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/121932/hollywood-star-plays-banjo-on-track-about-mold-cape.aspx|title=Hollywood star plays banjo on track about Mold cape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''monograph''' is a specialist work of writing (in contrast to [[reference work]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Campbell |first1=Robert |last2=Pentz |first2=Ed |last3=Borthwick |first3=Ian |date=2012 |title=Academic and Professional Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IpRlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-78063-309-1 |quote='[M]onograph' has become a catch-all term for a book that is not of a reference type, that is of primary material}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on a single subject or an aspect of a subject, often by a single author, and usually on a scholarly subject. 

In library cataloging, ''monograph'' has a broader meaning, that of a nonserial publication complete in one [[Volume (bibliography)|volume]] (book) or a definite number of volumes. Thus it differs from a [[periodical publication|serial]] publication such as a [[magazine]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[newspaper]].&lt;ref&gt;Prytherch, Raymond John, ''Harrod's librarians' glossary and reference book: a directory of over 10,200 terms, organizations, projects and acronyms in the areas of information management, library science, publishing and archive management'', 10th edn (Aldershot, Hants, England ; Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2005), p. 462.; "For the purpose of library cataloging, any nonserial publication, complete in one volume or intended to be completed in a finite number of parts issued at regular or irregular intervals, containing a single work or collection of works. Monographs are sometimes published in monographic series and subseries. Compare with book."[http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_m.aspx#monograph]&lt;/ref&gt; In this context only, books such as [[novel]]s are monographs.__FORCETOC__

== In academia ==
{{See also|Monographic series}}
The term "monographia" is derived from the Greek "mono" (single) and ''grapho'' (to write), meaning "writing on a single subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.phytojournal.com/archives/?year=2018&amp;vol=7&amp;issue=4&amp;ArticleId=5296&amp;si=false |title=Development of monograph and study of variation in chemical constituent of plant Balanites roxburghii |journal=Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry |volume=7 |issue=4 |year=2018 |access-date=8 October 2018 |pages=2369-2371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a textbook, which surveys the state of knowledge in a field, the main purpose of a monograph is to present primary research and original scholarship ascertaining reliable credibility to the required recipient. This research is presented at length, distinguishing a monograph from an article. For these reasons, publication of a monograph is commonly regarded as vital for career progression in many academic disciplines. Intended for other researchers and bought primarily by libraries, monographs are generally published as individual volumes in a short print run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/00012530910932294 |title=The role and future of the monograph in arts and humanities research|journal=Aslib Proceedings |volume=61 |pages=67 |year=2009 |last1=Williams |first1=Peter |last2=Stevenson|first2=Iain|last3=Nicholas|first3=David|last4=Watkinson|first4=Anthony|last5=Rowlands|first5=Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and the U.S., what differentiates a scholarly monograph from an academic trade title varies by publisher, though generally it is the assumption that the readership has not only specialized or sophisticated knowledge but also professional interest in the subject of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=John B. |title=Books in the Digital Age: The Transformation of Academic and Higher Education Publishing in Britain and the United States |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |year=2005 |isbn=978-0745634784 |pages=84-85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In art ==
Book publishers use the term "artist monograph" to indicate books dealing with a single artist, as opposed to broader surveys of art subjects.

== In biology ==

In biological taxonomy a monograph is a comprehensive treatment of a [[taxon]]. Monographs typically review all known species within a group, add any newly discovered species, and collect and synthesize available information on the ecological associations, geographic distributions, and morphological variations within the group. See this reference as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=|title=Revision of the Triatominae (Hemiptera, Reduviidae), and their significance as vectors of Chagas' disease |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/89400#/summary |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History|volume=163|issue=3|pages=125-520|hdl=2246/1282 |author1=Lent, Herman |author2=Wygodzinsky, Pedro W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-ever monograph of a plant taxon was [[Robert Morison]]'s 1672 ''Plantarum Umbelliferarum Distributio Nova'', a treatment of the [[Apiaceae]].&lt;ref name="Vines 1913"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Sydney Howard Vines|Vines, Sydney Howard]] | year = 1913 | chapter = Robert Morison 1620–1683 and John Ray 1627–1705 | editor = [[Francis Wall Oliver|Oliver, Francis Wall]] (ed.) | title = Makers of British Botany | publisher = Cambridge University Press | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In United States Food and Drug Administration regulation ==
{{See also|Pharmacopoeia}}
In the context of [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulation, monographs represent published standards by which the use of one or more substances is automatically authorized. For example, the following is an excerpt from the ''[[Federal Register]]'': "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule in the form of a final monograph establishing conditions under which over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen drug products are [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] and not misbranded as part of FDA's ongoing review of OTC drug products."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/052199b.txt |work=Federal Register|date= May 21, 1999 |volume= 64|number= 98 |series=Rules and Regulations |pages=27666–27693|title=DOCID:fr21my99-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such usage has given rise to the use of the word monograph as a verb, as in "this substance has been monographed by the FDA".

[[File:ThomasSchweicker2.jpg|thumb|Self portrait by mouth and foot artist [[Thomas Schweicker]] (1540–1602)]]
'''Mouth and foot painting''' is a technique to create [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s and other works of art by maneuvering brushes and other tools with the mouth or foot. The technique is mostly used by artists who through illness, accident or congenital disability have no use of their hands.

The [http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/research/ruralelectrification/casestudies/mali/index.shtml Multifunction Platform (MFP)] is a concept and a structure developed by [[UNDP]] and deployed in a number of West African countries, and [[Tanzania]] and [[Zambia]]. The idea has been to place an MFP in a village which, driven by a [[diesel engine]], powers devices such as [[pumps]] and [[grain mill]]s and [[Electric generator|generators]]. The UNDP has produced a number of reports on this project in [[Mali]] which [http://www.energyandenvironment.undp.org/undp/index.cfm?module=Library&amp;page=DocumentList&amp;LibraryID=8&amp;RegionID=4&amp;CountryID=MLI can be accessed here.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  There are few independent analyses of the development impact of the concept of the multifunctional platform, but recently an article in the journal Energy Policy,which [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V2W-4XSSV3C-4/2/168d4100da1f1b87a2584912bde29b09 can be accessed here], provide a more nuanced view of programme achievements than impact assessments made public at earlier stages of the project.

The primary impact of the MFP has been on women's work (on reducing daily drudgery and opening up new opportunities in life) and the UNDP's deployment has been to women's organisations, with part local funding and part local grant.

In places where [[Jatropha]] is grown, a device, powered by the MFP, can crush the Jatropha seed. The oil produced is suitable for running the diesel engine, allowing the MFP to produce fuel for its own operation. The company Mali Biocarburant has carried out a pilot with in a number of villages in Mali, as [https://web.archive.org/web/20140812211338/http://www.ease-web.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Final-report-MBSA.pdf reported here]. Also, [http://www.malifolkecenter.org/ The Mali Folke Centre] has reported on its success in this field.

More recently, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140809164402/http://fact-foundation.com/ FACT Foundation] has implemented a pilot programme in which biogas is used for co-fuelling MFP diesel engines. In five villages in Mali, biogas systems were installed and connected to the MFP diesel engines. As [http://www.snvworld.org/download/publications/snv_fact_productive_biogas_2014_final.pdf reported here], first results look promising, although further work is required to improve the management of the biogas systems.

Volunteers from [[Engineers Without Borders (Canada)|Engineers Without Borders]] have been involved with assessment of some MFP projects, as [https://web.archive.org/web/20070216195956/http://www.nigercurrents.ca/index.php/2006/08/09/p53 reported here].

Whereas the [[UNDP]]'s projects have involved substantial injection of foreign expert advice, a low budget self-initiated approach was in recent times taken  in [[Kiliba]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034940/http://aplaceof.info/kiliba/program1.htm Farm of Hope], a project of [[Fondation chirezi]]. However, that project failed to materialise.

The '''''Mystic  Marriage of St. Francis''''' is a  painting by the  Italian Renaissance artist [[Stefano di Giovanni|Sassetta]], currently housed in the [[Musée Condé]] of [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], [[France]].

==Description==
The painting was originally part of a [[polyptych]] at [[Sansepolcro]], where it was seen by [[Piero della Francesca]].

It portrays [[St. Francis of Assisi]] while ideally marrying the three [[Theological Virtues]], Faith, Hope and Charity, through the donation of a ring to them. The three virtues have differently colored dresses: red for Charity, green for Hope and white for Faith; they are also depicted on the left while flying to heaven with sticks in their hands. Behind St. Francis, who wears his traditional brown monk habit, is his companion Fra' Leone.

The scene is set in an idyllic landscape, between hills, castles and cultivated fields, without any attention to perspective and realism as in other Renaissance works. Sassetta was in fact one of the last painters of the Sienese Gothic school, as shown by the use of elongated figures, the delicate colors and the courtly atmosphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">'''New Music Economy''' is a term describing the emergent social, technical, political and economic context of the [[creative industries]]. This shift in context has been fueled by concurrent evolution within an ecosystem of interdependent technologies, institutions, and individuals; the result of which impacts the nature of creative property, identity, production, distribution and imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Touve, David, Pho List, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The term New Music Economy is evolving out of new [[Consumer behaviour|consumer behavior]], methods of promotion and sales.

== Term usage history ==
Notable changes in the economic stability of the music industry started in the late 1990s with the advent of [[File sharing|P2P file sharing]]. [[The Long Tail]] theory is a benchmark in the music industry for new economic concepts. The nuance of infinite shelf space opened up economic opportunity for independent record labels around the world. The term New Music Economy first emerged in 2007.
* Tim Westergren (Founder &amp; CSO, Pandora) &amp; Gideon D'Arcangelo (New York University) lead an event March 13, 2007 in Palo Alto, CA titled "Social Interactions in the New Music Economy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20070313/|title=Active Listening: Social Identity in the New Music Economy|date=2007-03-13|publisher=BayCHI|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Venture Capitalist Fred Wilson began using the term "New Music Economy" in his blog on April 4, 2008.
* The San Fran Music Tech Summit used the term "New Music Economy" as a title of a Marketing Panel on May 8, 2008. The Panel &amp; Audience of thought leaders attempted to create a formal definition for New Music Economy. The group wrote a list with 12 necessary components in defining the term New Music Economy:
** Music Licensing
** Co-Marketing
** Branding with New Tools
** Non Traditional Retail Space
** Digital Distribution
** Internet-Specific Content
** Fan Artist Relationship Management
** Quality Control
** Content Management System Structures
** Legal Structures
** Live Performance
** Incorporation of Attention Economy Principles in Marketing Strategies

''Music Licensing'' &lt;br /&gt;
Bands, artists &amp; labels are able to utilize [[music licensing]] for opportunity. Businesses are legally required to pay for the music they use to promote their product. Music has a positive effect on consumer behavior

''Co-Marketing'' &lt;br /&gt;
Brands and bands joining together to market their product in sync

''Branding''&lt;br /&gt;
Bands, artists &amp; [[record label]]s using digital tools such as widgets, social networks, avatars, and icons

''Non Traditional Retail Space''&lt;br /&gt;
Selling music in businesses that don't normally sell music

''Digital Distribution'' &lt;br /&gt;
(For sale and marketing purposes), including music, merchandise, video, concert tickets

''Internet Specific Content''&lt;br /&gt;
Creating and using content online to drive fans toward exclusive content of economic value to the band/ artist/ label

''Fan Artist Relationship Management'' &lt;br /&gt;
Creation, moderation and maintenance of fan groups, [[Fansite|fan sites]] and fan activities which includes exchanges of data ranging from email addresses to shared taste in music. Increased interaction between fans and artists/ bands/ labels with the use of blogs, fan clubs, forums, SMS, geo tagging

''Quality Control''&lt;br /&gt;
Boutique licensing agencies, promotional companies, licensees, record labels and broadcasters focusing on curation &amp; quality

{{About|imagination|the album by Washed Out|Paracosm (album)}}

A '''paracosm''' is a detailed [[imaginary world]]. Paracosms are thought generally to originate in childhood and to have one or numerous creators. The creator of a paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship with this subjective universe, which may incorporate real-world or imaginary characters and conventions. Commonly having its own geography, history, and language, it is an experience that is often developed during childhood and continues over a long period of time, months or even years, as a sophisticated reality that can last into adulthood.&lt;ref name="petrella"&gt;Kristin Petrella, "[http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1440&amp;context=honors_capstone A Crucial Juncture: The Paracosmic Approach to the Private Worlds of Lewis Carroll and the Brontës]". In ''Surface'', Syracuse University Honors Program, Spring 2009-05-01. (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Origin and usage ==
The concept was first described by a researcher for the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], Robert Silvey, with later research by British psychiatrist Stephen A. MacKeith and British [[psychologist]] David Cohen. The term "paracosm" was coined by Ben Vincent, a participant in Silvey's 1976 study and a self-professed paracosmist.&lt;ref&gt;The Paracosm: a special form of fantasy, in Morrison, D.C. (Ed.), ''Organizing Early Experience: Imagination and cognition in Childhood''. New York: Baywood, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cohen and Stephen MacKeith, ''The Development of Imagination: The Private Worlds of Childhood'' (Concepts in Developmental Psychology). Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alexander"&gt;Christine Alexander, "Playing the author: children's creative writing, paracosms and the construction of family magazines." In Kate Darian-Smith, Carla Pascoe (eds.), ''Children, Childhood and Cultural Heritage''. Routledge, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrists Delmont Morrison and Shirley Morrison mention paracosms and "paracosmic fantasy" in their book ''Memories of Loss and Dreams of Perfection'', in the context of people who have suffered the death of a loved one or some other tragedy in childhood. For such people, paracosms function as a way of processing and understanding their early loss.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Delmont C. and Shirley L., ''Memories of Loss and Dreams of Perfection: Unsuccessful Childhood Grieving and Adult Creativity''. Baywood, 2005. {{ISBN|0-89503-309-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They cite [[James M. Barrie]], [[Isak Dinesen]] and [[Emily Brontë]] as examples of people who created paracosms after the deaths of family members.

Marjorie Taylor is another child development psychologist who explores paracosms as part of a study on [[imaginary friend]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Marjorie, ''Imaginary Companions and the Children Who Create Them ''. Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-514629-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Adam Gopnik]]'s essay, "Bumping Into Mr. Ravioli", he consults his sister, a child psychologist, about his three-year-old daughter's imaginary friend. He is introduced to Taylor's ideas and told that children invent paracosms as a way of orienting themselves in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Gopnik, Adam, "Bumping Into Mr. Ravioli: A Theory of Busyness, and Its Hero". In ''The Best American Magazine Writing 2003'', ed. by the American Society of Magazine Editors (Harper Perennial, 2003), p. 251. Originally appeared in the ''New Yorker'' September 30, 2002, and also found in Gopnik's collection of autobiographical essays, ''Through the Children's Gate: A Home in New York'' (Vintage Canada, 2007). {{ISBN|1-4000-7575-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, creativity scholar Michele Root-Bernstein discusses her daughter's invention of an imaginary world, one that lasted for over a decade, in the 2014 book, ''Inventing Imaginary Worlds: From Childhood Play to Adult Creativity''.&lt;ref&gt;Root-Bernstein, Michele, ''Inventing Imaginary Worlds: From Childhood Play to Adult Creativity Across the Arts and Sciences''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1-4758-0979-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paracosms are also mentioned in articles about types of childhood creativity and problem-solving. Some scholars believe paracosm play indicates high intelligence. A Michigan State University study undertaken by Root-Bernstein revealed that many [[MacArthur Fellows Program]] recipients had paracosms as children, thus engaging in what she calls worldplay. Sampled MacArthur Fellows were twice as likely to have engaged in childhood worldplay as MSU undergraduates. They were also significantly more likely than MSU students to recognize aspects of worldplay in their adult professional work.&lt;ref&gt;Root-Bernstein, M. &amp; Root-Bernstein, R. 2006. Imaginary Worldplay in Childhood and Maturity and Its Impact on Adult Creativity, ''Creativity Research Journal'', 18(4): 405-425.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, paracosm play is recognized as one of the indicators of a high level of creativity, which educators now realize is as important as intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Po Bronson and Ashley Merrin, [http://www.newsweek.com/2010/07/10/the-creativity-crisis.html The Creativity Crisis]. In ''Newsweek'', 2010-07-10, page found 2010-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the ''International Handbook on Giftedness'', Root-Bernstein writes about paracosm play in childhood as an indicator of considerable creative potential, which may "supplement objective measures of intellectual giftedness ... as well as subjective measures of superior technical talent."&lt;ref&gt;Root-Bernstein, Michele, "Imaginary Worldplay as an Indicator of Creative Giftedness". In the ''International Handbook on Giftedness'', ed. by Larissa Shavinina. Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a chapter on paracosm play in the 2013 textbook ''Children, Childhood and Cultural Heritage'', written by Christine Alexander. She sees it, along with independent writing, as attempts by children to create [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] for themselves.&lt;ref name="alexander"/&gt;

Paracosms are one of the subjects of interest to the emerging field of literary [[juvenilia]], studying the childhood writings of well-known and lesser-known authors. Joetta Harty in her essay "Imagining the Nation, Imagining an Empire: A Tour of Nineteenth-Century British Paracosms" contextualizes the paracosms of 19th-century British children, including the [[Brontë family]], [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s Gombroon and [[Hartley Coleridge]]'s Ejuxria, with then-current events. Nike Sulway in "'A Date with Barbara': Paracosms of the Self in Biographies of Barbara Newhall Follett" explores adult reaction to [[Child prodigy|children perceived as prodigies or geniuses]], focusing on how their biographies often focus on their imaginations and paracosmic creations rather than on their daily lives, citing as an example adult reactions to child author [[Barbara Newhall Follett]]. &lt;ref&gt;Nike Sulway, "'A Date with Barbara: Paracosms of the Self in Biographies of Barbara Newhall Follett." In Dallas John Baker, Donna Lee Brien and Nike Sulway, eds., ''Recovering History through Fact and Fiction: Forgotten Lives''. Cambridge Scholars, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;In ''Home and Away: The Place of the Child Writer'', ed. by David Owen and Lesley Peterson. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien]], as expressed in his novels ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'', as well as a sizable body of writings published posthumously containing fictional histories, languages and other reference material. Tolkien had been  [[Conlang|inventing languages]] since his teen years, only later imagining the people who spoke them or their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically referred to as a paracosm by Joseph P. Laycock in ''Dangerous Games:  What the Moral Panic over Role-Playing Games Says about Play, Religion, and Imagined Worlds'' (Univ. of California Press, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Carpenter, ''Tolkien: A Biography.''

[[File:PeterPan Statue Londres.jpg|thumb|Statue in Kensington Gardens]]
[[File:Michael Llewelyn Davies as Peter Pan.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael Llewelyn Davies as Peter Pan in 1906]]

The '''''Peter Pan'' statue''' is a bronze sculpture of [[J. M. Barrie]]'s character [[Peter Pan]]. It was commissioned by Barrie and made by Sir [[George Frampton]].  The original statue is displayed in [[Kensington Gardens]] in London, to the west of [[The Long Water]], close to Barrie's former home on [[Bayswater Road]].  Barrie's stories were inspired in part by the gardens: the statue is located at the place where Peter Pan lands in Barrie's book ''[[The Little White Bird]]'' after flying out of his nursery.  Six other casts made by the original artist have been erected in other locations around the world.

==Statue in Kensington==
The sculpture stands about {{convert|14|ft}} high.  It has a tall conical form, like a tree stump, topped by a young boy, approximately life size for an eight year old, wearing a nightshirt and blowing a thin musical instrument like a trumpet or flute, sometimes interpreted as [[pan pipes]].  The sides of the stump are decorated with small figures of squirrels, rabbits, mice, and fairies.  Barrie had intended the boy to be based on a photograph of [[Michael Llewelyn Davies]] wearing a Peter Pan costume, but Frampton chose another model, possibly James W. Shaw or William A. Harwood.

A completed plaster model of the work was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in May 1911.  Barrie had the original bronze erected in London on 30 April 1912, without fanfare and without permission, so that it might appear to children that the fairies had put it in place overnight.  He published a notice in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper the following day, 1 May: "There is a surprise in store for the children who go to Kensington Gardens to feed the ducks in the Serpentine this morning. Down by the little bay on the south-western side of the tail of the Serpentine they will find a May-day gift by Mr J.M. Barrie, a figure of Peter Pan blowing his pipe on the stump of a tree, with fairies and mice and squirrels all around. It is the work of Sir George Frampton, and the bronze figure of the boy who would never grow up is delightfully conceived." 

He donated the sculpture to the city of London, although some critics objected to him advertising his works by erecting a sculpture in a public park without permission.  It became a Grade II* [[listed building]] in 1970. A plaque was unveiled by [[Princess Margaret]] in 1997.

==Other casts==
Frampton made a series of small bronze reproductions of the Pan figure from 1913 to his death in 1928.  Examples were sold at [[Bonham's]] in March and November 2015, and one was sold in Scotland in 2016 for £60,000.

Frampton made six other full-size casts from the original moulds, which are situated in:
* {{Interlanguage link|Egmont Park|fr|Parc d'Egmont}}, in [[Brussels]], donated to the Belgian state by Frampton in 1924 to recognise the Anglo-Belgian friendship during the First World War; it suffered bullet damage in the Second World War, and was listed as a Belgian historical monument in 1975.
* [[Bowring Park (St. John's)|Bowring Park]], in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]], erected on 29 August 1925, as a tribute to Betty Munn, the daughter of [[John Shannon Munn]], who had died aged three on 23 February 1918 in the sinking of [[SS Florizel|SS ''Florizel'']].
*[[Sefton Park]], in [[Liverpool]], erected overnight on 16 June 1928; it was vandalised in 1990; restored, it was relocated to a position in the grounds of the [[palm house]]; it received a Grade II listing in 1985.
* [[Queens Gardens, Perth|Queens Gardens]], in [[Perth, Western Australia]], erected overnight on 10 June 1929, and donated by [[Rotary International]] to the [[Perth City Council]] to celebrate the centenary of the state of [[Western Australia]] (founded in 1829 as [[Swan River Colony]]).
* [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada; erected on 14 September 1929 by the [[College Heights Association]] in a park that became known as "Peter Pan Park" after the statue, but later renamed [[Glenn Gould Park]].
* The grounds of [[Rutgers University]], [[Camden, New Jersey]], by [[Eldridge R. Johnson]] in 1929, and located outside the Walt Whitman Arts Center.

The memorial to George Frampton in the Crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] sculpted by Edward Gillick in 1930 depicts a young child holding in his hand a miniature replica of his statue of Peter Pan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/London_City2_StPaul.html|title=City of London – 2: St. Paul's Cathedral|publisher=Church Monuments Society|access-date=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sculptures==
Other sculptors have created statues of Peter Pan, including two by [[Alistair Smart]] near the birthplace of J. M. Barrie in [[Kirriemuir]] in Scotland; [[Charles Andrew Hafner]]'s 1928 sculpture in [[Carl Schurz Park]] in New York City; [[Ivan Mitford-Barberton]]'s sculpture given to the [[Red Cross Children's Hospital]] in [[Cape Town]] in 1959; [[Cecil Thomas (sculptor)|Cecil Thomas]]'s 1965 sculpture in [[Dunedin Botanic Garden]], and [[Diarmuid Byron O'Connor]]'s 2000 sculpture at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2389">'''Presentationism''' (from Latin ''prae-esse'', ''praesens'', present) is a philosophical term used in various senses deriving from the general sense of the term ''presentation''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Presentationism |volume=22 |page=298 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] (cf. ''Manual of Psychology'', i. 57), presentations are whatever constituents or our total experience at any moment directly determine the nature of the object as it is perceived or thought of at that moment. In [[James Mark Baldwin|Baldwin]]'s ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', vol. ii., a presentation is an object in the special form under which it is cognized at any given moment of perceptual or ideational process. This, the widest definition of the term, due largely to Professor [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]], thus includes both perceptual and ideational processes. The term has, indeed, been narrowed so as to include ideation, the correlative representation being utilized for ideal presentation, but in general the wider use is preferred.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

When the mind is cognizing an object, the object presents itself to the senses or to thought in one of a number of different forms (e.g. a picture is a work of art, a saleable commodity, a representation of a house, etc.). Presentation is thus essentially a cognitive process. Hence the most important use of the term presentationism, which is defined by Ward, in ''Mind'', N.S. (1893), ii. 58, as a doctrine the gist of which is that all the elements of psychical life are primarily and ultimately cognitive elements. This use takes precedence of two others: (1) that of Hamilton, for presentative as opposed to representative theories of knowledge, and (2) that of some later writers who took it as equivalent to [[Phenomenon|phenomenon]]. Ward traces the doctrine in his sense to [[David Hume]], to whom the mind is a kind of theatre in which perceptions appear and vanish continually (see Green and Grose edition of ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;534). The main problem is as to whether psychic activity is presented or not. Ward holds that it is not presented or presentable save indirectly.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A '''record label''', or '''record company''', is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of [[Sound recording and reproduction|music recordings]] and [[music videos]]. Sometimes, a record label is also a [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishing]] company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, [[manufacturing|manufacture]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]], marketing, promotion, and enforcement of [[copyright]] for sound recordings and music videos; also conducting talent scouting and development of new artists ("artists and repertoire" or "[[A&amp;amp;R]]"); and maintains [[Recording contract|contracts]] with recording artists and their managers. The term "record label" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klein |first=Allison |url=http://howstuffworks.com/record-label1.htm |title=How Record Labels Work |website=HowStuffWorks.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music industry==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Within the mainstream [[music industry]], recording artists have traditionally been reliant upon record labels to broaden their consumer base, market their albums, and be both promoted and heard on music streaming services, radio, and television. Record labels provide [[publicist]]s, who assist performers in gaining positive media coverage, and arrange for their merchandise to be available via stores and other media outlets.

But an increasing number of artists have sought to avoid costs and gain new audiences via the Internet, often with the help of [[music video|videos]]. Combined with the decline in album sales and rapid growth in free content available online, this has changed the way the industry works dramatically since the beginning of the 21st century. It has caused record labels to seek new sources of profit, in particular via "360" deals (see below, under "new label strategies").

==Major versus independent record labels==
Record labels may be small, localized and "[[independent record label|independent]]" ("indie"), or they may be part of a large [[multinational corporation|international media group]], or somewhere in between. The [[Association of Independent Music]] (AIM) defines a 'major' as "a multinational company which (together with the companies in its group) has more than 5% of the world market(s) for the sale of records or music videos." As of 2012, there are only three labels that can be referred to as "major labels" ([[Universal Music Group]], [[Sony Music Entertainment]], and [[Warner Music Group]]). In 2014 AIM estimated that the majors had a collective global market share of some 65-70%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicindie.com/independent-music-now-growing-force-global-market/&lt;/ref&gt; 

A "[[Record label#Sublabel|sublabel]]" is a label that is part of a larger record company but trades under a different name.

==Imprint==
A label used as a trademark or brand and not a company is called an [[Imprint (trade name)|imprint]], a term used for the same concept in [[publishing]]. An imprint is sometimes marketed as being a "project", "unit", or "division" of a record label company, even though there is no legal business structure associated with the imprint.

==Independent==
{{Main|Independent record label}}
Record companies and music publishers that are not under the control of the big three are generally considered to be ''independent'' (''[[indie (music)|indie]]''), even if they are large corporations with complex structures. The term ''indie label'' is sometimes used to refer to only those independent labels that adhere to independent criteria of corporate structure and size, and some consider an indie label to be almost any label that releases non-mainstream music, regardless of its corporate structure.

Independent labels are often considered more artist-friendly. Though they may have less financial clout, indie labels typically offer larger artist royalty with 50% profit-share agreement, aka 50-50 deal, not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicians.about.com/od/musicindustrybasics/tp/indielabelessons.htm |title=Top Five Lessons Learned from Indie Record Labels |website=Musicians.about.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sublabel==
Music collectors often use the term ''sublabel'' to refer to either an imprint or a subordinate label company (such as those within a group). For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, "4th &amp; B'way" was a trademarked brand owned by [[Island Records]] Ltd. in the UK and by a subordinate branch, Island Records, Inc., in the United States. The center label on a 4th &amp; Broadway record marketed in the [[United States]] would typically bear a 4th &amp; B'way logo and would state in the fine print, "4th &amp; B'way™, an Island Records, Inc. company". Collectors discussing labels as brands would say that 4th &amp; B'way is a sublabel or imprint of just "Island" or "Island Records". Similarly, collectors who choose to treat corporations and trademarks as equivalent might say 4th &amp; B'way is an imprint and/or sublabel of both Island Records, Ltd. and that company's sublabel, Island Records, Inc. However, such definitions are complicated by the corporate [[Mergers and acquisitions|merger]]s that occurred in 1989 (when Island was sold to PolyGram) and 1998 (when PolyGram merged with Universal). Island remained registered as corporations in both the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|UK]], but control of its brands changed hands multiple times as new companies were formed, diminishing the corporation's distinction as the "parent" of any sublabels.

==Vanity labels==
{{Main|Vanity label}}
Vanity labels are labels that bear an imprint that gives the impression of an artist's ownership or control, but in fact represent a standard artist/label relationship. In such an arrangement, the artist will control nothing more than the usage of the name on the label, but may enjoy a greater say in the packaging of his or her work. An example of such a label is the Neutron label owned by [[ABC (band)|ABC]] while at [[Phonogram Inc.]] in the UK. At one point artist Lizzie Tear (under contract with ABC themselves) appeared on the imprint, but it was devoted almost entirely to ABC's offerings and is still used for their re-releases (though Phonogram owns the masters of all the work issued on the label).

However, not all labels dedicated to particular artists are completely superficial in origin. Many artists, early in their careers, create their own labels which are later bought out by a bigger company. If this is the case it can sometimes give the artist greater freedom than if they were signed directly to the big label. There are many examples of this kind of label, such as [[Nothing Records]], owned by [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]]; and Morning Records, owned by the [[Cooper Temple Clause]], who were releasing EPs for years before the company was bought by [[RCA]].

==Relationship with artists==
A label typically enters into an exclusive [[recording contract]] with an artist to market the artist's recordings in return for [[Music royalties|royalties]] on the selling price of the recordings. Contracts may extend over short or long durations, and may or may not refer to specific recordings. Established, successful artists tend to be able to renegotiate their contracts to get terms more favorable to them, but [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s much-publicized 1994–1996 feud with [[Warner Bros. Records]] provides a strong counterexample,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Melinda|title=Inside Prince's Career-Long Battle to Master His Artistic Destiny|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/cover-story/7348551/prince-battle-to-control-career-artist-rights|website=Billboard|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Roger McGuinn]]'s claim, made in July 2000 before a US Senate committee, that [[the Byrds]] never received any of the royalties they had been promised for their biggest hits, "[[Mr.&amp;nbsp;Tambourine Man]]" and "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (to Everything There Is a Season)|Turn! Turn!, Turn!]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0007/11/se.01.html | title=CNN Transcript – Special Event: Lars Ulrich, Roger McGuinn Testify Before Senate Judiciary Committee on Downloading Music on the Internet|date=11 July 2000|website=Transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contract either provides for the artist to deliver completed recordings to the label, or for the label to undertake the recording with the artist. For artists without a recording history, the label is often involved in selecting producers, [[recording studio]]s, additional musicians, and songs to be recorded, and may supervise the output of recording sessions. For established artists, a label is usually less involved in the recording process.

The relationship between record labels and artists can be a difficult one. Many artists have had albums altered or censored in some way by the labels before they are released—songs being edited, artwork or titles being changed, etc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the changes are made.  Often the record label's decisions are prudent ones from a commercial perspective, but this typically frustrates the artists who feels that their art is being diminished or misrepresented by such actions.

In the early days of the recording industry, recording labels were absolutely necessary for the success of any artist.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The first goal of any new artist or band was to get signed to a contract as soon as possible. In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, many artists were so desperate to sign a contract with a record company that they sometimes ended up signing agreements in which they sold the rights to their recordings to the record label in perpetuity. [[Entertainment law]]yers are usually employed by artists to discuss contract terms.

Through the advances of the Internet the role of labels is becoming increasingly changed, as artists are able to freely distribute their own material through web radio, peer to peer file sharing such as [[BitTorrent]], and other services, for little or no cost but with little financial return. Established artists, such as Nine Inch Nails, whose career was developed with major label backing, announced an end to their major label contracts, citing that the uncooperative nature of the recording industry with these new trends are hurting musicians, fans and the industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/news.php?newsid=4504 |title=Nine inch nails = independent |website=Sputnikmusic.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine Inch Nails later returned to working with a major label,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.spin.com/2013/08/trent-reznor-nine-inch-nails-hesitation-marks-columbia-spin-september-2013-cover-story/ |title=Trent Reznor on Nine Inch Nails' Columbia Signing: ‘I'm Not a Major Label Apologist' |website=Spin.com |date=19 August 2013 |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; admitting that they needed the international marketing and promotional reach that a major label can provide. [[Radiohead]] also cited similar motives with the end of their contract with [[EMI]] when their album ''[[In Rainbows]]'' was released as a "[[pay what you want]]" sales model as an online download, but they also returned to a label for a conventional release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.nme.com/news/radiohead/32207 |title=Radiohead sign 'conventional' record deal |website=Nme.com |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that record labels still control most access to distribution.&lt;ref&gt;

==New label strategies==
With the advancement of the computer and technology such as the Internet, leading to an increase in file sharing and [[Direct-to-Fan|direct-to-fan]] digital distribution, combined with music sales plummeting in recent years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Covert |first=Adrian |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/25/technology/itunes-music-decline/ |title=A decade of iTunes singles killed the music industry - Apr. 25, 2013 |website=Money.cnn.com |date=25 April 2013 |accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; labels and organizations have had to change their strategies and the way they work with artists. New types of deals are being made with artists called "multiple rights" or "360" deals with artists. These types of pacts give labels rights and percentages to artist's touring, merchandising, and [[Testimonial|endorsement]]s. In exchange for these rights, labels usually give higher advance payments to artists, have more patience with artist development, and pay higher percentages of CD sales. These 360 deals are most effective when the artist is established and has a loyal fan base. For that reason, labels now have to be more relaxed with the development of artists because longevity is the key to these types of pacts. Several artists such as [[Paramore]], [[Maino]], and even [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] have signed such types of deals.

A look at an actual 360 deal offered by [[Atlantic Records]] to an artist shows a variation of the structure. Atlantic's document offers a conventional cash advance to sign the artist, who would receive a royalty for sales after expenses were recouped. With the release of the artist's first album, however, the label has an option to pay an additional $200,000 in exchange for 30 percent of the net income from all touring, merchandise, endorsements, and fan-club fees. Atlantic would also have the right to approve the act's tour schedule, and the salaries of certain tour and merchandise sales employees hired by the artist. But the label also offers the artist a 30 percent cut of the label's album profits—if any—which represents an improvement from the typical industry royalty of 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leeds |first=Jeff |title=The New Deal: Band as Brand |date=11 November 2004 |publisher=Nytimes.com |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/arts/music/11leed.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnlx=1269741649-euWFoDdXtDDM3tqfY5XwQQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Industry consolidation===
In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a phase of consolidation in the record industry that led to almost all major labels being owned by a very few multinational companies. CDs still flow through a handful of sources, with the majority of the sales going through the "big three" record labels.

===Resurgence of independent labels===
In the 1990s, as a result of the widespread use of home studios, consumer recording technology, and the Internet, independent labels began to become more commonplace. Independent labels are often artist-owned (although not always), with a stated intent often being to control the quality of the artist's output. Independent labels usually do not enjoy the resources available to the "big three" and as such will often lag behind them in market shares. Often independent artists manage a return by recording for a much smaller production cost of a typical big label release. Sometimes they are able to recoup their initial advance even with much lower sales numbers.

On occasion, established artists, once their record contract has finished, move to an independent label. This often gives the combined advantage of name recognition and more control over one's music along with a larger portion of royalty profits. Artists such as [[Dolly Parton]], [[Aimee Mann]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], BKBravo (Kua and Rafi), among others, have done this. Historically, companies started in this manner have been re-absorbed into the major labels (two examples are American singer [[Frank Sinatra]]'s [[Reprise Records]], which has been owned by [[Warner Music Group]] for some time now, and musician [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&amp;M Records]], now owned by Universal Music Group). Similarly, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s Maverick Records (started by Madonna with her manager and another partner) was to come under control of Warner Music when Madonna [[divest]]ed herself of controlling shares in the company.

Some independent labels become successful enough that major record companies negotiate contracts to either distribute music for the label or in some cases, purchase the label completely.

On the [[punk rock]] scene, the [[DIY ethic]] encourages bands to self-publish and self-distribute. This approach evolved out of necessity around since the early 1980s, due to the major labels' aversion to signing the punk rock bands that spawned after the initial wave in the mid-70s. Such labels have a reputation for being fiercely uncompromising and especially unwilling to cooperate with the [[World music market|big record labels]] at all. One of the most notable and influential labels of the Do-It-Yourself attitude was [[SST Records]], created by the band [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]. No labels wanted to release their material, so they simply created their own label to release not only their own material but the material of many other influential underground bands all over the country. [[Ian MacKaye]]'s [[Dischord Records|Dischord]] is often cited as a model of success in the DIY community, having survived for over thirty years with less than twelve employees at any one time.

===Internet and digital labels===
{{Main|Netlabel}}
With the Internet now being a viable source for obtaining music, [[netlabel]]s have emerged. Depending on the ideals of the net label, music files from the artists may be downloaded free of charge or for a fee that is paid via [[PayPal]] or other online payment system. Some of these labels also offer hard copy CDs in addition to direct download.  Digital Labels are the latest version of a 'net' label. Whereas 'net' labels were started as a free site, digital labels are more competition for the major record labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suhr|first1=Cecilia|title=Understanding the Hegemonic Struggle between Mainstream Vs. Independent Forces: The Music Industry and Musicians in the Age of Social Media|journal=International Journal of Technology, Knowledge &amp; Society|date=November 2011|volume=7|pages=123–136|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=91544625&amp;site=eds-live.|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source labels===
{{Main|Open-source record label}}
The new century brought the phenomenon of ''open-source'' or ''open-content'' record label. These are inspired by the [[free software]] and [[open source]] movements and the success of [[Linux|GNU/Linux]].

===Publishers as labels===
In the mid-2000s, some music publishing companies began undertaking the work traditionally done by labels. The publisher Sony/ATV Music, for example, leveraged its connections within the Sony family to produce, record, distribute, and promote [[Elliott Yamin]]'s debut album under a dormant Sony-owned imprint, rather than waiting for a deal with a proper label.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|magazine=Billboard|title=Publisher = Label? – Sony/ATV Music releases; Elliott Yamin's record|date=31 March 2007|last=Butler|first=Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major labels==
{{Timeline of Major Record Labels}}

Record labels are often under the control of a corporate umbrella organization called a "music [[Corporate group|group]]". A music group is typically owned by an international [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] "[[holding company]]", which often has non-music divisions as well. A music group controls and consists of music publishing companies, record (sound recording) manufacturers, record distributors, and record labels. Record companies (manufacturers, distributors, and labels) may also constitute a "record group" which is, in turn, controlled by a music group. The constituent companies in a music group or record group are sometimes marketed as being "divisions" of the group.

{{Anchor|Major labels 1988–1999 (Big Six)}}From 1988 to 1999, there were six major record labels, known as the Big Six:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
# [[Warner Music Group]]
# [[EMI]]
# [[Sony Music]] (known as CBS Records until January 1991)
# [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]
# [[Universal Music Group]]
# [[PolyGram]]

{{Anchor|Major labels 1999–2004 (Big Five)}}PolyGram was merged into UMG in 1999, leaving the rest to be known as the Big Five.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

{{Anchor|Major labels 2004–2012 (Big Four)}}In 2004, Sony and BMG agreed to a joint venture to create the [[Sony BMG]] label (which would be renamed Sony Music Entertainment after a 2008 merger). In 2007, the four remaining companies—known as the Big Four—controlled about 70% of the [[world music market]], and about 80% of the United States music market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copynot.org/Pages/The%20big%20four%20Record%20Companies.html |title=Copyright Law, Treaties and Advice |publisher=Copynot.org |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/fr/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328020555/https://www.apple.com/fr/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/ |date=28 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Big Three|Big 3|big three|3|Major labels since 2012|Major labels after collapse of EMI|Major labels since 2012 (Big Three)}}In 2012, the major divisions of [[EMI]] were sold off separately by owner [[Citigroup]]: most of EMI's recorded music division was absorbed into UMG; EMI Music Publishing was absorbed into Sony/ATV Music Publishing; finally, EMI's [[Parlophone]] and [[Virgin Classics]] labels were absorbed into Warner Music Group in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua R.

[[File:Redeyephotographynetwork.jpg|thumb|The Redeye Logo]]'''Redeye, The Photography Network''' is a UK-based [[photography]] network with around 7000 subscribers, the majority of whom are full- or part-time photographers, artists and other creatives. Based in [[Manchester]], it works with a large number of partner organisations such as galleries, universities and other photographic and arts organisations across the country to deliver its events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.look2011.co.uk/captureliverpool/&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a leader among a strengthening body of nationally significant photography-focused organisations that address career development for practitioners".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/view.cfm?issue=134&amp;id=3132 Focus on Photography - Coming into focus]", Arts Professional. ''Requires registration.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
Redeye was created in 1998 by a group of photographers who met in [[Manchester]] to discuss research into what the region's practitioners needed in regard to North West Arts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redeye.org.uk/redeye/about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.a-n.co.uk/arts_organisers/jobs_and_opps/employer_index/single/36505&lt;/ref&gt; With many facilities in demand such as darkrooms, exhibition spaces and help with legal matters, they decided that most photographers needed an environment in which they could network and learn from each other. By the beginning of 1999 these meetings had become regular. Some of the group, chaired by Len Grant, volunteered to help run the organisation. The award-winning&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.connectinghistories.org.uk/other%20collections/paul_hill.asp Paul Hill]", Connecting History (Birmingham City Archives ''et al.'').&lt;/ref&gt; British photographer Paul Hill gave the first of six talks that launched Redeye events in October 1999. The first paid member of staff was appointed in 2001, and a co-ordinator was selected the next year.

== Non-profit status ==

Redeye receives funding support from the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council of England]]. In March 2011 it received funding for the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/rfo/redeye-photography-network/ Redeye Photography Network]", Arts Council England.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has project funding from ACE, RALP, CIDS, AGMA and a number of other organisations.

In line with its manifesto, Redeye organises various events every year including talks each year by established photographers and workshops running at beginner, intermediate and advanced levels.

=== National Photography Symposium ===
The National Photography Symposium was established by Redeye in 2009. It has been described as "one of the must attend events of the photographic year” by Pete Jenkins, NUJ.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Jackson, "[http://www.artinliverpool.com/?p=15502 The National Photography Symposium 2011 – Liverpool 13-15 May]", Art in Liverpool, 14 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is a weekend of talks, workshops and events held annually, and covers every type of photography from fine art, photojournalism, community, editorial and commercial to museums, galleries, higher education and libraries. The 2009 symposium started with a punchy keynote address by Francis Hodgson of the ''Financial Times.''&lt;ref&gt;Diane Smyth, "[http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/blog-post/1651311/national-photography-symposium-business National Photography Symposium open for business]", ''British Journal of Photography,'' 20 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Makonde elephant.jpg|thumb|A Makonde elephant shetani]]
'''Shetani''' (the word is both singular and plural in English, the plural in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] is ''mashetani'') are spirits of East African [[African mythology|mythology and popular belief]].  Mostly malevolent, and found in many different forms and different types with different powers, shetani are a popular subject of carved artwork, especially by the [[Makonde people]] of [[Tanzania]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Kenya]].  Physically, shetani of various types appear as distorted human and animal figures.

There is a contemporary East African shetani cult, and reports of sightings of individual shetani are cyclical, with [[Popo Bawa]] panics having occurred in 1995 in [[Zanzibar]]&lt;ref&gt;"Today the cult of the shetani (meaning a spirit or spirits, the word is singular or plural) is still going strong in Zanzibar and Pemba – a dark undercurrent unseen and unknown by the majority of visitors." ''Zanzibar: The Bradt Travel Guide'', fifth edition, 2006  "The Shetani Of Zanzibar" Gemma Pitcher http://www.zanzibar-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1847&lt;/ref&gt; and 2007 in [[Dar es Salaam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6383833.stm |title= Sex attacks blamed on bat demon |publisher= [[BBC News]] |date=2007-02-21 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influential [[Makonde art]]ist [[George Lilanga]] (1934–2005) gained world renown with his shetani sculptures and paintings. Samaki Likankoa, master carver in Tanzania was the foremost originator of the shetani style in the early 1950s. Mohamed Peera, an Indian art curator was a major patron and influence to many makonde carvers such as Samaki, and played a decisive role in the abstract shetani makonde movement from the early 1950s to 1970s.

==Etymology==

A Swahili word used in various [[East Africa]]n nations to refer to mostly malevolent native pre-Islamic spirits, ''shetani'' (pl. ''mashetani''), is a borrowing from the [[Arabic]], ''[[Shaitan]]'', meaning ''devil'', or, more specifically, ''adversary''.  The word is [[cognate]] with the English word ''[[Satan]]'' which comes ultimately from the same [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] root.&lt;ref&gt;''A host of devils: the history and context of the making of Makonde spirit sculpture,'' Zachary Kingdon, p 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and types==

There are many types of shetani, with various attributes, and they take on many forms; abstract, animal, [[anthropomorphic]] and combinations thereof.  Whether one-legged or one-armed, [[cyclops|cyclopic]] or with exaggerated orifices and appendages, the essential nature of the shetani is a distorted, [[asymmetrical]] human figure, a common world archetype,&lt;ref&gt;''A host of devils: the history and context of the making of Makonde spirit sculpture,'' Zachary Kingdon, p 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical carving, done in [[ebony]] or [[African blackwood]], might have "one eye, a toothless, open mouth and a body which was bent over backwards with its head facing the wrong way."&lt;ref&gt;''A host of devils: the history and context of the making of Makonde spirit sculpture,'' Zachary Kingdon, p 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various classes of shetani.  Examples include the dangerous ''ukunduka'', which feed through sexual intercourse, and the chameleon shetani, a carnivore with exaggerated habits of the lizard, or the harmless medicinal ''shuluwele'' which gathers herbs for sorcerers.&lt;ref&gt;''Indian Ocean newsletter,'' volumes 5-8, University of Western Australia, Centre for South and Southeast Asian Studies, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some spirits, like the "exceptionally evil"&lt;ref&gt;http://everything2.com/title/Popo+Bawa&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popo Bawa]] ('bat-wing'), associated with "dirt and violent [[sodomy]]" and the smell of burnt [[sulphur]],&lt;ref&gt;''Wind, Life, Health: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives'', Elisabeth Hsu, Chris Low, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; are individuals with horrifying living reputations.&lt;ref&gt;''Zanzibar'', Chris McIntyre, Susan McIntyre, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the BBC in 2001, "Many Zanzibaris are now refusing to sleep in their houses as they believe it only preys on people in the comfort of their own beds. . . . [P]eople believe that it sodomises its victims, most of whom are men."&lt;ref&gt;"Sex-mad 'ghost' scares Zanzibaris", Ally Saleh, Thursday, 19 July 2001, 12:32 GMT 13:32 UK, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1446733.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shetani cult==

Belief in shetani is a contemporary continuation of pre-Islamic belief.  In addition to the Makonde who carry on a tradition of sculpture, other peoples, such as the [[Segeju]] of Tanzania, who recognize eight or ten tribes of spirits, with each individual having its own name and personality, carry on belief in shetani possession and exorcism.&lt;ref&gt;''Spirit Mediumship and Society in Africa'', John Beattie, John Middleton, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Zanzibar Bradt Travel Guide'', "There is no real way, say the locals, of protecting yourself from the possibility of being haunted or attacked by a shetani. The best thing is simply to keep out of their way and try to make sure they keep out of yours – for example by hanging a piece of paper, inscribed with special Arabic verses, from the ceiling of the house. Almost every home or shop in Zanzibar has one of these brown, mottled scraps, attached to a roof beam by a piece of cotton."&lt;ref&gt;''Zanzibar: The Bradt Travel Guide'', fifth edition, 2006  "The Shetani Of Zanzibar" Gemma Pitcher http://www.zanzibar-travel-guide.com/bradt_guide.asp?bradt=1847&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art and popular culture==

The depiction of shetani continues in the flourishing Makonde sculpture trade, varying from "airport art" knockoffs&lt;ref&gt;"The Authenticity of Makonde Art: A Collector Replies", Leon V. Hirsch, ''African Arts'', Vol. 26, No. 1 (Jan., 1993), p. 10 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3337104&lt;/ref&gt; to fine art found in such venues as the Hamburg Mawingu Collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.makonde.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Lilanga===

{{Main|George Lilanga}}

[[Image:George Lilanga insieme all'opera Banana guarda ho l'acquolina in bocca.jpg|thumb|right|George Lilanga with ''We banana anangalia ulimi kiangu unawasha'' ("Banana look to me, I have the mouth-watering")]]
George Lilanga (1934–2005) was a Tanzanian sculptor and artist of the Makonde tribe who lived in [[Dar es Salaam]]. His work was exhibited in international expositions of African contemporaries including Africa Remix in Düsseldorf, Paris, London and Tokyo.

In the 1970s, Lilanga participated in a collective exhibition of African artists in Washington D.C. Of the 280 works presented, about 100 were by Lilanga. It was on this occasion that he was compared with [[Jean Dubuffet]]. Lilanga was considered to have had an influence on the young American graffiti artists; [[Keith Haring]] said in an interview that he had been influenced by Lilanga's art. Lilanga began a long series of exhibitions.  His works had increasing success in Africa, Europe, the US, India and Japan. In the 1980s, he dedicated himself almost exclusively to painting. His shetani were represented two-dimensionally on [[Masonite]] and, later, on Faesite.

The Hamburg Mawingu Collection posthumously published a systematically and thematically complete collection of Lilanga's work, and his work forms the backbone of their collection.

===''Into the Out Of''===

{{Main|Into the Out Of}}

In [[Alan Dean Foster]]'s 1986 horror/fantasy novel, ''Into the Out Of'', elders of the [[Maasai people]] become aware that from the south of them in the [[Ruaha National Park|Ruaha wilderness]] of Tanzania a global crisis is approaching. Malevolent shetani, which originate from a dimensional portal known to the Maasai as the “Out Of” (because all things, such as humans, animals and plants, originally came "out of" it), are finding their way into this world.  In addition to general sabotage, the shetani are fomenting trouble between the superpowers, intent on inciting war.  If not prevented, the barriers between the two dimensions will be permanently breached and uncountable hordes of shetani will overrun the world, enslaving the few humans they do not exterminate.

[[File:Strawberry shortcake.jpg|right|thumb|Sweet foods, such as this strawberry [[shortcake]], are often eaten for [[dessert]].]]

'''Sweetness''' is a [[basic taste]] most commonly [[Perception|perceived]] when [[eating]] [[food]]s rich in [[sugar]]s. Sweet tastes are regarded as a [[pleasure|pleasurable]] experience, except perhaps in excess.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In addition to sugars like [[sucrose]], many other [[chemical compound]]s are sweet, including [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, and [[sugar alcohol]]s. Some are sweet at very low concentrations, allowing their use as non-caloric [[sugar substitute]]s. Such [[Sugar substitute|non-sugar sweeteners]] include [[saccharin]] and [[aspartame]]. Other compounds, such as [[miraculin]], may alter perception of sweetness itself.

The [[chemoreceptor|chemosensory]] basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century. One theoretical model of sweetness is the [[#MPA theory of sweetness|multipoint attachment theory]], which involves multiple binding sites between a sweetness receptor and a sweet substance.

Studies indicate that responsiveness to sugars and sweetness has very ancient evolutionary beginnings, being manifest as [[chemotaxis]] even in [[Motility|motile]] bacteria such as ''E. coli''.&lt;ref&gt;Blass, E.M. ''Opioids, sweets and a mechanism for positive affect: Broad motivational implications.'' {{harv|Dobbing|1987|pp=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newborn human infants also demonstrate preferences for high sugar concentrations and prefer solutions that are sweeter than [[lactose]], the sugar found in breast milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0034906 | last1 = Desor | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Maller | first2 = O. | last3 = Turner | first3 = R.E. | year = 1973 | title = Taste acceptance of sugars by human infants | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 84 | issue = 3| pages = 496–501 | pmid = 4745817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2 June 1983 |last=Schiffman |first=Susan S.|last2=Schiffman|first2=Susan S. |title=Taste and smell in disease (Second of two parts) |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=308 |issue=22 |pages=1337–43 |pmid=6341845 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198306023082207 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweetness appears to have the highest taste recognition threshold, being detectable at around 1 part in 200 of sucrose in solution. By comparison, [[Taste#Bitterness|bitterness]] appears to have the lowest detection threshold, at about 1 part in 2 million for quinine in solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McAleer, N. |title=The Body Almanac: Mind-boggling facts about today's human body and high-tech medicine |publisher=Doubleday  |location=New York |year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the natural settings that human primate ancestors evolved in, sweetness intensity should indicate [[energy density]], while bitterness tends to indicate [[toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altman | first1 = S. | year = 1989 | title = The monkey and the fig: A Socratic dialogue on evolutionary themes | journal = American Scientist | volume = 77 | pages = 256–263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Johns, T. |title=With Bitter Herbs They Shall Eat It: Chemical ecology and the origins of human diet and medicine |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Logue, A.W. |title=The Psychology of Eating and Drinking  |publisher=W.H.

==Examples of sweet substances==
{{further|Sugar substitute}}

A great diversity of [[chemical compound]]s, such as [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s are sweet. Among common biological substances, all of the simple [[carbohydrate]]s are sweet to at least some degree. [[Sucrose]] (table sugar) is the prototypical example of a sweet substance. Sucrose in solution has a sweetness perception rating of 1, and other substances are rated relative to this.&lt;ref name=Guyton91&gt;{{cite book |author=Guyton, Arthur C. |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |publisher=W.B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1991 |edition=8th }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, another sugar, [[fructose]], is somewhat sweeter, being rated at 1.7 times the sweetness of sucrose.&lt;ref name=Guyton91/&gt;  Some of the [[amino acid]]s are mildly sweet: [[alanine]], [[glycine]], and [[serine]] are the sweetest. Some other amino acids are perceived as both sweet and bitter.

A number of plant species produce [[glycosides]] that are sweet at concentrations much lower than [[sugar]].  The most well-known example is [[glycyrrhizin]], the sweet component of [[licorice]] root, which is about 30 times sweeter than sucrose.  Another commercially important example is [[stevioside]], from the [[South America]]n shrub ''[[Stevia]] rebaudiana''.  It is roughly 250 times sweeter than sucrose. Another class of potent natural sweeteners are the sweet proteins such as [[thaumatin]], found in the [[West Africa]]n [[katemfe]] fruit.  Hen egg [[lysozyme]], an [[antibiotic]] protein found in [[chicken egg]]s, is also sweet.

Even some [[inorganic compound]]s are sweet, including [[beryllium chloride]] and [[Lead(II) acetate]]. The latter may have contributed to [[lead poisoning]] among the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] aristocracy: the Roman delicacy ''sapa'' was prepared by boiling soured [[wine]] (containing [[acetic acid]]) in lead pots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Couper RTL. |title=The Severe Gout of Emperor Charles V |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2006 |volume=355 |issue=18 |pages=1935–36 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc062352 |pmid=17079773 |last2=Fernandez |first2=P. L. |last3=Alonso |first3=P. L. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of synthetic organic compounds are known to be sweet. The number of these that are legally permitted as food additives is, however, much smaller. For example, [[chloroform]], [[nitrobenzene]], and [[Ethylene glycol]] are sweet, but also toxic. {{As of|2005}}, seven artificial sweeteners are in widespread use: [[saccharin]], [[cyclamate]], [[aspartame]], [[acesulfame potassium]], [[sucralose]], [[alitame]], and [[neotame]].

A few substances alter the way sweet taste is perceived.  One class of these inhibits the perception of sweet tastes, whether from sugars or from highly potent sweeteners. Commercially, the most important of these is [[lactisole]],&lt;ref name="Kinghorn-book3"&gt;Kinghorn, A.D. and Compadre, C.M.

It is used in some [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jellies]] and other fruit preserves to bring out their fruit flavors by suppressing their otherwise strong sweetness.

Two natural products have been documented to have similar sweetness-inhibiting properties: [[gymnemic acid]], extracted from the leaves of the [[India]]n vine ''[[Gymnema sylvestre]]'' and [[ziziphin]], from the leaves of the Chinese [[jujube]] (''Ziziphus jujuba'').&lt;ref name="crfsn-32-231"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10408399209527598 |author=Kurihara Y |title=Characteristics of antisweet substances, sweet proteins, and sweetness-inducing proteins |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=231–52 |year=1992 |pmid=1418601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gymnemic acid has been widely promoted within [[herbal medicine]] as a treatment for sugar cravings and [[diabetes mellitus]].

Once the tongue has been exposed to either of these proteins, sourness is perceived as sweetness for up to an hour afterwards.  While curculin has some innate sweet taste of its own, miraculin is by itself quite tasteless.

==The sweetness receptor==
[[File:Gray1018.png|right|thumb|Sweetness is perceived by the taste buds.]]
Despite the wide variety of chemical substances known to be sweet, and knowledge that the ability to perceive sweet taste must reside in [[taste bud]]s on the [[tongue]], the biomolecular mechanism of sweet taste was sufficiently elusive that as recently as the 1990s, there was some doubt whether any single "sweetness receptor" actually exists.

The breakthrough for the present understanding of sweetness occurred in 2001, when experiments with [[laboratory mice]] showed that mice possessing different versions of the [[gene]] T1R3 prefer sweet foods to different extents. Subsequent research has shown that the [[TAS1R3|T1R3 protein]] forms a complex with a related protein, called [[TAS1R2|T1R2]], to form a [[G-protein coupled receptor]] that is the sweetness receptor in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Li XD, Staszewski L, Xu H, Durick K, Zoller M, Adler E | title=Human receptors for sweet and umami taste  | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | year=2002 | volume=99 | pages=4692–6 | doi=10.1073/pnas.072090199 | pmid=11917125 | issue=7 | pmc=123709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human studies have shown that sweet taste receptors are not only found in tongue, but also in the lining of gastrointestinal tract as well as nasal epithelium, pancreatic islet cells, sperm and testes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kohno|first=Daisuke|date=2017-04-04|title=Sweet taste receptor in the hypothalamus: a potential new player in glucose sensing in the hypothalamus|journal=The Journal of Physiological Sciences|volume=67|issue=4|pages=459–465|doi=10.1007/s12576-017-0535-y|pmid=28378265|issn=1880-6546}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that the presence of sweet taste receptors in the GI tract controls the feeling of hunger and satiety.

Another research has shown that the threshold of sweet taste perception is in direct correlation with the time of day. This is believed to be the consequence of oscillating leptin levels in blood that may impact the overall sweetness of food. Scientists hypothesize that this is an evolutionary relict of diurnal animals like humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=Y.|last2=Sanematsu|first2=K.|last3=Ohta|first3=R.|last4=Shirosaki|first4=S.|last5=Koyano|first5=K.|last6=Nonaka|first6=K.|last7=Shigemura|first7=N.|last8=Ninomiya|first8=Y.|date=2008-07-15|title=Diurnal Variation of Human Sweet Taste Recognition Thresholds Is Correlated With Plasma Leptin Levels|journal=Diabetes|volume=57|issue=10|pages=2661–2665|doi=10.2337/db07-1103|pmid=18633111|pmc=2551675|issn=0012-1797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweetness perception may differ between species significantly.  For example, even amongst the [[primate]]s sweetness is quite variable. [[New World monkey]]s do not find [[aspartame]] sweet, while [[Old World monkey]]s and [[ape]]s (including humans) all do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/chemse/20.5.573 | last1 = Nofre | first1 = C. | last2 = Tinti | first2 = J.

The ability to taste sweetness often atrophies genetically in species of carnivores who do not eat sweet foods like fruits, including [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[spotted hyena]]s and [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/carnivores-taste-sweet-120312.htm|title=RebelMouse vs. WordPress VIP|date=10 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=2 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525124426/http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/carnivores-taste-sweet-120312.htm|archivedate=25 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweet receptor pathway==
To depolarize the cell, and ultimately generate a response, the body uses different cells in the taste bud that each express a receptor for the perception of sweet, sour, salty, bitter or [[umami]]. Downstream of the [[taste receptor]], the taste cells for sweet, bitter and umami share the same intracellular signalling pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaudhari|first1=N|last2=Roper|first2=SD|title=The cell biology of taste.|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=9 August 2010|volume=190|issue=3|pages=285–96|pmid=20696704|doi=10.1083/jcb.201003144|pmc=2922655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incoming sweet molecules bind to their receptors, which causes a conformational change in the molecule. This change activates the G-protein, gustducin, which in turn activates [[PLCB2|phospholipase C]] to generate inositol trisphosphate ([[Inositol trisphosphate|IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), this subsequently opens the IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor and induces calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. This increase in intracellular calcium activates the [[TRPM5]] channel and induces cellular [[depolarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Philippaert|first1=Koenraad|last2=Pironet|first2=Andy|last3=Mesuere|first3=Margot|last4=Sones|first4=William|last5=Vermeiren|first5=Laura|last6=Kerselaers|first6=Sara|last7=Pinto|first7=Sílvia|last8=Segal|first8=Andrei|last9=Antoine|first9=Nancy|last10=Gysemans|first10=Conny|last11=Laureys|first11=Jos|last12=Lemaire|first12=Katleen|last13=Gilon|first13=Patrick|last14=Cuypers|first14=Eva|last15=Tytgat|first15=Jan|last16=Mathieu|first16=Chantal|last17=Schuit|first17=Frans|last18=Rorsman|first18=Patrik|last19=Talavera|first19=Karel|last20=Voets|first20=Thomas|last21=Vennekens|first21=Rudi|title=Steviol glycosides enhance pancreatic beta-cell function and taste sensation by potentiation of TRPM5 channel activity|journal=Nature Communications|date=31 March 2017|volume=8|pages=14733|doi=10.1038/ncomms14733|pmid=28361903|pmc=5380970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=YA|last2=Roper|first2=SD|title=Intracellular Ca(2+) and TRPM5-mediated membrane depolarization produce ATP secretion from taste receptor cells.|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=1 July 2010|volume=588|issue=Pt 13|pages=2343–50|pmid=20498227|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2010.191106|pmc=2915511}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] release channel [[CALHM1]] gets activated by the depolarization and releases ATP neurotransmitter which activates the afferent [[neuron]]s innervating the taste bud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taruno|first1=A|last2=Vingtdeux|first2=V|last3=Ohmoto|first3=M|last4=Ma|first4=Z|last5=Dvoryanchikov|first5=G|last6=Li|first6=A|last7=Adrien|first7=L|last8=Zhao|first8=H|last9=Leung|first9=S|last10=Abernethy|first10=M|last11=Koppel|first11=J|last12=Davies|first12=P|last13=Civan|first13=MM|last14=Chaudhari|first14=N|last15=Matsumoto|first15=I|last16=Hellekant|first16=G|last17=Tordoff|first17=MG|last18=Marambaud|first18=P|last19=Foskett|first19=JK|title=CALHM1 ion channel mediates purinergic neurotransmission of sweet, bitter and umami tastes.|journal=Nature|date=14 March 2013|volume=495|issue=7440|pages=223–6|pmid=23467090|doi=10.1038/nature11906|pmc=3600154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=Z|last2=Siebert|first2=AP|last3=Cheung|first3=KH|last4=Lee|first4=RJ|last5=Johnson|first5=B|last6=Cohen|first6=AS|last7=Vingtdeux|first7=V|last8=Marambaud|first8=P|last9=Foskett|first9=JK|title=Calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) is the pore-forming subunit of an ion channel that mediates extracellular Ca2+ regulation of neuronal excitability.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=10 July 2012|volume=109|issue=28|pages=E1963–71|pmid=22711817|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204023109|pmc=3396471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognition==
The [[color]] of food can affect sweetness perception. Adding more red color to a drink increases its perceived sweetness.  In a study darker colored solutions were rated 2–10% higher than lighter ones despite having 1% less sucrose concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = J. | last2 = Clydesdale | first2 = F. | year = 1982 | title = Perceived sweetness and redness in colored sucrose solutions | journal = Journal of Food Science | volume = 47 | pages = 747–752 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2621.1982.tb12706.x | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of color is believed to be due to cognitive expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shankar | first1 = MU | last2 = Levitan | first2 = CA | last3 = Spence | first3 = C. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2010 | title = Grape expectations: the role of cognitive influences in color-flavor interactions | journal = Conscious Cogn. | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 380–90 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2009.08.008 | pmid = 19828330 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some odors smell sweet and memory confuses whether sweetness was tasted or smelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stevenson | first1 = RJ | last2 = Oaten | first2 = MJ. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 2010 | title = Sweet odours and sweet tastes are conflated in memory | journal = Acta Psychol (Amst). | volume = 134 | issue = 1| pages = 105–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.actpsy.2010.01.001 | pmid = 20097323 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical theories==
[[File:Lugduname.svg|left|thumb|[[Lugduname]] is the sweetest chemical known.]]
The development of [[organic chemistry]] in the 19th century introduced many new chemical compounds and the means to determine their [[molecular structure]]s.  Early organic chemists tasted many of their products, either intentionally (as a means of characterization) or accidentally (due to poor laboratory [[hygiene]]).  One of the first attempts to draw systematic correlations between molecules' structures and their tastes was made by a German chemist, Georg Cohn, in 1914.  He hypothesized that to evoke a certain taste, a molecule must contain some structural motif (called a ''sapophore'') that produces that taste. With regard to sweetness, he noted that molecules containing multiple [[hydroxyl]] groups and those containing [[chlorine]] atoms are often sweet, and that among a series of structurally similar compounds, those with smaller [[molecular weight]]s were often sweeter than the larger compounds.

In 1919, Oertly and Myers proposed a more elaborate theory based on a then-current theory of [[color]] in synthetic [[dye]]s.  They hypothesized that to be sweet, a compound must contain one each of two classes of structural motif, a ''glucophore'' and an ''auxogluc''.  Based on those compounds known to be sweet at the time, they proposed a list of six candidate glucophores and nine auxoglucs.

From these beginnings in the early 20th century, the theory of sweetness enjoyed little further academic attention until 1963, when [[Robert Shallenberger]] and [[Terry Acree]] proposed the AH-B theory of sweetness.  Simply put, they proposed that to be sweet, a compound must contain a [[hydrogen bond]] [[Electron donor|donor]] (AH) and a [[Lewis base]] (B) separated by about 0.3 [[nanometre]]s.  According to this theory, the AH-B unit of a sweetener binds with a corresponding AH-B unit on the biological sweetness receptor to produce the sensation of sweetness.

B-X theory proposed by [[Lemont Kier]] in 1972.  While previous researchers had noted that among some groups of compounds, there seemed to be a correlation between [[hydrophobicity]] and sweetness, this theory formalized these observations by proposing that to be sweet, a compound must have a third binding site (labeled X) that could interact with a hydrophobic site on the sweetness receptor via [[London dispersion force]]s.  Later researchers have statistically analyzed the distances between the presumed AH, B, and X sites in several families of sweet substances to estimate the distances between these interaction sites on the sweetness receptor.

==MPA theory==
The most elaborate theory of sweetness to date is the multipoint attachment theory (MPA) proposed by [[Jean-Marie Tinti]] and [[Claude Nofre]] in 1991.  This theory involves a total of eight interaction sites between a sweetener and the sweetness receptor, although not all sweeteners interact with all eight sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2008|title=Transdisciplinary Perspectives on Sweetness|journal=Chemosensory Perception|volume=1|issue=1|pages=48–57|doi=10.1007/s12078-007-9003-z|pmid=|author=John E. Hayes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model has successfully directed efforts aimed at finding highly potent sweeteners, including the most potent family of sweeteners known to date, the [[guanidine]] sweeteners.  The most potent of these, [[lugduname]], is about 225,000 times sweeter than sucrose.

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}

'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Some variation in values is not uncommon between various studies. Such variations may arise from a range of methodological variables, from sampling to analysis and interpretation. Indeed, the taste index of 1, assigned to reference substances such as sucrose (for sweetness), hydrochloric acid (for sourness), quinine (for bitterness), and sodium chloride (for saltiness), is itself arbitrary for practical purposes.&lt;ref name=Guyton&amp;Hall2006/&gt;

Some values, such as those for maltose and glucose, vary little. Others, such as aspartame and sodium saccharin, have much larger variation. Regardless of variation, the perceived intensity of substances relative to each reference substance remains consistent for taste ranking purposes. The indices table for McLaughlin &amp; Margolskee (1994) for example,&lt;ref name="McLaughlin&amp;Margolskee"/&gt; is essentially the same as that of Svrivastava &amp; Rastogi (2003),&lt;ref name=Svrivastava&amp;Rastogi2003/&gt; Guyton &amp; Hall (2006),&lt;ref name=Guyton&amp;Hall2006/&gt; and Joesten ''et al.'' (2007).&lt;ref name=JoestenEal2007/&gt; The rankings are all the same, with any differences, where they exist, being in the values assigned from the studies from which they are derived.

'''Tenebrism''', from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{wiktang|tenebroso}}'' ("dark, gloomy, mysterious"), also occasionally called '''dramatic illumination''', is a style of [[painting]] using profoundly pronounced [[chiaroscuro]], where there are violent contrasts of [[light]] and [[Darkness|dark]], and where darkness becomes a dominating feature of the image. The technique was developed to add drama to an image through a [[Spotlight (theatre lighting)|spotlight]] effect,&lt;ref name="Fichner-Rathus2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lois Fichner-Rathus|title=Foundations of Art and Design: An Enhanced Media Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hfoZ8mgKBQC&amp;pg=PT90|date=January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-111-77145-6|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was popular during the [[Baroque painting|Baroque]] period of painting.  Tenebrism is used only to obtain a dramatic impact while chiaroscuro is a broader term, also covering the use of less extreme contrasts of light to enhance the illusion of three-dimensionality.

The term is somewhat vague, and tends to be avoided by modern [[art historian]]s.
==Baroque==
[[File:Michelangelo Merisi, called Caravaggio - Saint John the Baptist in the Wilderness - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist]]'' (John in the Wilderness), by [[Caravaggio]], 1604, in the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] ]]
The artist [[Caravaggio]] is generally credited with the invention of the style, although this technique was used much earlier by various artists, such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Tintoretto]], and [[El Greco]]. The term is usually applied to artists from the seventeenth century onward. [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], one of the few women artists of the Baroque and a follower of Caravaggio, was an outstanding exponent of tenebrism.&lt;ref name="Buser2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Buser|title=Experiencing Art Around Us|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m8yZK0QulMIC&amp;pg=PA89|year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-534-64114-8|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Greco painted three versions of a composition with a boy, a man, and a monkey grouped in darkness around a single flame. Among the most well-known tenebrist artists are: Italian and Dutch followers (the [[Utrecht School]]) of Caravaggio, [[Francisco Ribalta]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], and their Spanish followers.

[[File:Adam de Coster - A Man Singing by Candlelight.jpg|thumb|250px|''A Man Singing by Candlelight'', by [[Adam de Coster]]. 1625-1635]]
Tenebrism is most often applied to seventeenth-century Spanish painters. It is sometimes applied to other seventeenth-century painters in what has been called the "candlelight tradition".  These include [[Georges de La Tour]], who painted many images lit by a single candle, [[Trophime Bigot]], [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], and [[Rembrandt]].  In Flanders [[Adam de Coster]] was recognized as a leading tenebrist who excelled in scenes in which a single candle has its light blocked by an object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2008/old-master-paintings-n08453/lot.58.html Notes on Adam de Coster] at Sotheby's&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dutch artist [[Godfried Schalcken]] painted many candle-lit scenes. The northern painters (but not always  Rembrandt) often achieved a mood of stillness and tranquility through their extreme lighting, rather the reverse of the impression that Spanish painters intended.  They are typically as interested in the very dimly-lit areas of the painting as the spot-lit ones, and their light diffuses gently across much of the picture area.  

The term is not often used of [[Adam Elsheimer]], although he was an important innovator in painting night-scenes with a few lighted areas. His dark areas are always full of detail and interest.

==Later development==
Later, similar compositions were painted by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] and other artists of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Movement]], but the term is rarely used to characterize their work in general.&lt;ref name="Gómez2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Policarp Hortolà i Gómez|title=The aesthetics of haemotaphonomy : stylistic parallels between a science and literature and the visual arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bILXXA6tSpcC&amp;pg=PA38|date=August 2012|publisher=Editorial Club Universitario|isbn=978-84-9948-991-9|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">[[File:The Candle is Lighted - We Can Not Blow it Out - NPG mw116101.jpg|thumb|''The Candle is Lighted, We Can Not Blow it Out'', c. 1683]]
'''The Candle is Lighted, We Can Not Blow it Out''' refers to a series of engravings featuring a set of Protestant reformers seated around a candle on a table. The central figure is [[Martin Luther]], surrounded by both contemporary and historical Protestant reformers. Opposite him is a group of Catholics trying to blow the candle out. Often the first part of the text is pointing towards the bible, on which the light of the candle is shining, and the second part of the text is somewhat hidden under the puffs of breath coming from the Catholic objectors. Sometimes the candle is labelled "Evangelarium" or ''Gospels''.

Little is known of the origins of the text, but many assume the popularity of the scene in English means it was a 17th-century English invention. Luther with his bible translations and the other reformers through their questions regarding [[papal bull]]s and so forth have shed light on the bible, but they must protect it from the Catholics (the bull represents the papal bulls) who would wish to plunge it into darkness. Sometimes the text has the footnote ''[[Matthew 6]]''.

A German,&lt;ref&gt;[[:c:File:Martin Luther and Reformers OU HTFC PCF39.jpg|''Das licht ist aan den leuchter gestelt'']] from [[Hertford College, Oxford]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch,&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/59413 ''t Licht is op den kandelaer gestelt] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=35268&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=1891,0224.3&amp;page=1 1692 earthenware tin-glazed plate] in the [[British Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin&lt;ref&gt;[[:c:File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich - Effigies praecipuorum illustrium atque praestantium aliquot theologorum - 000008283 cropped.jpg|''lucerna candelabro imposita est'']] from Swiss Library in Zurich&lt;/ref&gt; inscription is known.

Above the heads of the men around the table are the heads of six "protesting" theologians, heroes of the Reformation movement: [[George III, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Georgius Princeps Anhaldinus]], died 1553, [[Johannes Alasco]], died 1509, [[William Farel]], died 1565, [[Johannes Sleidanus]], died 1556, [[Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde|Philip Mauxius]], died 1595 in St Aldegonde, and [[Franciscus Junius (the elder)|Franciscus Junius]], died 1602.

In this engraving-painting pair the same scene is depicted, but the "historical theologians" are in circular portraits and in the painting, the Dutch text has been overpainted. Both the engraving and the painting were created in the 17th-century.

'''''The Column''''' ({{lang-ro|Columna}}) is a 1968 Romanian [[historical film]] directed by [[Mircea Drăgan]]. The film was selected as the Romanian entry for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[41st Academy Awards]], but was not accepted as a nominee.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; 

The action starts near the end of [[Trajan's Dacian Wars]] (106 AD), when south western [[Dacia]] was transformed into a [[Roman province]]: [[Roman Dacia]]. It covers the years after the war, including the beginnings of the [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] and [[Origin of the Romanians|Romanian ethnogenesis]], the construction of [[Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa]], resistance of the [[Free Dacians]] and first [[Migration Period|barbarian invasions]].

==Plot==
===Part 1===
As the Romans under [[Trajan]] take the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa, the Dacian king [[Decebalus]] and his closest followers are forced to retreat. Trajan takes command of the city and orders one of his officers, Tiberius, to pursue the defeated king. In a cave, Decebalus broods on his defeat, and tells his devoted supporter Gerula that the Dacian people must continue to resist.  Tiberius and his men catch up with Decebalus and Gerula. Decebalus kills himself to avoid capture. To Gerula's horror, Tiberius chops off Decebalus' head and right hand as trophies to take back to Trajan. While they are returning to the Roman camp Gerula escapes. He gathers together a group of Dacians and takes them to a part of the land not yet under Roman control.

At Sarmizegetusa, Trajan orders Tiberius to remain in Dacia and preside over the Romanisation of the territory, building fortifications, victory monuments and Roman settlements. Tiberius initially meets resistance from the local people, but wins over influential local chief Ciungu when he shows clemency to his rebellious son. One of the Roman centurions, Sabinus, falls in love with a local woman, a devotee of the Dacian god [[Zalmoxis]]. They become lovers. 

The Romans seem to be building a successful community, but nearby, in a secret location, Gerula is training up free Dacians, including Decebalus's grandson, to launch a new campaign to destroy the Romans and restore the Dacian kingdom. Sabinus accidentally discovers the free Dacian camp, and a clash occurs, during which Gerula slashes Sabinus' face, blinding him.  Andrada, an aristocratic Dacian woman who has killed a Roman soldier, is brought back to the camp. Again Tiberius shows clemency. He also tries to woo Andrada, who rejects him. Eventually, after a period of distrust, Tiberius wins over Andrada, and the couple are married. Tiberius tells Ciungu that he intends to build a town, and use Roman technology to improve the lives of the Dacian people. Andrada gives birth to her first child with Tiberius, a boy. He proudly shows the baby to the community, to cheers from both Romans and Dacians.

===Part 2===
Years later, Tiberius has built up the settlement into a Roman town. Trajan sends a Roman official to legally declare it to be a municipality. During the ceremony the official is killed by an arrow — shot by one of Gerula's men. The colony nevertheless prospers. The blinded Sabinus becomes the local schoolteacher, instructing the children in Roman culture. Andrada, however, also passes on Dacian lore and stories of pre-Roman times to her son. Decebalus's grandson is now fully grown, becoming the potential new king Gerula wants him to be. Gerula decides it is time to launch the war of liberation against the Romans and their collaborators. A shipment of mined gold is attacked. Almost all those travelling with it, including Ciungu, are killed. One man is left alive to tell Tiberius that all such "traitors" will be killed. Tiberius is furious. He arranges a meeting with Gerula and tells him that if the Romans and the Dacians continue to attack each other, they will only weaken the country, making it ripe for invasion by the barbarians to the north. Gerula ponders this possibility. While doing so, he comes across Tiberius' young son, who has wandered away from the town to explore. Talking to him, he realises that the combination of Roman and Dacian culture can be positive. 

Just as Tiberius predicted, the chief of the northern barbarians plans to use the disorder in Dacia to expand into its territory. He meets with Gerula and suggests they join together to expel the Romans. Gerula decides that such an alliance would only replace invaders who brought civilization, with invaders who will bring barbarism. He convinces Decebalus's grandson to aid the Romans. The barbarian chief launches his attack on the Roman town. Tiberius has prepared sophisticated defences, but the force of the barbarian attack threatens to overwhelm the Romans until the free Dacians come to their aid in a cavalry attack. Tiberius sends in the Roman cavalry to support them and the barbarians are crushed. However, Decebalus's grandson is killed in the battle. Devastated, Gerula realises his dream of a restored Dacian kingdom is over. As Tiberius approaches the body of Decebalus' grandson, Gerula imagines he intends to decapitate him, as he did his grandfather. Confused and distraught, Gerula attacks and kills Tiberius. 

Tiberius' body is brought back to the town accompanied by a chastened Gerula. As Andrada laments, Gerula tells the dead man's son that his father was a great warrior who fought for his people, and that he must grow up to defend the new country his father helped create.

'''''The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch painter]] [[Rembrandt]], c. 1661–62, which was originally the largest he ever painted, at about five by five metres in the shape of a [[lunette]]. The painting was commissioned by the [[Amsterdam]] city council for the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Town Hall]].  After the work had been in place briefly, it was returned to Rembrandt, who may have never been paid. Rembrandt drastically cut down the painting to a quarter of the original size to be sold. It is the last secular history painting he finished.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, G. (1987) Rembrandt. Zijn leven, zijn schilderijen, pp. 319, 320, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until September 2018 the painting is on loan to the [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://goteborgskonstmuseum.se/en/exhibitions/rembrandts-the-conspiracy-of-claudius-civilis/ Gothenburg Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The account in Tacitus==
[[File:Zijgalerij 2.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Inside the palace on the second floor, with one of the lunettes by Jordaens]]
The painting follows [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' in depicting an episode from the [[Batavian rebellion]] (69–70 AD), led by the one-eyed chieftain [[Gaius Julius Civilis|Claudius Civilis]] (actually called Gaius Julius Civilis by Tacitus, except once, and so known to history; but Claudius Civilis has become entrenched in art history),&lt;ref&gt;Slive, Seymour, (1995) ''Dutch Painting, 1600–1800'', pp. 332, n. 34, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-07451-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he "collected at one of the sacred groves, ostensibly for a banquet, the chiefs of the nation and the boldest spirits of the lower class", convinced them to join his rebellion, and then "bound the whole assembly with barbarous rites and strange forms of oath."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#15|Tacitus, ''Histories'' 4.14–15]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilis, Tacitus writes, "was unusually intelligent for a native, and passed himself off as a second [[Sertorius]] or [[Hannibal]], whose facial disfigurement he shared"—that is to say, the loss of one eye. He feigned friendship with [[Emperor Vespasian]] in order to regain his freedom. When he returned to his tribal grounds in the marshes of the [[Betuwe]], he organized the revolt he had long been planning.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, p. 179-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The commission==
[[File:Nicolaes Visscher (I) 002.jpg|thumb|200px|Floorplan second floor (1661) Rembrandt's ''Conspiracy'' was in the lower left corner]]
The painting was commissioned for the gallery of the new city hall on the [[Dam Square|Dam]], finished in 1655 (now the [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|Royal Palace]]). [[History painting]]s were regarded as the highest in the [[hierarchy of genres]] in the 17th century (a view Rembrandt shared), and the Batavian revolt was regarded, and romanticised, as a precursor of the recently ended [[Dutch Revolt|war against the Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;See UCLA website in external links below&lt;/ref&gt; In 1659, when [[John Maurice of Nassau]], [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]], her two daughters and two daughters-in-law came to see the new building,&lt;ref&gt;Balbian Verster, J.F.L.

In: Amstelodamum, Jrb 22, pp. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; the council commissioned twelve paintings from Rembrandt's ex-pupil [[Govert Flinck]] to fill all the large spaces using a programme drawn up by the poet [[Joost van den Vondel]], but Flink  died in 1660 before completing any of the works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Clark|Clark, Kenneth]], ''An Introduction to Rembrandt'', 1978, London, John Murray/Readers Union, 1978,  pp. 60. The contract, after sketches had been approved, was dated November 28th, 1659. Slive:90.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was then shared out by the burgomasters [[Joan Huydecoper I|Joan Huydecoper]] and [[Andries de Graeff]], who were certainly decisive, between a number of painters including [[Jacob Jordaens]] and [[Jan Lievens]]. The council provided the canvas to the artist. Rembrandt was commissioned to do the scene from Tacitus, one of eight intended to cover the revolt in the original scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment and reception==
The sword-oath was invented by Rembrandt. There is one sword more in the painting – the one touching the front of the leader's blade – than Batavians holding them;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, G. (2006). ''Rembrandt's Universe, His Art His Life His World'', p. 179-183.&lt;/ref&gt; other depictions of the event show handshakes, especially that [[engraving|engraved]] in 1612 by [[Antonio Tempesta]] as one of a set of thirty-six illustrations to designs by [[Otto van Veen]] in the book ''Batavorum cum Romanis bellum'' on the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Tümpel, C. (1992) Rembrandt, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, the [[States-General of the Netherlands|States General]] had commissioned a set of twelve paintings by Van Veen on the same subject for [[The Hague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/aria/aria_assets/SK-A-424?lang=en&amp;context_space=&amp;context_id= One of the set, now in the Rijksmuseum]&lt;/ref&gt;  These [[baroque]] works had entered the popular imagination as depictions of the revolt, and Flinck's design drew on the engraving of this scene. Van Veen followed baroque ideas of decorum by always showing Civilis in profile, with only his good eye visible.

[[File:Rembrandt-Civilis-recto-1.jpg|thumb|300px|Funeral ticket sketch (see text), October 1661 or later.]]
A sketch survives (on the back of a funeral ticket dated October 1661) that shows that he had transferred the scene from Tactitus's "sacred grove" to a large vaulted hall with open arches.&lt;ref&gt;196 x 180 mm. Staatliche Graphihische Sammlung, Munich [http://www.rembrandtpainting.net/rmbrndt_selected_drawings/drawing_images/batavia.jpg &lt;br&gt; Online image of sketch] Other drawings claimed in the past as figure sketches for this work are unlikely to be so – see Slive:332, n.35.&lt;/ref&gt;  After delivery, which was by July 1662, the painting hung in place for a short period before being returned to him for reasons that are undocumented, but may have involved perceptions of a lack of the decorum felt necessary for history painting, lack of finish and an insufficiently heroic approach to the story. When all four paintings were in place, the discrepancy was evident.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  The council probably expected something similar in style, rather than the ominous grandeur of Rembrandt's conception.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, R.H.; ''Dutch painting''; 1978, pp. 74–8, Thames and Hudson, London, {{ISBN|0-500-20167-6}} and Slive, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[chiaroscuro]] is typical of Rembrandt's late works, but the "eerie light and shadow and the iridescent greyish blues and pale yellows" are not.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1662, when the painting was still there, Rembrandt signed an agreement giving a "quarter-share of his profits accruing from the piece for the City Hall and his prospective earnings from it."&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, p. 179-183; Crenshaw, P. (2006) Rembrandt's Bankruptcy. The artist, his patrons and the art market in seventeenth-century Netherlands, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; By 24 September 1662, however, when the archbishop and elector of Cologne [[Maximilian Henry of Bavaria]] was received in the town hall, Rembrandt's painting was gone.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, H. (1920) Jürgen Ovens. Sein Leben und seine Werke, p. 85-88.&lt;/ref&gt;   One objection may well have been the incongruous crown that Rembrandt had set upon Claudius Civilis's head and his dominating the scene, hardly features of a consultative, republican attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, J. (1995) The Dutch Republic, Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477–1806. Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 879.&lt;/ref&gt;  Blankert suggested that the painting had too much dark, unused space, compared with the others who had filled the image space with figures in a more conventional manner.&lt;ref&gt;Blankert, A. (1976) Ferdinand Bol, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Kenneth Clark]]: {{cquote|"one need only look at the surviving fragment to see why official opinion could not accept it.... It is a most marvellous picture, but in places it borders on the absurd.  The word ''Shakespearean'' is, for once, justifiable.  Rembrandt has evoked the kind of quasi-mythical, heroic-magical past that is the setting for King Lear and Cymbeline, and, as with Shakespeare, this remoteness has allowed him to insert into an episode of primitive grandeur the life-giving roughage of the grotesque [the figures at the extreme sides]".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, K. (1978) ''An Introduction to Rembrandt'', p. 60. London. John Murray/Readers Union.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Crenshaw writes that Rembrandt was away for a couple of months, and "... he did not have enough supporters in the right places when obstacles arose."&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, P. (2006) Rembrandt's Bankruptcy. The artist, his patrons and the art market in seventeenth-century Netherlands, pp. 119, 146–7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, Flinck's unfinished work was retrieved and rapidly finished off by the German painter [[Jürgen Ovens]] in four days. Ovens, then living in the house and using the studio formerly owned by Flinck, got paid 48 [[Dutch gulden|guilders]] for his work, whereas Flinck was promised 12,000 guilders for the series of twelve paintings.  Jordaens and Lievens received 1,200 guilders for each of their works.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, G. (2006) Rembrandts Universe, His Art His Life His World, p. 179-183; Balbian Verster, J.F.L. (1925) DE CLAUDIUS CIVILIS VAN REMBRANDT. In: Amstelodamum, Jrb 22, pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  In financial difficulties, Rembrandt was forced to cut it down drastically for easier sale and partly repainted it.  The table was elongated, and he added the man on the left.&lt;ref&gt;Tümpel, C. (1992) Rembrandt, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the next few months, Rembrandt was forced to sell the grave of his wife, [[Saskia van Uylenburgh|Saskia]].&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, P. (2006) Rembrandt's Bankruptcy. The artist, his patrons and the art market in seventeenth-century Netherlands, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
[[File:Gustav IIIs visit to the Royal Academy of Arts.jpg|thumb|[[Gustav III of Sweden]] at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts|Royal Academy of Arts]]]]

In 1734, the painting was bought at auction in Amsterdam by the merchant Nicolaas Kohl. It came to Sweden as inheritance from Kohl's widow, Sophia Grill, and appears to have been in Sweden by 1767, when [[Louis Masreliez]] produced an altarpiece for the parish church of Romfartuna that seems influenced by Rembrandt's painting.  It was later acquired through marriage by the Stockholm merchant Henrik Wilhelm Peill, whose wife was the sole daughter of the wealthy [[Grill (family)#Claes Grill (I)|Claes Grill]], a director of the Swedish East India Company. Probably on the advice of artist friends, Peill deposited the painting at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]], where it can be seen hanging on the wall in the background of a painting by [[Elias Martin]] of the visit of King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] to the Academy in 1782. The King asked to borrow the painting for his own gallery at the Royal Palace.

Peill, who had previously supported the King financially in his ''coup d'état'' in 1772, complied, and a plan of the royal collection shows the painting in a central position in one of the galleries. At this time, the painting was restored by conservator Erik Hallblad. Hallblad, who had developed or learnt a method for transferring an oil painting from one canvas to another, removed the paint layer from Rembrandt's original canvas and attached it to a new one. Some damage appears to have occurred during this risky process; the extra sword now seen on the painting was probably added by Hallblad to mask this. The painting is still owned by the Academy of Arts but has been deposited since 1864 in the [[Nationalmuseum]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk (1982), p. 10-12; Bille, C. (1956) Rembrandt's Claudius Civilis and its owners in the 18th century”. In: Oud-Holland, pp. 54–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of the twentieth century, a Danish author, [[Karl Madsen]], noticed the sketch from Munich and assumed that Rembrandt—after his bankruptcy—fled to Sweden. He suggested that Rembrandt had painted the one-eyed Northern god, king and priest [[Odin]].&lt;ref&gt;Balbian Verster, J.F.L. (1925) DE CLAUDIUS CIVILIS VAN REMBRANDT. In: Amstelodamum, Jrb 22, pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Rembrandt's burial in [[Westerkerk]] was discovered in 1866, and the true history of the painting had been published in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Roever, N. de (1891) "Een Rembrandt op ‘t Stadhuis". In: Oud-Holland IX (1891), p. 297-306 &amp; Oud-Holland X (1892), p. 137-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, the Academy valued the painting at 750 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] (£61m, or $123m), but then put it on sale at 300 million kronor (£24m, or $49m—that is, at a 60% discount), on the condition that it be deposited straight back to the museum, and shown there as before, after purchase.  This unusual measure was taken in order to raise money for exhibitions and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/rembrandt-for-sale-at-discount-price-but-you-must-give-it-back-to-museum-794477.html|title=Rembrandt for sale at discount price (but you must give it back to museum)|first=Karl|last=Ritter|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-03-12|date=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting later traveled to Amsterdam &lt;!-- and London? --&gt; for an exhibition on ''Late Rembrandt'', and was on display at the Rijksmuseum next to ''[[The Night Watch]]''.

From May 2017 till September 2018, the painting was the centerpiece of a special Rembrandt exhibit at the [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]] in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://goteborgskonstmuseum.se/en/exhibitions/rembrandts-the-conspiracy-of-claudius-civilis//|title=Rembrandt’s The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis|accessdate=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The History of Middle-earth''''' is a 12-volume series of books published between 1983 and 1996 that collect and analyse material relating to the fiction of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], compiled and edited by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The series shows the development over time of Tolkien's conception of [[Middle-earth]] as a fictional place with its own peoples, [[languages invented by Tolkien|languages]], and history, from his earliest notions of a "mythology for England" through to the development of the stories that make up ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It is not a "history of Middle-earth" in the sense of being a chronicle of events in Middle-earth written from an in-universe perspective; it is instead an out-of-universe history of Tolkien's creative process. In 2000–01, the twelve volumes were republished in three limited edition omnibus volumes. Non-deluxe editions of the three volumes were published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/gallery.php?subsection=81 |title=The History of Middle-earth |website=An Illustrated Tolkien Bibliography |publisher=TolkienBooks.net |date=2014 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Some of the content consists of earlier versions of already published works, while other portions are new material. These books are extremely detailed, often analysing a scrap of paper to provide the full evolution of two or even three different versions of a passage that were rewritten over each other. Despite the great amount of material in the twelve volumes, numerous unpublished texts are still known to exist in the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]] and [[Marquette University]] libraries, and in other papers held by individuals or organizations, such as the [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]].

The first five books track the early history of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and related texts.  Books six to nine discuss the development of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; book nine also discusses the [[Númenor]] story in the form of [[The Notion Club Papers]]. Books ten and eleven focus on material from the ''Silmarillion'' that Tolkien worked on after ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published, including the ''Annals of [[Beleriand]]'' and the ''[[Annals of Aman]]''. Book twelve discusses the development of the Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'' and examines assorted writings from the last years of Tolkien's life.

Christopher Tolkien made the decision not to include any material related to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in ''The History of Middle-earth'' because it was not originally intended to form part of [[Tolkien's legendarium|the mythology]], but was a children's story and originally not set in Middle-earth, but was revised during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' was published separately, in two volumes, in 2007 and was  edited by [[John D. Rateliff]]

'''''The Holy Kinship''''' is a circa 1495 [[Oil painting|oil on panel]] painting of [[Holy Kinship]] by the workshop of the renaissance artist [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]] in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/58546 painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
''The Holy Kinship'' shows the Virgin and Child in the left center with Saint Elizabeth and [[John the Baptist]] slightly more prominently positioned center right.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; The "kinship" members have been further identified as Saint Anne with a book on the left with her husband Joachim behind her and behind him [[Saint Joseph]] holding a lily towards his wife as a gesture of the immaculate conception. Three young cousins of the infants, the later disciples Simon, Jacob and John, pour wine into a chalice in the centre of the painting which is a reference to the [[Eucharist]], and beyond them a sculpture of [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac]] on the altar represents God's sacrifice of [[Jesus]]. A young [[Judas]] stands lighting the candles of the choir gate. In the doorways of the choir gate stand the other two former husbands of Saint Anne, the fathers of the other two Marias who are positioned behind St. Elisabeth.

==Provenance==
This painting is a former altarpiece of an unspecified church, though it is tempting to imagine similarities to the ''Commanderie van Sint-Jan'' where Geertgen is known to have lived and worked: [[Janskerk, Haarlem]].&lt;ref name=Geertgen&gt;''Geertgen was hier: meesterschilder, lekenbroeder en inspirator''’, exhibition catalog Geertgen tot Sint-Jans in De Vishal and Janskerk (18 September – 13 October), Haarlem, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The provenance of this painting only goes back to a Brussels sale in 1797 however, and indeed the painting was purchased in 1808 as a work by Jan and [[Hubert van Eyck]]. It wasn't until 1888 that it was identified as a work by the Haarlem master.&lt;ref name=RM&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/SK-A-500/catalogus-entry Catalog entry] in museum website&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several attempts have been made to determine the origins of the painting. In his translated ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'', [[Hessel Miedema]] reported that Geertgen died somewhere between 1486 and 1492, while recent [[dendrochronology]], on the other hand, places the painting around 1496 at the earliest.&lt;ref name=Wallert&gt;[http://www.hnanews.org/archive/2001/11/wallert01.html The Holy Kinship. A Medieval Masterpiece], by Arie Wallert (editor), Gwen Tauber and Lisa Murphy,  Zwolle: Waanders Publisher, Rijksmuseum, 2001, 56 pp ISBN 90- 400-9487-X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miedema&gt;[[Schilder-boeck]], Volume I folio 205v, Notes Volume II, p. 260, note "205v19 hoe vroegh"&lt;/ref&gt; The painting has many similar details in common with [[Albert van Ouwater]]'s circa 1445 ''Lazarus'' and the tiled floor is similar to a contemporary painting by the [[Master of Alkmaar]]:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Exhibitions==
[[File:Gerrit Lamberts - Trippenhuis - Stadsarchief Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|This painting can be seen hanging in a 19th-century sketch of the gallery of the [[Trippenhuis]] before the collection was moved to its present location in 1885]]
This painting has been considered a highlight of the collection since it was bought in 1808 and has been included in all ''Highlights of the Rijksmuseum'' catalogs. It was the subject of a mini-exhibition after 17 years were spent 1983-2000 restoring 12 centimeters of water damage at the bottom of the painting.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt;

In the film industry, '''unsimulated sex''' is the presentation in a film of [[sex scene]]s where the actors engage in an actual [[sex act]], and are not just miming or simulating the actions. At one time in the United States such scenes were restricted by law and self-imposed industry standards such as the [[Motion Picture Production Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms.html|title=History of Sex in Cinema: The Greatest and Most Influential Sexual Films and Scenes|last=Dirks|first=Tim|work=[[Filmsite.org]]|publisher=American Movie Classic Company|accessdate=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110213023/http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms.html|archive-date=10 January 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films showing explicit sexual activity were confined to privately distributed underground films, such as stag films or "porn loops".

Notable examples include two of the eight [[Bedside-films|''Bedside''-films]] and the six [[Zodiac-films|''Zodiac''-films]] from the 1970s, all of which were produced in Denmark and had many pornographic sex scenes, but were nevertheless considered mainstream films (they all had mainstream casts and crews, and premiered in mainstream cinemas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Michael|date=November 2006|title=Legitimizing Illegitimacy: Identity Spaces and Markets for Illegitamate Products|journal=Organizations &amp; Markets Workshop|publisher=Chicago Booth|url=http://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/workshops/orgs-markets/docs/jensen-legitimacy.pdf|access-date=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229175950/http://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/workshops/orgs-markets/docs/jensen-legitimacy.pdf|archive-date=29 December 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of these films, ''Agent 69 Jensen i Skyttens tegn'', was made in 1978. From the end of the 1970s until the late 1990s it was rare to see hardcore scenes in mainstream cinema, but this changed with the success of [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[The Idiots]]'' (1998), which heralded a wave of [[art-house]] films with explicit content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/feb/22/news|title=Explicit Euro-sex test for British censors|date=22 February 1999|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 December 2009|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204045908/http://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/feb/22/news|archive-date=4 February 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/27/entertainment/ca-38822|title=Graphic Sex Scenes on Film Causing Little Fuss--for Now|last=Wilmington|first=Michael|date=27 August 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=4 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904151852/http://articles.latimes.com/2001/aug/27/entertainment/ca-38822|archive-date=4 September 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Romance (1999 film)|Romance]]'' (1999), ''[[Baise-moi]]'' (2000), ''[[Intimacy (movie)|Intimacy]]'' (2001), [[Vincent Gallo]]'s ''[[The Brown Bunny]]'' (2003), and [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s ''[[9 Songs]]'' (2004). Some simulated sex scenes are sufficiently realistic that critics mistakenly believe that they are real, such as the cunnilingus scene in the 2006 film ''[[Red Road (film)|Red Road]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/london_film_festival/article651832.ece|title=Sealed with a Glasgow kiss|last=Dalton|first=Stephen|date=7 October 2006|work=The Times|accessdate=10 January 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationales==
In an interview after the release of his film ''Love'', when asked why audiences want to see realistic portrayals of sex, [[Gaspar Noé]] suggested it's really about power structures: "In most societies whether they’re western or not, people want to control the sexual behaviour or to organise it in a precise context. Sex is like a danger zone. Sometimes class barriers fall down and it scares a lot of people. It’s about states controlling their systems, like religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barlow |first1=Helen |title=Director Gaspar Noé explains why real sex scenes were filmed for Love movie |newspaper=Irish Examiner |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/director-gaspar-noe-explains-why-real-sex-scenes-were-filmed-for-love-movie-370409.html |accessdate=31 July 2018 |date=9 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731123354/https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/director-gaspar-noe-explains-why-real-sex-scenes-were-filmed-for-love-movie-370409.html |archive-date=31 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Franco]] has cited "aesthetics and personal reasons" for why he worked on ''[[Interior. Leather Bar.]]'' (2013): &lt;br&gt;

:I've been a part of professional mainstream film for 17 years, and then in addition to that, I am a citizen of the United States and, you   know, I am engaged with its mainstream culture, but I've also done a fair amount of studying queer theory or queer cinema classes. So I’ve found that my place, one thing that my position allows, is a way to bring these two worlds together and also question the rules of mainstream cinema or mainstream culture, to examine why things are made the way that they are, why some subject matter is presented in one way and not another, and how those things shape us as people, how it shapes our beliefs, how it shapes the way that we live. If we can question those things or introduce alternative ways of viewing lifestyles or whatever it might be in mainstream cinema or indie cinema or art cinema, I think it can only be for the good. If other voices or other kinds of discussions or storylines or narratives from different perspectives are introduced, it will only make us richer as a people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Logan |first1=Lynn (interviewer) |title=Unsimulated Sex: An Interview With James Franco and Travis Matthews |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/logan-lynn/james-franco-travis-matthews_b_3282986.html |website=Huffington Post.

==Production issues==
A few directors have openly discussed or written about the technical problems inherent in filming of actual sexual acts, particularly with actors or actresses who have never performed such acts on film. In an interview with ''BlackBook'', [[Gaspar Noé]] acknowledges that it is difficult for several reasons: an actor may not be able to get or maintain an erection in the presence of even a small crew, or on camera; either of the partipants may have a current partner. "So I've decided that the best way to show real sex is to cast two single people who used to be a couple."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Enter the Void' Director Gaspar Noé Uncensored |url=https://bbook.com/film/enter-the-void-director-gaspar-no-uncensored/ |website=Black Book |accessdate=31 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731093505/https://bbook.com/film/enter-the-void-director-gaspar-no-uncensored/ |archive-date=31 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Pornographic films re-edited for mainstream release==
Prior to the advent of home video, a number of [[hardcore pornography]] films were released to mainstream cinemas. In most cases, scenes of penetration were either cut out or replaced with alternate shots. One exception to this was ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', which was released uncensored.

Examples of this type of hybrid release include ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1976 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1976), shot as [[X-rated]], but first released as an R-rated version—afterwards, the uncut version was released;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074113/maindetails Alice in Wonderland (1976/I)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409091306/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074113/maindetails |date=9 April 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Café Flesh]]'' (1982)—the R-rated version of this science fiction porn film was released to mainstream cinemas;&lt;ref name=Peary&gt;{{cite book |title=Cult Movies 3 |first=Danny |last=Peary |year=1988 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Inc |location=New York |pages=52–56 |isbn=0-671-64810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stocks and Blondes'' (1984), originally available as ''Wanda Whips Wall Street'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313803,00.html What Blockbuster Didn't Bust Blockbuster's inconsistent ratings policy -- The video rental store cracks down on X and NC-17 rated films, but ignores racier unrated fare like ''Wild Orchid''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108144849/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313803,00.html |date=8 January 2010 }}, Ty Burr, ''Entertainment Weekly'', 29 March 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Droid (film)|Droid]]'' (1988), originally released as ''Cabaret Sin'' in 1987.

==Films with unsimulated sexual activity==
The following mainstream films have scenes with verified real sexual activity, meaning actors or actresses are filmed engaging in actual [[coitus]] or performing related sexual acts such as [[fellatio]] and [[cunnilingus]].
This list does not include [[:Category:Documentary films about pornography|documentaries about pornography]], which may contain unsimulated sexual activity. For example, ''[[Inside Deep Throat]]'' contains approximately 20 seconds of unsimulated fellatio.&lt;ref name=Inside&gt;[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/i/inside_deep.html A Film Review by James Berardinelli].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The 18th century "[[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]]" built purely as a landscape feature, influenced by the lake at [[Stourhead]], [[Wiltshire]], [[England]].]]

'''Villa Borghese''' is a landscape [[garden]] in the naturalistic [[English landscape garden|English manner]] in [[Rome]], containing a number of buildings, museums (see [[Galleria Borghese]]) and attractions. It is the third largest public park in Rome (80 hectares or 197.7 acres) after the ones of the [[Villa Doria Pamphili]] and [[Villa Ada]]. The gardens were developed for the [[Galleria Borghese|Villa Borghese Pinciana]] ("Borghese villa on the [[Pincian Hill]]"), built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by [[Scipione Borghese]], who used it as a ''villa suburbana'', a party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection.  The gardens as they are now were remade in the early nineteenth century.

==History==
In 1605, Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]], nephew of [[Pope Paul V]] and patron of [[Bernini]], began turning this former vineyard into the most extensive gardens built in Rome since Antiquity. The vineyard's site is identified with the [[gardens of Lucullus]], the most famous in the late Roman republic. In the 19th century much of the garden's former formality was remade as a landscape garden in the English taste (''illustration, right''). The Villa Borghese gardens were long informally open, but were bought by the commune of Rome and given to the public in 1903. The large landscape park in the English taste contains several villas. The [[Spanish Steps]] lead up to this park, and there is another entrance at the Porte del Popolo by [[Piazza del Popolo]]. The ''Pincio'' (the [[Pincian Hill]] of ancient Rome), in the south part of the park, offers one of the greatest views over Rome.

The Piazza di Siena, located in the villa, hosted the [[Equestrian at the 1960 Summer Olympics|equestrian]] [[dressage]], individual [[jumping]], and the jumping part of the [[eventing]] competition for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]]. A balustrade (dating from the early seventeenth century) from the gardens, was taken to England in the late 19th century, and installed in the grounds of [[Cliveden]] House, a mansion in [[Buckinghamshire]], in 1896.  In 2004, a species of [[Papillifera papillaris|Italian snail]] was discovered, still living on the balustrade after more than 100 years in England.

==Villas in the gardens==
*Today the [[Galleria Borghese]] is housed in the Villa Borghese itself.  The garden '''Casino Borghese,''' built on a rise above the Villa by the architect [[Giovanni Vasanzio]], was set up by [[Pope Paul V|Camillo Borghese]] to contain sculptures by [[Bernini]] from the [[Borghese collection]], including his ''David'' and his ''Daphne'', and paintings by [[Titian]], [[Raphael]] and [[Caravaggio]].
*The [[Villa Giulia]] adjoining the Villa Borghese gardens was built in 1551 - 1555 as a summer residence for [[Pope Julius III]]; now it contains the Etruscan Museum (''Museo Etrusco'').

[[Image:Vista del jardín de la Villa Medici en Roma, por Diego Velázquez.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Painting by [[Diego Velázquez]]]]
*The [[Villa Medici]] houses the [[French Academy in Rome]], and the ''Fortezzuola'' a Gothic garden structure that houses a collection memorializing the academic modern sculptor [[Pietro Canonica]]. In the 1650s, [[Diego Velázquez]] painted several depictions of this Villa's garden casino festively illuminated at night. Before electricity, such torchlit illuminations carried an excitement hard to conceive today.
*Other villas scattered through the Villa Borghese gardens are remains of a [[International Exhibition of Art (1911)|world exposition]] in Rome in 1911.
**The ''[[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna]]'' located in its grounds has a collection of 19th- and 20th-century paintings emphasizing Italian artists. 
**Architecturally the most notable of the 1911 exposition pavilions is the English pavilion designed by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (who later designed [[New Delhi]]), now housing the [[British School at Rome]].

*The garden contains a replica of the Shakespeare's [[Globe Theatre]] built in 2003.

'''White''' is the [[lightness|lightest]] [[color]] and is achromatic (having no [[hue]]). It is the color of fresh snow, [[chalk]], and milk, and is the opposite of [[black]]. White objects fully [[diffuse reflection|reflect]] and [[light scattering|scatter]] all the [[visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]] of [[light]].  White on television and computer screens is created by a  mixture of red, blue and green light.

In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome, priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity, and Romans wore a white toga as a symbol of citizenship. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white [[unicorn]] symbolized chastity, and a white lamb sacrifice and purity. It was the royal color of the Kings of France, and of the monarchist movement that opposed the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1922). Greek and Roman temples were faced with white marble, and beginning in the 18th century, with the advent of neoclassical architecture, white became the most common color of new churches, capitols and other government buildings, especially in the United States. It was also widely used in 20th century [[modern architecture]] as a symbol of modernity and simplicity.

According to surveys in Europe and the United States, white is the color most often associated with perfection, the good, honesty, cleanliness, the beginning, the new, neutrality, and exactitude.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets ets symboliques'', pp. 130–46&lt;/ref&gt; White is an important color for almost all world religions. The [[Pope]], the head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], has worn white since 1566, as a symbol of purity and sacrifice.  In [[Islam]], and in the [[Shinto]] religion of Japan, it is worn by pilgrims. In Western cultures and in Japan, white is the most common color for wedding dresses, symbolizing purity and virginity. In many Asian cultures, white is also the color of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets ets symboliques'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''[[:wikt:white|white]]'' continues [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|hwīt}}'', ultimately from a [[Common Germanic]] ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|χ&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;ītaz}}'' also reflected in [[Old High German|OHG]] ''{{lang|goh|(h)wîz}}'', [[Old Norse|ON]] ''{{lang|non|hvítr}}'', [[Gothic language|Goth.]] ''{{lang|got|ƕeits}}''. The root is ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language]] ''{{PIE|*k&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;id-}}'', surviving also in [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|śveta}}'' "to be white or bright"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/index.php?sfx=jpg Sanskrit-Lexicon.uni-koeln.de] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213080141/http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/index.php?sfx=jpg |date=13 February 2010 }} (''Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary'', p. 1106).&lt;/ref&gt; and Slavonic ''{{lang|sla-Latn|světŭ}}'' "light".&lt;ref&gt;Max Vasmer, ''Этимологический словарь русского языка'', т.III, Москва 1971, 575–76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]]; {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word for white, ''{{lang|is|hvítur}}'', is directly derived from the [[Old Norse]] form of the word ''{{lang|non|hvítr}}''. Common Germanic also had the word *''blankaz'' ("white, bright, blinding"), borrowed into [[Late Latin]] as *''blancus'', which provided the source for [[Romance languages|Romance]] words for "white" (Catalan, Occitan and French ''blanc'', Spanish ''blanco'', Italian ''bianco'', Galician-Portuguese ''branco'', etc.). The antonym of white is black.

Some non-European languages have a wide variety of terms for white. The [[Inuit]] language has seven different words for seven different nuances of white. [[Sanskrit]] has specific words for bright white, the white of teeth, the white of [[sandalwood]], the white of the autumn moon, the white of silver, the white of cow's milk, the white of pearls, the white of a ray of sunlight, and the white of stars.  Japanese has six different words, depending upon brilliance or dullness, or if the color is inert or dynamic.{{sfn|Varichon|2005|pages=11–12}}

== History and art ==
=== Prehistoric and ancient history===
White was one of the first colors used in art. The [[Lascaux Cave]] in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by [[paleolithic]] artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. [[Paleolithic]] artists used [[calcite]] or [[chalk]], sometimes as a background, sometimes as a highlight, along with charcoal and red and yellow ochre in their vivid cave paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau (2005), ''Le petit livre des couleurs,'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In [[ancient Egypt]], white was connected with the goddess [[Isis]]. The priests and priestesses of Isis dressed only in white linen, and it was used to wrap [[mummies]].&lt;ref name="Anne Varichon 2000 pg. 16"&gt;Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 16 .&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece and other ancient civilizations, white was often associated with mother's milk. In [[Greek mythology]], the chief god [[Zeus]] was nourished at the breast of the nymph Amalthea.  In the [[Talmud]], milk was one of four sacred substances, along with wine, honey, and the rose.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greeks saw the world in terms of darkness and light, so white was a fundamental color.  According to [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''Natural History'', [[Apelles]] (4th century BC) and the other famous painters of ancient Greece used only four colors in their paintings; white, red, yellow and black;&lt;ref&gt;John Gage (1993) ''Color and Culture'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; For painting, the Greeks used [[lead white]], made by a long and laborious process.

A plain white [[toga]], known as a ''toga virilis'', was worn for ceremonial occasions by all Roman citizens over the age of 14–18. Magistrates and certain priests wore a ''toga praetexta'', with a broad purple stripe.
In the time of the Emperor [[Augustus]], no Roman man was allowed to appear in the Roman forum without a toga.

The ancient Romans had two words for white; ''albus'', a plain white, (the source of the word ''albino''); and ''candidus,'' a brighter white. A man who wanted public office in Rome wore a white toga brightened with chalk, called a ''toga candida'', the origin of the word ''candidate''. The Latin word ''candere'' meant to shine, to be bright. It was the origin of the words ''candle'' and ''candid''.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language'', (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Rome]], the priestesses of the goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] dressed in white linen robes, a white [[palla (garment)|palla]] or shawl, and a white veil. They protected the sacred fire and the [[penates]] of Rome. White symbolized their purity, loyalty, and chastity.&lt;ref name="Anne Varichon 2000 pg. 16" /&gt;

=== Postclassical history ===
The early Christian church adopted the Roman symbolism of white as the color of purity, sacrifice and virtue. It became the color worn by priests during Mass, the color worn by monks of the [[Cistercian Order]], and, under [[Pope Pius V]], a former monk of the [[Dominican Order]], it became the official color worn by the pope himself. Monks of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] dressed in the white or gray of natural undyed wool, but later changed to black, the color of humility and penitence.

Postclassical history art, the white lamb became the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ on behalf of mankind. John the Baptist described [[Christ]] as the [[lamb of God]], who took the sins of the world upon himself. The white lamb was the center of one of the most famous paintings of the Medieval period, the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', pp. 224–25).&lt;/ref&gt;

White was also the symbolic color of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|transfiguration]]. The [[Gospel of Saint Mark]] describes Jesus' clothing in this event as "shining, exceeding white as snow." Artists such as Fra Angelico used their skill to capture the whiteness of his garments. In his painting of the transfiguration at the Convent of Saint Mark in [[Florence]], Fra Angelico emphasized the white garment by using a light gold background, placed in an almond-shaped halo.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', pp. 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The white [[unicorn]] was a common subject of Postclassical history manuscripts, paintings and tapestries. It was a symbol of purity, chastity and grace, which could only be captured by a virgin. It was often portrayed in the lap of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'', pp. 232–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Postclassical history, painters rarely ever mixed colors; but in the Renaissance, the influential humanist and scholar [[Leon Battista Alberti]] encouraged artists to add white to their colors to make them lighter, brighter, and to add ''hilaritas'', or gaiety. Many painters followed his advice, and the palette of the Renaissance was considerably brighter.&lt;ref&gt;John Gage, (1993), ''Color and Culture'', pp. 117–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern history ===

Until the 16th century, white was commonly worn by widows as a color of mourning. The widows of the kings of France wore white until [[Anne of Brittany]] in the 16th century. A white tunic was also worn by many knights, along with a red cloak, which showed the knights were willing to give their blood for the king or Church.

==== 18th and 19th centuries ====

White was the dominant color of architectural interiors in the [[Baroque]] period and especially the [[Rococo]] style that followed it in the 18th century. Church interiors were designed to show the power, glory and wealth of the church. They seemed to be alive, filled with curves, asymmetry, mirrors, gilding, statuary and reliefs, unified by white.

White was also a fashionable color for both men and women in the 18th century. Men in the aristocracy and upper classes wore powdered white wigs and white stockings, and women wore elaborate embroidered white and pastel gowns.

After the [[French Revolution]], a more austere white (''blanc cassé'') became the most fashionable color in women's costumes which were modeled after the outfits of Ancient Greece and Republican Rome. Because of the rather revealing design of these dresses, the ladies wearing them were called ''les merveilleuses'' (the marvellous) by French men of that era.&lt;ref&gt;Chronique des métropoles:Paris, p. 83, publ. Dargaud 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire style]] under Emperor Napoléon I was modeled after the more conservative outfits of Ancient Imperial Rome. The dresses were high in fashion but low in warmth considering the more severe weather conditions of northern France; in 1814 the former wife of Napoleon, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], caught [[pneumonia]] and died after taking a walk in the cold night air with Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Andrew, ''Napoleon – A Life'', (2014), Viking Press, {{ISBN|978-0-670-02532-9}}, pp. 723–24&lt;/ref&gt;

White was the universal color of both men and women's underwear and of sheets in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was unthinkable to have sheets or underwear of any other color. The reason was simple; the manner of washing linen in boiling water caused colors to fade. When linen was worn out, it was collected and turned into high-quality paper.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Pastoureau (2005), ''Le petit livre des couleurs'', pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century American painter [[James McNeill Whistler]] (1834–1903), working at the same time as the French impressionists, created a series of paintings with musical titles where he used color to create moods, the way composers used music. His painting ''Symphony in White No. 1 – The White Girl'', which used his mistress Joanna Hiffernan as a model, used delicate colors to portray innocence and fragility, and a moment of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 20th and 21st centuries ====


The [[White movement]] was the opposition that formed against the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], which followed the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917. It was finally defeated by the Bolsheviks in 1921–22, and many of its members emigrated to Europe.

At the end of the 19th century, lead white was still the most popular pigment; but between 1916 and 1918, chemical companies in [[Norway]] and the United States began to produce [[titanium white]], made from [[titanium oxide]]. It had first been identified in the 18th century by the German chemist [[Martin Klaproth]], who also discovered [[uranium]]. It had twice the covering power of lead white, and was the brightest white pigment known. By 1945, 80 percent of the white pigments sold were titanium white.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball (2001), ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', pp. 484–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The absoluteness of white appealed to modernist painters. It was used in its simplest form by the Russian suprematist painter [[Kazimir Malevich]] in his 1917 painting 'the white square,' the companion to his earlier 'black square.' It was also used by the Dutch modernist painter [[Piet Mondrian]]. His most famous paintings consisted of a pure white canvas with grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of primary colors.

Black and white also appealed to modernist architects, such as [[Le Corbusier]] (1887–1965). He said a house was "a machine for living in" and called for a "calm and powerful architecture" built of reinforced concrete and steel, without any ornament or frills.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier. ''Toward an Architecture''. Translated by John Goodman. Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the buildings of contemporary architect [[Richard Meier]], such as his museum in [[Rome]] to house the ancient Roman [[Ara Pacis]], or Altar of Peace, are stark white, in the tradition of Le Corbusier.

== Scientific understanding (Color science) ==
&lt;!-- Physics was linked from redirect [[White light]] --&gt;

Light is perceived by the human visual system as white when the incoming light to the eye stimulates all three types of color sensitive [[cone cell]]s in the eye in roughly equal amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author  = Wyszecki &amp; Stiles
| title   = Color Science
| edition = Second
| page    = 506
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials that do not emit light themselves appear white if their surfaces reflect back most of the light that strikes them in a [[Diffuse reflection|diffuse way]].

=== White light ===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights=" 200px" &gt;
File:Synthese+.svg||In the [[RGB color model]], used to create colors on TV and computer screens, white is made by mixing red, blue and green light at full intensity.
File:Dispersion prism.jpg|[[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|White light]] [[refract]]ed in a [[prism]] revealing the color components.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
In 1666, [[Isaac Newton]] demonstrated that [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]] could be broken up into its composite colors by passing it through a [[prism]], then using a second prism to reassemble them.  Before Newton, most scientists believed that white was the fundamental color of [[light]].

White light can be generated by the sun, by stars, or by earthbound sources such as [[Fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] lamps, [[Light-emitting diode#White light|white LEDs]] and [[Incandescent lamps|incandescent bulbs]]. On the screen of a color television or computer, white is produced by mixing the [[primary color]]s of light: red, green and blue ([[RGB]]) at full intensity, a process called [[additive mixing]] (see image below). White light can be fabricated using light with only two wavelengths, for instance by mixing light from a red and cyan laser or yellow and blue lasers. This light will however have very few practical applications since color rendering of objects will be greatly distorted.

The fact that light sources with vastly different [[spectral power distribution]]s can result in a similar sensory experience is due to the way the light is processed by the visual system. One color that arises from two different spectral power distributions is called a [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]].

Many of the light sources that emit white light emit light at almost all visible wavelengths (sun light, incandescent lamps of various [[Color temperature]]s). This has led to the notion that white light can be defined as a mixture of "all colors" or "all visible wavelengths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This widespread idea is a misconception,{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  and might originally stem from the fact that [[Isaac Newton#Optics|Newton]] discovered that ''sunlight'' is composed of light with wavelengths across the visible spectrum. Concluding that ''since "all colors" produce white light then white must be made up of "all colors"'' is a common logical error called [[affirming the consequent]], which might be the cause of the misunderstanding.

A range of spectral distributions of light sources can be perceived as white—there is no single, unique specification of "white light".  For example, when you buy a "white" light bulb, you might buy one labeled 2700K, 6000K, etc., which produce light having very different spectral distributions, and yet this will not prevent you from identifying the color of objects that they illuminate.&lt;ref name=illuminantIndep /&gt;

=== White objects ===
Color vision allows us to distinguish different [[Color#Color of objects|''objects'' by their color]]. In order to do so, [[color constancy]] can keep the perceived color of an object relatively unchanged when the illumination changes among various broad (whitish) spectral distributions of light.&lt;ref name=illuminantIndep&gt;Convex and non-convex illuminant constraints for dichromatic colour constancy, G.D. Finlayson and G. Schaefer, in ''Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. CVPR 2001'' http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/990528/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008232830/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/990528/ |date=8 October 2017 }} "the perceived colour of an object is more or less independent of the illuminant; a white paper appears white both outdoors under bluish daylight and indoors under yellow tungsten light, though the responses of the eyes' colour receptors ... will be quite different for the two cases."&lt;/ref&gt;

The same principle is used in photography and cinematography where the choice of [[white point]] determines a transformation of all other color stimuli. Changes in or manipulation of the white point can be used to explain some optical illusions such as [[The dress (viral phenomenon)|The dress]].

While there is no single, unique specification of "white light", there is indeed a unique specification of "white object", or, more specifically, "white surface".
A perfectly white surface [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflects]] ([[light scattering|scatters]]) all visible light that strikes it, without [[light absorption|absorbing]] any, irrespective of the light's wavelength or spectral distribution.&lt;ref name="mirror1"&gt;Program of Color Science / Munsell Color Science Laboratory, Rochester Institute of Technology, ''Complete Color FAQ''. "A perfect mirror reflects all of the light that strikes it... A perfect white also reflects all the light incident on it, but reflects that light diffusely. In other words, the white scatters the incident light in all directions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to Appearance Analysis, Richard W. Harold, in ''GATFWorld, the magazine of the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation'', SS Number 84. "The typical reference is a white standard that has been calibrated relative to the perfect white reflecting diffuser (100% reflectance at all wavelengths)."&lt;/ref&gt;
Since it does not absorb any of the incident light, white is the lightest possible color.
If the reflection is not diffuse but rather [[specular reflection|specular]], this describes a mirror rather than a white surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Color constancy is achieved by [[chromatic adaptation]].  The [[International Commission on Illumination]] defines ''white (adapted)'' as "a color stimulus that an observer who is [chromatically] adapted to the viewing environment would judge to be perfectly achromatic and to have a luminance factor of unity.  The color stimulus that is considered to be the adapted white may be different at different locations within a scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Why snow, clouds and beaches are white ===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights=" 200px" &gt;
File:Snow-covered fir trees.jpg|thumb|Snow is composed of ice and air; it scatters or reflects sunlight without absorbing other colors of the spectrum.
File:Cumulus clouds in fair weather.jpeg||[[Cumulus cloud]]s look white because the water droplets reflect and scatter the sunlight without absorbing other colors.
File:White Cliffs of Dover 02.JPG|The [[White Cliffs of Dover]], made of [[limestone]]
File:Hyams Beach 002.jpg|thumb|[[Hyams Beach]], [[New South Wales]] appears white because the sunlight is reflected or scattered by the quartz or limestone sand 
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Beaches with [[sand]] containing high amounts of [[quartz]] or eroded [[limestone]] also appear white, since quartz and limestone reflect or scatter sunlight, rather than absorbing it. Tropical white sand beaches may also have a high quantity of white [[calcium carbonate]] from tiny bits of seashells ground to fine sand by the action of the waves.&lt;ref name="livescience.com"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/38163-where-beach-sand-comes-from.html "Science of summer – where does beach sand come from?"] ''Livescience.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[White Cliffs of Dover]] take their white color from the large amount of [[chalk]], made of [[limestone]], which they contain, which reflects the sunlight.

[[Snow]] is a mixture of air and tiny [[ice]] crystals. When white [[sunlight]] enters snow, very little of the spectrum is absorbed; almost all of the light is reflected or scattered by the air and water molecules, so the snow appears to be the color of sunlight, white. Sometimes the light bounces around inside the ice crystals before being scattered, making the snow seem to sparkle.&lt;ref name="weather.about.com"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[glacier]]s, the ice is more tightly pressed together and contains little air. As sunlight enters the ice, more light of the red spectrum is absorbed, so the light scattered will be bluish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Cloud]]s are white for the same reason as ice. They are composed of water droplets or ice crystals mixed with air, very little light that strikes them is absorbed, and most of the light is scattered, appearing to the eye as white. Shadows of other clouds above can make clouds look gray, and some clouds have their own shadow on the bottom of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many mountains with winter or year-round snow cover are named accordingly: [[Mauna Kea]] means ''white mountain'' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Mont Blanc]] means ''white mountain'' in French. [[Changbai Mountains]] literally meaning ''perpetually white mountains'', marks the border between China and Korea.

==== White materials ====
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights=" 200px" &gt;
File:Titanium(IV) oxide.jpg|thumb|Titanium white, made with [[titanium dioxide]], is the brightest white paint available. It also colors most toothpaste and sunscreen.
File:Zinc oxide.jpg|thumb|[[Zinc white]] is made from [[zinc oxide]]. Zinc oxide is used in paints, suntan lotion, and breakfast cereals.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Chalk]] is a kind of [[limestone]], made of the mineral [[calcite]], or [[calcium carbonate]]. It was originally deposited under the sea as the scales or plates of tiny micro-organisms called [[Coccolithophore]]. It was the first white pigment used by prehistoric artists in cave paintings. The chalk used on blackboards today is usually made of [[gypsum]] or calcium sulphate, a powder pressed into sticks.

''Bianco di San Giovanni'' is a pigment used in the Renaissance, which was described by the painter [[Cennino Cennini]] in the 15th century. It is similar to chalk, made of calcium carbonate with calcium hydroxide. It was made of dried lime which was made into a powder, then soaked in water for eight days, with the water changed each day. It was then made into cakes and dried in the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Lead white]] was being produced during the 4th century BC; the process is described is [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Vitruvius]] and the ancient Greek author [[Theophrastus]]. Pieces of lead were put into clay pots which had a separate compartment filled with [[vinegar]]. The pots in turn were piled on shelves close to cow dung. The combined fumes of the vinegar and the cow dung caused the lead to corrode into [[lead carbonate]]. It was a slow process which could take a month or more. It made an excellent white and was used by artists for centuries, but it was also toxic. It was replaced in the 19th century by [[zinc white]] and [[titanium white]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Ball (2000), ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Titanium white]] is the most popular white for artists today; it is the brightest available white pigment, and has twice the coverage of lead white. It first became commercially available in 1921. It is made out of [[titanium dioxide]], from the minerals [[brookite]], [[anatase]], [[rutile]], or [[ilmenite]], currently the major source. Because of its brilliant whiteness, it is used as a colorant for most [[toothpaste]] and [[sunscreen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Zinc white]] is made from [[zinc oxide]]. It is similar to but not as opaque as titanium white. It is added to some breakfast cereals,{{cn|date=March 2018}} since zinc is an important [[nutrient]]. [[Chinese white]] is a variety of zinc white made for artists.

Some materials can be made to look "whiter than white", this is achieved using [[optical brightener]] agents (OBA). These are chemical compounds that absorb light in the [[ultraviolet]] and violet region (usually 340–370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420–470 nm). OBAs are often used in paper and clothing to create an impression of very bright white. This is due to the fact that the materials actually send out more visible light than they receive.

==== Bleach and bleaching ====
[[Bleaching]] is a process for whitening fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years. Sometimes it was simply a matter of leaving the fabric in the sun, to be faded by the bright light. In the 18th century several scientists developed varieties of [[chlorine bleach]], including [[sodium hypochlorite]] and [[calcium hypochlorite]] (bleaching powder).&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

| accessdate   = 2 May 2012
| edition      = 9th Edition (1875) and 10th Edition (1902)
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on [[peroxide]]s, such as [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[sodium percarbonate]] and [[sodium perborate]]. While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, a fewer number are [[reducing agents]] such as [[sodium dithionite]].

Bleaches attack the [[chromophore]]s, the part of a molecule which absorbs light and causes fabrics to have different colors. An oxidizing bleach works by breaking the [[chemical bond]]s that make up the chromophore. This changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore, or contains a chromophore that does not absorb [[visible light]]. A reducing bleach works by converting [[double bond]]s in the chromophore into [[single bond]]s. This eliminates the ability of the chromophore to absorb visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight acts as a bleach through a similar process. High energy [[photon]]s of light, often in the [[violet (color)|violet]] or [[ultraviolet]] range, can disrupt the bonds in the chromophore, rendering the resulting substance colorless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some detergents go one step further; they contain [[fluorescent]] chemicals which glow, making the fabric look literally whiter than white.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

White is an important symbolic color in most religions and cultures, usually because of its association with purity.  

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], white is associated with [[Jesus Christ]], innocence and sacrifice. Since the [[Middle Ages]], priests wear a white [[cassock]] in many of the most important ceremonies and religious services connected with events in the life of Christ. White is worn by priests at [[Christmas]], during [[Easter]], and during celebrations connected with the other events of the life of Christ, such as Corpus Christi Sunday, and [[Trinity Sunday]]. It is also worn at the services dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], and to those Saints who were not martyred, as well as other special occasions, such as the ordination of priests and the installation of new bishops. Within the hierarchy of the church, the lighter the color, the higher the rank. Ordinary priests wear black; bishops wear violet, cardinals wear red, and outside a church, only the [[Pope]] will wear white.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000). ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Popes occasionally wore white in the Middle Ages, but usually wore red. Popes have worn white regularly since 1566, when [[Pope Pius V]], a member of the [[Dominican Order]], began the practice.  White is the color of the [[Dominican Order]].

In Islam, white clothing is worn during required pilgrimage to Mecca, or ''[[Ihram]]'' [[pilgrimage]] (''[[Hajj]]'').[[Hajj]]. Called [[Ihram clothing]], men's garments often consist of two white un-hemmed sheets (usually towelling material). The top (the ''riḍā'') is draped over the torso and the bottom (the ''izār'') is secured by a belt; plus a pair of sandals. Women's clothing varies considerably and reflects regional as well as religious influences. Ihram is typically worn during [[Dhu al-Hijjah]], the last month in the [[Islamic calendar]].

White also has a long history of use as a religious and political symbol in Islam, beginning with the white banner that tradition ascribes to the [[Quraysh]], the tribe to which [[Muhammad]] belonged. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad dynasty]] also used white as its dynastic colour, following the personal banner of its founder, [[Mu'awiya I]], while the [[Shi'ite]] [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] also chose white to highlight their opposition to the [[Sunni]] [[Abbasid Caliphate]], whose colour was black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In Judaism, during the rituals of [[Yom Kippur]], the ceremony of [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]], the [[rabbi]] dresses in white, as do the members of the congregation, to restore the bonds between God and his followers.

In the traditional Japanese religion of [[Shinto]], an area of white gravel or stones marks a sacred place, called a ''niwa''. These places were dedicated to the ''kami'', spirits which had descended from the heavens or had come across the sea. Later, temples of [[Zen Buddhism]] in Japan often featured a [[Zen garden]], where white sand or gravel was carefully raked to resemble rivers or streams, designed as objects of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;David and Michigo Young (2005), ''The Art of the Japanese Garden'', p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

In the temples of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church or also known as Mormon), White clothing is worn inside once they have been officially dedicated, due to white symbolizing purity.&lt;ref&gt;Whalen, William J. ''The Latter Day Saints in the Modern Day World'' 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religions symbolize heaven by using a sky with white clouds. This phenomenon is not limited to western culture; in [[Yoruba religion]], the orisha [[Obatala]] in the [[Ifá]] tradition is represented by white. Obatala is associated with calmness, morality, old age, and purity.

In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and similar religions, the [[deity|deities]] called the [[Great White Brotherhood]] are said to have white [[aura (paranormal)|auras]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare ''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America'' Summit University Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Asian and Slavic cultures, white is considered to be a color that represents death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; White also represented death in [[ancient Egypt]], representing the lifeless desert that covered much of the country; black was held to be the color of life, representing the mud-covered fertile lands created by the flooding of the [[Nile]] and giving the country its name (''Kemet'', or "black land").

In China, Korea, and some other Asian countries, white, or more precisely, the whitish color of undyed linen, is the color of mourning and funerals.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Eva, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'', Pyramyd. pp. 136–37&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional China, undyed linen clothing is worn at funerals. As time passes, the bereaved can gradually wear clothing dyed with colors, then with darker colors. Small sacks of [[quicklime]], one for each year of the life of the deceased are placed around the body to protect it against impurity in the next world, and white paper flowers are placed around the body.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China and other Asian countries, white is the color of reincarnation, showing that death is not a permanent separation from the world.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, white is associated with the masculine (the ''yang'' of the ''yin'' and ''yang''); with the [[unicorn]] and [[tiger]]; with the fur of an animal; with the direction of west; with the element metal; and with the [[autumn]] season.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, undyed linen white robes are worn by pilgrims for rituals of purification, and bathing in sacred rivers. In the mountains, pilgrims wear costumes of undyed [[jute]] to symbolize purity. A white kimono is often placed in the casket with the deceased for the journey to the other world, as white represents death sometimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In India, it is the color of purity, divinity, detachment and serenity. In Hindi, the name Sweta means white.

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], white robes were reserved for the lama of a monastery.

In the [[Bedouin]] and some other pastoral cultures, there is a strong connection between milk and white, which is considered the color of gratitude, esteem, joy, good fortune and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Varichon, (2000), ''Couleurs – pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', pp. 16–35.&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Political movements ===
[[File:Klan-in-gainesville.jpg|thumb|A [[cross burning]] by the racist [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Florida in the early 20th century.]]
White is often associated with [[monarchism]]. The association originally came from the white flag of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasty of France. White became the banner of the royalist rebellions against the [[French Revolution]] (see [[Revolt in the Vendée]]).

During the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] which followed the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the White Army, a coalition of monarchists, nationalists and liberals, fought unsuccessfully against the [[Red Army]] of the [[Bolsheviks]]. A similar battle between reds and whites took place during the [[Civil War in Finland]] in the same period.

The Ku Klux Klan is a [[racist]] and [[anti-immigrant]] organization which flourished in the [[Southern United States]] after the [[American Civil War]]. They wore white robes and hoods, burned crosses and violently attacked and murdered black Americans.

In Iran, the [[White Revolution]] was a series of social and political reforms launched in 1963 by the last [[Pahlavi dynasty|Shah]] of [[Iran]] before his downfall.

White is also associated with peace and passive resistance. The [[white ribbon]] is worn by movements denouncing [[violence against women]] and the [[White Rose]] was a non-violent [[Widerstand|resistance]] group in [[Nazi Germany]].

=== Selected national flags featuring white ===
White is a common color in national flags, though its symbolism varies widely.  The white in the [[flag of the United States]] and [[flag of the United Kingdom]] comes from traditional red [[St George's Cross]] on a white background of the historic [[flag of England]]. The white in the [[flag of France]] represents either the monarchy or "white, the ancient French color" according to the [[Marquis de Lafayette]].

Many flags in the Arab world use the colors of the [[flag of the Arab Revolt]] of 1916; red, white, green and black. These include the flags of [[Egypt]], [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Iraq]].

[[Philippines]] also use white as their symbol for unity in [[Flag of the Philippines|their flag]].

== Associations and symbolism ==
=== Innocence and sacrifice ===
In Western culture, white is the color most often associated with innocence, or purity.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques''.&lt;/ref&gt; In Biblical times, lambs and other white animals were sacrificed to expiate sins.  In Christianity Christ is considered the "lamb of God," who died for the sins of mankind. The white [[lily]] is considered the flower of purity and innocence, and is often associated with the [[Virgin Mary]].

=== Beginning and new ===
White is the color in Western culture most often associated with beginnings and the new. In Christianity, children are baptized wearing white, and, wear white for their first [[Eucharist|communion]]. Christ after his Resurrection is traditionally portrayed dressed in white. Eggs, another symbol of the new, are used to celebrate Easter.

The Queen of the United Kingdom traditionally wears white when she opens the session of Parliament. In high society, [[debutantes]] traditionally wear white for their first ball.

=== Weddings ===
White has long been the traditional color worn by brides at royal weddings, but the white wedding gown for ordinary people appeared in the 19th century. Before that time, most brides wore their best Sunday clothing, of whatever color.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp. 144–48&lt;/ref&gt; The white lace wedding gown of [[Queen Victoria]] in 1840 had a large impact on the color and fashion of wedding dresses in both Europe and America down to the present day.
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:MyBarong created this Custom tailored Barong Tagalog for my wedding.jpg|The [[Barong Tagalog]] is a traditional [[folk costume]] of the [[Philippines]]; this attire is worn on formal gatherings and weddings.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Cleanliness ===
White is the color most associated with cleanliness. Objects which are expected to be clean, such as refrigerators and dishes, toilets and sinks, bed linen and towels, are traditionally white. White was the traditional color of the coats of doctors, nurses, scientists and laboratory technicians, though nowadays a pale blue or green is often used. White is also the color most often worn by chefs, bakers, and butchers, and the color of the aprons of waiters in French restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ghosts, phantoms and two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ===
[[File:Apparition DB.JPG|thumb|The woman in white, a familiar figure in European ghost stories]]
[[File:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|The biblical ''Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse''. Conquest, with a bow, rides a white horse. Death rides a pale or light green horse (painting by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], 1887).]]
White is the color associated with [[ghost]]s and phantoms. In the past the dead were traditionally buried in a white shroud.  Ghosts are said to be the spirits of the dead who, for various reasons, are unable to rest or enter heaven, and so walk the earth in their white shrouds. White is also connected with the paleness of death. A common expression in English is "pale as a ghost."&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman in white, Weiße Frau, or ''dame blanche'' is a familiar figure in English, German and French ghost stories. She is a spectral apparition of a female clad in white, in most cases the ghost of an ancestor, sometimes giving warning about death and disaster. The most notable Weiße Frau is the legendary ghost of the German [[Hohenzollern]] dynasty.

Seeing a white horse in a dream is said to be presentiment of death.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Revelation]], the last book in the [[New Testament]] of the Bible, the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] are supposed to announce the [[Apocalypse]] before the [[Last Judgement]]. The man on a [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]] with a bow and arrow. according to different interpretations, represents either War and Conquest, the [[Antichrist]], or Christ himself, cleansing the world of sin. Death rides a horse whose color is described in ancient Greek as ''khlōros'' ([[wikt:χλωρός|χλωρός]]) in the original [[Koine Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codex-sinaiticus.net/en/manuscript.aspx?book=59&amp;chapter=6&amp;lid=en&amp;side=r&amp;verse=8&amp;zoomSlider=0 Codex Sinaiticus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030011038/http://www.codex-sinaiticus.net/en/manuscript.aspx?book=59&amp;chapter=6&amp;lid=en&amp;side=r&amp;verse=8&amp;zoomslider=0 |date=30 October 2013 }}, Rev 6:8.&lt;/ref&gt; which can mean either green/greenish-yellow or pale/pallid.&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxlwro%2Fs A Greek-English Lexicon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406225630/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxlwro%2Fs |date=6 April 2014 }}'': χλωρός.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black and white ===
{{Further information|Black-and-white dualism}}
[[File:Yin and Yang.svg|thumb|In [[Taoism]], white represents the ''yang'' or male energy, one of the two complementary natures of the universe.]]
Black and white often represent the contrast between light and darkness, day and night, male and female, good and evil.

In [[taoism]], the two complementary natures of the universe, [[yin and yang]], are often symbolized in black and white, Ancient games of strategy, such as [[Go (game)|go]] and [[chess]], use black and white to represent the two sides.

In the French monarchy, white symbolized the King and his power ''par la grâce de Dieu'' ("by the grace of God") and in contrast black was the color of the queen who according to the Salic Law which excluded women from the throne (and thus from power) could never become the ruling monarch.

Black and white also often represent formality and seriousness, as in the costumes of judges and priests, business suits, of formal evening dress. Monks of the [[Dominican Order]] wear a black cloak over a white habit. Until 1972 agents of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] were informally required by FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to wear white shirts with their suits, to project the correct image of the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;Lydon, Christopher, "J. Edgar Hoover Made the FBI Formidable With Politics, Publicity and Results," ''The New York Times'' obituary, 3 May 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names taken from white ===
White is the source of more names for women in western countries than any other color.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la Couleur – effets et symboliques'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Names taken from white include Alba, Albine (Latin). Blandine, Blanche and Blanchette (French); Bianca (Italian); Jennifer (Celt); Genevieve, Candice (from Latin Candida); Fenela, Fiona and Finola (Irish); Gwendoline, Gwenael, Nol(g)wen (''white woman'') (Celt), Nives (Spanish) and Zuria (Basque).{{Sfn|Heller|2000|pages=133–34}}

In addition many names come from white flowers: Camille, Daisy, Lily, Lili, Magnolie, Jasmine, Yasemine, Leila, Marguerite, Rosalba, and others.

Other names come from the white [[pearl]]; Pearl, Margarita (Latin), Margaret, Margarethe, Marga, Grete, Rita, Gitta, Marjorie, Margot.

=== Temples, churches and government buildings ===
Since ancient times, temples, churches, and many government buildings in many countries have traditionally been white, the color associated with religious and civic virtue. The [[Parthenon]] and other ancient temples of Greece, and the buildings of the [[Roman Forum]] were mostly made of or clad in white marble, though it is now known that some of these ancient buildings were actually brightly painted.&lt;ref&gt;John Gage (1993), ''Couleur et Culture'', pp. 11–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman tradition of using white stone for government buildings and churches was revived in the Renaissance and especially in the [[neoclassic style]] of the 18th and 19th centuries. White stone became the material of choice for government buildings in Washington D.C. and other American cities. European cathedrals were also usually built of white or light-colored stone, though many darkened over the centuries from smoke and soot.

The Renaissance architect and scholar [[Leon Battista Alberti]] wrote in 1452 that churches should be plastered white on the inside, since white was the only appropriate color for reflection and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi, ''Color in Art'' (2012), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Reformation, [[Calvinist]] churches in the [[Netherlands]] were whitewashed and sober inside, a tradition that was also followed in the [[Protestant]] churches of New England, such as [[Old North Church]] in [[Boston]].

=== Ethnography ===
People of the [[Caucasian race]] are often referred to simply as white. The [[United States Census Bureau]] defines [[white people]] as those "having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes people who reported "white" or wrote in entries such as Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Near Easterner, Arab, or Polish."&lt;ref name=Census&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; White people constitute the majority of the U.S. population, with a total of 223,553,265 or 72% of the population in the [[2010 United States Census]].

=== White flag ===
A [[white flag]] has long been used to represent either surrender or a request for a truce.  It is believed to have originated in the 15th century, during the [[Hundred Years' War]] between France and England, when multicolored flags, as well as firearms, came into common use by European armies.  The white flag was officially recognized as a request to cease hostilities by the [[Geneva Convention]] of 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vexillology and heraldry ===
In English [[heraldry]], white or [[silver (color)|silver]] signified brightness, purity, virtue, and innocence.&lt;ref&gt;''American Girls Handy Book: How to Amuse Yourself and Others'', by Adelia Beard. {{ISBN|978-0-87923-666-3}}, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Brooke Thomas Trego''' (15 September, 1858 &amp;ndash; 24 June, 1909) was an [[United States|American]] [[Painting|painter]] best known for his historical [[Military art|military subjects]], in particular scenes of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]] and [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michenermuseum.org/bucksartists/artist.php?artist=281&amp;page=1191 James A. Michener Art Museum: Bucks County Artists - William B. T. Trego]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
William B. T. Trego was born in [[Yardley, Pennsylvania|Yardley]], [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1858, the son of the artist [[Jonathan Kirkbridge Trego]] and Emily Roberts née Thomas. At the age of two William's hands and feet became nearly paralyzed, either from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], or from a doctor administering a dose of [[calomel]] (mercurous chloride). Trego's family moved to Detroit in 1874 where William was enrolled in the local school, but an incident where 16-year-old William burned off all his hair with a [[Gas lighting|gas jet]] made his father decide to teach William in his studio from then on. Despite his crippled hands, young William showed an aptitude for art, learning to paint with a brush jammed in his right hand while he guided it with his left.&lt;ref name=battery&gt;Battery B, 4th U.S. Light Artillery [http://www.batteryb.com/trego.html William B.T. Trego]&lt;/ref&gt; William Trego first received public attention when he exhibited a painting titled ''The Charge of Custer at Winchester'' in 1879 at the [[Michigan State Fair]]. His depiction of [[George Armstrong Custer]]'s charge at the [[Third Battle of Winchester]] was described by the ''[[Cleveland Press]]'' as "one of the best historical paintings of the kind that has ever been produced by an American artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A historical account of the Trego family|page =71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9ZJZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA71|year=1884|publisher=Press of I. Freidenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania Academy years===
[[File:Battery of Light Artillery en Route William T Trego 1883.png|thumb|left|300px|''Battery of Light Artillery en Route'' (1882)]]
Later that year, Trego used the proceeds from the sale of ''The Charge of Custer at Winchester'' to enroll himself at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gratzgallery.com/artist_trego.html Gratz Gallery bio - William Trego]&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at PAFA for three years under [[Thomas Eakins]], in courses that included instruction on aspects of the human figure, including anatomical study of the human and animal body and surgical dissection. Trego did not appreciate Eakins' rigorous, terse teaching style, and would later remark:
:"''Fortunately for myself I was drilled in the principles of drawing in my father's studio before I went to the Academy, so that I was able to some extent to brave the sarcasm and neglect of Eakins''"&lt;ref name="tfaoi.com"&gt;[http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/8aa/8aa147.htm http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/8aa/8aa147.htm "The Artist as Interpreter of American History"] by Mark Thistlethwaite excerpted from the exhibition catalogue "In This Academy: The Pennsylvanian Academy of the Fine Arts 1805 - 1976"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The March to Valley Forge William Trego.png|thumb|right|300px|''The March to Valley Forge'' (1883), [[Museum of the American Revolution]]]]
In an 1882 Academy exhibition, Trego won the first Toppan Prize for his work, ''Battery of Light Artillery en Route,'' and the painting was subsequently purchased for the Academy by [[Fairman Rogers]]. In 1883, Trego received what he thought was a snub from the Academy when the art jury for the Temple Competition of Historical Paintings, a competition intended to help revive historical painting by limiting entries to depictions of the American War of Independence",&lt;ref name="tfaoi.com"/&gt; decided there were no paintings of sufficient quality to merit a 1st or second place, and awarded Trego 3rd place for his painting of [[George Washington]] and his troops called ''The March to Valley Forge''.&lt;ref&gt;note: This painting has many titles including "The March to Valley Forge", "Washington Reviewing His Troops At Valley Forge" and "Washington reviewing his Ragged Army at Valley Forge"&lt;/ref&gt; Trego sued the Academy on the grounds that if his painting was the best overall, it should receive first place (and he should get the $3,000 prize money). In 1886, he lost the case, with the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] ruling the jury was well within their rights under the contract of the exhibit to award prizes as they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/20092259 Patronage Gone Awry: The 1883 Temple Competition of Historical Paintings], by Mark Thistlethwaite, 1988, Historical Society of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Wales studio===
[[File:Civil War Battle Scene 1887 William T Trego.png|thumb|left|250px|''Civil War Battle Scene'', (1887) an example of Trego's realistic depiction of battle.]]
After leaving the Academy, Trego lived in [[North Wales, Pennsylvania]], with his mother and father. Except for trips abroad, Trego would live in North Wales for the rest of his life, working in a studio behind his house. He used the town residents, their horses, and the surrounding landscape as models and backdrops for his paintings. Trego was becoming well known for the accuracy of his military depictions as well as the honest, sometimes brutal realism, especially in his Civil War subjects&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the American Civil War, by David Stephen Heidler, Jeanne T. Heidler, David J. Coles, page 117 [https://books.google.com/?id=SdrYv7S60fgC&amp;pg=PA117 Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil War works were well received and Trego had much success selling paintings during that time.

===Paris studies===
[[File:The Color Guard - William B. T. Trego (1888).jpg|thumb|''The Color Guard'', French [[dragoon]]s, 1888.]]
In 1887, he went to Paris to study at the [[Académie Julian]] under the [[France|French]] [[Academic art|academic painter]]s [[Tony Robert-Fleury]] and [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. Trego studied at the French museums while he was there and enjoyed the Paris night life with other Pennsylvania Academy alumni such as [[Robert Henri]], [[Augustus B. Koopman]], [[Henry McCarter]], and [[Frederick J. Waugh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williamtrego.com/documents_images.htm The William B.T. Trego Centenary Project - Documents and Images]&lt;/ref&gt; Trego also participated in the [[Paris Salon]]s of 1889 and 1890, gaining some recognition for his 1889 submission, a military painting titled ''The End of the Charge of von Bredow’s Brigade at Rezonville'' depicting German cavalry units charge against French during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. One French writer thought this work put Trego on par with the famous French academic military artist, [[Édouard Detaille]].&lt;ref&gt;William Brooke Thomas Trego (1858-1909), The End of the Charge - [http://www.williamttrego.org/The_End_of_the_Charge.html williamttrego.org]&lt;/ref&gt; On his ocean voyage home from Paris in 1890, Trego returned to America not only with new found knowledge of French academic painting, he also returned with a French fiancée. But in a sad and very public event on board ship, the "handsome French girl" (as reported in the newspapers of the time)&lt;ref&gt;The Washington Post [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/229314222.html?dids=229314222:229314222&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Aug+4%2C+1890&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++(1877-1954)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=7&amp;desc=RIVAL+ARTISIS+IN+LOVE transcript "Rival Artists in Love - ''The Parisian Romance in Which Two Young Philadelphians Figured''"], Aug 4, 1890&lt;/ref&gt; switched her affections to fellow Académie Julian student&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Robert Henri|author=Bennard B.

===Later years===
After his return to the States, Trego's work received much acclaim from critics. In 1891, noted American art collector [[Thomas Benedict Clarke]] wrote of Trego:

:"''In the accomplishment of his work, which is marked by strength, firmness, and force, he has had to overcome physical infirmities that would have made a less brave and earnest character halt at the threshold''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalogue of the Thomas B.

Despite these accolades and the prestige of exhibiting in the Paris Salon, Trego found it hard to sell paintings due to the declining in popularity of [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] military artwork. He painted portraits and [[genre painting]]s to make money and took on work doing book and magazine illustration. He also tried unsuccessfully to become an instructor at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He lived with, and was supported by, his parents during the 1890s. Trego's father died in 1901 and his stepmother died six years later. Trego's increasing financial problems during this time made him take on students including [[Walter Emerson Baum]] and his wife, Flora. Trego tried to revive his career by basing a painting on the popular novel ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben Hur]]'' with one of his last works, ''The Chariot Race from Ben Hur'' (1908). He sent it to the 1909 [[National Academy of Design]] exhibition in New York but it failed to spark any interest.&lt;ref&gt;William Brooke Thomas Trego (1858-1909), ''The Chariot Race from Ben Hur'' [http://www.williamttrego.org/Chariot_Race.html williamttrego.org]&lt;/ref&gt; William Trego was found unconscious in his studio on June 24, 1909 and was dead by the time the doctor arrived.

During his lifetime, Trego had painted over 200 historical and military paintings. These would become so widely published after his death that writer [[Edwin Augustus Peeples]] commented: 
:"''There is probably not an American History book which doesn't have (a) Trego picture in it''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michenermuseum.org/bucksartists/artist.php?artist=281&amp;page=1191 michenermuseum.org - William B. T. Trego]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1976, Trego's ''The March to Valley Forge'' had become such an iconic image of that event that it was reproduced as a souvenir postage sheet issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] as part of the observance of the [[United States Bicentennial]]. It is currently on loan from the [[Museum of the American Revolution]] to [[Valley Forge National Historical Park]].

A book was published about Trego's life, So Bravely and So Well: The Life and Art of William T. Trego, by Joseph P. Eckhardt, in 2011.
