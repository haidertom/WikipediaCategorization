The '''Animals in War Memorial''' is a [[war memorial]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London. It is located on [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]], at the junction with [[Brook Street|Upper Brook Street]], on the eastern edge of the park.

The memorial was designed by English sculptor David Backhouse to commemorate the countless animals that have served and died under British military command throughout history. It was unveiled in November 2004 by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne, the Princess Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2004/11/09/david_backhouse_animals_in_war_feature.shtml "Somerset sculptor designs Animals in War memorial"], ''BBC'', 25/11/04&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The memorial was inspired by [[Jilly Cooper]]'s book ''Animals in War'', and was made possible by a specially created fund of £1.4 million from public donations of which Cooper was a co-trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| title = Animals in War Memorial
| url = http:derpo.uk/Events-Review/animals-in-war-memorial
| accessdate = 2008-01-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The memorial consists of a 55&amp;nbsp;ft by 58&amp;nbsp;ft (16.8&amp;nbsp;m by 17.7&amp;nbsp;m) curved [[Portland stone]] wall: the symbolic arena of war,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt; emblazoned with images of various struggling animals, along with two heavily laden bronze mules progressing up the stairs of the monument, and a bronze horse and bronze dog beyond it looking into the distance. The horse was modelled on a retired Charger from The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery called Ben Bragg.

The Animals in War Memorial was officially opened on 24 November 2004 by [[Anne, Princess Royal]].

In May 2013 it was one of two London war memorials vandalised on the same night. The word '[[Islam]]' was spray-painted on it causing £2,766 in damage, and the nearby [[RAF Bomber Command Memorial]] suffered £6,500 in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-22678874 | title=Vandals deface war memorials in London parks | work=BBC News | date=2013-05-27 | accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 31-year-old man later admitted to vandalising the memorials and was charged for a total of 94 vandalism and destruction of property offences carried out over several weeks against homes, cars, memorials and a church, causing over £50,000 in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robson|first1=Steve|title=Vandal admits painting 'Islam' on war memorial days after murder of Lee Rigby|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/andrew-patterson-admits-painting-islam-3477896|work=mirror|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inscriptions ==

Beneath the main header, "Animals in War", the memorial has two separate inscriptions; the first and larger reads:

"This monument is dedicated to all the animals&lt;br&gt;
that served and died alongside British and allied forces&lt;br&gt;
in wars and campaigns throughout time."

The second, shorter but larger in font inscription simply reads:&lt;br&gt;
"They had no choice."

Upon the rear or outside of the memorial are these words:

"Many and various animals were employed to support British and Allied Forces in wars and campaigns over the centuries, and as a result millions died. From the pigeon to the elephant, they all played a vital role in every region of the world in the cause of human freedom.&lt;br&gt;
Their contribution must never be forgotten."

'''Apollonius of Tyre''' is the subject of an ancient short novella, popular in the Middle Ages.  Existing in numerous forms in many languages, the text is thought to be translated from an ancient Greek manuscript, now lost.

==Plot summary==

In most versions, the eponymous hero is hunted and persecuted after he reveals Antiochus of Antioch's [[incestuous]] relationship with his daughter. After many travels and adventures, in which Apollonius loses both his wife and his daughter and thinks them both dead, he is eventually reunited with his family through unlikely circumstances or intercession by gods. In some English versions Apollonius is shipwrecked and becomes a tutor to a princess who falls in love with him, and the good king gradually discovers his daughter's wishes. The major themes are the punishment of inappropriate lust&amp;mdash;the incestuous king invariably comes to a bad end&amp;mdash;and the ultimate rewards of love and fidelity.

==Origins (Latin and Greek?)==

The story is first mentioned in Latin by [[Venantius Fortunatus]] in his ''Carmina'' (Bk. vi. 8, 11. 5–6) during the late 6th century;&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apollonius of Tyre|volume=2|pages=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is conjectured, based on similarities with the ''[[Ephesian Tale]]'' of [[Xenophon of Ephesus]] and the presence of idioms awkward in Latin but typical in Greek, that the original was a [[Greek language|Greek]] romance of the third century.&lt;ref name = Gill&gt;Stuart Gillespie, ''Shakespeare's Books'' (2001) p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Some fragments of Greek romance, however, point to the possibility of an even older date.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'', New York Burt Franklin, 1963, p. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest manuscripts of the tale, in a Latin version, date from the 9th or 10th century but are from late antiquity. Thus they show an intersection of Greek and Roman as well as pre-Christian and Christian influences.&lt;ref&gt;Stelios Panayotakis, [http://www.fiec2009.org/proposals/panayotakis.pdf "Figuring the Body in ''The Story of Apollonius, King of Tyre''."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726052614/http://www.fiec2009.org/proposals/panayotakis.pdf |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the work is classed with other ancient Greek romance novels.&lt;ref&gt;B. P. Reardon, editor, ''Collected Ancient Greek Novels'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars hold that the [[riddle]]s with which the king tests the hero in many versions may be a later addition:&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, op. cit., p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; ten derive from the c. fourth-century Latin riddle-collection attributed to [[Symphosius]].&lt;ref&gt;Chauncey E. Finch, 'Codex Vat. Barb. Lat. 721 as a Source for the Riddles of Symphosius', ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'', 98 (1967), 173-79 (p. 173); DOI: 10.2307/2935872; https://www.jstor.org/stable/2935872.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars believe the incest story to have been a later addition as well, though others, including Elizabeth Archibald, see it as an integral thematic element of the tale.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Archibald, ''Apollonius of Tyre: Medieval and Renaissance Themes and Variations'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widespread Latin versions are those of [[Gottfried von Viterbo]], who incorporated it into his ''[[Pantheon (book)|Pantheon]]'' of 1185 as if it were actual history, ''Historia Apollonii regis Tyri'' and a version in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, op. cit., p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
'Fifty to a hundred versions' of the story are known from antiquity into the early modern period, mostly European, including texts in English, Dutch, German, Danish, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Greek, and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Goldberg, ''Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851'', Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest vernacular translation is an incomplete [[Old English language|Old English]] prose text from the 11th century, sometimes called the first [[English novel]]. The existence of this unique text is unusual, as secular prose fiction from that time is extremely rare. The manuscript copy may only have survived because it was bound into a book together with Archbishop Wulfstan's homilies.&lt;ref&gt;Goolden, Peter ''The Old English Apollonius of Tyre'' Oxford University Press 1958 xxxii-xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; Various versions of the tale were later written in most European languages.

A notable English version is in the eighth book of [[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (1390), which uses it as an [[exemplum]] against [[lust]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  It is described as being based on ''Pantheon'', but it contains many details that work does not but the old ''Historia'' does.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p165–6 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;

Its numerous vernacular versions, along with the Latin ones, attest to its popularity throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p165 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in an old Danish ballad collected in ''[[Danmarks gamle Folkeviser]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Laura A. Hibbard, ''Medieval Romance in England'' p168 New York Burt Franklin,1963&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Copland]] translated from the French the romance of ''Kynge Appolyne of Thyre'' (W. de Worde, 1510).

==Later versions and influence==

The story was retold in thirteenth-century [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]] as ''[[Libro de Apolonio]]''.

Robert Copland wrote an early 16th-century prose version.

[[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' was based in part on Gower's version, with the change of name probably inspired by [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|Arcadia]]''.  ''Apollonius of Tyre'' was also a source for his plays ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4873">[[File:Arrivas House.jpg|thumb|Arrivas House, 2018]]
The Arrivas House is located at 46 St. George Street, [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. It was the first completed restoration project of the [[Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board]] (HSAPB), and was named after early owner Don Raimundo de Arrivas. 

== History ==
It is believed that the first building on this property dates back as early as 1650-1680, and was built of ripio, a shell concrete mixture. The original structure was replaced around 1725 with a building made of [[coquina]].  Don Raimundo de Arrivas is listed as the owner of the property on a 1764 map, which was created as an inventory of buildings that the Spanish compiled for the British when Florida became a colony of Great Britain. 

During the [[History of Florida|British Period]], the property was placed in the charge of a British agent, [[Jesse Fish]]. The property later reverted to the Arrivas heirs when Florida was regained by Spain in [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783]]. A 1788 map shows that the building had evolved into a large L-shaped masonry house, very similar to the structure that stands today. From 1824 until 1960 ownership changed over 20 times, with several architectural changes made, including the addition of a second story and balconies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide Book: Including Descriptions of the Buildings, Crafts, and a Brief History of the Restoration of the Nation's Oldest City|last=Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board|first=|publisher=Department of Cultural Affairs, Department of State, State of Florida|year=1971|isbn=|location=Tallahassee, Florida|pages=25-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Arnau, St. Augustine Collector of Customs and Superintendent of Lighthouses, was another notable resident of the Arrivas House. While St. Augustine was under [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] control, he oversaw the darkening of the St. Augustine Lighthouse and removed its lighting apparatus.  In November 1861, Arnau was elected mayor, a post he resigned when the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] took control of the town.  He was imprisoned until lighting mechanisms, which he had stored in his home, were returned to the Union Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vivaflorida.org/Explore/Historic-and-Archaeological-Sites/Arrivas-House|title=Arrivas House / Historic and Archaeological Sites / Explore / Home - Viva Florida|website=vivaflorida.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board purchased the Arrivas House in July 1960, and set out to restore the structure to its [[History of Florida|Second Spanish Period]] appearance. It was the first restoration project they undertook in preparation for St. Augustine’s 400th Anniversary celebration in 1965. Work began on the home in January 1961, and was formally dedicated on March 11, 1963. Then Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] visited St. Augustine to mark the occasion, and gave a speech to the city from the Arrivas House balcony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/USACH00499/00010|title=Importance Of Restoration Cited By Vice President In Speech Climaxing Dedication|website=ufdc.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arrivas House served as an interpreted historic site run by the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board, where costumed docents demonstrated typical activities of Spanish colonial women. This included spinning, weaving, and candle making. The second story briefly served as administrative offices for the Preservation Board. 

The Arrivas House was documented as part of the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] in 1960. Complete documentation is available on the [[Library of Congress]]'s online catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/hh/item/fl0198/|title=Don Raimundo Arrivas House, 44 South George Street, Saint Augustine, St. Johns County, FL|last=Survey|first=Historic American Buildings|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Present Day ==
Today, the Arrivas House is a commercial retail space, owned by the State of Florida and managed by [[University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc.|University of Florida Historic St. Augustine, Inc]]. It is operated by The Panama Hat Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mypanamahat.com/|title=The Panama Hat Company {{!}} St. Augustine, FL since 1985|website=www.mypanamahat.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4511">Art competitions were held as part of the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism.  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

[[File:Relieur JPG01.jpg|thumb|A traditional bookbinder at work]]
[[File:Bookbinders type holder (1).jpg|thumb|Bookbinders type holder]]

'''Bookbinding''' is the process of physically assembling a [[book]] of [[codex]] format from an ordered stack of [[paper]] sheets that are folded together into sections or sometimes left as a stack of individual sheets. The stack is then bound together along one edge by either sewing with thread through the folds or by a layer of flexible adhesive. Alternative methods of binding that are cheaper but less permanent include loose-leaf rings, individual screw posts or binding posts, twin loop spine coils, plastic spiral coils, and plastic spine combs. For protection, the bound stack is either wrapped in a flexible cover or attached to stiff boards. Finally, an attractive cover is adhered to the boards, including identifying information and  decoration. Book artists or specialists in book decoration can also greatly enhance a book's content by creating book-like objects with artistic merit of exceptional quality.

Before the computer age, the bookbinding trade involved two divisions. First, there was '''[[Stationery]]''' binding (known as [[vellum]] binding in the trade) that deals with books intended for handwritten entries such as accounting ledgers, business journals, blank books, and guest log books, along with other general office stationery such as [[notebook|note books]], manifold books, day books, diaries, portfolios, etc.  Computers have now replaced the pen and paper based accounting that constituted most of the stationery binding industry. Second was '''[[letterpress printing|Letterpress]]''' binding which deals with making books intended for reading, including [[library binding]], fine binding, edition binding, and publisher's bindings.{{sfn|Vaughan|1950|p=xi}} A third division deals with the repair, restoration, and conservation of old used bindings.

Today, modern bookbinding is divided between '''hand binding''' by individual craftsmen working in a shop and '''commercial bindings''' mass-produced by high-speed machines in a factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a bindery shop varies with job types, for example, from one-of-a-kind custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large-run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. For the largest numbers of copies, commercial binding is effected by production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory.

==Overview==
Bookbinding is a specialized trade that relies on basic operations of measuring, cutting, and gluing. A finished book might need dozens of operations to complete, according to the specific style and materials. Bookbinding combines skills from other trades such as paper and fabric crafts, leather work, model making, and graphic arts. It requires knowledge about numerous varieties of book structures along with all the internal and external details of assembly. A working knowledge of the materials involved is required. A book craftsman needs a minimum set of hand tools but with experience will find an extensive collection of secondary hand tools and even items of heavy equipment that are valuable for greater speed, accuracy, and efficiency.

Bookbinding is an artistic craft of great antiquity, and at the same time, a highly mechanized industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.{{sfn|Robinson|1968|p=9}}

===Origins of the book===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|The binding of a Chinese bamboo book ([[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'')]]
The craft of bookbinding probably originated in [[India]], where religious [[sutra]]s were copied on to palm leaves (cut into two, lengthwise) with a metal stylus. The leaf was then dried and rubbed with ink, which would form a stain in the wound. The finished leaves were given numbers, and two long twines were threaded through each end through wooden boards, making a [[Palm-leaf manuscript|palm-leaf book]]. When the book was closed, the excess twine would be wrapped around the boards to protect the manuscript leaves. Buddhist monks took the idea through Afghanistan to China in the first century BC.

Similar techniques can also be found in ancient Egypt where priestly texts were compiled on scrolls and books of papyrus. Another version of bookmaking can be seen through the ancient [[Mayan codex]]; only four are known to have survived the Spanish invasion of Latin America.

Writers in the Hellenistic-Roman culture wrote longer texts as [[scroll]]s; these were stored in boxes or shelving with small cubbyholes, similar to a modern winerack. Court records and notes were written on [[wax tablet]]s, while important documents were written on [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]]. The modern English word ''book'' comes from the Proto-Germanic ''*bokiz'', referring to the beechwood on which early written works were recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|book|accessdate=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was not needed in ancient times, as many early Greek texts—scrolls—were 30 pages long, which were customarily folded accordion-fashion to fit into the hand. Roman works were often longer, running to hundreds of pages. The Greeks used to call their books ''tome'', meaning "to cut". The Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]] was a massive 200 pages long and was used in funerary services for the deceased. [[Torah]] scrolls, editions of the Jewish holy book, were—and still are—also held in special holders when read.

Scrolls can be rolled in one of two ways. The first method is to wrap the scroll around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text at the end of the scroll, the entire scroll must be unwound. This is partially overcome in the second method, which is to wrap the scroll around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double scroll, the text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of the scroll not being read can remain wound. This still leaves the scroll a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.

===Early book formats===
[[File:Ezra Codex Amiantinus.jpg|thumb|Early medieval [[bookcase]] containing about ten codices depicted in the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]'' ({{circa}} 700)]]

In addition to the scroll, [[wax tablet]]s were commonly used in Antiquity as a writing surface.  [[Diptych]]s and later [[polyptych]] formats were often hinged together along one edge, analogous to the spine of modern books, as well as a folding ''concertina'' format.  Such a set of simple wooden boards sewn together was called by the Romans a [[codex]] (pl. codices)—from the Latin word ''caudex'', meaning "the trunk" of a tree, around the first century AD. Two ancient polyptychs, a ''pentaptych'' and ''octoptych'', excavated at [[Herculaneum]] employed a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on thongs or cords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Pugliese Carratelli|first=Giovanni |encyclopedia=Pompeiana: raccolta di studi per il secondo centenario degli di Pompei |title=L'Instrumentum Scriptorium nei Monumenti Pompeiani ed Ercolanesi |year=1950 |pages=166–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the first century, a kind of folded parchment notebook called ''pugillares membranei'' in Latin, became commonly used for writing throughout the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Roberts|Skeat|1987|pp=15–22}} This term was used by both the pagan [[Roman literature|Roman poet]] [[Martial]] and [[Christian]] [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul the Apostle]]. Martial used the term with reference to gifts of literature exchanged by Romans during the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. According to T. C. Skeat, "in at least three cases and probably in all, in the form of codices" and he theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then "must have spread rapidly to the Near East".{{sfn|Skeat|2004|p=45}} In his discussion of one of the earliest pagan parchment codices to survive from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat's notion when stating "its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory" and that "early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first= Eric |title=The Typology of the Early Codex |year=1977 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn= 0-8122-7696-5 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early intact codices were discovered at [[Nag Hammadi]] in Egypt.  Consisting of primarily Gnostic texts in Coptic, the books were mostly written on [[papyrus]], and while many are single-quire, a few are multi-quire.  Codices were a significant improvement over papyrus or vellum scrolls in that they were easier to handle. However, despite allowing writing on both sides of the leaves, they were still foliated—numbered on the leaves, like the Indian books. The idea spread quickly through the early churches, and the word ''Bible'' comes from the town where the Byzantine monks established their first [[scriptorium]], [[Byblos]], in modern Lebanon. The idea of numbering each side of the page—Latin ''pagina'', "to fasten"—appeared when the text of the individual testaments of the Bible were combined and text had to be searched through more quickly. This book format became the preferred way of preserving manuscript or printed material.

===Development===

The [[codex]]-style book, using sheets of either [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] (before the spread of Chinese [[papermaking]] outside of [[Imperial China]]), was invented in the [[Roman Empire]] during the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Colin H|last2=Skeat|first2=TC|title=The Birth of the Codex|year=1983|publisher=British Academy|location= London|isbn=0-19-726061-6|pages=15–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; First described by the poet [[Martial]] from [[Roman Spain]], it largely replaced earlier writing mediums such as [[wax tablet]]s and [[scroll]]s by the year 300 AD.&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Codex" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 473. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century AD, the scroll and wax tablet had been completely replaced by the codex in the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skeat|first= T.C.|title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C. Skeat.|year=2004|publisher=E.J.

Western books from the fifth century onwards{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} were bound between hard covers, with pages made from parchment folded and sewn onto strong cords or ligaments that were attached to wooden boards and covered with leather. Since early books were exclusively handwritten on handmade materials, sizes and styles varied considerably, and there was no standard of uniformity.  Early and medieval codices were bound with flat spines, and it was not until the fifteenth century that books began to have the rounded spines associated with hardcovers today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenfield |first=Jane |title=ABC of Bookbinding |year=2002 |publisher=Oak Knoll Press |location=New Castle, DE |isbn=1-884718-41-8 |pages=79–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the vellum of early books would react to humidity by swelling, causing the book to take on a characteristic wedge shape, the wooden covers of medieval books were often secured with straps or clasps. These straps, along with metal bosses on the book's covers to keep it raised off the surface that it rests on, are collectively known as furniture.{{sfn|Harthan|1950|p=8}}

The earliest surviving European bookbinding is the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] of about 700, in red goatskin, now in the [[British Library]], whose decoration includes raised patterns and coloured tooled designs.  Very grand manuscripts for liturgical rather than library use had covers in [[metalwork]] called [[treasure binding]]s, often studded with gems and incorporating [[ivory]] relief panels or enamel elements.  Very few of these have survived intact, as they have been broken up for their precious materials, but a fair number of the ivory panels have survived, as they were hard to recycle; the divided panels from the [[Codex Aureus of Lorsch]] are among the most notable.  The 8th century [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]] were given a new gold relief cover in about 1500, and the [[Lindau Gospels]] (now [[Morgan Library]], New York) have their original cover from around 800.{{sfn|Harthan|1950|pp=8–9}}

Luxury medieval books for the library had leather covers decorated, often all over, with tooling (incised lines or patterns), [[blind stamp]]s, and often small metal pieces of furniture.  Medieval stamps showed animals and figures as well as the vegetal and geometric designs that would later dominate book cover decoration.  Until the end of the period books were not usually stood up on shelves in the modern way. The most functional books were bound in plain white [[vellum]] over boards, and had a brief title hand-written on the spine. Techniques for fixing [[gold leaf]] under the tooling and stamps were imported from the Islamic world in the 15th century, and thereafter the gold-tooled leather binding has remained the conventional choice for high quality bindings for collectors, though cheaper bindings that only used gold for the title on the spine, or not at all, were always more common. Although the arrival of the printed book vastly increased the number of books produced in Europe, it did not in itself change the various styles of binding used, except that vellum became much less used.{{sfn|Harthan|1950|pp=8–11}}

===Introduction of paper===
{{expand section|date=February 2013}}

Although early, coarse [[hemp]]en paper had existed in China during the [[Western Han]] period (202 BC - 9 AD), the [[Han dynasty|Eastern-Han]] Chinese court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] (ca. 50 AD&amp;nbsp;– 121 AD) introduced the first significant improvement and standardization of papermaking by adding essential new materials into its composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=38-41|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 8th century [[Arab]]s learned the arts of papermaking from the Chinese and were then the first to bind [[paper]] into books at the start of the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hassani, Woodcock and Saoud, "1001 Inventions, Muslim heritage in Our World", FSTC Publishing, 2006, reprinted 2007, pp.218–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Particular skills were developed for [[Arabic calligraphy]], [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and bookbinding. The people who worked in making books were called ''Warraqin'' or paper professionals. The Arabs made books lighter—sewn with silk and bound with leather covered paste boards, they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed. The production of books became a real industry and cities like [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]], had a street named ''Kutubiyyin'' or book sellers, which contained more than 100 bookshops in the 12th century. The famous [[Koutoubia Mosque]] is named so because of its location on this street. Because the [[Qur'an]] itself was considered a sacred object, in order to beautify the book containing the holy scripture, a culture of calligraphy and lavish bookbinding developed.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Don, "The golden age of Islamic bookbinding", ''Ahlan Wasahlan'', (Public Relations Div., Saudi Arabian Airlines, Jeddah), 1984. pp. 13–15, at p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Traditional Chinese bookbinding|Bookbinding in medieval China]] replaced traditional Chinese writing supports such as [[bamboo and wooden slips]], as well as [[History of silk|silk]] and paper scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|page=227|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the codex in [[History of China|China]] began with folded-leaf [[pamphlet]]s in the 9th century AD, during the late [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD), improved by the 'butterfly' bindings of the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), the wrapped back binding of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368), the stitched binding of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368-1644 AD) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1644-1912), and finally the adoption of Western-style bookbinding in the 20th century (coupled with the European [[printing press]] that replaced [[History of printing|traditional Chinese printing methods]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227-229|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial phase of this evolution, the accordion-folded palm-leaf-style book, most likely came from [[India]] and was introduced to China via [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist missionaries and scriptures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227-229|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the arrival (from the East) of [[Cotton paper|rag paper]] manufacturing in Europe in the late [[Middle Ages]] and the use of the [[printing press]] beginning in the mid-15th century, bookbinding began to standardize somewhat, but page sizes still varied considerably.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the early sixteenth century, the Italian printer [[Aldus Manutius]] realized that personal books would need to fit in saddle bags and thus produced books in the smaller formats of ''[[quarto]]s'' (one-quarter-size pages) and ''[[octavo]]s'' (one-eighth-size pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/libraries-books-and-printing-biographies/aldus-manutius|title=Aldus Manutius facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Aldus Manutius|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2016-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With printing, the books became more accessible and were stored on their side on long shelves for the first time. Clasps were removed, and titles were added to the spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/11/12/a-brief-history-of-shelving-and-other-news/ | first=Dan | last=Piepenbring | date=12 November 2015 | title=A brief history of shelving, and other news | work=The Paris Review | access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leipzig]], a prominent centre of the German book-trade, in 1739 had 20 bookshops, 15 printing establishments, 22 book-binders and three type-foundries in a population of 28,000 people.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|p=269}}

In the German book-distribution system of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the end-user buyers of books "generally made separate arrangements with either the publisher or a bookbinder to have printed sheets bound according to their wishes and their budget".&lt;ref&gt;

The reduced cost of books facilitated cheap lightweight Bibles, made from tissue-thin oxford paper, with floppy covers, that resembled the early [[Arabic]] [[Quran]]s, enabling missionaries to take portable books with them around the world, and modern wood glues enabled the addition of paperback covers to simple glue bindings.

Some older presses could not separate the pages of a book, so readers used a [[paper knife]] to separate the outer edges of pages as a book was read.

==Modern commercial binding==
There are various commercial techniques in use today. Today, most commercially produced books belong to one of four categories:

===Hardcover binding===
A [[hardcover]], hardbound or hardback book has rigid covers and is stitched in the spine. Looking from the top of the spine, the book can be seen to consist of a number of [[#Terms and techniques|signatures]] bound together. When the book is opened in the middle of a signature, the binding threads are visible. Signatures of hardcover books are typically [[Octavo (text)|octavo]] (a single sheet folded three times), though they may also be folio, quarto, or 16mo (see [[Book size]]). Unusually large and heavy books are sometimes bound with wire.

Until the mid-20th century, covers of mass-produced books were laid with cloth, but from that period onward, most publishers adopted clothette, a kind of textured paper which vaguely resembles cloth but is easily differentiated on close inspection. Most cloth-bound books are now half-and-half covers with cloth covering only the spine. In that case, the cover has a paper overlap. The covers of modern hardback books are made of thick cardboard.

Some books that appeared in the mid-20th century signature-bound appear in reprinted editions in glued-together editions. Copies of such books stitched together in their original format are often difficult to find, and are much sought after for both aesthetic and practical reasons.

A variation of the hardcover which is more durable is the calf-binding, where the cover is either half or fully clad in [[leather]], usually from a [[calf]]. This is also called full-bound or, simply, leather bound.

[[Library binding]] refers to the [[hardcover]] binding of books intended for the rigors of [[library]] use and are largely [[Serial (literature)|serials]] and [[paperback]] publications. Though many publishers have started to provide "library binding" editions, many libraries elect to purchase paperbacks and have them rebound as hardcover books, resulting in longer life for the material.

====Methods of hardcover binding====
There are a number of methods used to bind hardcover books, from them:
# '''Case binding''' is the most common type of hardcover binding for books. The pages are arranged in signatures and glued together into a "textblock." The textblock is then attached to the cover or "case" which is made of cardboard covered with paper, cloth, vinyl or leather. This is also known as cloth binding, or edition binding.
# '''[[oversewn binding|Oversewing]]''', where the signatures of the book start off as loose pages which are then clamped together. Small vertical holes are punched through the far left-hand edge of each signature, and then the signatures are sewn together with lock-stitches to form the text block. Oversewing is a very strong method of binding and can be done on books up to five inches thick. However, the margins of oversewn books are reduced and the pages will not lie flat when opened.
# '''Sewing through the fold''' (also called '''Smyth Sewing'''), where the signatures of the book are folded and stitched through the fold. The signatures are then sewn and [[Adhesive|glued]] together at the spine to form a text block. In contrast to oversewing, through-the-fold books have wide margins and can open completely flat. Many varieties of sewing stitches exist, from basic links to the often used Kettle Stitch. While Western books are generally sewn through punched holes or sawed notches along the fold, some Asian bindings, such as the Retchoso or Butterfly Stitch of Japan, use small slits instead of punched holes.
# '''Double-fan adhesive binding''' starts off with two signatures of loose pages, which are run over a roller—"fanning" the pages—to apply a thin layer of glue to each page edge. Then the two signatures are perfectly aligned to form a text block, and glue edges of the text block are attached to a piece of cloth lining to form the spine. Double-fan adhesive bound books can open completely flat and have a wide margin. However, certain types of paper do not hold adhesive well, and, with wear and tear, the pages can come loose.&lt;ref name="Parisi"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parisi | first = Paul |date=February 1994 | title = Methods of Affixing Leaves: Options and Implications | journal = New Library Scene | volume = 13 | issue = 1  | pages = 8–11, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bookshop, Tokyo.JPG|thumb|Modern [[paperback]] spines]]

===Punch and bind===
Different types of the ''punch and bind'' binding include:
# [[Wire binding|'''Double wire''', '''twin loop''', or '''Wire-O''' binding]] is a type of binding that is used for books that will be viewed or read in an office or home type environment. The binding involves the use of a "C" shaped wire spine that is squeezed into a round shape using a wire closing device. Double wire binding allows books to have smooth crossover and is affordable in many colors. This binding is great for annual reports, owners manuals and software manuals. Wire bound books are made of individual sheets, each punched with a line of round or square holes on the binding edge. This type of binding uses either a 3:1 pitch hole pattern with three holes per inch or a 2:1 pitch hole pattern with two holes per inch. The three to one hole pattern is used for smaller books that are up to 9/16" in diameter while the 2:1 pattern is normally used for thicker books as the holes are slightly bigger to accommodate slightly thicker, stronger wire. Once punched, the back cover is then placed on to the front cover ready for the wire binding elements (double loop wire) to be inserted. The wire is then placed through the holes. The next step involves the binder holding the book by its pages and inserting the wire into a "closer" which is basically a vise that crimps the wire closed and into its round shape. The back page can then be turned back to its correct position, thus hiding the spine of the book.
# '''[[Comb binding]]''' uses a 9/16" pitch rectangular hole pattern punched near the bound edge. A curled plastic "comb" is fed through the slits to hold the sheets together. Comb binding allows a book to be disassembled and reassembled by hand without damage. Comb supplies are typically available in a wide range of colors and diameters. The supplies themselves can be re-used or recycled. In the United States, comb binding is often referred to as 19-ring binding because it uses a total of 19 holes along the 11-inch side of a sheet of paper.
# '''[[VeloBind]]''' is used to permanently rivet pages together using a plastic strip on the front and back of the document. Sheets for the document are punched with a line of holes near the bound edge. A series of pins attached to a plastic strip called a Comb feeds through the holes to the other side and then goes through another plastic strip called the receiving strip. The excess portion of the pins is cut off and the plastic heat-sealed to create a relatively flat bind method. VeloBind provides a more permanent bind than comb-binding, but is primarily used for business and legal presentations and small publications.
# '''[[coil binding|Spiral binding]]''' is the most economical form of mechanical binding when using plastic or metal. It is commonly used for atlases{{cn|date=January 2018}} and other publications where it is necessary or desirable to be able to open the publication back on itself without breaking the spine. There are several types but basically it is made by punching holes along the entire length of the spine of the page and winding a wire [[helix]] (like a spring) through the holes to provide a fully flexible hinge at the spine. Spiral coil binding uses a number of different hole patterns for binding documents. The most common hole pattern used with this style is 4:1 pitch (4 holes per inch). However, spiral coil spines are also available for use with 3:1 pitch, 5:1 pitch and 0.400-hole patterns.

===Thermally activated binding===
Some of the different types of thermally activated binding include:
# '''Perfect binding''' is often used for [[paperback]] books. It is also used for [[magazine]]s; ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' is one example of this type. Perfect-bound books usually consist of various sections with a cover made from heavier paper, glued together at the spine with a strong glue. The sections are milled in the back and notches are applied into the spine to allow hot glue to penetrate into the spine of the book. The other three sides are then face-trimmed. This is what allows the magazine or paperback book to be opened. [[Mass-market paperback]]s (pulp paperbacks) are small (''[[Duodecimo|16mo]]'' size), cheaply made with each sheet fully cut and glued at the spine; these are likely to fall apart or lose sheets after much handling or several years. [[Paperback#Trade paperback|Trade paperbacks]] are more sturdily made, with traditional gatherings or sections of bifolios, usually larger, and more expensive. The difference between the two can usually easily be seen by looking for the sections in the top or bottom sides of the book.
# '''Thermal binding''' uses a one-piece cover with glue down the spine to quickly and easily bind documents without the need for punching. Individuals usually purchase "thermal covers" or "therm-a-bind covers", which are usually made to fit a standard-size sheet of paper and come with a glue channel down the spine. The paper is placed in the cover, heated in a machine (basically a [[griddle]]), and when the glue cools, it adheres the paper to the spine. Thermal glue strips can also be purchased separately for individuals that wish to use customized/original covers. However, creating documents using thermal binding glue strips can be a tedious process, which requires a scoring device and a large-format printer.
# A '''cardboard article''' looks like a hardbound book at first sight, but it is really a paperback with hard covers. Many books that are sold as '''hardcover''' are actually of this type. The [[Modern Library]] series is an example. This type of document is usually bound with thermal adhesive glue using a perfect-binding machine.
# '''Tape binding''' refers to a system that wraps and glues a piece of tape around the base of the document. A tape-binding machine such as the PLANAX COPY Binder or Powis Parker Fastback system will usually be used to complete the binding process and to activate the thermal adhesive on the glue strip. However, some users also refer to tape binding as the process of adding a colored tape to the edge of a mechanically fastened (stapled or stitched) document.

===Stitched or sewn binding===
Types of stitched or sewn bindings:
# A ''sewn book'' is constructed in the same way as a hardbound book, except that it lacks the hard covers. The binding is as durable as that of a hardbound book.
# [[Stapling]] through the [[centerfold]], also called ''saddle-stitching'', joins a set of nested folios into a single magazine issue; most [[comic book]]s are well-known examples of this type.
# [[Magazine]]s are considered more ephemeral than books, and less durable means of binding them are usual. In general, the cover papers of magazines will be the same as the inner pages (self-cover)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3010.html|accessdate=2008-10-22|title=A Dictionary of Descriptive Terminology: self-cover|publisher=Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; or only slightly heavier (plus cover). Most magazines are stapled or saddle-stitched; however, some are bound with perfect binding and use thermally activated adhesive.

Modern bookbinding by hand can be seen as two closely allied fields: the creation of new bindings, and the repair of existing bindings. Bookbinders are often active in both fields. Bookbinders can learn the craft through [[apprenticeship]]; by attending specialized trade schools;&lt;ref&gt;Such as the: [http://www.cbl-ascona.ch/html/english.html Centro del bel Libro], [[Camberwell College of Arts|The Camberwell College of Arts]], The London College of Communication, and [http://www.nbss.org/ The North Bennet Street School]&lt;/ref&gt; by taking classes in the course of university studies, or by a combination of those methods. Some European countries offer a ''Master Bookbinder'' certification, though no such certification exists in the United States. MFA programs that specialize in the 'Book Arts' (hand paper-making, printmaking and bookbinding) are available through certain colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Such as: [http://www.colum.edu/book_and_paper/ Columbia College Chicago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512143659/http://www.colum.edu/Book_and_Paper/ |date=12 May 2009 }}, the [http://www.bookarts.ua.edu/ University of Alabama], [http://www.nscad.ca – Nova Scotia College of Art and Design] and the [http://www.uarts.edu/academics/cad/bookarts.html/ University of the Arts in Philadelphia].&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand bookbinders create new bindings that run the gamut from historical book structures made with traditional materials to modern structures made with 21st-century materials, and from basic cloth-case bindings to valuable full-leather fine bindings. Repairs to existing books also encompass a broad range of techniques, from minimally invasive conservation of a historic book to the full restoration and rebinding of a text.

Though almost any existing book can be repaired to some extent, only books that were originally sewn can be rebound by resewing. Repairs or restorations are often done to emulate the style of the original binding. For new works, some publishers print unbound manuscripts which a binder can collate and bind, but often an existing commercially bound book is ''pulled'', or taken apart, in order to be given a new binding. Once the textblock of the book has been pulled, it can be rebound in almost any structure; a modern suspense novel, for instance, could be rebound to look like a 16th-century manuscript. Bookbinders may bind several copies of the same text, giving each copy a unique appearance.

Hand bookbinders use a variety of specialized hand tools, the most emblematic of which is the [[bonefolder]], a flat, tapered, polished piece of bone used to crease paper and apply pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt1387.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—folder | publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional tools common to hand bookbinding include a variety of knives and hammers, as well as brass tools used during [[Finishing (bookbinding)|finishing]].

When creating new work, modern hand binders often work on commission, creating bindings for specific books or collections. Books can be bound in many different materials. Some of the more common materials for covers are [[leather]], decorative [[paper]], and [[cloth]] (see also: [[buckram]]). Those bindings that are made with exceptionally high craftsmanship, and that are made of [[particularly]] high-quality materials (especially full leather bindings), are known as ''fine'' or ''extra'' bindings. Also, when creating a new work, modern binders may wish to select a book that has already been printed and create what is known as a 'design binding'. "In a typical design binding, the binder selects an already printed book, disassembles it, and rebinds it in a style of fine binding—rounded and backed spine, laced-in boards, sewn headbands, decorative end sheets, leather cover etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leslie|first=W.|date=2016|title=Bridging the Gap: Artist's Book and Design Bindings by Karen Hanmer.|url=|journal=Journal of Artists Books|volume=39|pages=47–49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation and restoration==
Conservation and restoration are practices intended to repair damage to an existing book. While they share methods, their goals differ. The goal of conservation is to slow the book's decay and restore it to a usable state while altering its physical properties as little as possible. Conservation methods have been developed in the course of taking care of large collections of books. The term archival comes from taking care of the institutions archive of books. The goal of restoration is to return the book to a previous state as envisioned by the restorer, often imagined as the original state of the book. The methods of restoration have been developed by bookbinders with private clients mostly interested in improving their collections.

In either case, one of the modern standard for conservation and restoration is "reversibility". That is, any repair should be done in such a way that it can be undone if and when a better technique is developed in the future. Bookbinders echo the physician's creed, "[[Primum non nocere|First, do no harm]]". While reversibility is one standard, longevity of the functioning of the book is also very important and sometimes takes precedence over reversibility especially in areas that are invisible to the reader such as the spine lining.

[[File:restore.jpg|right|thumb|Rebacking saving original spine, showing one volume finished and one untouched]]
Books requiring restoration or conservation treatment run the gamut from the very earliest of texts to books with modern bindings that have undergone heavy usage. For each book, a course of treatment must be chosen that takes into account the book's value, whether it comes from the binding, the text, the [[provenance]], or some combination of the three. Many people choose to rebind books, from amateurs who restore old paperbacks on internet instructions to many professional book and paper conservators and restorationists, who often in the United States are members of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC).

Many times, books that need to be restored are hundreds of years old, and the handling of the pages and binding has to be undertaken with great care and a delicate hand. The archival process of restoration and conservation can extend a book's life for many decades and is necessary to preserve books that sometimes are limited to a small handful of remaining copies worldwide.

Typically, the first step in saving and preserving a book is its deconstruction. The text pages need to be separated from the covers and, only if necessary, the stitching removed. This is done as delicately as possible. All page restoration is done at this point, be it the removal of [[foxing]], ink stains, page tears, etc. Various techniques are employed to repair the various types of page damage that might have occurred during the life of the book.

The preparation of the "foundations" of the book could mean the difference between a beautiful work of art and a useless stack of paper and leather.

The sections are then hand-sewn in the style of its period, back into book form, or the original sewing is strengthened with new lining on the text-spine. New hinges must be accounted for in either case both with text-spine lining and some sort of end-sheet restoration.

The next step is the restoration of the book cover; This can be as complicated as completely re-creating a period binding to match the original using whatever is appropriate for that time it was originally created. Sometimes this means a new full leather binding with vegetable tanned leather, dyed with [[natural dye]]s, and [[Paper marbling|hand-marbled]] papers may be used for the sides or end-sheets. Finally the cover is hand-tooled in gold leaf. The design of the book cover involves such hand-tooling, where an extremely thin layer of gold is applied to the cover. Such designs can be lettering, symbols, or floral designs, depending on the nature of any particular project.

Sometimes the restoration of the cover is a matter of surgically strengthening the original cover by lifting the original materials and applying new materials for strength. This is perhaps a more common method for covers made with book-cloth although leather books can be approached this way as well. Materials such as Japanese tissues of various weights may be used. Colors may be matched using acrylic paints or simple colored pencils.

It is harder to restore leather books typically because of the fragility of the materials.

==Terms and techniques==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Leonhard Euler]] --&gt;

Most of the following terms apply only with respect to American practices:
* A ''leaf'' (often wrongly referred to as a ''folio'') typically has two pages of text and/or images, front and back, in a finished book. The Latin for ''leaf'' is ''folium'', therefore the ablative "folio" ("on the folium") should be followed by a designation to distinguish between recto and verso. Thus "folio 5r" means "on the recto of the leaf numbered 5". Although technically not accurate, common usage is "on folio 5r". In everyday speech it is common to refer to "turning the pages of a book", although it would be more accurate to say "turning the leaves of a book"; this is the origin of the phrase "to turn over a new leaf" i.e. to start on a fresh blank page.
** The ''[[recto]]'' side of a leaf faces left when the leaf is held straight up from the spine (in a paginated book this is usually an odd-numbered page).
** The ''[[verso]]'' side of a leaf faces right when the leaf is held straight up from the spine (in a paginated book this is usually an even-numbered page).
* A ''bifolium'' (often wrongly called a "bifolio", "bi-folio", or even "bifold") is a single sheet folded in half to make two leaves. The plural is "bifolia", not "bifolios".
* A ''[[Section (bookbinding)|section]]'', sometimes called a ''gathering'', or, especially if unprinted, a ''quire'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt2766.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—quire| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of bifolia nested together as a single unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3005.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—section| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a completed book, each quire is sewn through its fold. Depending of how many bifolia a quire is made of, it could be called:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/chapter3/index.html | title = Printing and Book Designs| publisher = National Diet Library, Japan | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''duernion''&amp;nbsp;– two bifolia, producing four leaves;
** ''ternion''&amp;nbsp;– three bifolia, producing six leaves;
** ''quaternion''&amp;nbsp;– four bifolia, producing eight leaves;
** ''quinternion''&amp;nbsp;– five bifolia, producing ten leaves;
** ''sextern'' or ''sexternion''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt2766.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—sexternion| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2009-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– six bifolia, producing twelve leaves.
* A ''[[codex]]'' is a series of one or more quires sewn through their folds, and linked together by the sewing thread.
* A ''signature'', in the context of printed books, is a section that contains text. Though the term ''signature'' technically refers to the [[signature mark]], traditionally a letter or number printed on the first leaf of a section in order to facilitate collation, the distinction is rarely made today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cool.conservation-us.org/don/dt/dt3109.html | title = Etherington &amp; Roberts. Dictionary—signature| publisher = US Government Printing Office | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Folio'', ''quarto'', and so on may also refer to the size of the finished book, based on the size of sheet that an early paper maker could conveniently turn out with a manual press. Paper sizes could vary considerably, and the finished size was also affected by how the pages were trimmed, so the sizes given are rough values only.
** A [[folio (printing)|folio]] volume is typically {{Convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} or more in height, the largest sort of regular book.
** A [[quarto]] volume is typically about {{Convert|9|by|12|in|cm|abbr=on}}, roughly the size of most modern magazines. A sheet folded ''in quarto'' (also 4to or 4º) is folded in half twice at right angles to make four leaves. Also called: eight-page signature.
** An [[octavo]] volume is typically about {{Convert|5|to|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} by {{Convert|8|to|9|in|cm|abbr=on}}, the size of most modern [[digest magazine]]s or [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperbacks]]. A sheet folded ''in octavo'' (also 8vo or 8º) is folded in half 3 times to make 8 leaves. Also called: sixteen-page signature.
** A sextodecimo volume is about {{Convert|4+1/2|by|6+3/4|in|cm|abbr=on}}, the size of most mass market paperbacks. A sheet folded ''in sextodecimo'' (also 16mo or 16º) is folded in half 4 times to make 16 leaves. Also called: 32-page signature.
** ''Duodecimo'' or 12mo, 24mo, 32mo, and even 64mo are other possible sizes. Modern paper mills can produce very large sheets, so a modern printer will often print 64 or 128 pages on a single sheet.
* ''Trimming'' separates the leaves of the bound book. A sheet folded in quarto will have folds at the spine and also across the top, so the top folds must be trimmed away before the leaves can be turned. A quire folded in octavo or greater may also require that the other two sides be trimmed. ''[[Deckle edge]]'', or ''Uncut'' books are untrimmed or incompletely trimmed, and may be of special interest to [[book collecting|book collectors]].

===Paperback binding===
Though books are sold as hardcover or paperback, the actual binding of the pages is important to durability.
Most paperbacks and some hard cover books have a "perfect binding".  The pages are aligned or cut together and glued.  A strong and flexible layer, which may or may not be the glue itself, holds the book together.  In the case of a paperback, the visible portion of the spine is part of this flexible layer.

== Spine ==

=== Orientation ===
[[File:bookspine.jpg|thumb|The spine of the book is an important aspect in book design, especially in cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, what's on the spine is the only visible information about the book. In a book store, the details on the spine are what initially attract attention.]]

In languages written from left to right, such as English, books are bound on the left side of the cover; looking from on top, the pages increase counter-clockwise. In right-to-left languages, books are bound on the right. In both cases, this is so the end of a page coincides with where it is turned. Many translations of [[manga|Japanese comic books]] retain the binding on the right, which allows the art, laid out to be read right-to-left, to be published without mirror-imaging it.

In China (only areas using Traditional Chinese), Japan, and Taiwan, literary books are written top-to-bottom, right-to-left, and thus are bound on the right, while text books are written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and thus are bound on the left. In mainland China the direction of writing and binding for all books was changed to be like left to right languages in the mid-20th century.

=== Titling ===
Early books did not have [[title (publishing)|titles]] on their spines; rather they were shelved flat with their spines inward—as is still common in Republic of South Africa{{according to whom|date=March 2016}}—and titles written with ink along their fore edges. Modern books display their titles on their spines.

In languages with Chinese-influenced writing systems, the title is written top-to-bottom, as is the language in general. In languages written horizontally, conventions differ about the direction in which the title on the spine is rotated:
*In the United States, the Commonwealth, Scandinavia and for books in Dutch, titles are usually written top-to-bottom on the spine. This means that when the book is placed on a table with the front cover upwards, the title is oriented left-to-right on the spine. This practice is reflected in the industry standards ANSI/NISO Z39.41&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niso.org/kst/reports/standards?step=2&amp;gid=None&amp;project_key%3Austring%3Aiso-8859-1=adf940d30971d49c34abb475530b58b9cefd0ffa ANSI/NISO Z39.41 – Printed Information on Spines] NISO Standards – National Information Standards Organization. Section 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and ISO 6357.&lt;ref&gt;''Spine titles on books and other publications'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In most of continental Europe and Latin America, titles are conventionally printed bottom-to-top on the spine so, when the books are placed vertically on shelves, the title can be read by tilting the head to the left.&lt;ref name="Drösser"&gt;{{cite news|last=Drösser|first=Christoph|title=Linksdrehende Bücher|url=http://www.zeit.de/2011/15/Stimmts|accessdate=9 April 2011|newspaper=[[Die Zeit]]|date=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the reader to read spines of books shelved in alphabetical order in accordance to the usual way left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

'''Chagdud Tulku''' ({{bo|t=ལྕགས་མདུད་|w=lcags mdud}}, 1930–2002) was a Tibetan teacher of the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Vajrayana]] [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. He was known and respected in the West for his teachings, his melodic chanting voice, his artistry as a sculptor and painter, and his skill as a physician. He acted as a spiritual guide for thousands of students worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Betty. [http://oregonmag.com/MonkPasses.htm The passing of a beloved teacher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807121503/http://oregonmag.com/MonkPasses.htm |date=August 7, 2008 }} in ''Oregon Magazine'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He was the sixteenth [[tulku|tülku]] of the Chagdud line.

Chagdud Gonpa centers practice Tibetan Buddhism, primarily in the Nyingma tradition of [[Padmasambhava]].

==Early life==
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche was born Padma Gargyi Wangchuk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche|url=http://chagdudgonpa.org/about-2/chagdud-gonpa-lamas/|work=Chagdud Gonpa|publisher=Chagdud Gonpa Foundation|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the Tromtar region of [[Kham]] eastern Tibet in 1930. His father was Sera Khato Tulku, a [[lama]] in the [[Gelug]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. His mother was Dawa Drolma, who was widely considered to be an emanation of [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and was from a [[Sakya]] family, and had a profound influence on her son's spiritual life.

By the time he was three years old, he was recognized as the incarnation of the previous Chagdud Tulku, and soon thereafter traveled to [[Temp'hel Gonpa]], a monastery about two or three days by horseback from Tromtar. As he recounts in his autobiography, ''The Lord Of The Dance'':
{{quote|For the next seven years, until I went into three year retreat at the age of  eleven, my life would alternate between periods of strict discipline in which my every move would be under the surveillance of my tutors and interludes in which my suppressed energies would explode. Throughout, I had many visions, many clairvoyant experiences, many extraordinary dreams, and within these, I sometimes had glimpses of absolute open awareness.&lt;ref name="Tulku Rinpoche"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Tulku Rinpoche  | first =Chagdud  | publication-date =1992 | date =October 1, 1992 | title =Lord of the Dance: Autobiography of a Tibetan Lama | edition =1st | publication-place =Junction City, CA | publisher =Padma Publishing | page = 19 | isbn = 1-881847-00-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After this retreat he received numerous teachings, empowerments, and oral transmissions, from various spiritual masters. One of them, Sechen Rabjam Rinpoche, told him that [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] [[meditation]] would be one of his major practices.

In 1945, shortly after completing his first three-year retreat, he went to see [[Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö]]. From him, Chagdud tulku received the rinchen terdzö ({{bo|t=རིན་ཆེན་གཏེར་མཛོད་}}) empowerments and met [[Dilgo Khyentse]], who was also attending. By 1946 he entered his second three-year retreat, this time under the guidance of the Tromge Trungpa Rinpoche. Near the conclusion of this retreat, the death of Tromge Trungpa forced him to leave before its completion. He then returned to Chagdud Gompa in Nyagrong, and after staying there for a while, proceeded on a pilgrimage to [[Lhasa]] with an entourage of monks. He then did an extended retreat at [[Samye]], the monastery built by [[Padmasambhava]], and afterwards attended empowerments given by [[Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje]], who would become a main teacher as well as a source of spiritual inspiration for him.

After this in 1957 he stayed for a year in Lhasa, Tibet, in the same household as Khenpo Dorje, whom he regarded as his root lama. Among his other teachers were Shechen Kongtrul, Tulku Arig and Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje.

During 1958, his last year in Tibet, Chagdud Tulku was advised to marry in order to have a companion and helper in the unsettled times to come. He later wed Karma Drolma, the daughter of a wealthy landowner in Kongpo. Later, in exile in India, they would have a son and a daughter, [[Jigme Tromge]] and Dawa Lhamo Tromge.

==Life in exile from Tibet==
Following Tibet's invasion by [[China]] in 1959, Chagdud Tulku escaped along with Khenpo Dorje to [[India]], after enduring hunger, and many dangers, where it looked like they would be captured. His route took him through the [[Pemakö]] region of Tibet, and his party came out from there into the Indian state of [[Nagaland]].{{dubious|date=February 2013}} In India Rinpoche lived in a number of Tibetan refugee resettlement camps ─ [[Kalimpong]], [[Odisha]], [[Dalhousie, India|Dalhousie]], [[Bir, Himachal Pradesh]], and [[Delhi]]. He practiced [[traditional Tibetan medicine]], and was much in demand as his fellow refugees had trouble coping with the heat, and subtropical diseases found in India.

A year or two after his arrival in India, Rinpoche entered a retreat in [[Tso Pema]], a lake sacred to Padmasambhava, located  near the city of [[Mandi, Himachal Pradesh]]. At this location he met Jangchub Dorje, a primary disciple of [[Apong Terton]] and a lineage holder of this great [[tertön]]'s [[Red Tara]] cycle.  Jangchub Dorje gave him empowerments for the Red Tara cycle, and then he re-entered into retreat and signs of accomplishment in the practices came very swiftly. Later, when he began teaching in the West, the Red Tara [[sādhanā]] would become the meditation most extensively practiced by his Western students.

While he was living in Bir, Himachal Pradesh, circumstances there gradually led to an estrangement with Karma Drolma, and eventually they separated.

After giving a teaching in [[Kulu Manali]], the [[14th Dalai Lama]] extended an invitation for Rinpoche to go to the United States and teach, contingent upon him getting a visa. It was at this time that he moved to [[Delhi]], and lived in [[Majnu-ka-tilla]], a Tibetan camp on the banks of the [[Yamuna]]. The process of trying to get a visa went on for three years, and was ultimately unsuccessful. During this time period he met his first Western students, but he also caught [[malaria]] and nearly died, and was saved by an Indian doctor who finally made the correct diagnosis of what was ailing him.

In the fall of 1977 empowerment cycles were given in [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]] by Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje in order to propagate the sacred lineages to a new generation. Chagdud Tulku decided to travel there in order to receive all the empowerments of the Dudjom treasures from Dudjom Rinpoche. Hundreds of [[tulku]]s, scholars, [[yogi]]s and lay practitioners gathered at [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]]'s monastery for these empowerments. About his experience he says this in his autobiography:
{{quote|During my stay in [[Nepal]] I received empowerments and oral transmissions for all the treasures he had discovered in this life and in his previous life as Dudjom Lingpa. It was a wealth of  practices whose splendor is unsurpassed, and deep within me I formed the aspiration  to offer this transmission to others through empowerment and teaching.&lt;ref name="Tulku Rinpoche p206"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Tulku Rinpoche  | first =Chagdud | publication-date =1992 | date =October 1, 1992  | title =Lord of the Dance: Autobiography of a Tibetan Lama | edition =1st | publication-place =Junction City, CA | publisher =Padma Publishing | page = 206| isbn = 1-881847-00-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While attending them Chagdud Tulku met an older lama from Western Tibet, Lama Ladakh Nono, who was known for doing mirror [[divination]]s. He subsequently did a mirror divination for Chagdud and told him he should go to the West and benefit many people there by teaching the [[Dharma]]. He also predicted that a Western woman would come into his life and that this would be good.

He continued to stay in Nepal on into 1978 in order to attend a new series of empowerments in the [[Chokling Tersar]] cycle given by [[Dilgo Khyentse]]. It was while attending one of these empowerments that a Western woman, Jane Dedman (later [[Chagdud Khadro]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Chagdud_Khadro Chagdud Khadro]@Rigpa wiki&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pt.chagdud.org/en/ordained-lamas/chagdud-khadro.html Chagdud Khadro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815053533/http://pt.chagdud.org/en/ordained-lamas/chagdud-khadro.html |date=August 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; approached Chagdud Rinpoche with the offering of a white scarf and a jar of honey. Afterwards he invited her to lunch, and shortly after this he gave her some teachings. A month or so later he accepted her offer to serve as his attendant in retreat after the empowerments. This retreat lasted for several months, after which Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje among other things suggested Chagdud go to America to teach.

==Life in the West==
After many months of waiting he was finally granted a visa and landed in [[San Francisco]] on Oct. 24, 1979. Shortly after this, he married Jane in [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]], [[California]]. The early years of his teaching in the Americas was spent in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], and [[Cottage Grove, Oregon|Cottage Grove]], [[Oregon]]. In 1983, at the request of his students, he established Chagdud Gonpa Foundation. He soon ordained his first lama, a Western woman named Inge Sandvoss, as Lama Yeshe Zangmo (in 1987).

Additionally in the time period of 1980 through 1987 he traveled widely and gave many teachings, accompanied by his interpreter, Tsering Everest. He invited many other Lamas such as [[Dudjom Rinpoche]], [[Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche]], [[Kalu Rinpoche]], and Kyabje [[Penor Rinpoche]] to Oregon where they bestowed many empowerments and teachings. He also helped set up Padma Publications which eventually published his two books: ''The Lord of the Dance'', and ''Gates to Buddhist Practice''. With the assistance of Richard Barron, Padma Publications also began the monumental task of translating [[Longchenpa]]'s [[Seven Treasuries]] from Tibetan into English,  three volumes of which have been published to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetantreasures.com/tthtml/ttmerch/Padma%20Publishing/padmamain.html Padma Publishing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013215154/http://www.tibetantreasures.com/tthtml/ttmerch/Padma%20Publishing/padmamain.html |date=October 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowcrest.net/chagdud/main/trans.htm The Padma Translation Committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203023842/http://www.snowcrest.net/chagdud/main/trans.htm |date=February 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 he returned to Tibet for the first time since 1959. He  traveled to Kham, visiting the three monasteries of his youth, and actually bestowed empowerments to the monastic staff there. His son, [[Jigme Tromge Rinpoche]], traveled with him to Tibet and the next year immigrated to the [[United States]], entering a three-year retreat a few months after his arrival. Then in 1988, after land was acquired in the [[Trinity Alps]] of Northern California, the main seat of Chagdud Gonpa Foundation was created there as [[Rigdzin Ling]].

It was here that Chagdud Tulku offered the [[empowerment]]s and oral transmissions of the Dudjom Treasures in 1991, and several years later, of the supreme [[Dzogchen]] cycle, [[Nyingt'hig Yabzhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Nyingtik_Yabshi Nyingtik Yabshi] RangjungYesheWiki&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 he received an invitation to teach in [[Brazil]] and he would become a pioneer insofar as spreading the Dharma in [[South America]]. Throughout the 1990s he maintained  an extensive teaching schedule, put some of his senior students into three year retreats, and helped to establish many Chagdud Gonpa centers throughout the Western Hemisphere. These include more than 38 Dharma centers under Chagdud Tulku's supervision and inspiration, in USA, [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Australia]]. The best known are Rigdzin Ling in [[Junction City, California]] and [[Khadro Ling]], his main center in [[Três Coroas]], Brazil.

In all his teachings he was known for stressing pure motivation in doing spiritual practice. He once wrote, "In the course of my [[Buddhist]] training, I have received teachings on many philosophical topics and meditative methods. Of all teachings, I find none more important than pure motivation. If I had to leave only one legacy to my students, it would be the wisdom of pure motivation. If I were to be known by one title, it would be the 'motivation lama.'" ”&lt;ref name="Meeske, Kathryn"&gt;{{Cite book | last =Meeske | first =Kathryn | publication-date =2004 |date=October 2004 | title =Sacred Voices of the Nyingma Masters| edition =1st | publication-place =Junction City, CA | publisher =Padma Publishing | page = 122 |isbn = 978-1-881847-35-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

In this context, ‘pure motivation’ means the cultivation of ''[[bodhicitta]]'', which is the enlightened intent of doing practice for the benefit of oneself, and all other sentient beings.

In 1995 he moved to Khadro Ling, in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Brazil, and it became the main seat of his activities for the rest of his life. Before moving to Brazil, Chagdud Tulku enthroned Lama Drimed Norbu (Alwyn Fischel) one of his main Western students, head lama of the Chagdud Gonpa foundation and gave him authorization to teach the Great Perfection teachings. In 1996 the first  Brazilian Dzogchen retreat took place at Khadro Ling and a large [[Guru Rinpoche]] statue was created there. In the next few years, he traveled in South America, giving teachings in Uruguay, Argentina, and [[Chile]], in addition to different parts of Brazil. He also continued to travel to his centers in the United States, and made frequent visits to Nepal, a return to Chagdud Gompa in eastern Tibet and a visit to mainland China. During this same time period, in addition to leading Drubchens and month-long Dzogchen retreats, he also trained his students in the sacred arts of sculpture and painting, as well as ritual dance, chanting, and music.

In 1998, construction began on the ''lha khang'' (temple) of Khadro Ling. In July 1998, the empowerments of the Taksham Treasures were bestowed by Terton Namkhai Drimed in the still incomplete temple. This temple was followed by an enormous [[prayer wheel]] project, perhaps the largest in the Western Hemisphere, then eight magnificent [[stupa]]s, and a monumental statue of [[Akshobhya]] Buddha. In the same period, in [[Pharping]], Nepal, Rinpoche built a new retreat center where eight people began training according to the [[Kat'hog]] tradition under Kyabje Getse Tulku.

While Chagdud Rinpoche kept up a tremendous amount of Dharmic activity, in the last few years of his life he was somewhat slowed down by [[diabetes]], and in 1997, he entered a clinic and was diagnosed with a serious heart condition. In the last year of his life Rinpoche's body began to hinder his outer activities. He tired more easily, and travel became difficult. In 2002, he cancelled a trip to the United States, which had been scheduled for October, and instead entered strict retreat.

In the last week of his life, he concluded this retreat on Tuesday, November 12, worked with a student artist to complete a statue of [[Amitabha]], talked with many of his students, and led a training in ''[[phowa]]'' (transference of consciousness at the moment of death) for more than two hundred people. He continued teaching with great vigor until about 9 pm on Saturday night November 16. Then on Sunday morning of the 17th, at about 4:15&amp;nbsp;a.m., Brazilian daylight time, he suffered massive heart failure while sitting up in bed.

According to his son, [[Jigme Tromge Rinpoche]], Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche then remained in a state of [[meditation]] for almost six full days. The ability to remain in meditation after the breath stops is known as (''t'hug dam''). [[Jigme Tromge Rinpoche]] described this in a release to the Brazilian press:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
After his last breath, my father remained in a state of meditation for almost six full days that prevented the usual deterioration of his body. The ability to remain in a state of meditation after the breath stops is well known among great Tibetan masters, but circumstances have rarely allowed it to occur in the West. Chagdud Rinpoche remained sitting in a natural, lifelike [[meditation]] posture, with little visible change of color or expression. During that time, no one touched his body.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Until the sixth day, Friday, November 22nd, Rinpoche showed no physical signs that his meditation had ended. In the interim we were in constant consultation with a lawyer and other officials about local customs and regulations. Friday midday, his meditation ended and his mind separated from his body. Within hours, his appearance changed. He took on the signs typical of those occurring within the first 24 hours of death.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Afterwards his ''ku dun'' (the physical body) was flown to [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, and then to the retreat center in Parping. During the forty-nine days that followed, Getse Tulku Rinpoche and Jigme Tromge Rinpoche led ceremonies in Parping, to purify inauspicious circumstances to Rinpoche's rebirth and to generate great [[Merit (Buddhism)|merit]] through offerings and practice.

A year later on the full moon of December 8, 2003, Rinpoche's [[cremation]] was held on Jigme Rinpoche's land in Parping, with Kyabje Mogtza Rinpoche, one of the highest lamas of Kat'hog  Gonpa, serving as [[Vajra]] Master. Hundreds of Rinpoche's students gathered, to mourn the loss of his direct physical presence, and made prayers and offerings for his eventual rebirth.

His main students and the lamas he ordained continue to teach and carry on Chagdud's many projects and practices.

At Brazil Gonpa the project&lt;ref&gt;[http://padmasambhavapureland.com/us/terrapura.php Project information]&lt;/ref&gt; of Padmasambhava's Pureland has been realized, the Consecration having taken place in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pt.chagdud.org/en/agenda/padmasambhava-s-pureland-consecration.html Photos and videos of the Consecration]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://padmasambhavapureland.com/us/index.php Website of Padmasambhava's Pureland]&lt;/ref&gt; To build a replica of Zangdog Palri was Chagdud Rinpoche’s last wish and great project before he died in 2002.

Chagdud Rinpoche made it a point to not only ordain many western lineage holders and lamas, but to surround himself with powerful female practitioners. Over half of the 30 some-odd westerners he has ordained as lamas have been women..." The first lama whom he had ordained as Lama Yeshe Zangmo was a Western woman named Inge Sandvoss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowcrest.net/chagdud/main/LamaInge.html Lama Inge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730092701/http://www.snowcrest.net/chagdud/main/LamaInge.html |date=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a "true Dzogchen master" he authorized at least one western teacher to teach Dzogchen, Lama Drimed - there may be more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snowcrest.net/chagdud/main/lamas/drimed.htm Lama Drimed of Chagdud Gonpa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314150828/http://www.snowcrest.net/chagdud/main/lamas/drimed.htm |date=March 14, 2010 }} Lama Padma Drimed Norbu&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, Lama Drimed offered his resignation to the Board of Directors of Chagdud Gonpa Foundation from his positions as Spiritual Director and President of the Foundation, while remaining an ordained lama with authorization to teach the Great Perfection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">A '''chief creative officer''' ('''CCO''') is the highest ranking position of the creative team within a company. Depending on the type of company, this position may be responsible for the overall look and feel of [[marketing]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[brand]]ing associated with the organization. The CCO may also be charged with managing, developing, and leading the team of [[creative director]]s, [[art director]]s, [[designer]]s, and [[copywriter]]s.

==Overall description==
The CCO directs a company's creative output, developing the artistic design strategy that defines the company's brand.&lt;ref name="do"&gt;Written By: Terry Masters, Edited By: Allegra J. Lingo [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-chief-creative-officer-do.htm "What Does a Chief Creative Officer Do"], 14 October 2014, Retrieved on 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The CCO creates the unique image of the firm and deliver this distinctive design to consumers and to create a clear [[brand image]] which is a fundamental and essential work throughout the company. Advertisements present a certain memorable artistic design while also structured to accomplish functional goals. The CCO ensures that the design and functionality combine harmoniously so the firm can present a product that successfully represents its creative brand.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

CCOs, in some cases are called [[creative directors]], are demanded in firms which involve creative thinking and artistic design. The position of generic head of marketing is usually replaced by chief creative officer in advertising firms.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt; The power of chief creative officer can even be compared to [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and at the early stages of a small company, usually at the start of [[partnerships]], the CCO and the CEO manage jointly.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

The current '''[[coat of arms]] of [[Venezuela]]''' was primarily approved by the Congress on April 18, 1836, undergoing small modifications through history, reaching the present version.

The coat of arms was established in the [[Law of the National Flag, Coat of Arms, and Anthem (Venezuela)|Law of the National Flag, Shield and Anthem]] (''Ley de Bandera, Escudo e Himno Nacionales''), passed on February 17, 1954, by the military governor of Venezuela, [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]]. The shield is divided in the colors of the [[Flag of Venezuela|national flag]]. In the dexter chief, on a red field, [[wheat]] represents the union of the 20 [[Political Division of Venezuela|states]] of the [[Republic]] existing at the time and the [[wealth]] of the [[Venezuela|nation]]. In sinister chief, on a yellow field, [[weapons]] (a sword, a [[sabre]] and three lances) and two [[Flag of Venezuela|national flag]]s are tied by a branch of [[Lauraceae|laurel]], as a symbol of [[Roman triumph|triumph]] in war. In base, on a deep blue field, a wild white [[horse]] (perhaps representing [[Simón Bolívar]]'s white horse ''Palomo'') runs free, an emblem of [[independence]] and [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].

Above the shield are two crossed [[cornucopia]]s (horns of plenty), pouring out wealth. The shield is flanked by an [[olive branch]] and another of [[Arecaceae|palm]], both tied at the bottom of the coat with a large band that represents the national tricolour (yellow for the nation’s wealth, blue for the [[Atlantic ocean|ocean]] separating Venezuela from [[Spain]], and red for the blood and courage of the people). The following captions appear in golden letters on the blue stripe:

==2006 changes==
On March 27, 2006, the [[National Assembly of Venezuela|National Assembly]] approved changes to the coat of arms and the [[flag of Venezuela]], which were made official on March 12, 2006, coinciding with Flag Day. Prior to 2006, the horse was running to the sinister side of the shield with its head turned to the dexter (to the viewer, this appears as the horse galloping towards his right and looking back to the left). In heraldic practice, animals and beasts are to appear facing to the dexter, which is considered the natural and honorable position. ''[[The Economist]]'' observed that [[Hugo Chávez]] ordered the seal changed after his daughter, [[Rosinés Chávez Rodríguez]], had described the previous horse as “looking backwards”.&lt;ref&gt;"Freedom to Agree", ''The Economist'', February 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Government supporters state, however, that even if the president's daughter was the one who sparked the discussion, both the legislative and executive branch agreed to changes. These were adding a machete to represent the peasant fighters during the revolutionary wars in Venezuela since the War of Independence, and a bow and arrow as a tribute to the brave indigenous population who resisted the Spanish conquistadors.

Many critics have suggested that the horse, now running to the dexter (to the viewer's left) is a political statement of the current left-wing government of President Hugo Chávez. Previously in the Venezuelan arms adopted in 1863, the horse was moving as it is seen today, to the dexter (the viewer's left). Also to note is that in heraldry, positions are not described from the viewer's point of view, but rather the shield's, so while the horse appears to be galloping left to one observing the arms, the horse is actually galloping to the dexter, or right, side of the shield. This symbolizes Venezuela as the first of the independent states of South America, and Simon Bolivar's campaigns of liberation for all of Latin America, which started here in 1811 (with Venezuela's Declaration of Independence and the earlier Caracas Junta of 1810) and ended with his final victory in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on December 9, 1824, all the while riding his white horse Palomo.

Political opponents have also claimed that in addition to being politically motivated, the changes were economically wasteful. At the time of the official unveiling, the opposition party stated that they will not use the new flag or coat of arms, but retain the old and employ them in demonstrations against the government. However, by 2008, and with a slightly improved political climate, the new coat of arms and flag have been generally accepted among the population and opposition.

Heraldist Fabio Cassani Pironti, commissioned by the National Assembly, made the reform of the National coats of arms.&lt;ref&gt;El Nacional, 12/03/2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[color theory]], a '''color scheme''' is the choice of [[color]]s used in [[design]] for a range of media. For example, the "Achromatic" use of a [[white (color)|white]] background with [[black (color)|black]] text is an example of a basic and commonly [[Default (computer science)|default]] color scheme in [[web design]].

Color schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] feeling when used together will commonly accompany each other in color schemes. A basic color scheme will use two colors that look appealing together. More advanced color schemes involve several related colors in "Analogous" combination, for example, text with such colors as [[red (color)|red]], [[yellow (color)|yellow]], and [[orange (color)|orange]] arranged together on a black background in a magazine article. The addition of  light [[blue (color)|blue]] creates an "Accented Analogous" color scheme.

Color schemes can contain different "Monochromatic" shades of a single color; for example, a color scheme that mixes different shades of green, ranging from very light (white), to very neutral (gray), to very dark (black).

Use of the phrase '''color scheme''' may also and commonly does refer to choice and use of colors used outside typical aesthetic media and context, although may still be used for purely aesthetic effect as well as for purely practical reasons. This most typically refers to color patterns and designs as seen on [[vehicles]], particularly those used in the [[military]] when concerning color patterns and designs used for [[Identification friend or foe|identification of friend or foe]], identification of specific military units, or as [[camouflage]].

A color scheme in [[marketing]] is referred to as a '''[[trade dress]]''' and can sometimes be protected by [[trademark]] or [[trade dress]] laws, as is the [[pink]] color of [[Owens-Corning]] [[fiberglass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Intellectual Property: Valuation, Exploitation, and Infringement Damages | author = Gordon V.

==List of color schemes==
{{further|color theory}}

===Monochromatic colors===
{{Main|Monochromatic color}}
[[File:CPT-Websites-monochrome.svg|frame|Example of monochromatic color]]
'''Monochromatic colors''' are all the colors (tints, tones, and shades) of a single [[hue]].  Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue, and extended using its shades, tones and tints (that is, a hue modified by the addition of black, gray (black + white) and white. As a result, the energy is more subtle and peaceful due to a lack of contrast of hue.

===Complementary colors===

[[File:Chevreul's RYB chromatic diagram.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Chevreul]]'s 1855 "chromatic diagram" based on the [[RYB color model]], showing [[complementary color]]s and other relationships]]

{{Main|Complementary color}}

For the mixing of colored light, Newton's [[color wheel]] is often used to describe complementary colors, which are colors which cancel each other's hue to produce an achromatic (white, gray or black) light mixture.  Newton offered as a conjecture that colors exactly opposite one another on the hue circle cancel out each other's hue; this concept was demonstrated more thoroughly in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

A key assumption in Newton's hue circle was that the "fiery" or maximum saturated hues are located on the outer circumference of the circle, while achromatic white is at the center. Then the saturation of the mixture of two spectral hues was predicted by the straight line between them; the mixture of three colors was predicted by the "center of gravity" or centroid of three triangle points, and so on.

Split-Complementary
The split-complementary (also called 'Compound Harmony') color scheme is a variation of the complementary color scheme. In addition to the base color, it uses the two "Analogous" colors adjacent to its complement. Split-complementary color scheme has the same strong visual contrast as the complementary color scheme, but has less pressure.

===Achromatic colors===
{{Main|Achromatic color}}
Any color that lacks strong chromatic content is said to be''''unsaturated'', ''achromatic'', or near ''neutral''''. Pure achromatic colors include black, white and all grays; near neutrals include browns, tans, pastels and darker colors. Near neutrals can be of any hue or lightness.

''Neutrals'' are obtained by mixing pure colors with white, black or gray, or by mixing two complementary colors. In color theory, neutral colors are colors easily modified by adjacent more saturated colors and they appear to take on the hue complementary to the saturated color.  Next to a bright red couch, a gray wall will appear distinctly greenish. &lt;!-- this isn't just "in the color theory"... it's a property of human color vision --&gt;

Black and white have long been known to combine well with almost any other colors; black decreases the apparent ''saturation'' or ''brightness'' of colors paired with it, and white shows off all hues to equal effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theory of Color|url=https://zedbi.com/View-a-websites-color-scheme#theory|website=zedbi.com/|accessdate=23 October 2014|ref=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024010749/https://zedbi.com/View-a-websites-color-scheme#theory|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analogous colors===
{{Main|Analogous color}}
Analogous colors (also called '''Dominance Harmony''') color scheme are groups of colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel, with one being the dominant color, which tends to be a [[primary colors|primary]] or [[secondary colors|secondary]] color, and two on either side complementing, which tend to be [[tertiary colors|tertiary]].

The term analogous refers to the having analogy, or corresponding to something in particular. An analogous color scheme creates a rich, [[monochromatic]] look. It’s best used with either warm or cool colors, creating a look that has a certain temperature as well as proper color harmony. While this is true, the scheme also lacks contrast and is less vibrant than [[complementary colors|complementary]] schemes.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Red, reddish-orange, orange, yellow-orange is one example of a set of analogous colors.

====Accented analogous====
An accented analogous complementary scheme utilizes related hues lying adjacent on the color wheel with a hue directly opposite to these. This direct complement becomes the accent color, used to create a dominant color grouping of three similar colors accented with the direct complement (or the near complement) of one of them. The complementary accent color creates an interesting contrast against the dominant color grouping. This scheme is frequently used to put a warm accent color with a cool analogous color pallet, or a cool accent color with a warm pallet.

===Triadic colors===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
[[File:Triadic colors.png|thumb|Example of a triadic color scheme]]
The triadic color scheme uses three colors equally spaced around the color wheel. The easiest way to place them on the wheel is by using a triangle of equal sides. Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant, even when using pale or unsaturated versions of hues, offers a higher degree of contrast while at the same time retains the color harmony. This scheme is very popular among artists because it offers strong visual contrast while retaining balance, and color richness. The triadic scheme is not as contrasting as the complementary scheme, but it is easier to accomplish balance and harmony with these colors.

The primary colors are an example of a triadic color scheme.

===Tetradic colors===
{{expand section|date=April 2014}}
The tetradic (double complementary) colors scheme is the richest of all the schemes because it uses four colors arranged into two complementary color pairs. This scheme is hard to harmonize and requires a color to be dominant or subdue the colors.; if all four colors are used in equal amounts, the scheme may look unbalanced.

====Rectangle ====
The rectangle color scheme uses four colors arranged into two complementary pairs and offers plenty of possibilities for variation. Rectangle color schemes work best when one color is dominant.

====Square====
The square color scheme is similar to the rectangle, but with all four colors spaced evenly around the color circle. Square color schemes works best when all colors are evenly balanced.

===Polychromatic colors===
{{Main|Polychromatic}}
The term '''polychromatic''' means having several colors.

It is used to describe [[light]] that exhibits more than one [[color]], which also means that it contains radiation of more than one [[wavelength]]. The study of polychromatics is particularly useful in the production of [[diffraction grating]]s.

For CAE, tactical media is situational, ephemeral, and self-terminating. It encourages the use of any media that will engage a particular socio-political context in order to create molecular interventions and semiotic shocks that collectively could diminish the rising intensity of authoritarian culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/TacticalMedia.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since its formation in 1987 in Tallahassee, Florida,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} CAE has been frequently invited to exhibit and perform projects examining issues surrounding information, communications and bio-technologies by museums and other cultural institutions. These include the Whitney Museum and the New Museum in NYC; the Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; the ICA, London; the MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; the London Museum of Natural History; Kunsthalle Luzern, and dOCUMENTA 13.

The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages.

Its work has been covered by art journals, including Artforum, Kunstforum, and The Drama Review. Critical Art Ensemble is the recipient of awards, including the 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of Artistic Expression Grant, the 2004 John Lansdown Award for Multimedia, and the 2004 Leonardo New Horizons Award for Innovation.

==History==

===1986–1990===

Formed in 1987, CAE's focus has been on the exploration of the intersections between art, [[critical theory]], technology, and political activism. In 1986, [[Steve Kurtz]] and Steve Barnes began a collaboration to make low-tech videos with students. They credited each person who contributed to the productions under the signature of Critical Art Ensemble. During the summer of 1987, the group transformed into a broad-based artist and activist collective with six core members: Steve Kurtz, Steve Barnes, Dorian Burr, Beverly Schlee, [[Ricardo Dominguez (professor)]] and Hope Kurtz. In 1987, the group's first multimedia exhibitions were held at Club Nu in Miami and Pappy's Lounge in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1988, the group's first events are produced: ''Political Art In Florida?'' in collaboration with [[Group Material]], and ''Frontier Production'' in collaboration with [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]]. In 1988-89, CAE begin to release their books of plagiarist text poetry (of which there are six in all). In 1989, the group collaborate with [[Gran Fury]] to release ''Cultural Vaccines'', a multimedia event in Tallahassee, Florida, which critiques U.S. policy on HIV. In 1990, the group collaborated with Prostitutes of New York to create ''Peep Show'' which premiered at Window on Gaines in Tallahassee, Florida.

===1991–1995===

In 1991, a body of work titled ''Fiesta Critica'' was developed in Indiantown, Florida, with local migrant workers; addressing Floridian agricultural labour relations. CAE produces an Easter fiesta platform to show the works. In 1992, the group produces ''Exit Culture'' as a series of works developed for [[Highway Culture]]. They also propose ''The Electronic Disturbance'' to [[Autonomedia]] publishers. In 1993, the group is invited to perform their first appearance in Europe at the Audio/Visual Experimental festival in the Netherlands. They complete the associational documentary series ''Apocalypse and Utopia''. In 1994, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''The Electronic Disturbance'' and construction begins to create CAE's website [http://www.critical-art.net Critical Art Ensemble]. CAE projects begin to appear in both real and virtual forms as the ''Useless Technology'' project is performed as street action and launched online. The concept of electronic civil disobedience is introduced at the ''Terminal Futures'' conference in London. In 1995, the concept of the data body is introduced in lectures at the [[Ars Electronica]]. The group tours around Europe with the performance of ''Body Count''.

===1996–2000===

In 1996, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Electronic Civil Disobedience'' (the companion text to ''The Electronic Disturbance''), and research begins for the book ''Flesh Machine''. In 1997, the group tours ''Flesh Frontiers and Shareholder's Briefing''. [[Castelvecchi]] publishes the Italian translation of ''The Electronic Disturbance''. The group goes to [[Documenta X]] in Kassel, Germany to begin the editing and conceptualizing process for the book ''README: Ascii Culture and the Revenge of Knowledge'' at Hybrid Workspace. The performance of ''Flesh Machine'' is toured, premiering in Vienna and closing in Helsinki at Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in summer 1998. [[L'Eclat]] publishes the French anthology of CAE's writings titled ''La Resistance Electronique''. In 1998, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Flesh Machine'' and the German translation is published by Passagen. The group's street action occurs in Sheffield, UK, with the performance of ''The International Campaign for Free Alcohol and Tobacco for the Unemployed''. [[Castelvecchi]] publishes the Italian translation of ''Electronic Civil Disobedience''. In 1999, ''The Society for Reproductive Anachronisms'' is premiered at Rutgers University in the student cafeteria. Work begins on ''Cult of the New Eve'' (CoNE) and is premiered at St. Clara Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. A new book project is begun, entitled ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media''. In 2000, [[Autonomedia]] publishes ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media'' and the German anthology of CAE's writings on electronic media is published by Passagen.&lt;ref&gt;
Critical Art Ensemble, 'Timeline', pp. 132-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has exhibited and performed at diverse venues internationally, ranging from the street, to the museum, to the internet. Museum exhibitions include the Whitney Museum and The New Museum in NYC; The Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; The ICA, London; The MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; and The London Museum of Natural History.

===2003–2004===
Free Range Grain was a performance-based project which tested foods to contest the global food trade system. The project used basic molecular biology techniques over a 72-hour period to test foods that others deemed suspicious of "contamination" even when the authorities were guarding against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/Biotech.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt; This performance sought to explore biotechnology and the science behind it, as the artists felt it was "one of the most misunderstood areas of production in the cultural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.critical-art.net/FRG.html Critical Art Ensemble]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works and artistic approach==

===Performance style===
In its performances, CAE creates various performative identities, such as that of a group of scientists or a corporation. Instead of using fancy, high-tech machinery they use 'high school lab equipment as well as common household supplies and groceries',&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; which brings the scientific difficulty down to a level at which the public can understand and engage with because the worlds of science and technology in the modern world are 'increasingly privatised'.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; This playful style, however, contrasts with the groups numerous books and manifestos which have an analytical focus.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicola Triscott is the founder of [[Arts Catalyst|The Arts Catalyst]]. In her writings about the CAE, she states that their participatory theatre 'aims to involve the public in the processes of biotechnology in order to contribute to the development of an informed and critical public discourse on contemporary bioscience'.&lt;ref name="triscott2"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; This provides people with knowledge of how science can be interesting and that it can be misused if in the wrong hands. Their works have ranged from genetically modified food, the Human Genome Project (CoNE), reproductive technologies, genetic screening and transgenics. The way they approach this style is through directly engaging with the science and presenting techniques generally unknown to the public in a performative way.&lt;ref name="triscott2"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.151.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The work of the CAE continues to entertain, inform and show the public how biotechnology can be demonstrated via performance.&lt;ref name="sholette1"&gt;Sholette 2005, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; 

:As part of their critical objectives, they target their attention on private corporations unknown in the public sector who misuse biotechnology. This tactical response is what the CAE have termed 'Fuzzy Biological Sabotage' (or FBS if abbreviated).&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Using harmless biological species including plants, insects and reptiles, they make sophisticated pranks 'to operate in the grey, in-between spaces as yet unregulated by institutional regimes'&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p. 52. cited in [http://www.critical-art.net/MolecularInvasion.html ''Molecular Invasion'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===

The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages. Its books include: ''The Electronic Disturbance'' (1994), ''Electronic Civil Disobedience &amp; Other Unpopular Ideas'' (1996), ''Flesh Machine: Cyborgs, Designer Babies, &amp; New Eugenic Consciousness'' (1998), ''Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media'' (2001), ''Molecular Invasion'' (2002), ''Marching Plague'' (2006), and the project book ''Disturbances'' (2012).

CAE is noted for having written the article [http://www.critical-art.net/books/ted/ted2.pdf Nomadic Power and Cultural Resistance], in which CAE argues that with the creation of the [[internet]] the power of the elite has become mobile to the extent that it is difficult for a dissident to directly confront the authority, comparing the untrackable, elusive mobility to that of the [[Scythians]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Electronic Disturbance'', 11-30. New York: Autonomoedia, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; They demolished the idea that power cannot corrupt and co-opt network and hypertext technologies, that such technologies have a predetermined and manifest destiny of freedom.&lt;ref name="reader2003"&gt;The New Media Reader. New York: The MIT, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; CAE goes on to observe that occupation theory &lt;!-- why is there no page on this theory? --&gt;itself is challenged by [[cyberspace]] and the difficulties it presents in terms of focusing a group effort against one authority as opposed to a singular hacker, fiddling with code. An important distinction is made that when rebellious acts are carried out by an individual as opposed to a group in singularity, that the dissenter is seen as a vandal instead of a protester. The article mentions that resistance in the form posters, pamphleteering, street theater and public art have been useful in the past but now that the public is electronically engaged one must bring their resistance methods online.
&lt;ref name="reader2003"/&gt;

===Molecular Invasion===

In correlation to CAE's work "Molecular Invasion (2002)" the collective hosted an exhibit about genetically modified crops. They planted [[Monsanto]]'s genetically modified seeds that were designed to be immune to Monsanto's commercial pesticide [[Roundup (herbicide)|roundup]] (Glyphosate). They successfully grew these crops in their exhibit however once the plants were fully grown they applied an enzyme inhibitor that was reverse engineered to the plants that eradicated the protection that these crops had against the pesticide. The plants quickly died. This exhibit was a statement against genetically modified foods.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Cult of the New Eve===

In 1999, CAE began a new project to draw attention to the ways in which scientific discourses surrounding biotechnologies drew upon promissory religious rhetoric. This participatory performance was titled ''Cult of the New Eve'' (or CoNE when abbreviated) and included a "communion" using a random library of the entire genome of the first female donor to the [[Human Genome Project]] taken from a blood sample. CAE spliced the genome and inserted it into yeast, which was then placed into host wafers and beer given to audience members who were willing to participate. The genome from the donor is intended to represent a 'New Eve… a sacrosant Messiah'.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Art Ensemble 2000, pp.167-173&lt;/ref&gt; The project also offers public and online preaching, baptisms, communion, sacred theological and cosmological texts and prophecies.&lt;ref&gt;Critical Art Ensemble, 'Performing a Cult', pp.167-173&lt;/ref&gt;

===GenTerra===

CAE created a performance titled ''GenTerra'' which raised issues surrounding ethics and safety in performative science. This was done through an investigation into creating transgenic life forms and seeing the consequences of potentially releasing them into the environment. It was the audience members who had to decide whether the bacteria was harmful or not in a game of 'genetic Russian roulette'.&lt;ref name="triscott3"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Triscott states through her own experience of participating in the performance that members of the audience were given the opportunity to grow and store their own bacteria, with full instructions and guidance. With the aid of a spinning machine, bacteria were spun with only one of ten chambers holding active bacteria. The purpose of ''GenTerrra'' is to 'introduce bioproducts to the audience, and demonstrate the practical applications of such research, such as disease treatment and xenotransplantation'.&lt;ref name="triscott3"&gt;Triscott 2009, p.164&lt;/ref&gt; As CAE wear lab-coats and appear as professional scientists, they simulate actual biotechnology corporations, emphasizing their intentions even further.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective structure===
CAE attributes the collective's longevity to their structure which has contributed to positive attitudes throughout the group. The number of members, ranging from three to eight and known as a 'cellular structure'&lt;ref name="critical1"&gt;Critical Art Ensemble 2001, pp.70-73&lt;/ref&gt; has managed to be sustained without members feeling alienated. As each member has the opportunity to show off their individual strengths and weaknesses, the risk of conflict and mistrust is reduced. They do not believe in equality; rather that every member has 'a voice in the production process [of a project]; however the member with the greatest expertise in the area has authority over the final product'.&lt;ref name="critical1"/&gt;

===Amateurism===
CAE has also stated that amateurs have the ability to see through dominant paradigms, are more free to recombine elements of paradigms thought long dead, and can apply everyday life experience to their deliberations. Most important, however, amateurs are not invested in institutional systems of knowledge production and policy construction, and hence do not have irresistible forces guiding the outcome of their process…'.&lt;ref&gt;Sholette 2005, p.52. cited in Critical Art Ensemble 2001, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future projects===

'Since 2006, CAE has changed the focus of its work towards a critique of US defense policy, and has moved away from its interrogation of biotechnology'.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Steve Kurtz's Trial===
In 2004, one of its founders, [[Steve Kurtz]], was arrested on suspicion of [[bioterrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/arts/design/03kenn.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin|title=The Artists in the Hazmat Suits|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=July 3, 2005|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 11 May 2004, he woke to find that his wife Hope had died in her sleep. He called 911. Police became suspicious after noticing his biology lab which he kept in his own home. They contacted the FBI and Kurtz was detained for 24 hours before being interrogated and his house searched for biohazardous materials. The house was given the all clear, yet a week later, Kurtz's CAE collaborators were ordered to appear before a grand jury to investigate possible violations of the law regarding biological weapons. The jury met in July 2004 and cleared Kurtz of all "bioterrorism" charges, however the FBI continued to press charges against the artist and the case dragged on for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.154.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was widely covered in the US and international press, and sparked outrage among artists and scientists worldwide. A website was created for people to donate money to help Kurtz pay his mounting legal fees. The case was dismissed in 2008. [http://caedefensefund.org -- CAE DEFENSE FUND --] According to Nicola Triscott, the FBI 'thought they had a situation out of which they could manufacture a terrorism case, which potentially brought great personal rewards', based upon the 'Lackawanna Six Sleeper Cell' case where six Yemeni Americans were convicted of supporting al-Qaeda&lt;ref&gt;Triscott 2009, p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Designer toys''', also called "Art Toys", are novelty toys and collectibles created by independent artists and designers, which they usually produce in [[limited edition]]s. Artists use a variety of materials, such as [[ABS plastic]], [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[wood]], [[metal]], [[latex]], and [[resin]]. Many designer toys are [[plush toys]]. Creators often have backgrounds in [[graphic design]], [[illustration]] or self-described [[Lowbrow (art movement)|low brow]] art; some artists have classical art and design training, while others are self-taught. The first designer toys appeared in the 1990s.

==Overview==
A typical example of designer toys are the [[Qee]] series, produced in [[Hong Kong]] by [[Toy2R]]. The standard size of [[Qee]] figures is 2" high, but 8" and 16" figures are also produced. Qees vary in their design, usually with the same basic body type, but with head sculpts that may be of a bear, a cat, a dog, a monkey, or a rabbit. Variations of the Qee are the ''Toyer'' with a head that resembles a cartoon skull; the ''Knuckle Bear'', which was created by Japanese character designer [[Touma (designer)|Touma]], and resembles a [[graffiti]]-style [[caricature]] of an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] bear; and the Qee ''Egg'', a [[Bird|bird's]] [[egg (biology)|egg]] with arms and legs. ''Blank'' Qees are produced in 2" and 8" sizes; these figures may be of any Qee sculpt, but are packaged unpainted, as [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] pieces. Each piece is designed by an artist and carries its own [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[Motif (visual arts)|theme]]. Each 2" figure is packaged with an optional [[keychain]] attachment.

Another example of designer toys is the Dunny series, produced by the American company [[Kidrobot]]. Dunny figures may be considered the Western counterpart of the Chinese [[Qee]] and the Japanese [[Be@rbrick]]. Dunny are a series of figures that resemble anthropomorphized rabbits in a cartoon style (a design originally illustrated by graffiti, [[stencil]], and [[Comics|comic]] artists) which are produced as 3", 8", and 20" figures. There is a variation of the Dunny figure called a [[Munny]], which resembles a monkey, and is only sold as an unpainted do-it-yourself piece. Some creators of designer toys are [[Hong Kong]]-based [[Michael Lau]], credited with the establishment of the Urban Vinyl movement; [[Devilrobots]], a five-person design team from Japan, known for their [[television]] character named TO-FU Oyako;&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Amos. "Design Style". ''Newtype USA'' '''6''' (11) 142&amp;ndash;143. November 2007. {{ISSN|1541-4817}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican artists Carlos &amp; Ernesto East "The Beast Brothers" which are known for their [[Dia de muertos]] and [[Aztec]] influences; American concert poster artist [[Frank Kozik|Frank Kozik's]] Mongers series and Labbit character; and British illustrator James Jarvis' cast of characters, produced as vinyl figures of varying sizes.

Most vinyl toys are produced in factories in China, though some designers have shifted production to Japan where higher quality materials such as clear vinyl are used. Designer toys are rarely produced in the United States due to environmental restrictions on the production of vinyl, some exceptions are resin and plush toys.

==Urban vinyl==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bigfootvinyl.jpg|right|thumb|120px|''Bigfoot'', an example of an urban vinyl toy, designed by San Francisco artist Bigfoot One, produced by STRANGEco in conjunction with Fifty24SF Gallery{{Pufc|1=Bigfootvinyl.jpg|log=27 March 2010}}]] --&gt;
'''Urban vinyl''' is a type of designer toy, featuring [[action figure]]s in particular which are usually made of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]. Although the term is sometimes used interchangeably with the term designer toy, it is more accurately used as a modifier: not all designer toys can be considered urban vinyl, while urban vinyl figures are necessarily designer toys, by virtue of the way in which they are produced. Like designer toys in general, urban vinyl figures feature original designs, small production numbers, and are marketed to collectors, predominantly adults.

What sets "urban" designer toys apart from general "designer" or "art" toys, is the subject matter. Anything dealing with graffiti, hip-hop, rap or other subjects typically tied to an urban environment.

The urban vinyl [[Fads and trends|trend]] was initiated by artist Eric So &amp; Michael Lau, who first created urban vinyl figures in Hong Kong in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/15/magazine/15DOLL.html?ei=5035&amp;en=9618348bd208ce1a&amp;ex=1178942400&amp;partner=MARKETWATCH&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position=| last=Lubow| first=Arthur| title=Cult Figure| date=15 August 2004| work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sacbee"&gt;{{Cite news| title=Not kids play| last=Leibrock| first=Rachel| date=6 January 2004| work=[[The Sacramento Bee]]| url=http://www.sacbee.com/content/lifestyle/v-print/story/8052930p-8987066c.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other creators of urban vinyl figures are Japanese artist and designer [[Takashi Murakami]] whose work has been exhibited in the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo]], and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], Australian designer [[Nathan Jurevicius]]'s [[Scarygirl]], based on characters from his comic of the same name, and produced in conjunction with Hong Kong company [[Flyingcat]], and former graffiti artist [[KAWS (artist)|KAWS]].

Urban vinyl figures are designed primarily by  illustrators, graffiti artists, musicians and [[Disc jockey|DJs]] from [[Urban culture|urban]] areas in Asia (especially Japan and Hong Kong), [[North America]] (especially the United States), and [[Europe]].

An offshoot of [[hip hop]] and youth-oriented [[popular culture]], urban vinyl often depicts real-life figures from Asian and American culture, particularly artists who perform in a hip-hop or related styles. Two examples are Lau's depiction of the [[Lazy Mutha Fucka|LMF]] rappers from Hong Kong, and figures based on the members of the virtual electronic band [[Gorillaz]], produced by Jamie Hewlett and made by Kidrobot.

Urban vinyl is commonly designated as either Eastern Vinyl, including anything designed and produced in Asia or Australia, or Western Vinyl, encompassing pieces which are designed and produced in North America, [[South America]], or Europe. Urban vinyl figures have become [[collectable|collectible]] items. Rare pieces may sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="millionaire"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.millionaireplayboy.com/toys/urbanvinyl.php| first=Kristian [Jager]|last=Yeager|title=A Look at Urban Vinyl and Where it Came From| year=2004| work=Millionaire Playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resin toys==
Some artists create their toys using synthetic [[resin]] material and [[resin casting]]. After casting the resin toy receives adjustments in its details, sometimes being superficially cast on some parts. The toy can be finished using automotive paint by aerosol and sometimes receives a varnished layer above the dry painting.

The process of making resin toys is more labor-intensive and time-consuming than industrialized vinyl toy production, which in most of cases are made identical and in large quantities. But resin casting allows artists to produce toys in small numbers. Most vinyl factories will only produce toys in large series. Resin toys have become a way for less established artists to produce a toy without the large financial investment required to produce a vinyl toy. Unlike most vinyl toys, resin toys are usually sculpted, cast, and painted by a single artist as shown in the book "We are indie Toys" by [[HarperCollins]] {{ISBN|9780062293435}}.&lt;ref name="IndieToys"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bou | first = Louis | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = We Are Indie Toys | journal = [[HarperCollins]] | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | date=  February 2014 | url =  | doi = | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designer plush==
Designer plush, a subcategory of designer toys, are soft, stuffed dolls created in limited quantities by artists and designers. Common designs include [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] animals or [[fantasy|fantastic]] human likenesses, although designer plush dolls often feature entirely unique character designs. Designer plush dolls are usually given names and [[persona]]s, with their distinctive personalities described on their tags or in booklets included in their packaging.

One producer of designer plush is [[Friends With You]], a commercial art and design collective based in [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. Their work is characterized by a cute yet bizarre aesthetic, and exhibits a hand-made quality, even in pieces that are machine-made. In addition to their plush dolls, Friends With You also create [[Modular design|modular]] wood toys, and [[motion graphic]]s for companies such as [[Sony]], [[MTV]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Columbia Records]].

Another type of designer plush are [[Uglydolls]], created by independent toy designers David Horvath and Sun-Min Kim under the label Pretty Ugly. Their first products were 12" plush dolls based on drawings by David Horvath’s, and handmade by Sun-Min Kim. Pretty Ugly has also produced 7" versions of their character designs, called ''Little Uglys'', 24" versions called ''Giant Uglys'', 4" miniatures intended for use as keychains, and in a departure from the plush medium, 7" ''Vinyl Uglys''. With Ugly Dolls being featured in motion pictures like Zarthura and in major specialty stores the brand has gone from exclusive to Mass appeal in mainstream.&lt;ref name="Hollywood goes Ugly"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Hollywood Toyboy | work = TD Monthly | url = http://www.toydirectory.com/monthly/article.asp?id=1492 | author = TDmonthly Staff | date = 1 September 2005 | accessdate = 2008-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designer consumer electronics==
A recent addition to the world of vinyl toys, '''designer consumer electronics''' is a subcategory started by [[mimoco]], whose [[mimobot]] Art Toy [[USB flash drive|Flash Drives]] proved that there was a market for Urban Vinyl products with a purpose. Like other platform art toys, there have been mimobot designs by a wide variety of artists, including [[Mori Chack]], [[Sket One]] and [[Jon Burgerman]]. The appeal of designer consumer electronics in flash memory form tends to be the addition of a digital canvas, allowing affiliated artists to create much more in-depth characters, complete with animations, music, etc.

Designer consumer electronics are not limited to mimobots; in 2007, [[Medicom]] brought out a [[Be@rbrick]] [[USB flash drive]].[http://www.lafab.us/brand/Xoopar Xoopar]  designs the XBoy line of Bluetooth speakers

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6005">The '''Domhnach Airgid''' (English: '''Sliver Church''') is an 8th-century Irish metalwork and wooden book [[shrine]] of the [[cumdach]] type, held at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Dublin&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.culturalheritageireland.ie/index.php/component/content/article/67-metalwork/188-the-domhnach-airgid- The Domhnach Airgid]". Cultural Heritage Ireland. Retrieved 1 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; since 1847.&lt;ref name="dd464" /&gt; It is traditionally associated with [[Saint Patrick]], who was thought to have had it in his possession at one point.

Domhnach Airgid comprises two separate main elements: an outer casket or box and the fragments of a 6th-9th century manuscript it was built to hold. The wooden oblong box is heavily inscribed, with lettering running right around the outer borders, and it is covered by silver and bronze panels which contain fragments of [[vellum]] manuscript of the [[Gospels]] written in Latin.&lt;ref name="Cornhill"&gt;"The Study of Celtic Literature". ''The Cornhill magazine'', Volume 11; Volume 13. Guildford: Cornhill 1993. p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-nine pages of the manuscript survive,&lt;ref name="dd464"&gt;Diringer (1986), 464&lt;/ref&gt; each about nine inches in height.&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt;

The shrine was redesigned c 1350, when the much of the extant metalwork and [[relief]] plaques on the cover were added. The work is thus a mixture of the non-contemporary [[Insular art]] and [[International Gothic]] styles.

==Design==

Domhnach Airgid's casket was designed to hold relics and consists of three covers, with the center one being made of wood, probably from [[yew]]. Another is made from copper, plated with silver. The outer cover, pictured above, is of the highest quality, and lined with silver and decorated by [[gilding]].&lt;ref name="oc322"&gt;O'Curry (1878), 322&lt;/ref&gt; The cover contains a series of elevated carving centered on a representation of Jesus on [[Crucifix|the cross]] surrounded by eleven smaller sized figures, including a grouping of three [[apostles]], probably James, Peter and Paul, the panel showing the [[Archangel Michael]] and the Virgin and Child, a panel with a grouping of [[Saint Colmcille]], [[St. Brigid]] and Patrick, while with the saint at the lower right is thought to represent of Patrick presenting a cumdach to [[Mac Cairthinn of Clogher|St. Macartan]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://irisharchaeology.ie/2015/02/the-domhnach-airgid-an-early-irish-book-shrine/ The Domhnach Airgid, an Early Irish Book Shrine]". Irish Archaeology, 2015. Retrieved 1 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The corners of the frontispiece contain a series of running animals or [[grotesques]] placed on small mounts. A dove, representing the [[Holy Spirit]] and decorated with a crystal, hovers above Christ's head.&lt;ref name="oc323"&gt;O'Curry (1878), 323&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures are ornately and delicately carved. The cover was built to hold a number of [[relic]]s, by legend associated with Patrick. In this tradition, the shrine was thought to have been in his possession and was sanctified by him&lt;ref name="oc12"&gt;O'Curry (1861), 12&lt;/ref&gt; before he gave it to St. Macartan. It thus became a significant and prized object that was widely venerated.&lt;ref name="ot98"&gt;O'Toole (2013), 98&lt;/ref&gt;


The case was significantly remodeled around 1350 (a dating established by [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]]) by the goldsmith John O’Bardan, during work commissioned by John O’Carbri, [[Clones Abbey|abbot of Clones]]. O’Bardan, whose signature appears on the object and is known to have lived in [[Drogheda]], modernised the appearance of the shrine in the contemporary International Gothic style,&lt;ref name="ot98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="h510"&gt;Hourihane (2012), 510&lt;/ref&gt; and added the figures of Jesus and the saints.&lt;ref name="ot98" /&gt; O’Carbri likely had political motivations for commissioning the redesign in the context of the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland]]. The Normans sought to undermine the established order, in part by undermining and reforming Irish Christianity, while seeking to detach it from its Celtic basis. In response, some clerics fought back by refurbishing and restoring early medieval sacred objects in order to reinforce the island's cultural identity.&lt;ref name="ot98"  /&gt;

Due to its age, the Domhnach Airgid is not in good condition. Areas of the gilding contain accumulations of dirt, and any colourisation has long since faded, giving it its current dark appearance of mostly brown and black hues.&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt;

==Manuscript==
The manuscript is of the Cathach (literally "Battle Book") style,&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt; indicating an apocryphal use as a rallying cry or protector in battle. There are 39 surviving leaves, with text written in the [[Insular script|Irish majuscule]] script.&lt;ref name="dd464" /&gt; The manuscript leaves are very worn down, and some have become detached from their casing.&lt;ref name="oc12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17408">'''Ecocriticism''' is the study of [[literature]] and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] from an [[interdisciplinary]] point of view, where literature scholars analyze texts that illustrate environmental concerns and examine the various ways literature treats the subject of [[nature]]. Some ecocritics brainstorm possible solutions for the correction of the contemporary environmental situation, though not all ecocritics agree on the purpose, methodology, or scope of ecocriticism. 
In the United States, ecocriticism is often associated with the [[Association for the Study of Literature and Environment]] (ASLE),&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; which hosts biennial meetings for scholars who deal with environmental matters in literature.  ASLE publishes a journal&amp;mdash;''Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment'' (''ISLE'')&amp;mdash;in which current international scholarship can be found.

Ecocriticism is an intentionally broad approach that is known by a number of other designations, including "green (cultural) studies", "[[Ecopoetry|ecopoetics]]", and "environmental literary criticism" and is often informed by other fields such as [[ecology]], [[sustainable design]], [[biopolitics]], [[environmental history]], [[environmentalism]], and [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], among others.

== Definition ==
In comparison with other 'political' forms of criticism, there has been relatively little dispute about the moral and philosophical aims of ecocriticism, although its scope has broadened rapidly from nature writing, romantic poetry, and canonical literature to take in film, television, theatre, animal stories, architectures, scientific narratives and an extraordinary range of literary texts. At the same time, ecocriticism has borrowed methodologies and theoretically informed approaches liberally from other fields of literary, social and scientific study.

Cheryll Glotfelty's working definition in ''The Ecocriticism Reader'' is that "ecocriticism is the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environment",&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and one of the implicit goals of the approach is to recoup professional dignity for what Glotfelty calls the "undervalued genre of nature writing".&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p. xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Buell defines "'ecocriticism' ... as [a] study of the relationship between literature and the environment conducted in a spirit of commitment to environmentalist praxis".&lt;ref&gt;430, n.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Estok noted in 2001 that "ecocriticism has distinguished itself, debates notwithstanding, firstly by the ethical stand it takes, its commitment to the natural world as an important thing rather than simply as an object of thematic study, and, secondly, by its commitment to making connections".&lt;ref&gt;Estok 2001, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, in an article that extends ecocriticism to Shakespearean studies, Estok argues that ecocriticism is more than "simply the study of Nature or natural things in literature; rather, it is any theory that is committed to effecting change by analyzing the function–thematic, artistic, social, historical, ideological, theoretical, or otherwise–of the natural environment, or aspects of it, represented in documents (literary or other) that contribute to material practices in material worlds".&lt;ref&gt;Estok 2005, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; This echoes the functional approach of the [[cultural ecology]] branch of ecocriticism, which analyzes the analogies between ecosystems and imaginative texts and posits that such texts potentially have an ecological (regenerative, revitalizing) function in the cultural system.&lt;ref&gt;Zapf 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As Michael P. Cohen has observed, "if you want to be an ecocritic, be prepared to explain what you do and be criticized, if not satirized."   Certainly, Cohen adds his voice to such critique, noting that one of the problems of ecocriticism has been what he calls its "praise-song school" of criticism. All ecocritics share an environmentalist motivation of some sort, but whereas the majority are 'nature endorsing',&lt;ref&gt;[[Kate Soper]], "What is Nature?", 1998&lt;/ref&gt; some are 'nature sceptical'. In part this entails a shared sense of the ways in which 'nature' has been used to legitimise gender, sexual and racial norms (so homosexuality has been seen as 'unnatural', for example), but it also involves scepticism about the uses to which 'ecological' language is put in ecocriticism; it can also involve a critique of the ways cultural norms of nature and the environment contribute to environmental degradation. Greg Garrard has dubbed 'pastoral ecology' the notion that nature undisturbed is balanced and harmonious,&lt;ref&gt;Barry 2009, pp. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt; while Dana Phillips has criticised the literary quality and scientific accuracy of nature writing in "The Truth of Ecology". Similarly, there has been a call to recognize the place of the [[Environmental Justice]] movement in redefining ecocritical discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Buell 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the question of what ecocriticism is or should be, Camilo Gomides has offered an operational definition that is both broad and discriminating: "The field of enquiry that analyzes and promotes works of art which raise moral questions about human interactions with nature, while also motivating audiences to live within a limit that will be binding over generations" (16). He tests it for a film (mal)adaptation about Amazonian deforestation. Implementing the Gomides definition, Joseph Henry Vogel makes the case that ecocriticism constitutes an "economic school of thought" as it engages audiences to debate issues of resource allocation that have no technical solution. Ashton Nichols has recently argued that the historical dangers of a romantic version of nature now need to be replaced by "urbanatural roosting", a view that sees urban life and the natural world as closely linked and argues for humans to live more lightly on the planet, the way virtually all other species do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.macmillan.com/beyondromanticecocriticism-1/AshtonNichols|title=Macmillan|first=|last=Macmillan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literary studies==
Ecocritics investigate such things as the underlying [[ecology|ecological]] values, what, precisely, is meant by the word nature, and whether the examination of "place" should be a distinctive category, much like class, gender or race. Ecocritics examine human perception of [[wilderness]], and how it has changed throughout history and whether or not current environmental issues are accurately represented or even mentioned in popular culture and modern literature. Scholars in ecocriticism engage in questions regarding [[anthropocentrism]], and the "mainstream assumption that the natural world be seen primarily as a resource for human beings" as well as critical approaches to changing ideas in "the material and cultural bases of modern society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Timothy|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Literature and the Environment|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=New York|isbn=9780521720908|page=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=May 19, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other disciplines, such as history, economics, philosophy, ethics, and psychology, are also considered by ecocritics to be possible contributors to ecocriticism.

While William Rueckert may have been the first person to use the term ''ecocriticism'' (Barry 240) in his 1978 essay entitled ''Literature and Ecology: An Experiment in Ecocriticism,'' ecocriticism as a movement owes much to [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 environmental exposé ''[[Silent Spring]]''. Drawing from this critical moment, Rueckert's intent was to focus on "the application of ecology and ecological concepts to the study of literature".&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;107&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecologically minded individuals and scholars have been publishing progressive works of ecotheory and criticism since the explosion of environmentalism in the late 1960s and 1970s. However, because there was no organized movement to study the ecological/environmental side of literature, these important works were scattered and categorized under a litany of different subject headings: [[pastoral]]ism, human ecology, regionalism, American Studies etc. British [[marxist literary criticism|marxist critic]] [[Raymond Williams]], for example, wrote a seminal critique of pastoral literature in 1973, ''[[The Country and the City]]''.

Another early ecocritical text, Joseph Meeker's ''The Comedy of Survival'' (1974), proposed a version of an argument that was later to dominate ecocriticism and environmental philosophy; that environmental crisis is caused primarily by a cultural tradition in the West of separation of culture from nature, and elevation of the former to moral predominance. Such [[anthropocentrism]] is identified in the tragic conception of a hero whose moral struggles are more important than mere biological survival, whereas the science of animal ethology, Meeker asserts, shows that a "comic mode" of muddling through and "making love not war" has superior ecological value. In the later, "second wave" ecocriticism, Meeker's adoption of an ecophilosophical position with apparent scientific sanction as a measure of literary value tended to prevail over Williams's ideological and historical critique of the shifts in a literary genre's representation of nature.

As Glotfelty noted in ''The Ecocriticism Reader'', "One indication of the disunity of the early efforts is that these critics rarely cited one another's work; they didn't know that it existed...Each was a single voice howling in the wilderness."&lt;ref&gt;Glotfelty &amp; Fromm 1996, p. vii&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ecocriticism—unlike feminist and Marxist criticisms—failed to crystallize into a coherent movement in the late 1970s, and indeed only did so in the USA in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the mid-1980s, scholars began to work collectively to establish ecocritism as a genre, primarily through the work of the [[Western Literature Association]] in which the revaluation of nature writing as a non-fictional literary genre could function. In 1990, at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]], Glotfelty became the first person to hold an academic position as a professor of Literature and the Environment, and UNR has retained the position it established at that time as the intellectual home of ecocriticism even as ASLE has burgeoned into an organization with thousands of members in the US alone. From the late 1990s, new branches of ASLE and affiliated organizations were started in the UK, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand (ASLEC-ANZ), India (OSLE-India), Taiwan, Canada and Europe.

'''Estudio Lamela''' is a Spanish firm of architecture and urbanism based in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

==History==
Estudio Lamela was created in 1954 when Antonio Lamela ([[Madrid]], 1926) obtained his architecture degree. The firm is presently headed by his son Carlos Lamela ([[Madrid]], 1957), who has been a qualified architect since 1981. From its beginnings, Estudio Lamela has grown to become one of the main architecture firms of Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archello: Estudio Lamela|url=http://sp.archello.com/en/company/estudio-lamela|website=Archello}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Carlos Lamela|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2005/01/09/eps/1105255609_850215.html|website=El Pais|publisher=Grupo Prisa|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a very prolific output in the fields of residential and tourist architecture.

The firm’s architectural approach is to provide technically innovative solutions from a modern and rational perspective. It has developed large national and international projects in all architectural areas, especially residential, tertiary, sports and airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Estudio Lamela Arquitectos 2008- 2012|publisher=General de Editores de Arquitectura|isbn=978-84-940229-1-3|url=https://www.tccuadernos.com/monografias/175-estudio-lamela-arquitectos-2008-2012.html|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, the firm has undertaken projects in more than 30 countries and has opened branch offices in [[Warsaw]] (2002), [[Mexico City]] (2006) and [[Doha]] (2013). It is a founding member of the [http://www.e-a-n.eu Architects Network (EAN)], an organization that unites architectural firms in Europe.

==Highlighted works==
===Spain===
* Residential and tourist buildings in Madrid (O'Donnell 33, 1958; Conjunto Castellana, 1960; Conjunto Galaxia, 1966) as well as numerous buildings on the island of [[Majorca]] and in [[Malaga]] (Costa del Sol). Examples: La Caleta, Torremar, Playamar, La Nogalera, Parquemar, etc.
*First modern hotels: Motel El Hidalgo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sánchez-Migallón Jimenés|first1=Toedoro|title=Motel- El Hidalgo|url=http://oa.upm.es/38334/|publisher=UPM|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1960); [[Meliá Hotels International|Meliá]] Torremolinos (1962) and [[Meliá Hotels International|Meliá]] Madrid (1967).
*Office buildings: In Madrid, the O'Donnell Building 34 and [[Torres de Colón|Torres Colón]] (1967-1977) stand out. This latter structure is considered one of the most important buildings of Spanish architecture for its novel suspended construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Torres Colón, Madrid (España)|journal=Informes de la Construcción - CSIC|volume=30|issue=293|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains the world record for the number of floors suspended in a reinforced concrete structure. In addition, other emblematic works are the Pyramid Building (1978) and the International Bank of Commerce (1979), which has now been remodeled for the company GMP. Alongside these buildings are also the Cristalia Buildings, the Ebrosa Building, the [[John Deere]] headquarters, the Leitner Building, the [[IMDEA Software Institute]] and Caja Badajoz. [[File:Estudio Lamela CajaBadajoz.jpg|thumb|Estudio Lamela. Headquarters of Caja Badajoz]]
* Remodeling of the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]] (1988-1994). The firm proposed a facade and a third upper ring designed to seat 20,000 spectators. The challenge was to make this adaptation while the Stadium continued to be used regularly. [[File:Estadio Santiago Bérnabeu (Mayo 2010) (4624134213).jpg|thumb|Estudio Lamela. Remodeling of the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]]

'''Etching''' is traditionally the process of using strong [[acid]] or [[mordant]] to cut into the unprotected parts of a [[metal]] surface to create a design in [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] (incised) in the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/etching |title=Etching &amp;#124; Definition of etching by Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern manufacturing, other chemicals may be used on other types of material. As a method of [[printmaking]], it is, along with [[engraving]], the most important technique for [[old master print]]s, and remains in wide use today.  In a number of modern variants such as [[Etching (microfabrication)|microfabrication etching]] and [[photochemical machining|photochemical milling]] it is a crucial technique in much modern technology, including [[circuit board]]s.

In traditional pure etching, a metal (usually copper, zinc or steel) plate is covered with a waxy [[ground (drawing surface)|ground]] which is resistant to acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cairnsregionalgallery.com.au/ed-artiststudio.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Artist's Stdio : What Is Etching? |publisher=Cairnsregionalgallery.com.au |accessdate=2015-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906124255/http://www.cairnsregionalgallery.com.au/ed-artiststudio.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist then scratches off the ground with a pointed etching needle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/207.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he or she wants a line to appear in the finished piece, so exposing the bare metal. The échoppe, a tool with a slanted oval section, is also used for "swelling" lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/209.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plate is then dipped in a bath of acid, technically called the ''[[mordant]]'' ([[French language|French]] for "biting") or ''etchant'', or has acid washed over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/210.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acid "bites" into the metal (it dissolves part of the metal) where it is exposed, leaving behind lines sunk into the plate. The remaining ground is then cleaned off the plate. The plate is inked all over, and then the ink wiped off the surface, leaving only the ink in the etched lines.

The plate is then put through a high-pressure [[printing press]] together with a sheet of paper (often moistened to soften it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/204.htm |title=Abraham Bosse |language=fr|publisher=Expositions.bnf.fr |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper picks up the ink from the etched lines, making a print. The process can be repeated many times; typically several hundred impressions (copies) could be printed before the plate shows much sign of wear. The work on the plate can also be added to by repeating the whole process; this creates an etching which exists in more than one [[State (printmaking)|state]].

Etching has often been combined with other [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] techniques such as [[engraving]] (e.g., [[Rembrandt]]) or [[aquatint]] (e.g., [[Francisco Goya]]).

[[Image:Virgin and child with cat.jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]], [[The Virgin and Child with a Cat]], 1654. Original copper etching plate above, example of the print below, with composition reversed.]]
{{Main|Old master print}}

===Origin===
Etching by [[goldsmith]]s and other metal-workers in order to decorate metal items such as guns, armour, cups and plates has been known in Europe since the [[Middle Ages]] at least, and may go back to antiquity. The elaborate decoration of armour, in Germany at least, was an art probably imported from Italy around the end of the 15th century—little earlier than the birth of etching as a printmaking technique. Printmakers from the German-speaking lands and Central Europe perfected the art and transmitted their skills over the Alps and across Europe. [[File:Wenzel Hollar nach Jan Meyssens.jpg|thumb|Self-portrait etched by Wenceslaus Hollar]]

[[File:BM engraved printing plates.jpg|thumb|Selection of early etched printing plates from the [[British Museum]]]]

The process as applied to printmaking is believed to have been invented by [[Daniel Hopfer]] (circa 1470–1536) of Augsburg, Germany. Hopfer was a craftsman who decorated armour in this way, and applied the method to printmaking, using iron plates (many of which still exist). Apart from his prints, there are two proven examples of his work on armour: a shield from 1536 now in the Real Armeria of Madrid and a sword in the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]] of Nuremberg. An Augsburg horse armour in the [[German Historical Museum]], [[Berlin]], dating to between 1512 and 1515, is decorated with motifs from Hopfer's etchings and [[woodcut]]s, but this is no evidence that Hopfer himself worked on it, as his decorative prints were largely produced as patterns for other craftsmen in various media. The oldest dated etching is by [[Albrecht Dürer]] in 1515, although he returned to engraving after six etchings instead of developing the craft.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Brian D. [http://artinprint.org/article/freedom-and-resistance-in-the-act-of-engraving-or-why-durer-gave-up-on-etching/ "Freedom and Resistance in the Act of Engraving (or, Why Dürer Gave up on Etching),"] &lt;i&gt;Art in Print&lt;/i&gt; Vol. 7 No. 3 (September-October 2017), 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The switch to copper plates was probably made in Italy, and thereafter etching soon came to challenge [[engraving]] as the most popular medium for artists in [[printmaking]]. Its great advantage was that, unlike engraving where the difficult technique for using the [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] requires special skill in metalworking, the basic technique for creating the image on the plate in etching is relatively easy to learn for an artist trained in drawing.  On the other hand, the handling of the ground and acid need skill and experience, and are not without health and safety risks, as well as the risk of a ruined plate.

Prior to 1100&amp;nbsp;AD, the New World [[Hohokam]] independently utilized the technique of acid etching in marine shell designs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Farb]], ''Man's Rise to Civilization'' (1978) p.205, citing [[Emil Haury|Emil Walter Haury]], ''The Hohokam: Desert Farmers and Craftsmen'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Callot's innovations: échoppe, hard ground, stopping-out===
[[Jacques Callot]] (1592–1635) from [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]] (now part of France) made important technical advances in etching technique. He developed the échoppe, a type of etching-needle with a slanting oval section at the end, which enabled etchers to create a swelling line, as engravers were able to do.
[[Image:Gärtnerin mit Korb (Belange).jpg|thumb|right|Etching by [[Jacques Bellange]], ''Gardener with basket'' c. 1612]]

Callot also appears to have been responsible for an improved, harder, recipe for the etching ground, using [[lute]]-makers' varnish rather than a wax-based formula. This enabled lines to be more deeply bitten, prolonging the life of the plate in printing, and also greatly reducing the risk of "foul-biting", where acid gets through the ground to the plate where it is not intended to, producing spots or blotches on the image. Previously the risk of foul-biting had always been at the back of an etcher's mind, preventing too much time on a single plate that risked being ruined in the biting process. Now etchers could do the highly detailed work that was previously the monopoly of engravers, and Callot made full use of the new possibilities.

Callot also made more extensive and sophisticated use of multiple "stoppings-out" than previous etchers had done. This is the technique of letting the acid bite lightly over the whole plate, then stopping-out those parts of the work which the artist wishes to keep light in tone by covering them with ground before bathing the plate in acid again. He achieved unprecedented subtlety in effects of distance and light and shade by careful control of this process. Most of his prints were relatively small—up to about six inches or 15&amp;nbsp;cm on their longest dimension, but packed with detail.

One of his followers, the Parisian [[Abraham Bosse]], spread Callot's innovations all over Europe with the first published manual of etching, which was translated into Italian, Dutch, German and English.

The 17th century was the great age of etching, with [[Rembrandt]], [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]] and many other masters. In the 18th century, [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]], [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] and [[Daniel Chodowiecki]] were the best of a smaller number of fine etchers. In the 19th and early 20th century, the [[Etching revival]] produced a host of lesser artists, but no really major figures. Etching is still widely practiced today.

==Variants==
[[Aquatint]] uses acid-resistant resin to achieve tonal effects.

Soft-ground etching uses a special softer ground. The artist places a piece of paper (or cloth etc. in modern uses) over the ground and draws on it. The print resembles a drawing.

{{further|William Blake#Relief etching}}
Relief etching was invented by [[William Blake]] in about 1788, and he has been almost the only artist to use it in [[All Religions are One#Relief etching|its original form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/biography.xq?b=illum&amp;targ_div=d1| title = Illuminated Printing| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| date = 2003| accessdate = January 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from 1880–1950 a photo-mechanical ("line-block") variant was the dominant form of commercial printing for images. A similar process to etching, but printed as a [[relief print]], so it is the "white" background areas which are exposed to the acid, and the areas to print "black" which are covered with ground. Blake's exact technique remains controversial. He used the technique to print texts and images together, writing the text and drawing lines with an acid-resistant medium.

Carbograph etching was invented in 2006 and yields an image like that of a charcoal drawing:

==Printmaking technique in detail==
[[File:Tools of etching.svg|thumb|600px|left|Steps in the typical technique]]
A waxy acid-resist, known as a ground, is applied to a metal plate, most often [[copper]] or [[zinc]] but [[steel]] plate is another medium with different qualities. There are two common types of ground: hard ground and soft ground.

Hard ground can be applied in two ways. Solid hard ground comes in a hard waxy block. To apply hard ground of this variety, the plate to be etched is placed upon a hot-plate (set at 70 degrees C), a kind of metal worktop that is heated up. The plate heats up and the ground is applied by hand, melting onto the plate as it is applied. The ground is spread over the plate as evenly as possible using a roller. Once applied the etching plate is removed from the hot-plate and allowed to cool which hardens the ground.

After the ground has hardened the artist "smokes" the plate, classically with 3 beeswax tapers, applying the flame to the plate to darken the ground and make it easier to see what parts of the plate are exposed. Smoking not only darkens the plate but adds a small amount of wax. Afterwards the artist uses a sharp tool to scratch into the ground, exposing the metal.
[[File:America a Prophecy copy a plate 01.jpg|thumb|Relief etching by William Blake, frontispiece to ''[[America a Prophecy]]'' (Copy A, printed 1795)]]
[[Image:Paula Modersohn-Becker Landschaft unter Bäumen.jpg|thumb|right|''Landscape under Trees'', etching by [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]], c. 1902]]

The second way to apply hard ground is by liquid hard ground. This comes in a can and is applied with a brush upon the plate to be etched. Exposed to air the hard ground will harden. Some printmakers use
oil/tar based [[asphaltum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magical-secrets.com/studio/glossary |title=Glossary &amp;#124; Magical-Secrets: A Printmaking Community |publisher=Magical-Secrets |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[bitumen]] as hard ground, although often bitumen is used to protect steel plates from rust and copper plates from aging.

Soft ground also comes in liquid form and is allowed to dry but it does not dry hard like hard ground and is impressionable. After the soft ground has dried the printmaker may apply materials such as leaves, objects, hand prints and so on which will penetrate the soft ground and expose the plate underneath.

The ground can also be applied in a fine mist, using powdered rosin or spraypaint. This process is called aquatint, and allows for the creation of tones, shadows, and solid areas of color.

The design is then drawn (in reverse) with an etching-needle or échoppe. An "echoppe" point can be made from an ordinary tempered steel etching needle, by grinding the point back on a carborundum stone, at a 45–60 degree angle. The "echoppe" works on the same principle that makes a fountain pen's line more attractive than a ballpoint's: The slight swelling variation caused by the natural movement of the hand "warms up" the line, and although hardly noticeable in any individual line, has a very attractive overall effect on the finished plate. It can be drawn with in the same way as an ordinary needle.

The plate is then completely submerged in a solution that eats away at the exposed metal. [[Iron(III) chloride|Ferric chloride]] may be used for etching copper or zinc plates, whereas nitric acid may be used for etching zinc or steel plates. Typical solutions are 1 part FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to 1 part water and 1 part nitric to 3 parts water. The strength of the acid determines the speed of the etching process.
* The etching process is known as ''biting'' (see also spit-biting below).
* The waxy resist prevents the [[acid]] from biting the parts of the plate which have been covered.
* The longer the plate remains in the acid the deeper the "bites" become.

[[Image:Aetzung Landschaft.jpg|thumb|left|Example of etching]]
During the etching process the printmaker uses a bird feather or similar item to wave away bubbles and detritus produced by the dissolving process, from the surface of the plate, or the plate may be periodically lifted from the acid bath. If a bubble is allowed to remain on the plate then it will stop the acid biting into the plate where the bubble touches it. Zinc produces more bubbles much more rapidly than copper and steel and some artists use this to produce interesting round bubble-like circles within their prints for a Milky Way effect.

The detritus is powdery dissolved metal that fills the etched grooves and can also block the acid from biting evenly into the exposed plate surfaces. Another way to remove detritus from a plate is to place the plate to be etched face down within the acid upon plasticine balls or marbles, although the drawback of this technique is the exposure to bubbles and the inability to remove them readily.

For aquatinting a printmaker will often use a test strip of metal about a centimetre to three centimetres wide. The strip will be dipped into the acid for a specific number of minutes or seconds. The metal strip will then be removed and the acid washed off with water. Part of the strip will be covered in ground and then the strip is redipped into the acid and the process repeated. The ground will then be removed from the strip and the strip inked up and printed. This will show the printmaker the different degrees or depths of the etch, and therefore the strength of the ink color, based upon how long the plate is left in the acid.

The plate is removed from the acid and washed over with water to remove the acid. The ground is removed with a solvent such as [[turpentine]]. Turpentine is often removed from the plate using methylated spirits since turpentine is greasy and can affect the application of ink and the printing of the plate.

Spit-biting is a process whereby the printmaker will apply acid to a plate with a brush in certain areas of the plate. The plate may be aquatinted for this purpose or exposed directly to the acid. The process is known as "spit"-biting due to the use of saliva once used as a medium to dilute the acid, although gum arabic or water are now commonly used.

[[Image:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878 (2).jpg|thumb|''Pornocrates'' by [[Félicien Rops]]. Etching and [[aquatint]]]]
A piece of matte board, a plastic "card", or a wad of cloth is often used to push the ink into the incised lines. The surface is wiped clean with a piece of stiff fabric known as ''[[tarlatan]]'' and then wiped with [[newsprint]] paper; some printmakers prefer to use the blade part of their hand or palm at the base of their thumb. The wiping leaves ink in the incisions. You may also use a folded piece of organza silk to do the final wipe. If copper or zinc plates are used, then the plate surface is left very clean and therefore white in the print. If steel plate is used, then the plate's natural tooth gives the print a grey background similar to the effects of aquatinting. As a result, steel plates do not need aquatinting as gradual exposure of the plate via successive dips into acid will produce the same result.

A damp piece of paper is placed over the plate and it is run through the press.

===Nontoxic etching===
Growing concerns about the health effects of acids and solvents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/artsafety/sec13.htm |title=Welcome to the Office of Environmental Health and Safety &amp;#124; Office of Environmental Health and Safety |publisher=Web.princeton.edu |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/node/9287 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825165930/http://www.chicagoartistsresource.org/node/9287 |date=August 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the development of less toxic etching methods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenart.info/galvetch/etchtabl.htm |title=Traditional intaglio printmaking methods, their health hazards, new non-toxic substitutes |publisher=Greenart.info |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 20th century. An early innovation was the use of floor wax as a hard ground for coating the plate. Others, such as printmakers Mark Zaffron and Keith Howard, developed systems using [[acrylic polymer]]s as a ground and ferric chloride for etching. The polymers are removed with sodium carbonate (washing soda) solution, rather than solvents. When used for etching, ferric chloride does not produce a corrosive gas, as acids do, thus eliminating another danger of traditional etching.

The traditional aquatint, which uses either powdered rosin or enamel spray paint, is replaced with an airbrush application of the acrylic polymer hard ground. Again, no solvents are needed beyond the soda ash solution, though a ventilation hood is needed due to acrylic particulates from the air brush spray.

The traditional soft ground, requiring solvents for removal from the plate, is replaced with water-based relief printing ink. The ink receives impressions like traditional soft ground, resists the ferric chloride etchant, yet can be cleaned up with warm water and either soda ash solution or ammonia.

Anodic etching has been used in industrial processes for over a century. The etching power is a source of direct current. The item to be etched (anode) is connected to its positive pole. A receiver plate (cathode) is connected to its negative pole. Both, spaced slightly apart, are immersed in a suitable aqueous solution of a suitable electrolyte. The current pushes the metal out from the anode into solution and deposits it as metal on the cathode. Shortly before 1990, two groups working independently&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Behr | first = Marion | last2 = Behr | first2 = Omri | title = Environmentally safe Etching | journal = Chem Tech | volume = 21 | issue = #4 | pages = 210– | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nick|first1=Semenoff|last2=Christof|first2=C.|title=Using Dry Copier Toners in Intaglio and Electro-Etching of metal Plates|journal=Leonardo|date=1999|volume=24|issue=4|pages=389–394|doi=10.2307/1575513|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed different ways of applying it to creating intaglio printing plates.

Some of the earliest printmaking workshops experimenting with, developing and promoting nontoxic techniques include Grafisk Eksperimentarium, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Edinburgh Printmakers, in Scotland, and [[New Grounds Print Workshop]], in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

===Photo-etching===
[[File:2013 12 diciembre (30)2.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Luca Giordano]], 18th century]]
{{main|Photochemical machining}}
Light sensitive polymer plates allow for photorealistic etchings. A photo-sensitive coating is applied to the plate by either the plate supplier or the artist. Light is projected onto the plate as a negative image to expose it. Photopolymer plates are either washed in hot water or under other chemicals according to the plate manufacturers' instructions. Areas of the photo-etch image may be stopped-out before etching to exclude them from the final image on the plate, or removed or lightened by scraping and burnishing once the plate has been etched. Once the photo-etching process is complete, the plate can be worked further as a normal intaglio plate, using [[Drypoint|drypoint]], further etching, engraving, etc. The final result is an intaglio plate which is printed like any other.

==Types of metal plates==
[[File:Insekto_(1976)_01.jpg|thumb|Insekto [[Lito Mayo]], Philippines,1976]]
{{main|Photochemical machining}}

[[Copper]] is a traditional metal, and is still preferred, for etching, as it bites evenly, holds texture well, and does not distort the color of the ink when wiped. [[Zinc]] is cheaper than copper, so preferable for beginners, but it does not bite as cleanly as copper does, and it alters some colors of ink. [[Steel]] is growing in popularity as an etching substrate. Increases in the prices of copper and zinc have steered steel to an acceptable alternative. The line quality of steel is less fine than copper, but finer than zinc. Steel has a natural and rich aquatint.

The type of metal used for the plate impacts the number of prints the plate will produce. The firm pressure of the printing press slowly rubs out the finer details of the image with every pass-through. With relatively soft copper, for example, the etching details will begin to wear very quickly, some copper plates show extreme wear after only ten prints. Steel, on the other hand, is incredibly durable. This wearing out of the image over time is one of the reasons etched prints created early in a numbered series tend to be valued more highly. An artist thus takes the total number of prints he or she wishes to produce into account whenever choosing the metal.

==Industrial uses==
{{Main|Chemical milling}}
{{See also|Etching (microfabrication)}}
Etching is also used in the manufacturing of [[printed circuit board]]s and [[semiconductor device]]s, and in the preparation of metallic specimens for microscopic observation.

==Controlling the acid's effects==
There are many ways for the printmaker to control the acid's effects.

===Hard grounds===
[[Image:Lesser Ury Junges Mädchen im Café.jpg|thumb|right|''Young Girl in cafe with street-view'', etching by [[Lesser Ury]], 1924]] 
Most typically, the surface of the plate is covered in a hard, [[wax]]y 'ground' that resists acid. The printmaker then scratches through the ground with a sharp point, exposing lines of metal which the mordant acid attacks.[[File:Sugar Lift and Spit Bite Effects.jpg|thumb|left|Example of sugar lift and spit bite effect]]

===Aquatint===
[[Aquatint]] is a variation in which particulate resin is evenly distributed on the plate, then heated to form a screen ground of uniform, but less than perfect, density. After etching, any exposed surface will result in a roughened (i.e., darkened) surface. Areas that are to be light in the final print are protected by varnishing between acid baths. Successive turns of varnishing and placing the plate in acid create areas of tone difficult or impossible to achieve by drawing through a wax ground.

===Sugar lift===
Here designs in a syrupy solution of sugar or [[Camp Coffee]] are painted onto the metal surface prior to it being coated in a liquid etching ground or 'stop out' varnish. When later the plate is placed in hot water the sugar dissolves and lifts off leaving the image. The plate can then be etched.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ghost-ships-nick-richards.jpg|thumb|right|A contemporary example of Etching with spit-bite - 'Ghost Ships' (2012) by [http://www.nick-richards.com/project/ghost-ships/ Nick Richards RCA].]] --&gt;

===Spit bite===
A mixture of nitric acid and [[Gum Arabic]] (or almost never – saliva) which can be dripped, spattered or painted onto a metal surface giving interesting results. A mixture of nitric acid and [[rosin]] can also be used.

==Printing==
[[File:Cylinder press at SCAD-Lacoste in Vaucluse, France.jpg|thumb|right|Cylinder press for printing etchings]] Printing the plate is done by covering the surface with [[printing ink]], then rubbing the ink off the surface with ''[[tarlatan]]'' cloth or newsprint, leaving ink in the roughened areas and lines. Damp paper is placed on the plate, and both are run through a [[printing press]]; the pressure forces the paper into contact with the ink, transferring the image (''c.f.'', [[chine-collé]]). Unfortunately, the pressure also subtly degrades the image in the plate, smoothing the roughened areas and closing the lines; a [[copper]] plate is good for, at most, a few hundred printings of a strongly etched imaged before the degradation is considered too great by the artist. At that point, the artist can manually restore the plate by re-etching it, essentially putting ground back on and retracing their lines; alternatively, plates can be [[electroplating|electro-plated]] before printing with a harder metal to preserve the surface. [[Zinc]] is also used, because as a softer metal, etching times are shorter; however, that softness also leads to faster degradation of the image in the press.

==Faults==
[[File:Foul Bite through Soft Ground on Zinc.jpg|thumb|Example of foul bite in acid etching]]

''Foul-bite'' or "over-biting" is common in etching, and is the effect of minuscule amounts of acid leaking through the ground to create minor pitting and burning on the surface. This incidental roughening may be removed by smoothing and polishing the surface, but artists often leave faux-bite, or deliberately court it by handling the plate roughly, because it is viewed as a desirable mark of the process.

=="Etchings" euphemism== &lt;!-- This is linked from the redirect [[Come up and see my etchings]] --&gt;
The phrase "Want to come up and see my etchings?" is a romantic euphemism by which a person entices someone to come back to their place with an offer to look at something artistic, but with ulterior motives. The phrase is a corruption of some phrases in a novel by [[Horatio Alger, Jr.]] called ''The Erie Train Boy'', which was first published in 1891. Alger was an immensely popular author in the 19th century—especially with young people—and his books were widely quoted. In chapter XXII of the book, a woman writes to her boyfriend, "I have a new collection of etchings that I want to show you. Won't you name an evening when you will call, as I want to be certain to be at home when you really do come." The boyfriend then writes back "I shall no doubt find pleasure in examining the etchings which you hold out as an inducement to call."

This was referenced in a 1929 [[James Thurber]] cartoon in which a man tells a woman in a building lobby: "You wait here and I'll bring the etchings down".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/cartoonists/2011/09/sexual-revolutions.html |title=My Sexual Revolution |author=Robert Mankoff |publisher=Newyorker.com |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also referenced in [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s 1934 novel ''[[The Thin Man]]'', in which the narrator answers his wife asking him about a lady he had wandered off with by saying: "She just wanted to show me some French etchings."&lt;ref&gt;Hammett, Dashiell, ''The Thin Man'', (1934) in Five Complete Novels, New York: Avanel Books, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;592.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was given new popularity in 1937: in a well publicized case, violinist [[David Rubinoff]] was accused of inviting a young woman to his hotel room to view some French etchings, but instead seducing her.

As early as 1895, [[Hjalmar Söderberg]] used the reference in his "[[Decadent movement|decadent]]" [[debut novel|début novel]] ''Delusions'' (swe: ''Förvillelser)'', when he lets the dandy Johannes Hall lure the main character's younger sister Greta into his room under the pretence that they browse through his etchings and engravings (e.g., ''[[Die Sünde]]'' by [[Franz Stuck]]).&lt;ref&gt;Förvillelser, Lind &amp; Co., 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;158—163&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fanny Holland''' (14 September 1847 &amp;ndash; 18 June 1931) was an English singer and comic actress primarily known as the creator of principal [[soprano]] roles in numerous [[German Reed Entertainments]].

==Life and career==
Holland was born in London and trained at the Royal Academy of Music.  She was the daughter of John Holland and his wife Meriel Ann ''nee'' Marshall.&lt;ref name=VoE&gt;{{cite book |title=Visitation of England and Wales |volume=7 |last=Howard |first=Joseph Jackson |author2=Frederick Arthur Crisp |year=1899 |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=btYKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years, she was a popular concert singer in London and the British provinces.  [[Frederic Clay]] engaged her for a part in an [[operetta]] he had written.  It was performed in Canterbury and included a song for Holland that she popularised, "She Wandered Down the Mountain Side."  Soon after that experience, Holland made her London stage debut with the [[German Reed Entertainment]]s at the Gallery of Illustration, in November 1869, as Rose in [[W. S. Gilbert]] and Clay's ''[[Ages Ago]]''.  Holland eventually appeared in scores of German Reed productions.  They included four more of Gilbert's German Reed pieces: ''[[Our Island Home]]'' (1870), ''[[A Sensation Novel]]'' (1871), ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872), and ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (1875).  She also starred in ''[[Dora's Dream]]'', with music by [[Alfred Cellier]] and words by [[Arthur Cecil]] (1873).  Holland also appeared in Gilbert's ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' at the [[Criterion Theatre]] in 1874.

Holland returned to the German Reeds in 1875.  In 1877, she married actor-playwright [[Arthur Law (playwright)|Arthur Law]], with whom she appeared with the German Reeds.  The couple had a son named Hamilton Patrick John Holland Law (born 1879).&lt;ref name=VoE/&gt;  During a two-year period, from 1879 to 1881, Law and Holland performed on tour as "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Arthur Law's Entertainment," but the venture proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=MaW&gt;{{cite book | title = Men and women of the time: a dictionary of contemporaries | last = Plarr | first = Victor | edition = 15th | publisher = G. Routledge | year = 1899 | page = 625 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CPcMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA625}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Holland then remained with the German Reeds at their new theatre, [[St. George's Hall (London)|St. George's Hall]], until 1895, except when she performed with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] at the [[Opera Comique]], as Josephine in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' from December 1879 through February 1880, at the close of the run.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon. [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchivegas.htm HMS Pinafore programme] at c20th Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, showing Holland as Josephine, accessed 11 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At St. George's she played in entertainments too numerous to list.  In 1877 alone, she appeared in ''A Night Surprise'' by her husband, Arthur Law, writing under the pseudonym, "West Cromer"; ''Number 204'' by [[F. C. Burnand]], with music by Mr. German Reed; ''A Happy Bungalow'', by Law, with music by King Hall; ''Once in a Century'' by [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett]], with music by Vivian Bligh; and ''Our New Doll’s House'' by W. Wye, with music by Cotsford Dick.  Her fellow players, besides the German Reeds, and their son Alfred, included Law, Cecil, [[Richard Corney Grain|Corney Grain]], [[Leonora Braham]] and Carlotta Carrington.  Among many other works by her husband, she played in his 1882 play ''Nobody's Fault''.

In 1895, the German Reed partnership dissolved, following the deaths of Corney Grain and Alfred German Reed.  One of Holland's last appearances at St. George's Hall was in an 1895 revival of ''Happy Arcadia'', under the management of [[Rutland Barrington]].  She later appeared in [[Henry Arthur Jones]]'s comedy ''The Manoeuvers of Jane'' at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] in 1898-99.

Holland died in [[Bournemouth]] at the age of 83.

The '''Gibson Girl''' was the personification of [[Physical attractiveness#Female physical attractiveness|the feminine ideal of physical attractiveness]] as portrayed by the pen-and-ink illustrations of artist [[Charles Dana Gibson]] during a 20-year period that spanned the late 19th and early 20th century in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/gibson-girls-america/ "The Gibson Girl’s America: Drawings by Charles Dana Gibson"] at the Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; The artist saw his creation as representing the composite of "thousands of American girls."

==Image==
[[Image:Gibson Girls seaside -cropped- by Charles Dana Gibson.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Gibson Girls at the beach]] The Gibson Girl image that appeared in the 1890s combined elements of older American images of contemporary female beauty, such as the "fragile lady" and the "voluptuous woman". From the "fragile lady" she took the basic slender lines, and a sense of respectability. From the "voluptuous woman" she took a large bust and hips, but was not vulgar or lewd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazur|first=Allan|title=U.S trends in feminine beauty and over-adaptation. |journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=August 1986|volume=22|issue=3|page=287 |doi=10.1080/00224498609551309}}&lt;/ref&gt; as previous images of women with large busts and hips had been depicted. From this combination emerged the Gibson Girl, who was tall and slender, yet with ample bosom, hips and buttocks. She had an exaggerated S-curve torso shape achieved by wearing a [[History of corsets#The Edwardian corset|swan-bill]] [[corset]]. Images of her epitomized the late 19th- and early 20th-century Western preoccupation with youthful features and ephemeral beauty. Her neck was thin and her hair piled high upon her head in the contemporary [[bouffant]], [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]], and [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] ("waterfall of curls") fashions. The statuesque, narrow-waisted ideal feminine figure was portrayed as being at ease and stylish.

She was a member of upper middle class society, always perfectly dressed in the latest fashionable attire appropriate for the place and time of day. The Gibson Girl was also one of the new, more athletic-shaped women, who could be found cycling through Central Park, often exercised and was emancipated to the extent that she could enter the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazur|first=Allan|title=U.S trends in feminine beauty and over-adaptation.|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=August 1986|volume=22|issue=3|page=288|doi=10.1080/00224498609551309}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Gibson Girl's refined beauty, in spirit, she was calm, independent, confident, and sought personal fulfillment. She could be depicted attending college and vying for a good mate, but she would never have participated in the [[Suffragette|suffrage]] movement.

Taking part in the [[Suffragette|suffrage]] movement was something more associated with the [[New Woman]], another cultural image of women that emerged around the same time as the Gibson Girl. As a more popular version of the New Woman, the Gibson Girl both undermined and sanctioned women's desires for progressive sociopolitical change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Martha. H.|title=Beyond the Gibson Girl: Re-imagining the America New Woman 1895-1915|year=2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Woman was the more disconcerting of the two images at the time as she was seen as an example of change and disruption within the old patterns of social order, asking for the right to equal educational and work opportunities as well as progressive reform, sexual freedom and [[suffrage]]. Whilst the Gibson Girl took on many characteristics of the New Woman, she did so without involving herself in politics and thus did not appear to contemporaries at the time to be usurping traditionally masculine roles as the New Woman was deemed to. She therefore managed to stay within the boundaries of feminine roles without too much transgression.

Gibson depicted her as an equal and sometimes teasing companion to men.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/swann/beauties/beauties-overview.html American Beauties]&lt;/ref&gt; She was also sexually dominant, for example, literally examining comical little men under a magnifying glass, or, in a breezy manner, crushing them under her feet. Next to the beauty of a Gibson Girl, men often appeared as simpletons or bumblers; and even men with handsome physiques or great wealth alone could not provide satisfaction to her. Gibson illustrated men so captivated by her looks that they would follow her anywhere, attempting to fulfill any desire, even if it was absurd. One memorable drawing shows dumbstruck men following a Gibson Girl's command to plant a young, leafless tree upside-down, roots in the air, simply because she wanted it that way. Most often, a Gibson Girl appeared single and uncommitted. However, a romance always relieved her boredom. Once married, she was shown deeply frustrated if romantic love had disappeared from her life, but satisfied if socializing with girlfriends or happy when doting on her infant child. In drawings such as these there was no hint at pushing the boundaries of women's roles, instead they often cemented the long-standing beliefs held by many from the old social orders, rarely depicting the Gibson Girl as taking part in any activity that could be seen as out of the ordinary for a woman.

The artist believed that the Gibson Girl represented the beauty of American women:

{{quote|text=I'll tell you how I got what you have called the 'Gibson Girl.' I saw her on the streets, I saw her at the theatres, I saw her in the churches. I saw her everywhere and doing everything. I saw her idling on [[Fifth Avenue]] and at work behind the counters of the stores ... I haven't really created a distinctive type, the nation made the type. What [[Israel Zangwill|Zangwill]] calls the '[[Melting Pot]] of Races' has resulted in a certain [[Culture of the United States|character]]; why should it not also have turned out a certain type of face? ... There isn't any 'Gibson Girl,' but there are many thousands of American girls, and for that let us all thank God.{{r|marshall19101120}}}}

Gibson believed that America's Gibson Girls would become more beautiful:

{{quote|text=They are beyond question the loveliest of all their sex ... In the United States, of course, where natural selection has been going on, as elsewhere, and where, much more than elsewhere, that has been a great variety to choose from. The eventual American woman will be even more beautiful than the woman of to-day. Her claims to that distinction will result from a fine combination of the best points of all those many races [[Demographics of the United States|which have helped to make our population]].&lt;ref name="marshall19101120"&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=Edward|title=The Gibson Girl Analyzed By Her Originator|url=http://sundaymagazine.org/2010/11/the-gibson-girl-analyzed-by-her-originator/|accessdate=2010-11-21|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1910-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Many women posed for Gibson Girl-style illustrations, including Gibson's wife, Irene Langhorne who may have been the original model, and was a sister of [[Nancy Astor, Viscountess Astor|Viscountess Nancy (Langhorne) Astor]]. Other models included [[Evelyn Nesbit]], and Minnie Clark.&lt;ref&gt;| url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/fine_lines |accessdate=2017-10-5 | pages=112 |quote=Best known as the face of the original "Gibson Girl," Clark appeared in Charles Dana Gibson's famous and widely emulated illustrations of fashionable, young, middle-class women, images that set the standard for feminine beauty in that period (see number 53). pages/=115 |quote=It is believed that Minnie Clark (life dates unknown) ... served as the original model for the Gibson Girl.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous Gibson Girl was probably the Belgian-American stage actress, [[Camille Clifford]], whose high coiffure and long, elegant gowns that wrapped around her hourglass figure and tightly corseted [[wasp waist]] defined the style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 10, 1906 |title=Why Do They Call Me A Gibson Girl?

Among the many "Gibson Girl" illustrators were [[Howard Chandler Christy]] whose work celebrating American "beauties" was similar to Gibson's, and [[Harry G. Peter]], who was most famous for his art on [[Wonder Woman]] comics.

In the newly developing art of cinema, although most leading actresses were at the cutting style of the day, the ones who came to embody it best were the [[Biograph girl]]s, [[Florence Lawrence]] and to a more [[ingenue (stock character)|ingénue]] side of it, [[Mary Pickford]]. They personified and catapulted the cult of ''the ideal woman'' for the masses beyond American borders. Camille Clifford, a woman known as the "ideal Gibson Girl", posed for various photographers and produced photographs that exemplified the physical characteristics of the Gibson Girl.

==Popularity==
Some people{{who|date=January 2015}} argue that the Gibson Girl was the first national beauty standard for American women. Gibson's fictional images of her published in newspapers and magazines during the [[Belle Époque]] were extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Mitchell, John Ames |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=November 15, 1894 |title=Bookishness: The Gibson Girl |journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=XXIV |issue=620 |pages=312–313 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bB0AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA312 |accessdate=2009-07-27 |quote=Mr. Gibson has a great responsibility on his shoulders, and if he once fully realizes it, it will keep him awake nights.

Large size books ("table albums," they were called), china plates and saucers, ashtrays, tablecloths, pillow covers, chair covers, souvenir spoons, screens, fans, umbrella stands ... all bore the image of Gibson's creations. There was even a wallpaper for bachelor apartments, with the lovely Gibson faces in endless array. A popular turn-of-the-century hobby, pyrography, saw people burning the Gibson Girl into leather and wood; and the image was traced and stitched into handkerchiefs. There were plays, songs, and even a movie based on his creation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Source appears to be a user-maintained blog with no reference authority|date=January 2015}}

By the outbreak of [[World War I]], changing fashions caused the Gibson Girl to fall out of favor as women favored practical clothing compatible with changing times over the elegant dresses, bustle gowns, [[shirtwaist]]s, and terraced, floor-length skirts favored by the Gibson Girl.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The image was not forgotten, however, with the [[USAAF]] [[World War II]]-era SCR-578 (and the similar post-war AN/CRT-3) [[survival radio#The Gibson Girl|survival radio]] transmitters carried by aircraft on over-water operations being given the nickname "Gibson Girl" because of their "hourglass" shape, which allowed them to be held stationary between the legs while the generator handle was turned.&lt;ref&gt;	Dirk Septer,''Lost Nuke: The Last Flight of Bomber 075, Revised Edition'', Heritage House Publishing Co, 2016 {{ISBN|1772031283}} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Agent '''Helena George&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/msjaimemurray/status/342499307993313280|title=Helena? What's the middle name?|author=[[Jaime Murray]]|publisher=twitter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "H.G." Wells''' is a fictional character on the American television series ''[[Warehouse 13]]'', played by [[Jaime Murray]]. Agent Wells has been a recurring guest-character of the series playing the major antagonist of Season 2 and appearing alongside Agents [[Myka Bering]] and [[Pete Lattimer]]. Portrayed as having a genius-level intellect and a methodical nature, she is an inventor and author and a former agent of Warehouses 12 and 13.

==Character background==
In the season 3 episode "[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep37|Stand]]", it is revealed that Wells joins Warehouse 12 in the year 1889. It is depicted in "Stand" and "[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep21|Vendetta]]" that Helena begins her work as an agent from that time and continues up until sometime after 1899.

As an Agent of Warehouse 12 it is made clear that she dislikes the use of conventional firearms. When she brings the matter to her mentor and boss Chaturanga, he gives her a gun that stuns the victim with electricity. She likely used it as a base model for the Tesla (the primary firearm used by Agents of Warehouse 13) that she created with [[Nikola Tesla]] in 1893.

After the loss of her daughter Christina, who was killed in a robbery while vacationing with cousins in Paris, Helena becomes obsessed with finding a way to turn back time and save her. This leads to the invention of the "[[H.G. Wells]]' Time Machine". Helena's time machine in Warehouse 13 differs from the machine described in the novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'' by H.G. Wells in that the device she presents is not a vehicle. Instead, it transports consciousness to a directed target across time.

After several failed attempts to save her daughter's life Helena eventually realizes she is unable to change events from the past, and after murdering the men who killed her daughter, she continues to behave recklessly until she eventually inadvertently causes the death of a fellow agent. This event shocks her into the realization that she has become a danger, and she chooses to be bronzed to prevent any further damage. Bronzing is a form of punishment the Warehouse utilizes after conventional imprisonment has failed or is not an option. The subject is cast in bronze in a special machine, and thereafter remains conscious, but in a state that resembles cryogenic sleep where the aging process is stopped. She remains bronzed until set free by [[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Leena|Leena]] on the order of [[List of Warehouse 13 characters#James MacPherson|James MacPherson]] in the season finale of season 1.

== Character arc==

Awakened from bronzing in the season 1 finale by Leena, Wells is taken away from the Warehouse by MacPherson. She later kills him during the Season 2 premiere episode "[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep13|Time Will Tell]]". Throughout Season 2 Helena attempts to be reinstated at the Warehouse as an agent and enlists the aid of Myka Bering as an advocate for her cause. She is eventually reinstated in "Vendetta", but in "[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep23|Buried]]" it is clear the ulterior motive for being reinstated is to destroy the world by inducing an [[extinction event]] through use of a stolen artifact. Planning to trigger a massive earthquake with the Minoan Trident in Yellowstone, she later fails to follow through when Myka Bering convinces her to stop by forcing her to have to shoot Myka if she wishes to carry out her plan. She voluntarily gives herself up for arrest following the confrontation and is taken away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thetvwatchtower.com/2010/09/22/review-warehouse-13-reset/|title=Review 'Warehouse 13' – Reset|author=Tiffany Vogt|publisher=The TV Watchtower.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her incarceration in Season 3, Helena has no corporeal body, and is instead a holographic image. Her consciousness is projected by an artifact allowing her to converse while preventing any physical interaction. While in this state she persuades Myka to return to work at the Warehouse in the premiere "[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep26|The New Guy]]", and is not seen again until she is brought in for consultation on a case she unsuccessfully worked in 1893 as shown in "[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep30|3...2...1...]]."

In the finale episodes of Season 3, "[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep36|Emily Lake]]" and "Stand", the main antagonist for the season, [[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Walter Sykes|Walter Sykes]], pursues finding Helena's physical form as well as her consciousness in order to reconstitute them. Myka Bering and Pete Lattimer find Helena's physical body in the personage of Ms. Emily Hannah Lake – a high school literature teacher living in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. They later discover Helena's consciousness was separated from her physical body by using the Janus Coin artifact. They are unable to save her from being abducted by [[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Marcus Diamond|Marcus Diamond]] and their under-cover Warehouse agent [[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Steve Jinks|Steve Jinks]] who deliver her to Sykes. Sykes reintegrates Helena's body and mind before taking her to China where he forces her to help him open a portal directly into Warehouse 13. She complies only to save Myka Bering's life after an unsuccessful attempt to save Tyler Struhl. Shortly afterward, Helena chooses to sacrifice her life in order to save the lives of her fellow agents from an explosion that obliterates the warehouse.

In the Season 4 premiere [[Arthur "Artie" Nielsen|Artie Nielsen]] uses an artifact to turn back time 24 hours, and successfully finds a way to defuse the bomb that would destroy the Warehouse. Since he is successful in saving the Warehouse, Helena's death, her tragic hero's redemptive act of self-sacrifice, never happened. Artie later successfully advocates on Helena's behalf to keep her from being re-incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1667482.php/Warehouse-13-recap-%E2%80%93-Emily-Lake-Stand |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129095040/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/news/article_1667482.php/Warehouse-13-recap-%E2%80%93-Emily-Lake-Stand |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-29 |title='Warehouse 13' recap – 'Emily Lake'/'Stand' |author=Wayne Hall |publisher=monstersandcritics.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/24/warehouse-13-a-new-hope-review|title=Warehouse 13: "A New Hope" Review|author=Ramsey Isler|publisher=IGN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helena becomes aware of this alternate timeline in "[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep46|Second Chance]]", after she deduces, in the previous episode ("[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep45|Endless Wonder]]"), that Artie used a time travel artifact to save the Warehouse. Also in this episode, [[List of Warehouse 13 characters#Mrs. Irene Frederic|Mrs. Frederic]] tells her to take the astrolabe and hide it where no one can find it.

In the season 4 episode, "Instinct", Helena is shown working as a forensic scientist for the Wisconsin police. She is also living, and romantically involved, with a man named Nate. Nate has an eight-year-old daughter named Adelaide, to whom Helena has taught Kenpo as well as deductive reasoning. When Myka confronts Helena and states her belief that Helena is running away from who she is by holding onto the surrogate daughter she has found in Adelaide, Helena becomes incensed and asks her to leave.  Later, however, the two women reaffirm their bond and part ways on good terms.

==Skills and abilities==
Helena's character was created within the series to have a remarkably tuned quality of [[deductive reasoning]], extremely calm focus, and extraordinary attention to detail. Within the ''Warehouse 13'' universe this allows her character to be portrayed as a science-fiction type of [[Sherlock Holmes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airlockalpha.com/node/8560|title=Not So Fast On 'Warehouse 13' Spinoff, Syfy|author=Michael Hinman|publisher=AirlockAlpha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The Helena character is given an expertise in the martial art of [[Kenpo]] which she displays in multiple episodes throughout Seasons 2 and 3. She is also shown to be an accomplished author and inventor. Two of her many inventions are the Imperceptor Vest (allows faster-than-humanly-detectable movement) and Cavorite (a fictitious metal with anti-gravity effects, as described in the real H.G. Wells story ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'') - both of which are depicted in "Time Will Tell". Another invention displayed in the show is a grappler gun, shown in episodes "[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep19|For the Team]]", "Buried" and "[[Warehouse 13 (season 3)#ep33|The 40th Floor]]"; and a time machine as seen in "[[Warehouse 13 (season 2)#ep22|Where and When]]", which allows the transference of consciousness to the minds of targeted individuals at a specific date and time. It is implied the character has a fluency in languages as she depicts a fluent grasp of French and a recognition of [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]] upon hearing it spoken per "Buried". In the same episode, Wells says she "considers the study of dead languages to be a hobby".

In the episode "[[Warehouse 13 (season 4)#ep53|Instinct]]", Helena is shown to be employed as a forensic scientist for a police station in Wisconsin.

==Relationships==
Helena had three professional relationships from her days at Warehouse 12, with her partner Agent Wolcott, fellow-agent McShane, and her teacher Caturanga – as depicted in "3...2...1..." and "Stand". Her professional relationships from her dealings at the current Warehouse are depicted throughout Seasons 2, 3, and 4 and are with Artie Nielsen who serves mostly as her chief detractor until the Season 4 premiere, [[Claudia Donovan]] who serves as a mentee, Pete Lattimer a fellow-agent with whom she has some difficulties, and Myka Bering who is her fellow-agent, friend, and a romantic interest of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://io9.com/5864702/warehouse-13s-joanne-kelly-i-would-love-to-see-hg-wells-and-myka-get-together|title=Warehouse 13's Joanne Kelly: "I would love" to see H.G. Wells and Myka get together|author=Charlie Jane Anders|publisher=i09.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic interests==

===Myka Bering===
While never explicitly shown or stated on the show itself, [[Joanne Kelly]] addressed the ''Warehouse 13'' panel discussion's audience at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con to assert "Myka will always love H.G.", and reiterated the romantic attraction between her character and Jaime Murray's in a later interview that same day by saying of the characters "we're in love". In the same interview she clarifies her statement by making the sexual undertones of their love for each other definitive.&lt;ref name="AFTERELLEN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/TV/warehouse-13-star-confirms-the-shows-lesbian-subtext-and-then-some |title=Warehouse 13 star confirms the show's lesbian subtext, and then some |author=Dorothy Snarker |publisher=AfterEllen.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130101190433/http://www.afterellen.com/TV/warehouse-13-star-confirms-the-shows-lesbian-subtext-and-then-some |archivedate=2013-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Nate===
In the season 4 episode, "Instinct", Helena is shown to be part of a new family.  She lives with a man named Nate and Adelaide, his 8-year-old daughter - to whom Helena has taught the arts of deductive reasoning as well as Kenpo.  Helena indicates this new family life is her way of trying to fit into the world again, to find normalcy, away from the Warehouse and the world of the artifacts.

==Helena G. Wells versus the real-life H.G. Wells==
The season 2 episode "Time Will Tell" and season 3 episode "Emily Lake" establish the birth-year, birthplace, and later residence of Helena G. Wells to be the same as her real-world counterpart H.G. Wells who was born in 1866 in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/07/07/warehouse-13-season-premiere-recap-a-steamy-makeout-sesh-with-h-g-wells/|title='Warehouse 13' season premiere recap: A steamy makeout sesh with H.G. Wells|author=Darren Franich|publisher=EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear how much of the biographical information available on the historical H.G. Wells would apply to Helena due to her claim that her brother, Charles, is the person history remembers by her name.

'''iO''', or '''iO Chicago''', (formerly known as "ImprovOlympic") is an improv theater and training center in central [[Chicago]], with a former branch in [[Los Angeles]] called [[iO West]]. The theater teaches and hosts performances of [[improvisational comedy]]. It was founded in 1981 by [[Del Close]] and [[Charna Halpern]]. The theater has many notable alumni, including [[Amy Poehler]] and [[Stephen Colbert]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-io-theater-new-home-20140801-column.html|title=Inside the new iO,where Fey, Poehler got their start|first=Chicago|last=Tribune|website=Chicagotribune.com|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
iO concentrates on "long-form" improvisational structures, in contrast to the "short-form" or "improv game" format of [[Theatresports]], [[ComedySportz]] or the television show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (disambiguation)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' The iO's signature piece is the "[[Harold (improvisation)|Harold]]", and the theater features other forms of improvisation, as well as sketch comedy and stand-up comedy.{{citation needed|reason=No citation|date=June 2016}}

The building has four performance spaces:
* The Del Close Theater - This is the second-largest of iO's theaters, and is located on the ground floor of the building. It hosts some of iO's premiere shows, such as ''The Armando Diaz Theatrical Experience and Hootenanny'', ''Whirled News Tonight'', ''The Improvised Shakespeare Company'', and ''The Deltones''.
* The Chris Farley Cabaret - One of two cabaret-style theaters in the building, this hosts many different types of performances, mostly improvised and mostly non-Harold.
* The Jason Chin Harold Cabaret - Named after a revered teacher at iO who died on January 8, 2015, this theater predominantly features performances of the Harold from house teams at the theater which specialize in that form.
* The Mission Theater - This is adjacent to the main iO complex, but is separately run and managed by [[T. J. Jagodowski]] and [[David Pasquesi]], or "TJ and Dave".{{cn|date=October 2018}}

iO has one other active franchise: [[I.O. West|iO West]], located in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

==History==

The ImprovOlympic was created in 1981, putting competing teams of comedic improvisers on stage in front of audiences. This was the brainchild of [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]], who used early [[Viola Spolin]] theater games as a way for teams to compete. The first ImprovOlympic classes and shows took place at [[The Players Workshop]] in [[Chicago]], where [[Charna Halpern]] was an improv student. Charna Halpern became David Shepherd's assistant, and eventually the producer of the competitions. There were also competitions at a network of local bars and clubs. In 1982, The ImprovOlympic moved from [[The Players Workshop]] to its own space. Teams began to form out of every major [[improv troupe]] in Chicago. Shows began shifting to a long-form approach by 1983. 

In 1995, The ImprovOlympic moved to its location on Clark St. in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.ioimprov.com/about/about |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410182406/http://chicago.ioimprov.com/about/about |archivedate=April 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional theater, iO West was opened by Paul Vaillancourt in Los Angeles, California in 1997. Today it is managed by Colleen Doyle and Zach Huddleston. In 2001, The [[International Olympic Committee]] legally threatened the theater over its use of the name "ImprovOlympic" and the name was subsequently changed to "iO." On September 2, 2005, iO held its 25th anniversary show at the [[Chicago Theater]] in downtown Chicago.  The wireless microphones went dead shortly into the show, but the improvisers rallied and played using wired mics for the rest of the performance. Celebrity veterans of the iO program who returned to play included Mike Myers, Tim Meadows, Amy Poehler, and Ike Barinholtz. The opening to the Harold piece performed was conducted by the most veteran iO house team "The Reckoning." 

In August 2014, after almost 20 years in Chicago's Wrigleyville neighborhood, Charna Halpern bought a building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and moved the iO Theater to its new home at 1501 N. Kingsbury St.

The '''International Comparative Literature Association''' - '''ICLA''') (French '''Association Internationale de Littérature Comparée''' - '''AILC'''), founded in 1954, is an international organization for international research in the field of [[comparative literature]]. The Association seeks to foster the study of literature undertaken from an international point of view and attempts to realize this objective through international cooperation. It organizes international congresses, occurring every three years.

== History ==
The AILC/ICLA was founded in [[Oxford|Oxford, UK]] in 1954 in connection with the 6th Congress of the [[The International Federation for Modern Languages and Literatures (FILLM)|International Federation for Modern Languages and Literatures]] (FILLM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillespie|first=Gerard|date=2003|title=The International Comparative Literatures Association (AILC/ICLA): Association Internationale de Littérature Comparéé|journal=Diogenes|volume=50|issue=2|page=117|doi=10.1177/039219210305000211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balakian Prize ==
In 2004, the Association, in collaboration with the [[Anna Balakian]] Foundation, established the '''Anna Balakian Prize'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ailc-icla.org/site/?page_id=1335&lt;/ref&gt; to promote scholarly research by younger comparatists and to honor the memory of Professor Anna Balakian, a great comparatist. The first prize winner was announced in 2007 in the XVIIIth Congress of the ICLA AILC in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Past recipients of the Balakian Prize are:

'''Kilwa Kisiwani''' is a community on an [[Indian Ocean]] [[island]] off the southern coast of present-day [[Tanzania]] in eastern Africa. Historically, it was the center of the [[Kilwa Sultanate]], a medieval sultanate whose authority at its height in the 13th-15th centuries CE stretched the entire length of the [[Swahili Coast]]. Kilwa Kisiwani has been designated by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] along with the nearby stonetown [[Songo Mnara]].

== History and archaeology ==
Kilwa Kisiwani is an archaeological [[city-state]] site located along the Swahili Coast on the Kilwa [[archipelago]]. It was occupied from at least the 8th century CE and became one of the most powerful settlements along the coast. The seasonal wind reversals would affect trade circulations.&lt;ref name=Elkiss1973&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elkiss|first1=Terry A.|title=Kilwa Kisiwani: The Rise of an East African City-State|journal=African Studies Review|date=1973|volume=16|issue=1|pages=119–130|doi=10.2307/523737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade connections with the Arabian Peninsula as well as India and China influenced the growth and development of Kilwa, and, though there are Islamic words and customs that have been adapted to the culture, the origins are African.&lt;ref name=Pollard2008 /&gt; Many of the Swahili settlements showed complex layouts that reflected social relations between groups, however at Kilwa, there are many questions still left unanswered about the town layout. The cemeteries were located on the edge of the town, which was common for the region, and large, open spaces were likely used for social gatherings.&lt;ref name=FWJ2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fleisher|first1=Jeffery|last2=Wynne-Jones|first2=Stephanie|title=Finding Meaning in Ancient Swahili Spatial Practices|journal=Afr Archaeol Rev|date=2012|volume=29|pages=171–207|doi=10.1007/s10437-012-9121-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important city for trade, around the 13th century there were increased fortifications and a greater flow of goods. For these to take place, there would need to be a form of political administration overseeing the city, controlling the movement of goods. Much of the trade networks were with the [[Arabian peninsula]]. Kilwa Kisiwani reached its highest point in wealth and commerce between 13th and 15th centuries CE.&lt;ref name="Pollard2008"/&gt;

Evidence of growth in wealth can be seen with the appearance of stone buildings around the 13th century CE, before which all of the buildings were [[wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]]. The socio-economic status of the individuals residing there could be clearly seen in the type of structure they were living in. Among Kilwa's exports were spices, tortoiseshell, coconut oil, ivory, and aromatic gums, as well as gold.&lt;ref name=Elkiss1973 /&gt; At around this time, Kilwa had seized control over the trade of gold at [[Sofala]]. The wealthy also possessed more commercial goods than the individuals who were of the lower class did. Luxury cloths and foreign ceramics were among a few of the items they would have owned, though some items, such as luxury clothes, do not preserve in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name=Pollard2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Edward John|title=THe maritime landscape of Kilwa Kisiwani and its region, Tanzania, 11th to 15th century CE|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|date=2008|volume=27|pages=265–280|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2008.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; For approximately 500 years, Kilwa was minting coins. This lasted from about A.D 1100-1600 and the coins have been found across the region, including [[Great Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name=CHAMI98&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chami|first1=Felix A.|title=A Review of Swahili Archaeology|journal=African Archaeological Review|date=1998|volume=15|issue=3|pages=199–218|doi=10.1023/a:1021612012892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine resources were abundant and utilized for food. Food sources would also come from the surrounding land. But because of the huge impact the sea, with all of the resources and trade opportunities, had on Kilwa, the archaeological investigation of the harbors and ports is considered to be quite important. The soil at Kilwa that was found over the limestone was of poor quality, so the land food sources came from the areas of higher ground. However, the soil in the Kilwa region would have been suitable for growing cotton, which could be used in sail manufacturer. 12th century [[spindle whorl]]s have been found, indicating that cotton was used and processed in this area.&lt;ref name="Pollard2008"/&gt;

===Ceramics===
At first, most of the focus was placed on the archaeology of Kilwa's ports and harbors, however, more and more emphasis is being placed on Kilwa's hinterlands. 
Ceramic artifacts are plentiful at the site and can be divided into two groups: regional and coastal. All of the ceramics with regional distribution were locally produced, but the area of distribution is limited. These unglazed ceramics were referred to as Kitchen Wares, though their uses were not necessarily just as cooking vessels.  All of the varieties of locally produced pottery found in the region were also uncovered at the site of Kilwa itself.&lt;ref name=WJ2005&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wynne-Jones|first1=Stephanie|title=Creating urban communities at Kilwa Kisiwani, Tanzania, CE 800-1300|journal=Antiquity|date=2007|volume=81|pages=368–380|doi=10.1017/s0003598x00095247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Kitchen Wares could be seen throughout the region, there were ceramics that were mostly seen within Kilwa itself. These included modeled forms and red-burnished wares. The distribution pattern of the red-burnished wares was coastal. Other ceramic types that were seemingly restricted to town were the imported ceramic vessels from the Arabian peninsula and China. Imported ceramic materials are not found in rural areas. They were used as a sign of social status by the elite. They were kept in wall niches made just for the purpose of displaying them. These imported ceramics played important symbolic roles along the Swahili Coast. The symbolism attached to the imported ceramics was so strong that it carried on to modern Swahili culture. The lack of imported goods in the hinterlands indicates that, while Kilwa was undergoing a process of urbanization, the local communities did not undergo a dramatic transformation.&lt;ref name=WJ2005 /&gt;

===Preservation===
In 2004, Kilwa Kisiwani was inscribed on UNESCO's [[List of World Heritage in Danger]]. There is a serious rapid deterioration of the archaeological and monumental heritage of these two islands due to various agents like erosion and vegetation. The eastern section of the Palace of Husuni Kubwa, for example, is progressively disappearing. The damage to the soil caused by rainwater wash is accentuating the risks of the collapse of the remaining structures on the edge of the cliff. The vegetation that proliferates on the cliff has limited the progression of the rain-wash effect but causes the break-up of the masonry structures. The [[World Monuments Fund]] included Kilwa on its 2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites, and since 2008 has been supporting conservation work on various buildings.

==Notable features==

===Great Mosque===
The [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]] is a [[Jama Masjid|congregational]] [[mosque]] on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani, in [[Tanzania]]. It was likely founded in the tenth century, but the two major stages of construction date to the eleventh or twelfth and thirteenth century, respectively. It is one of the earliest surviving mosques on the Swahili Coast.

The smaller northern prayer hall dates to the first phase of construction. It contained a total of 16 bays supported by nine pillars, which were originally carved from [[coral]] but later replaced by timber. The structure was entirely roofed, and was perhaps one of the first mosques in the area to have been built without a courtyard.

In the early fourteenth century, [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]], who also built the nearby [[Palace of Husuni Kubwa]], added a southern extension which included a great dome. This dome was described by [[Ibn Battuta]] after he visited Kilwa in 1331.

===Palace of Husuni Kubwa===
[[File:Kilwa Kisiwani Fort.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The fort on the banks of Kilwa Kisiwani.]]
Husuni Kubwa (the "Great Fort"), situated outside the town, was an early 14th-century sultan's palace and emporium.  Other defining features include [[causeway]]s and platforms at the entrance of the Harbour made from blocks of reef and coral nearly a meter high. These act as breakwaters, allowing mangroves to grow which is one of the ways the breakwater can be spotted from a distance. Some parts of the causeway are made from the bedrock, but usually the bedrock was used as a base. Coral stone was used to build up the causeways with sand and lime being used to cement the cobbles together. Some of the stones were left loose.&lt;ref name=Pollard2008intertidal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Edward|title=Inter-Tidal Causeways and Platforms of the 13th- to 16th-Century City-States of Kilwa Kisiwani, Tanzania|journal=The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=2008|volume=1|issue=37|pages=98–114|doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.2007.00167.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palace of Husuni Kubwa is a ruined structure on the island of Kilwa Kisiwani, in [[Tanzania]]. The majority of the palace was erected in the 14th century by [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]], who also built an extension to the nearby [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]], although portions may date back to the 13th century. The palace was inhabited only for a brief period of time, and abandoned before its completion.

The structure was built out of [[coral]] stone on a high bluff overlooking the [[Indian Ocean]]. It consists of three major elements: a south court, used primarily for commerce; a residential complex including over one hundred individual rooms; and a wide stairway leading down a mosque that was situated on the beach. Other notable features include pavilion, which likely served as a reception hall, and an octagonal swimming pool. All of Husuni Kubwa spans across approximately two acres. The coral rag was set in limestone mortar and cut stone was used for decorative pieces, door jams, and vaults. The rooms were about 3 meters tall. The roof was made from cut limestone blocks laid across cut timbers and the floors were white plaster. The main entrance to Husuni Kubwa is from the shore. Most of the imported glazed pottery recovered at the site was Chinese celadon, though there were a few Ying Ch'ing stoneware sherds present. A Yuan dynasty flask dated to about C.E. 1300. Neither the Kilwa Chronicle nor any Portuguese accounts describe a building comparable to Husuni Kubwa.&lt;ref name=Chittick63&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chittick|first1=Neville|title=Kilwa and the Arab Settlement of the East African Coast|journal=The Journal of African History|date=1963|volume=4|issue=2|pages=179–190|doi=10.1017/s0021853700004011|jstor=179533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Husuni Ndogo===
Husuni Ndogo ("Little Fort") is built from coral rubble and limestone mortar. The rectangular enclosure wall surrounds the complex and at each corner stands a tower. The foundations extend two meters below ground level. It appears to have been built as a fort, but the exact purposes and uses are somewhat unknown. There is some evidence that it, for at least a time, was used as a mosque. Architecturally, it appears to be different from other buildings along the coast, resembling buildings constructed under the Caliphs of the Umayyad at around C.E. 661-750. However, whether or not the structure is related or even dates to the Arabic buildings remains uncertain, though it seems unlikely.&lt;ref name=Chittick63 /&gt;

[[File:City of Kilwa, 1572.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1572 depiction of the city of Kilwa from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''Civitates orbis terrarum''.]]
A document written around CE 1200 called ''al-Maqama al Kilwiyya'', discovered in [[Oman]], gives details of a mission to reconvert Kilwa to [[Ibadism]], as it had recently been affected by the [[Ghurabiyya Shia]] doctrine from southern Iraq.

According to local oral tradition, in the 11th century the island of Kilwa Kisiwani was sold to Ali bin Hasan, son of the "King" of [[Shiraz]], in Persia. Another tradition relates that his mother was [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] (Habesha). Ali bin Al-Hasan is credited with founding the island city and with marrying the daughter of the local king. Though he was credited with the founding, he had arrived at an already inhabited area. He did, however, come to power and is credited with fortifying the city and increasing trade.&lt;ref name=Elkiss1973 /&gt; Tradition also relates that it was the child of this union who founded the Kilwa Sultanate. Archaeological and [[documentary research]] has revealed that over the next few centuries, Kilwa grew to be a substantial city and the leading commercial [[entrepôt]] on the southern half of the [[Swahili Coast]] (roughly from the present Tanzanian-Kenya border southward to the mouth of the [[Zambezi]] River), trading extensively with states of the Southeast African hinterland as far as Zimbabwe. Trade was mainly in gold, iron, ivory and other animal products of the interior for beads, textiles, jewelry, porcelain and spices from Asia.

By the 12th century, under the rule of the Abu'-Mawahib dynasty, Kilwa had become the most powerful city on the Swahili Coast. At the zenith of its power in the 15th century, the Kilwa Sultanate claimed authority over the city-states of [[Malindi]], Mvita (Mombasa), [[Pemba Island]], [[Zanzibar]], [[Mafia Island]], [[Grande Comore|Comoro]], [[Sofala]] and the trading posts across the channel on [[Madagascar]].

[[Ibn Battuta]] recorded his visit to the city around 1331, and commented favorably on the generosity, humility, and religion of its ruler, [[Sultan al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman]]. Ibn Battuta also describes how the sultan would go into the interior and raid the people taking slaves and other forms of wealth. He was also particularly impressed by the planning of the city and believed that it was the reason for Kilwa's success along the coast.&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunn|first1=Ross E.|title=The adventures of Ibn Battuta, a Muslim traveler of the fourteenth century|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520243854|edition=Rev. ed. with a new pref.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this period date the construction of the [[Palace of Husuni Kubwa]] and a significant extension to the [[Great Mosque of Kilwa]], which was made of [[coral]] stones—the largest mosque of its kind. Kilwa was an important and also wealthy city for the trade of gold, because of this some of the people who lived in Kilwa had a higher standard of living, but many others were also poor. The wealthy enjoyed indoor plumbing in their stone homes and the poor lived in mud huts with thatched roofs.&lt;ref&gt;The Travels of Ibn Battuta&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 16th century, [[Vasco da Gama]] extorted tribute from the wealthy Islamic state. In 1505 another Portuguese force commanded by D. [[Francisco de Almeida]] took control of the island after besieging it. It remained in Portuguese hands until 1512, when an Arab mercenary captured Kilwa after the Portuguese abandoned their outpost. The city regained some of its earlier prosperity, but in 1784 was conquered by the [[Oman]]i rulers of [[Zanzibar]]. After the Omani conquest, the [[France|French]] built and manned a fort at the northern tip of the island, but the city itself was abandoned in the 1840s. It was later part of the colony of [[German East Africa]] from 1886 to 1918.

==Tourism==
The town is located within the [[Kilwa District]] of the [[Lindi Region]].

It is possible to visit the island of Kilwa Kisiwani and most people base themselves in Kilwa Masoko. The town Kilwa Masoko can be reached by bus from Dar es Salaam (leaving Mbagala bus stop), and is served by [[Coastal Aviation]]. There are numerous basic guesthouses and a handful of tourist hotels, mostly spread along Jimbiza beach and the beautiful and highly regarded Masoko Pwani.

A permit is needed to visit the ruins of Kisiwani itself, and can be easily obtained from the local government building on the main road in Kilwa Masoko. Once the permit has been obtained it is easy to arrange [[dhow]] transport over the narrow channel to Kisiwani.

This soundtrack contains background music and a few theme songs from the first Area of the original ''EXE'' series. Although the soundtrack's title implies a second Sound Navigation may have been released, one was never announced, possibly due to poor sales.

This album contains every opening and closing theme song from ''EXE'' through ''Beast'' as well as two bonus songs available in the first print of the album (indicated by the asterisk beside the track listing). However, most of the songs are in their broadcast ''TV-Sized'' lengths, presumably because full-length versions were never recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonymusicshop.jp/detail.asp?goods=CPCA000010183|title=Sony Music Shop Product Listing|accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mediology''' (French: ''médiologie''), broadly indicates a wide-ranging method for the analysis of [[cultural transmission]] in society and across societies, a method which challenges the conventional idea that 'technology is not culture'. The mediological method pays specific attention to the role of organisations and technical innovations, and the ways in which these can ensure the potency of cultural transmission - and thus the transformation of ideas into a civilisational worldview capable of sustained action.

==Overview==
The term was first coined and introduced in French as "médiologie" by the French intellectual [[Régis Debray]] in the "Teachers, Writers, Celebrities" section of his book ''Le pouvoir intellectuel en France'', (Editions Ramsay, 1979). The English form of the term became more widely known and respected in the English-speaking world with the publication of the key text on mediology in English, Debray's ''Transmitting Culture'' (University of Columbia Press, 2004). Mediology was taught for the first time in the Sorbonne (Paris) in 2007.

The practice of mediology is not a science, and thus is able to range across academic disciplines. The main areas involved are those of longitudinal history (the history of technologies, the history of the book, the histories and theories of aesthetics) and also research in communications and information theory.

Mediology is not a narrow specialist area of contemporary academic knowledge (as [[media sociology]] is), nor does it aspire to be a precise science of signs (as [[semiotics]] does). It differs from the models put forward by [[communication studies]], in that its focus is not isolated individuals and a fleeting few moments of communication. Instead mediologists study the cultural transmission of [[religion]]s, ideologies, the arts and political ideas in society, and across societies, over a time period that is usually to be measured in months, decades or millennia. Debray argues that mediology "would like to bring to light the function of [[Media (communication)|medium]] in all its forms, over a long time span - since the birth of writing. And without becoming obsessed by today's media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mediology must thus closely examine the methods used for the memorising, transmission, and displacement of cultural knowledge in any [[milieu]]. But it must balance its understanding of these with an equally close study of our individual modes of belief, thoughts, and competing social organisations. Mediology must further understand that such transmission is not simply happening within a lofty [[linguistic]] or textual discourse, but that transmission takes an equally valid concrete form in which "material technologies and symbolic forms"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/1999/08/DEBRAY/12314|title=Qu'est-ce que la médiologie ?, par Régis Debray (Le Monde diplomatique, août 1999)|publisher=Monde-diplomatique.fr|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; combine to produce things such as [[rituals]], [[architecture]], [[flags]], special sites, customs, [[typefaces]] and [[book binding]]s, smells and sounds, [[body language|bodily gestures and postures]], all of which have a potent anchoring role in cultural transmission among ordinary people.

Debray further points to the need to consider the role in transmission of all manner of non-media technical-cultural inventions, especially those of new forms of transportation. He gives the historical example of the [[bicycle]], which he suggests was historically associated with: the rise of a democratic rational individualism; a new role for women in advanced societies; and the new kinetic ideas expressed in early [[modernist]] art and cinema.

A mediologist might thus make an examination "within a system" (e.g. of systems of book production, of authors and publishers), or of "the interaction between systems" (e.g. how [[painting]] and [[early photography]] influenced each other), or even of "the interactions across systems" (e.g. the ways in which symbolic transmission of systematic knowledge is brought to intersect with the material history of actual transportation - such as desert trading routes and ancient religion, [[telegraph]] and railroad, the radio and airplanes, television and satellites, mobile phones and cars).

Debray is generally critical of some of the ideas of [[Marshall McLuhan]] (whom he sees as being overly [[Technological determinism|technologically determinist]]), and of the French [[sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. He also tries to step beyond [[Antonio Gramsci]], in that he suggests that an ideology cannot be comprehended in ideological terms alone.

==Criticisms==
Criticisms of mediology in English so far have been found in two short book reviews and one article.  The first, by the screenwriter [[Yvette Biro|Yvette Bíró]] (''Wide Angle'' magazine, Vol.18, No.1, January 1996), was a four-page book review of Debray's ''Vie et Mort de l'Image'', in which she claimed to have discerned "traces of a strong, vulgar [[Marxist]] school of thought".

The second review, by [[Pramod Nayor]] of the University of Hyderabad (''Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory'', Vol.8, No.1, Winter 2006) was a review of the English translation of ''Transmitting Culture'' (2004).  In concluding the review Nayor notes the similarities of some aspects and directions of mediology to [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School cultural studies]] ranging from "[[Raymond Williams]] through [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]". Nayor also notes that recent philosophers and historians of science - he cites [[Bruno Latour]], [[Eugene Thacker]] and [[Dwight Atkinson]] - have also examined science in relation to "intersecting cultural, ethnic, economic and iconographic 'bases' of the transmission of culture"

An article by Steven Maris in ''Fibreculture'' No.12 [http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue12/issue12_maras.html] similarly suggests that Debray is too firmly embedded in "the French academic scene" and that thus "Debray's explicit engagement with other national scholarly traditions of media, communications and cultural studies in the works mentioned above is minimal". Maris also notes that mediology "predates much of the [current academic] interest in networked cultures and new media".

Physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] have criticized Debray's work for using [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] as a metaphor without understanding its basic ideas, in their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]''. Debray engaged in dialogue with Bricmont in a 2003 book titled "À l'ombre des lumières : Débat entre un philosophe et un scientifique", which so far has not been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main;jsessionid=DCNAOEIEBKEB?ISUM_ID=center&amp;ISUM_SCR=nwExternalServiceScr&amp;ISUM_CIPH=T9aJnOHAgwQV8T2hIQ5D3Du3v4I5zbXVbG3CxvkJy7s_&amp;ISUM_URL=rtE--JVQ7nRU10QjZURxmHAxjLLIW3DXPzmc29-XDq1dc8FTO2YT0563J3xcF8aK |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816160928/http://www.alencon.fr/alencon/Main |archivedate=August 16, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such criticisms, the six-volume ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' (2004) wrote of Debray that "His achievement is to have synthesized these earlier arguments into a practice with a powerful political project ahead of it." (Vol.4, page 1394).

The '''multiple lining tool''' is a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] chisel used in [[engraving]] with multiple cutting blades for making parallel lines to create a [[hatching]] effect.

The multiple lining tool is also called the '''multiple tool''', '''lining tool''',{{sfn|Chamberlain|1972|p=117}} '''multiliner''',{{sfn|Banister|1969|p=80}} '''liner''', '''shooter''',{{sfn|Kohlus|1926|p=116}} '''multiple graver''', '''comb''', and '''half-tone comb'''.{{sfn|Wijnekus|Wijnekus|2013|p=359}}

==Description==

The multiple lining tool allows the engraver to create [[hatching|hatched]] shading effects{{sfn|Banister|1969|p=80}} by engraving multiple parallel lines at the same time.{{sfn|Kohlus|1926|p=116}}  It achieves this by having two or more cutting blades,{{sfn|Banister|1969|p=80}} which are available in different grades or sizes,{{sfn|Chamberlain|1972|p=117}} such as the density of lines.  The resulting hatching has a mechanical look.{{sfn|Banister|1969|p=80}}

The '''National Book Foundation''' (NBF) is an American [[nonprofit organization]] established "to raise the cultural appreciation of great writing in America". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/magazine/lisa-lucas-wants-to-make-reading-fun-again.html|title=Lisa Lucas Wants to Make Reading Fun Again|author=|date=7 September 2016|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established 1989 by National Book Awards, Inc.,&lt;ref name=nyt1989&gt;Edwin McDowell. "Book Notes: 'The Joy Luck Club' is to be in paperback&amp;nbsp;... The National Book Awards' new foundation". ''The New York Times'', July 5, 1989, page C19.&lt;/ref&gt;
the foundation is the administrator and sponsor of the [[National Book Award]]s, a changing set of [[literary awards]] inaugurated 1936 and continuous from 1950. It also organizes and sponsors public and educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/features/la-ca-jc-lisa-lucas-20160509-snap-story.html|title=Lisa Lucas, head of the National Book Foundation, wants you to love reading|first=Carolyn|last=Kellogg|date=|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Book Foundation's Board of Directors comprises representatives of American literary institutions and the book industry. For example, in 2009 the Board included the President of the [[New York Public Library]], the Chief Merchandising Officer of [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], the President/Publisher of [[Grove/Atlantic, Inc.]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/70585-national-book-foundation-names-two-new-board-members.html|title=National Book Foundation Names Two New Board Members|author=|date=|website=publishersweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Lisa Lucas became the Foundation's third Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/lisa-lucas-named-executive-director-of-national-book-foundation/?_r=0|title=Lisa Lucas Named Executive Director of National Book Foundation|last=Williams|first=John|website=ArtsBeat|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Book Foundation states the mission "to celebrate the best of American literature, to expand its audience, and to enhance the cultural value of great writing in America."

==Awards==
The original task of the National Book Foundation was to award the National Book Award. The Award was given without the foundation from 1950 until it was replaced with The American Book Awards in 1980, with 16 different categories.  In 1987, the National Book Award was reestablished. The award split into 4 categories in 1996: Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, and Young People's Literature. The winner in each category is decided by an independent panel of writers, librarians, booksellers, and critics.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Neary. [https://www.npr.org/2013/09/16/223132417/national-book-awards-look-to-raise-profile-and-its-not-the-first-time "National Book Awards Look to Raise Profile"]. ''NPR books''. September 16, 2013. [[National Public Radio]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to four National Book Awards to authors for particular books, the Foundation presents two lifetime achievement awards: the [[National Book Award#Medal for Distinguished Contribution (lifetime)|Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters]] and the [[National Book Award#Literarian Award for Outstanding Service (lifetime)|Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://michaelcavacini.com/2015/11/19/james-patterson-honored-at-national-book-awards/|title=James Patterson Honored At National Book Awards|date=2015-11-19|website=Michael Cavacini|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/44096ee4eb0b419cb1859594e6d3cd5c/robert-caro-receive-honorary-national-book-award-medal|title=Robert Caro to receive honorary National Book Award medal|author=|date=|website=ap.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation annually awards the [[Innovations in Reading Prize]] ($10,000) to "individuals and institutions—or partnerships between the two—that have developed innovative means of creating and sustaining a lifelong love of reading."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferbaker/2016/02/14/national-book-foundation-celebrates-innovators-of-reading/#55bb11a37e30|title=National Book Foundation Celebrates Innovators Of Reading Encouraging Philanthropy For More Literacy|last=Baker|first=Jennifer|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Book Up===
Book Up is an after school program for middle school students to foster a lifelong love of reading. The program is designed in a way meant to show kids how enjoyable reading can be, and to improve their confidence in their reading abilities. Middle School students are chosen as studies have shown that this is the age that students are the most likely to stop reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://electricliterature.com/infographic-national-book-foundations-bookup-helps-foster-a-lifelong-love-of-reading-f2b330bf0842|title=INFOGRAPHIC: National Book Foundation’s BookUp Helps Foster a Lifelong Love of Reading|author=|date=17 March 2015|website=electricliterature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Program is typically run by authors with experience in teaching. Sessions last for at least 24 weeks, over which students share their reading interests and previous experiences with reading. Since BookUp began, the program has given out more than 30,000 free books to students. The program started in 2007 in New York City and has expanded to Hunstville, TX, Detroit, MI, and created BookUp LGBTQ for LGBTQ youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/features/news/01/30/bookup-lgbtq-launches-at-the-hetrick-martin-institute/|title=BookUp LGBTQ Launches at the Hetrick-Martin Institute|date=2016-01-30|website=Lambda Literary|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===5 Under 35===
The 5 Under 35 program was started in 2005 in order to honor 5 young writers, all under the age of 35. The winners are all chosen by previous Finalists of the National Book Award. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-ca-jc-5-under-35-20160908-snap-story.html|title=Meet the National Book Foundation's 5 Under 35|first=Michael|last=Schaub|date=|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2015, the winners were chosen by previous 5 Under 35 honorees. Each award comes with a cash prize of $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarrylee/5-under-35|title=Here Are The 2015 National Book Foundation 5 Under 35 Honorees|website=BuzzFeed|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5 Under 35 Ceremony has been hosted by [[Questlove]], [[Carrie Brownstein]], [[LeVar Burton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/540285/national-book-foundation-reveals-their-5-under-35-honorees|title=The National Book Foundation Reveals Its "5 Under 35" Honorees|date=2015-09-30|website=Flavorwire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

=== Teen Press Conference ===
The Teen Press Conference invites middle and high school students in New York City to interview the five Young People's Literature Finalists the day before the National Book Awards. Students are provided copies of the Finalists' books. In 2015, the Teen Press Conference took place at the [[92nd Street Y]] with host [[Jacqueline Woodson]], a National Book Award Winner, as well as in Miami as part of the Miami Book Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://miamibookfair.com/event/national-book-foundation-presents-the-teen-press-conference/|title=Upcoming Events – National Book Foundation presents the Teen Press Conference – Miami Book Fair|website=miamibookfair.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New York Watercolor Society''', also known as the '''New York Water Color Society''', was a "short-lived" organization founded in 1850 by in part by [[John William Hill]]. It led to the founding of the [[American Watercolor Society]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan M. Marter|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;pg=RA4-PA507|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533579-8|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was an early watercolor organization, following the 1804 establishment of the first Watercolor Society in England called the Society of Painters in Water Colours, the present day renamed [[Royal Watercolour Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adelheid M. Gealt|title=Looking at art: a visitor's guide to museum collections|year=1983|publisher=R.R. Bowker|isbn=978-0-8352-1730-9|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the organization was sometimes confused with the [[New York Watercolor Club]]. For instance [[Childe Hassam]] was said to be the Society's first president (1889),&lt;ref name="Sammarco2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Mitchell Sammarco|title=Dorchester: A Compendium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwiR6OTYjXcC&amp;pg=PA52|date=January 2011|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-60949-217-5|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was the first president of the New York Watercolor Club.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan p. 224"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Niamh O'Sullivan|author2=Aloysius O'Kelly|title=Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5K4W8kWtqnkC&amp;pg=PA224|year=2010|publisher=Field Day Publications|isbn=978-0-946755-42-4|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1752">'''On air on sale''' is a policy in the [[music industry]] where [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded music]] is made available for sale at the same time as it is made available for radio broadcast, instead of several weeks later in order to let marketing "buzz" develop, as was former practice. The aim of the policy is to prevent [[copyright infringement]] by making legal [[music download|digital download]]s available as soon as possible. A relatively new development, it is controversial within the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&amp;storycode=1043929|title=UK Government gets behind on air/on sale|publisher=Music Week|date=January 18, 2011|author=Robert Ashton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/13086221|title=Chipmunk: On Air On Sale 'unfair'|work=[[BBC Newsbeat]]|date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] announced that it will be dropping its on air on sale strategy in the United Kingdom. The strategy was put into practice early this year by both Sony and [[Universal Music|Universal]] in the UK, but has been largely abandoned in favor of "looking at each release on a case-by-case basis," according to a statement from Sony. Singles by Lady Gaga, [[Jessie J]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chipmunk]] were released as part of this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perpetua|first1=Matthew|title=Sony Drops 'On Air On Sale' U.K. Strategy|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/sony-drops-on-air-on-sale-u-k-strategy-20111012|date=October 12, 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Marseus van Schrieck''' (ca. 1613, in [[Nijmegen]] &amp;ndash; buried 22 June 1678, in [[Amsterdam]]) was a painter in the [[Dutch Golden Age]]. He is best known for his paintings of forest [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]].

==Biography==
Marseus van Schrieck spent the years 1652-1657 in [[Rome]] and [[Florence]] with the painters [[Matthias Withoos]] and [[Willem van Aelst]], and there joined the Dutch Guild of Artists. Later he worked at the court of the Grand Duke of Tuscany and traveled throughout England and France, after which he settled in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"/&gt; On 25 April 1664, he married Margarita Gysels (the daughter of Cornelius Gysels, an engraver).&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;{{Citation|last = Caldwell|first = Joan|contribution = Otto Marseus van Schrieck|year = 1995|title = Handbook of the Collection of New Orleans Museum of Art|editor-last = Bullard|editor-first = E. John|pages = 41|place = New Orleans|publisher = New Orleans Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Houbraken]]'s biography of Otto mentions that he joined the [[Bentvueghels]] in Rome and was called the ''snuffelaer'', or "sniffer", because he was always sniffing strange lizards and snakes.{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}  Houbraken quotes Otto's wife, who survived him by two husbands and was still alive when he wrote the book; according to her, Otto kept snakes and lizards in a shed at the back of his house, and also on a piece of land outside the city that was walled in for this purpose.

==Works==
Many of his paintings are dark studies of plants, often with lizards at the base and insects on the leaves and branches. According to the RKD, his followers were [[Willem van Aelst]], [[Anthonie van Borssom]], [[Elias van den Broeck]], J Falk, Carl Wilhelm de Hamilton, Trajan Hughes, [[Nicolaes Lachtropius]], [[Jacob Marrel]], [[Abraham Mignon]], [[Rachel Ruysch]], [[Christiaen Striep]], [[Isac Vromans]], [[Matthias Withoos]], and [[Pieter Withoos]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/52810 Otto Marseus van Schrieck] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable omission in this list is the daughter and sister of the last two mentioned, [[Alida Withoos]], who collaborated with him on creating paintings of the garden of Vijverhof for [[Agnes Block]]'s collection of garden albums.

The '''Pipe rolls''', sometimes called the '''Great rolls''',&lt;ref name=Brown54&gt;Brown ''Governance'' pp. 54–56&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Great Rolls of the Pipe''', are a collection of financial records maintained by the English [[Exchequer]], or Treasury, and its successors. The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833.&lt;ref name=Chrimes62&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they are some of the earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a continuous series like the English.

They were the records of the yearly audits performed by the Exchequer of the accounts and payments presented to the Treasury by the sheriffs and other royal officials; and owed their name to the shape they took, as the various sheets were affixed to each other and then rolled into a tight roll, resembling a pipe, for storage. They record not only payments made to the government, but debts owed to the crown and disbursements made by royal officials. Although they recorded much of the royal income, they did not record all types of income, nor did they record all expenditures, so they are not strictly speaking a budget. The Pipe Roll Society, formed in 1883, has published the Pipe rolls up until 1224.

==Composition==
The Pipe rolls are named after the "pipe" shape formed by the rolled up [[parchment]]s on which the records were originally written.&lt;ref name=Coredon219/&gt; There is no evidence to support the theory that they were named pipes for the fact that they "piped" the money into the Treasury, nor for the claim that they got their name from resembling a wine cask, or [[Butt (volume)|pipe]] of wine.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt; They were occasionally referred to as the roll of the treasury, or the great roll of accounts, and the great roll of the pipe.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt;

The Pipe rolls are the records of the audits of the [[High Sheriff|sheriffs]]' accounts, usually conducted at [[Michaelmas]] by the [[Exchequer]], or English treasury.&lt;ref name=Warren73&gt;Warren ''Governance'' pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; Until the [[Charter Roll|chancery records]] began in the reign of King [[John of England]], they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government.&lt;ref name=Chrimes62/&gt; They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer.&lt;ref name=Chrimes62/&gt; They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered.&lt;ref name=RandS216&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' pp. 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rolls use an [[Accountancy|accounting system]], it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance until the end of the 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each [[shire]].&lt;ref name=Chrimes62/&gt; In their early form, they record all debts owed to the [[The Crown|Crown]], whether from [[Feudalism|feudal]] dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt.&lt;ref name=Warren76&gt;Warren ''Governance'' pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed.&lt;ref name=Bartlett198&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.&lt;ref name=Lyon262&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest surviving Pipe roll, already in a mature form, dates from 1129–30,&lt;ref name=HenryI26/&gt;{{efn|The Pipe Roll of 31 Henry I is "the earliest surviving comprehensive account of royal income in European history" according to [[C. Warren Hollister]]&lt;ref name=HenryI26&gt;Hollister ''Henry I'' p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;}} and the continuous series begins in 1155–56,&lt;ref name=Coredon219&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; and continued for almost seven hundred years.&lt;ref name=Lyon112&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]], the Pipe rolls contributed to the centralisation of financial records by the [[Norman dynasty|Norman kings]] (reigned 1066–1154) of England that was ahead of contemporary Western European monarchies; the French, for instance, did not have an equivalent system of accounting until the 1190s.&lt;ref name=Chibnall&gt;Chibnall ''Anglo-Norman England'' p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The exact form of the records, kept in a roll instead of a book, was also unique to England,&lt;ref name=Memory136&gt;Clanchy ''Memory to Written Record'' p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; although why England kept some of its administrative records in this form is unclear.&lt;ref name=Clanchy141&gt;Clanchy ''Memory to Written Record'' p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; A set of Norman rolls, drafted differently, are extant in a few years for the reigns of Kings [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (reigned 1154–1189) and [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (reigned 1189–1199), who also ruled the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in France.&lt;ref name=Mason139&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason150&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the Norman rolls were started about the same time as the English, but due to lack of survival of the earlier Norman rolls, it is unclear exactly when they did start.&lt;ref name=Lyon220&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; An Irish Exchequer produced Irish Pipe rolls, and much like the English Pipe rolls, the earliest surviving Irish Pipe roll, that of 1212, does not appear to be the first produced.&lt;ref name=Frame87&gt;Frame ''Political Development'' p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Dialogus de Scaccario'' or ''[[Dialogue concerning the Exchequer]]'', written in about 1178, details the workings of the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created.&lt;ref name=Chrimes60/&gt; The ''Dialogue'' was written by [[Richard FitzNeal]], the son of [[Nigel (Bishop of Ely)|Nigel of Ely]], who was [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] for both [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] and Henry II of England.&lt;ref name=Warren73/&gt; According to the ''Dialogue'', the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the [[Clerk of the Pipe]] and later the clerk of the pells.&lt;ref name=Chrimes60&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; FitzNeal wrote his work to explain the inner workings of the Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used.&lt;ref name=Clanchy136&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dialogue'' also states that the Pipe rolls, along with [[Domesday Book]] and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.&lt;ref name=Clanchy151&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The main source of income recorded on the Pipe rolls was the county farm, or income derived from lands held by the king.&lt;ref name=Lyon164&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Occasional sources of revenue, such as from vacant bishoprics or abbeys or other sources, were also recorded.&lt;ref name=Enc266&gt;Loyn (ed.) ''Middle Ages'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The payments were made both in coin, or in objects, such as spurs, lands, spices, or livestock.&lt;ref name=Lyon163&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The only surviving roll from Henry I's reign also records payments of [[danegeld|geld]], a form of land tax dating from [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon times]],&lt;ref name=Warren68&gt;Warren ''Governance'' p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; although after 1161 the Pipe rolls no longer record any payments of geld.&lt;ref name=Warren146&gt;Warren ''Governance'' p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Whether geld was abolished in 1161 or later is a matter of debate among historians.&lt;ref name=Warren146/&gt;}} By 1166, the fines and other monetary income of the [[Assize Court|Assizes]], or royal courts, began to be recorded in the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Warren111&gt;Warren ''Governance'' p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coredon23&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scutage]] payments, made by knights in lieu of military service, were also recorded in the Pipe rolls from the reign of Henry II on.&lt;ref name=Hollister578&gt;Hollister "Significance of Scutage Rates" ''English Historical Review'' p. 578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict252&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary'' p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It is unclear if the recording of scutage in the Pipe rolls was an innovation during Henry II's reign, or if it is just mischance that the lone surviving Pipe roll prior to his reign does not record any scutage payments.&lt;ref name=1066page717&gt;Hollister "1066" ''American Historical Review'' p. 717&lt;/ref&gt; The 1130 Pipe roll does allude to scutage payments, it just does not record any payment made.&lt;ref name=Irony9&gt;Hollister "Irony of English Feudalism" ''Journal of British Studies'' p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although they recorded all income that came through the Exchequer, not all sources of income went through that office, so the Pipe rolls are not a complete record of royal income. They did include both regular income from the royal lands and judicial profits, as well as more occasional income derived from feudal levies, [[Ward (law)|wardships]], and ecclesiastical vacancies.&lt;ref name=Mortimer42&gt;Mortimer ''Angevin England'' p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of income recorded in the rolls was from feudal reliefs, the payment made by an heir when inheriting an estate.&lt;ref name=Bartlett164&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coredon237&gt;Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms'' pp. 237–238&lt;/ref&gt; A major source of income in the roll of 1130 is from the forests, under the [[Royal forest#Forest law|Forest Law]],&lt;ref name=Bartlett170&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; which was the royal law covering the restrictions imposed on non-royals hunting in areas of the country declared [[royal forest]].&lt;ref name=Bartlett239&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 239–240&lt;/ref&gt; However, royal income from taxation that was not annually assessed was not usually recorded in the Pipe rolls, nor were his receipts from lands outside England. Some payments went directly to the king's household, and because they did not pass through the Exchequer, they were not recorded in the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Bartlett159/&gt;

Expenditures were also subject to documentation in the Pipe rolls. Among the recorded expenditures are payments for carts and cart horses,&lt;ref name=Bartlett133&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; wages for royal servants, payments for improvements to royal manors and houses, royal gifts to persons,&lt;ref name=Bartlett171&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 171–174&lt;/ref&gt; hunting expenses,&lt;ref name=Bartlett239/&gt; payments to acquire a governmental office,&lt;ref name=Huscroft159&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; payments to mercenaries,&lt;ref name=Bartlett254&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; and the costs of bags and casks to transport [[Penny (English coin)|silver pennies]] about the kingdom.&lt;ref name=Bartlett373&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about other subjects besides revenues also is contained in the rolls, including the movement of prisoners, which helps to identify which medieval castles were used as prisons.&lt;ref name=Heiser20&gt;Heiser "Castles, Constables and Politics" ''Albion'' p. 20 footnote 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Pipe rolls also allow the identification of the custodians of royal lands and castles.&lt;ref name=Heiser22&gt;Heiser "Castles, Constables and Politics" ''Albion'' p. 22 footnote 22&lt;/ref&gt; The clerks writing the rolls also used them as places to deride officials of the government, such as [[William Longchamp]], who was the object of derision in the 1194 Pipe roll.&lt;ref name=Heiser32&gt;Heiser "Castles, Constables and Politics" ''Albion'' p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain areas did not report their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These included the [[County palatine|palatinate]]s of [[County Durham|Durham]] and [[Cheshire|Chester]].&lt;ref name=Palatinate719&gt;Alexander "New Evidence" ''English Historical Review'' p. 719&lt;/ref&gt; The county of [[Cornwall]] also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, but it was not a palatinate.&lt;ref name=Palatinate724&gt;Alexander "New Evidence" ''English Historical Review'' p. 724 and footnote 2&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll.&lt;ref name=Barratt636&gt;Barratt "English Revenue of Richard I" ''English Historical Review'' p. 636&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous [[Easter]] to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.&lt;ref name=John836/&gt;

==History==
[[File:National Archives 2007 02 03.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]], where the Pipe rolls are now held]]

Although the earliest Pipe roll dates from 1130, the 31st year of King Henry I's reign, it is clear that they were being produced by the Exchequer before then, as the 1130 roll is not an experiment. It shows no hesitancy in its use of accounts, or lack of continuity from previous years.&lt;ref name=Chrimes30&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; An extract from an earlier Pipe roll, from the 25th regnal year of Henry I or 1124, has been found in a 14th-century manuscript now in the [[Cotton Library]] at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=Hagger&gt;Hagger "Pipe Roll for 25 Henry I" ''English Historical Review''&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The extract is very short, but it shows that the Pipe rolls already recorded exemptions from [[danegeld]]. It is currently [[manuscript Tiberius]] E.vi part i.&lt;ref name=Hagger/&gt;}}  Exactly when the Pipe rolls began to be produced is debated amongst historians. Some hold that they date from Henry I's reign, whether early or late in the reign,&lt;ref name=Chrimes30/&gt; but others feel that they were introduced by King [[William I of England|William I]] (reigned 1066–1087).&lt;ref name=Clanchy151/&gt; The precursors of the records probably date to the Anglo-Saxon period, as the historian [[Pauline Stafford]] argues that financial records must have been kept in some form during the reigns of [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] (reigned 1016–1035), [[Ethelred the Unready|Æthelred II]] (reigned 978–1016), and [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar the Peaceable]] (reigned 959–975).&lt;ref name=Stafford149&gt;Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; There is a reference to the king's "rolls" in a [[writ]] from 1110, which purports to be a grant from Henry I to the abbot of [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] of ten [[Shilling (British coin)|shillings]], but the writ may be a forgery, or parts of it may be genuine with some interpolations. As the writ only exists in a copy in a later [[cartulary]], and the Abbey of Westminster is also known to have forged a number of other writs or charters, the writ is not a solid source for royal rolls being kept as early as 1110.&lt;ref name=Clanchy137&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' pp. 137–138&lt;/ref&gt;

After the one surviving roll from Henry I's reign, no further Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from the reign of his successor, King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] (reigned 1135–1154). But by the second year of King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt; It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=RandS257&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' p. 257 footnote 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoshi&gt;Yoshitake "Exchequer in the Reign of Stephen" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 950–959&lt;/ref&gt; Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only a break in the last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).&lt;ref name=Mortimer66&gt;Mortimer ''Angevin England'' pp. 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The 1213 roll does not exist, and the 1215 roll was compiled after John's death and is not contemporary with the actual financial investigation carried out in that year.&lt;ref name=John836&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' p. 836 footnote 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The surviving Pipe roll from 1130 records an income of £24,500.&lt;ref name=Bartlett159&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is dwarfed by the amount recorded on the Pipe roll that was actually owed to the king, which totals £68,850.&lt;ref name=Huscroft102&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The income that they record in the early years of Henry II is much smaller than that of the one surviving year for Henry I. Those early Pipe rolls of Henry I record an income about £10,000 to £15,000. By the end of Henry II's reign, royal income recorded in the Pipe rolls had risen to £20,000. The end of John's reign saw a recorded income of about £30,000, but Henry III's reign recorded only £8,000 in the early years, rising to £16,500 by 1225.&lt;ref name=Mortimer51&gt;Mortimer ''Angevin England'' p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do the rolls from the early years of Henry II's reign show less income reaching the Exchequer than during Henry I's reign, those early rolls were haphazard and not as accurate and detailed as rolls dating from the later part of the reign. Nor are they as carefully produced as either the later rolls or the roll of 1130.&lt;ref name=RandS260&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of information in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system was settled on whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded in a set of ''receipt rolls'' and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Chrimes73&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate ''[[Estreat]] rolls'', and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Chrimes119&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In 1284 the ''[[Statute of Rhuddlan|Statutes of Rhuddlan]]'' were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Chrimes148&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, a large number of unrecoverable debts were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a "d" and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the backlogged debts on the books.&lt;ref name=EdwardI242&gt;Prestwich ''Edward I'' pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet more extraneous details were removed from the Pipe rolls under the ''Cowick Ordinance'' of June 1323,&lt;ref name=Chrimes181&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; along with further ordinances in 1324 and 1326, all of which were done during the time that [[Walter de Stapledon]] held the office of Treasurer.&lt;ref name=Plant59&gt;Prestwich ''Plantagenet England'' p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this reform the rolls had become clogged with debts, and clauses 2 through 8 of the ''Cowick Ordinance'' attempted to return the rolls to an exposition of accounts.&lt;ref name=Buck246&gt;Buck "Reform of the Exchequer" ''English Historical Review'' p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Another attempted reform at this time was the removal of [[customs]] receipts, as well as military accounts, from the rolls.&lt;ref name=Graves473&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'' p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; New offices in the Exchequer were also created, in an attempt to speed up the auditing process and lessen the time it took to prepare the Pipe rolls and other financial records.&lt;ref name=Plant208&gt;Prestwich ''Plantagenet England'' p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; The attempt to remove non-Exchequer accounts did completely remove those types of records from the Pipe rolls, and further reforms in 1368 created a set of foreign rolls, and all extraneous records in the Pipe rolls were transferred to those rolls.&lt;ref name=Graves473/&gt;

In 1462, the exchequer was told to no longer summon for audit any farms or feefarms worth over 40 shillings per year, as these would be supervised by a newly appointed board of receivers or approvers.&lt;ref name=Wolffe2&gt;Wolfee "Management of English Royal Estates" ''English Historical Review'' p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pipe rolls series ended in 1834 when the office that was in charge of their creation, the Pipe Office, was abolished.&lt;ref name=Web&gt;"[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Pi/Pipe_Rolls.html Pipe rolls entry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231225308/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Pi/Pipe_Rolls.html |date=31 December 2009 }}" ''Websters Online Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
They were created by taking the shire, or other governmental districts, accounts and writing them on two strips of parchment, usually about {{convert|14|in|cm|sigfig=2}} wide.&lt;ref name=Lyon112/&gt; The two pieces were then attached end to end to form one long sheet. Then, the various sheets from all the shires were piled together and affixed together at the top, and the resulting document would be rolled into a tight roll resembling a pipe.&lt;ref name=Coredon219/&gt; They were not formed into one long continuous roll, as the [[Patent Rolls]] were, however. The sheets for each county have a heading at the top giving the name of the county the account is for, in Latin. If more than one sheet was required for a county, the county name would be amended on secondary sheets to indicate the order the sheets were in.&lt;ref name=Ramsay&gt;Ramsay "Origin of the Name Pipe Roll" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 329–220&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes they are referred to, in [[Latin]], as ''magnus rotulus pipae''.&lt;ref name=Chrimes50&gt;Chrimes ''Administrative History'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Several sources for the actual idea of making the rolls as rolls have been suggested, including Jews, [[Adelard of Bath]], who was a royal clerk and was familiar with Arabic practices of using rolls, or the royal clerk Thurkil, who studied under a mathematician who may have been from Sicily.&lt;ref name=Clanchy140&gt;Clanchy ''From Memory to Written Record'' p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The rolls were written in Latin until 1733, except for a short time around 1650.&lt;ref name=NatArch&gt;National Archives ''[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/RdLeaflet.asp?sLeafletID=186&amp;j=1 Research Guides: Early Pipe Rolls, 1130–c.&amp;nbsp;1300]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the reign of Henry II, a duplicate copy of the year's Pipe roll was made for the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], and was called the Chancellor's roll. This was created at the same time as the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor.&lt;ref name=Lyon261&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; The Chancellor rolls survive from 1163 to 1832, but are basically duplicates of the corresponding Pipe rolls, except for the occasional addition of a private charter or other material.&lt;ref name=Graves474/&gt;

==Influence on other records==
The example of the royal exchequer's records eventually influenced others to keep similar records. The earliest surviving non-royal Pipe rolls are those of the [[Bishop of Winchester]], which are extant from 1208,&lt;ref name=Clanchy92/&gt; and form a continuous series from that date. They started under [[Peter des Roches]], who was also a royal clerk and administrator.&lt;ref name=Bartlett201&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; They record monies coming in as well as expenses and payments made, in detail, but like the royal records, they do not show profits or losses as a sum total. Most private rolls resembling the Pipe rolls are from monasteries. The household rolls, which closely resemble the Pipe rolls, for [[Eleanor of Leicester|Eleanor of England]], wife of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], survive for part of the year 1265.&lt;ref name=Clanchy92&gt;Clanchy ''Memory to Written Record'' pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies by historians==

A number of historians have studied the surviving Pipe rolls, using them as the basis for study of financial and governmental history, especially of the medieval era.&lt;ref name=Mason148/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason157/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason162/&gt; A study from 1925 compiled the royal income that passed through the Exchequer for each year of Henry II and Richard I, as well as a sample of some years from John's reign, attempting to compare how the royal revenues compared in the various reigns.&lt;ref name=Bartlett175&gt;Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work by [[Nick Barratt]] on the reigns of Richard and John have updated the earlier research.&lt;ref name=Barratt&gt;Barratt "English Revenue of Richard I" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 835–856&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=John&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 835–855&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Carpenter has carried out further studies on the early years of King Henry III's reign.&lt;ref name=Bartlett175/&gt; The Pipe rolls have also been used to identify royal officials, especially those that were involved in local government and were not high ranking.&lt;ref name=Huscroft88&gt;Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; Because they recorded judicial fines, the Pipe rolls also can be used to shed light on how the judicial system in medieval England worked, as well as identifying royal judges.&lt;ref name=Lyon191&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RandS176&gt;Richardson and Sayles ''Governance'' pp. 176–177&lt;/ref&gt; Although they don't provide exact revenue figures, most historians believe they represent a close approximation of revenue, and can be used to gain a general understanding of how much financial resources the English kings had available in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=John836a&gt;Barratt "Revenue of King John" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 836–837&lt;/ref&gt;

The lone surviving Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, has been a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include [[Judith Green (historian)|Judith Green]]'s search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites.&lt;ref name=Mason148&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, as well as on the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign.&lt;ref name=Mason157&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World''  p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[C. Warren Hollister]] used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.&lt;ref name=Mason162&gt;Mason "Administration and Government" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World''  p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pipe rolls from the 13th century onwards are less important for historical study because there are other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=Lyon330&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt; However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are occasionally the sole source for historical facts such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s residence in the parish of [[St Helen's Bishopsgate]], and in [[Southwark]].&lt;ref name=Hales401&gt;Hales "London Residences of Shakespeare" ''Athenaeum'' pp. 401-402&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
[[File:Pipe roll 1174 record type.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Extract from the Pipe roll for [[Regnal years of English monarchs|21]] [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1174–5), as published by the Pipe Roll Society in 1897 using [[record type]].]]

The earliest Pipe rolls were published by the [[Record Commission]] in 1833 (the isolated roll of 1130) and the [[Public Record Office]] in 1844 (the rolls for 1155–58).&lt;ref name=Graves474/&gt; The Commission's edition of the 1130 roll has now been superseded by a new edition (with English translation) published by the Pipe Roll Society in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Green ''Great Roll of the Pipe''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 the Pipe Roll Society (a [[text publication society]]) was founded by the Public Record Office, on the initiative of [[Walford Dakin Selby]] and his colleague James Greenstreet, to establish a systematic publishing programme for the Pipe rolls.&lt;ref name=NatArch/&gt; It published its first volume in 1884, and has now published all the rolls from 1158 to 1224.&lt;ref name="PRS pubs"&gt;Pipe Roll Society "[http://www.piperollsociety.co.uk/page2.htm Pipe Roll Society Publications]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RHS PRS"&gt;{{cite web |author=Royal Historical Society |publisher=Royal Historical Society |url=http://5hm1h4aktue2uejbs1hsqt31.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/piperollsociety.pdf |title=Pipe Roll Society Publications |accessdate=11 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the continuous series, it has also published the roll for 1230. The rolls for 1241 were published in 1918 by the [[Yale University Press]].&lt;ref name=Graves474&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'', p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; Various county record societies have published parts of the rolls for various years that relate to their particular county. The Society's earliest volumes (to 1900) were printed in "[[record type]]", designed to produce a near-[[facsimile]] of the original manuscript, including its [[scribal abbreviation]]s. This policy was abandoned in 1903, and all volumes since have been published in normal type with abbreviations extended.&lt;ref name=Pipe1904&gt;Pipe Roll Society ''Great Roll of the Pipe'' pp. vii-viii&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pipe Roll Society has also published numerous related texts, including the Chancellor's Roll for 1196 and the Norman Pipe Rolls of Henry II.&lt;ref name="PRS pubs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RHS PRS"/&gt; Rolls for the Irish Exchequer and the Norman Exchequer have also been published.&lt;ref name=Graves475&gt;Graves ''Bibliography of English History'' pp. 475–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Restless Dance Theatre''' is a [[dance theatre]] company based in the [[South Australia]]n capital of [[Adelaide]]. Founded in 1991, Restless works with people with and without [[disability]] to collaboratively create inclusive dance theatre informed by disability. The company presents dance theatre works in multiple mediums to diverse audiences. Restless has an extensive workshop program for all ages. The company, originally called '''Restless Dance Company''', changed its name to Restless Dance Theatre in 2008.{{sfn|Annual Report|2008|p=4}} 
 

==The Company==
The Restless Dance Company was founded in 1991 by Sally Chance and Tania Rose and was incorporated in 1996.{{sfn|Annual Report|2008|p=2}} The current Artistic Director is Michelle Ryan who has been the Artistic Director since January 2013.&lt;ref name="RDT-People"/&gt;

As an inclusive dance company, the work is informed by disability but not about disability. Restless has developed a way of working where participants are given a series of creative challenges and asked to respond in movement. Dance sequences are then built up from their responses. This produces unique and distinctive dance through a process that nurtures the creative voices of the dancers.

The guiding values which underpin the company’s work are:
* Vision: Restless artists enliven and diversify Australian dance.
* Purpose: Restless Dance Theatre collaboratively creates inclusive work informed by disability.
* Mission: Present unexpectedly real dance theatre works in multiple mediums to diverse audiences nationally and internationally.

==Awards==
The company received a Ruby Award in 2010 for sustained contribution by an organisation. Restless was nominated for an Australian Dance Award for "Salt" in 2015. The company won the award for Outstanding Achievement in Youth or Community Dance at the 2010 [[Australian Dance Awards]] for ''Bedroom Dancing''.&lt;ref name="Northover-2010"/&gt;
The Necessary Games film triptych has received multiple awards both nationally and internationally.
 
==Reviews==
"Restless Dance is one of a handful of Australian companies which defy pigeon-holing. The work they do with performers of differing physical and intellectual abilities is useful and heart-warming : but the point is that the work itself is exceptionally beautiful and highly skilled, often funny, and always moving."
Robyn Archer

"Restless changes attitudes to disability every time it performs."
Noel Jordan (Artistic Director, Imaginate Festival, Edinburgh)

"It’s an amazing company of dancers and performers. But what you don’t see on stage is disability, you just see an extraordinary group of human beings dancing with such heart and such talent."
Neil Armfield (Adelaide Festival co-director)

“5 STARS. Innovative, potent, bold and beautiful, Intimate Space is an extraordinary and highly entertaining experience.”
Limelight, March 2017

In The Balance…."Unbearably beautiful solos and duets."
Peter Burdon, Advertiser, June 2016

A '''rhyme''' is a repetition of similar sounds (usually, the exact same sound) in the final stressed syllables (and any following syllables) of two or more words. Most often, this kind of "perfect" rhyming is consciously used for effect in the final positions of [[Line (poetry)|lines]] of [[poem]]s and [[song]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhyme|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rhyme}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less strictly speaking, a rhyme may also variously refer to other types of similar sounds near the ends of two or more words. Furthermore, the word ''rhyme'' has come to be sometimes used as a [[pars pro toto|shorthand term]] for any brief poem, such as a [[rhyming couplet]] or [[nursery rhyme]].

==Etymology==

The word derives from [[Old French]] ''rime'' or ''ryme'', which may be derived from [[Old Frankish language|Old Frankish]] ''*rīm'', a Germanic term meaning "series, sequence" attested in Old English (Old English ''rīm'' meaning "enumeration, series, numeral") and Old High German ''rīm'', ultimately cognate to Old Irish ''rím'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ἀριθμός}}'' ''arithmos'' "number". Alternatively, the Old French words may derive from [[Latin]] ''rhythmus'', from Greek ''{{lang|grc|ῥυθμός}}'' (''rhythmos'', [[rhythm]]).&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book | title = rhyme, n. | work = OED Online | date = March 2013 | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/165361?rskey=SsEOXt&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Harper | first = Douglas | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | year = 2000–2012 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=rhyme&amp;searchmode=none | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling ''rhyme'' (from original ''rime'') was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period from a learned (but perhaps etymologically incorrect) association with Latin ''rhythmus''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The older spelling ''rime'' survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling; cf. ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of [[linguistics]] and [[phonology]] for which ''rime/rhyme'' is used to refer to the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] and [[Syllable coda|coda]] of a [[syllable]]. Some prefer to spell it ''rime'' to separate it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article (see [[syllable rime]]).

==Function of rhyming words==
Rhyme partly seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear. It also serves as a powerful [[mnemonic]] device, facilitating memorization. The regular use of [[Rhyme#Classification by position|tail rhyme]] helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener. As with other poetic techniques, poets use it to suit their own purposes; for example [[William Shakespeare]] often used a rhyming [[couplet]] to mark off the end of a scene in a play.

==Types of rhyme==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

The word ''rhyme'' can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. A rhyme in the strict sense is also called a [[perfect rhyme]]. Examples are ''sight'' and ''flight'', ''deign'' and ''gain'', ''madness'' and ''sadness''.

===Perfect rhymes===
{{main article|Perfect rhyme}}

Perfect rhymes can be classified according to the number of syllables included in the rhyme, which is dictated by the location of the final stressed syllable.

* '''single''', also known as [[masculine rhyme|masculine]]: a rhyme in which the stress is on the final syllable of the words (''rhyme'', ''sublime'')
* '''double''', also known as [[Feminine rhyme|feminine]]: a rhyme in which the stress is on the penultimate (second from last) syllable of the words (''picky'', ''tricky'')
* '''[[Dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]]:''' a rhyme in which the stress is on the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable (''cacophonies'', ''Aristophanes'')

===General rhymes===
In the general sense, ''general rhyme'' can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and to the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse. Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity:

* '''[[syllable rhyme|syllabic]]:''' a rhyme in which the last syllable of each word sounds the same but does not necessarily contain stressed vowels. (''cleaver'', ''silver'', or ''pitter'', ''patter''; the final syllable of the words ''bottle'' and ''fiddle'' are {{IPA|/l/}}, a [[liquid consonant]].)
* '''imperfect (or near):''' a rhyme between a stressed and an unstressed syllable. (''wing'', ''caring'')
* '''weak (or unaccented):''' a rhyme between two sets of one or more unstressed syllables. (''hammer'', ''carpenter'')
* '''semirhyme:''' a rhyme with an extra syllable on one word. (''bend'', ''ending'')
* '''forced (or oblique):''' a rhyme with an imperfect match in sound. (''green'', ''fiend''; ''one'', ''thumb'')
* '''[[assonance]]:''' matching vowels. (''sh'''a'''ke'', ''h'''a'''te'') Assonance is sometimes referred to as slant rhymes, along with consonance.
* '''[[literary consonance|consonance]]:''' matching consonants. ('''''r'''a'''b'''ie'''s''', '''r'''o'''bb'''er'''s''''')
*'''[[half rhyme]]''' (or '''slant rhyme'''): matching final consonants. (''Roxie'''', ''Lexie''''')
* '''[[pararhyme]]:''' all consonants match. (''tell'', ''tall'')
* '''[[alliteration]]''' (or '''head rhyme'''): matching initial consonants. ('''''sh'''ip'', '''''sh'''ort'')

===Identical rhymes===
Identical rhymes are considered less than perfect in English poetry; but are valued more highly in other literatures such as, for example, ''[[rime riche]]'' in French poetry.

Though [[homophone]]s and [[homonym]]s satisfy the first condition for rhyming—that is, that the stressed vowel sound is the same—they do not satisfy the second: that the preceding consonant be different. As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words.

If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all.&lt;ref name="myclasses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myclasses.net/smiser/cwp/rhyme.html|title=Rhyme, which cites ''Whitfield's University Rhyming Dictionary'', 1951 |publisher=myclasses.net|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="michael-thomas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-thomas.com/music/songwriting/rhyming.htm|title=Rhyming and Songwriting|publisher=michael-thomas.com|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a ''super-rhyme'' or "more than perfect rhyme" is the ''identical rhyme'', in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in ''gun'' and ''begun''. Punning rhymes, such as ''bare'' and ''bear'' are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound identical, it is called a ''[[holorhyme]]'' ("For I scream/For ice cream").

In poetics these would be considered ''identity'', rather than rhyme.

===Eye rhyme===
{{main article|Eye rhyme}}
Eye rhymes or sight rhymes or spelling rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound where the final sounds are spelled identically but pronounced differently.&lt;ref name=Stillman /&gt;  Examples in English are ''cough'', ''bough'', and ''love'', ''move''.

Some early written poetry appears to contain these, but in many cases the words used rhymed at the time of writing, and subsequent changes in pronunciation have meant that the rhyme is now lost.

===Mind rhyme===
{{main article|Mind rhyme}}
Mind rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to [[rhyming slang]], but it is less generally codified and is “heard” only when generated by a specific verse context. For instance, “this sugar is neat / and tastes so sour.” If a reader or listener thinks of the word “sweet” instead of “sour,”  a mind rhyme has occurred.

===Classification by position===
Rhymes may be classified according to their position in the verse:
*'''Tail rhyme''' (also called '''end rhyme''' or '''rime couée''') is a rhyme in the final syllable(s) of a verse (the most common kind).
*'''[[Internal rhyme]]''' occurs when a word or phrase in the interior of a line rhymes with a word or phrase at the end of a line, or within a different line.
*'''[[Off-centered rhyme]]''' is a type of internal rhyme occurring in unexpected places in a given line. This is sometimes called a misplaced-rhyme scheme or a [[spoken word]] rhyme style.
*'''[[Holorime]]''', mentioned above, occurs when two entire lines have the same sound.
*'''[[Broken rhyme]]''' is a type of [[enjambement]] producing a rhyme by dividing a word at the line break of a poem to make a rhyme with the end word of another line.
*'''Cross rhyme''' matches a sound or sounds at the end of a line with the same sound or sounds in the middle of the following (or preceding) line.&lt;ref name=Stillman /&gt;

A [[rhyme scheme]] is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem.

==History==
In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as [[ballad]]s, [[sonnet]]s and [[couplet|rhyming couplet]]s. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional [[rhyme scheme]]s.

The earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese [[Shi Jing]] (ca. 10th century BC). Rhyme is also occasionally used in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=6wSWpZmmlAoC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=ugaritic+poetry+rhyme&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8i7tZjxiF6&amp;sig=F918VtPZEKIZ7r4ffu7lDRbrH6k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=37ReTdeKLJKs8QOespxa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rhyme&amp;f=false Old Testament survey: the message, form, and background of the Old Testament pg. 236]"&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not usually rhyme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wesling|first=Donald|title=The chances of rhyme|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03861-5|pages=x–xi, 38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rhyme was used very occasionally. For instance, Catullus includes partial rhymes in the poem ''[[Catullus 1|Cui dono lepidum novum libellum]]''.&lt;ref name="prosentient"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prosentient.com.au/balnaves/johnbalnaves/dissch6c.asp|title=Bernard of Morlaix - METRE AND RHYME|publisher=prosentient.com.au|accessdate=2015-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031628/http://www.prosentient.com.au/balnaves/johnbalnaves/dissch6c.asp|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks knew rhyme, and rhymes in ''[[The Wasps]]'' by [[Aristophanes]] are noted by a translator.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristophanes, 2: Wasps, Lysistrata, Frogs, The Sexual Congress|author1=Aristophanes|author2=Slavitt, D.R.|author3=Bovie, S.P.|date=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press, Incorporated|isbn=9780812216844|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHmfT2s4mLgC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some archaic sources, [[Early Irish literature|Irish literature]] introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe, but that is a disputed claim.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08116a.htm Article about early Irish literature by Prof. Douglas Hyde in The Catholic Encyclopedia]"&lt;/ref&gt; In the 7th century, the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection. Also in the 7th century, rhyme was used in the [[Qur'an]]. The [[leonine verse]] is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century.

Rhyme entered European poetry in the [[High Middle Ages]], in part under the influence of the [[Arabic language]] in [[Al Andalus]] (modern Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=88|author=Menocal, Maria Rosa|title=The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2003|isbn=0-8122-1324-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the [[6th century in poetry|sixth century]], as in their long, rhyming [[qasida]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10387-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since languages change over time, lines that rhymed in the past may no longer rhyme in today's language, and it may not be clear how one would pronounce the words so that they rhyme:
:Rejoice, O Judah, and in songs divine
:With cherubim and seraphim harmonious join.
::from [[Handel]]'s ''[[Judas Maccabaeus (Handel)|Judas Maccabaeus]]'' (libretto by [[Thomas Morell]])
Although historically valid, "Should we really sing 'harmonious jine'?"&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas Forest (2011). ''Early Music: A Very Short Introduction'', p.83. {{ISBN|978-0-19-973076-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhyme in various languages==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

===Celtic languages===
:''For Welsh, see [[cynghanedd]]''

Rhyming in the [[Celtic Languages]] takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance and English patterns. Even today, despite extensive interaction with English and French culture, Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics. Brian Ó Cuív sets out the rules of rhyme in Irish poetry of the classical period: the last stressed vowel and any subsequent long vowels must be identical in order for two words to rhyme. Consonants are grouped into six classes for the purpose of rhyme: they need not be identical, but must belong to the same class. Thus 'b' and 'd' can rhyme (both being 'voiced plosives'), as can 'bh' and 'l' (which are both 'voiced continuants') but 'l', a 'voiced continuant', cannot rhyme with 'ph', a 'voiceless continuant'. Furthermore, "for perfect rhyme a palatalized consonant may be balanced only by a palatalized consonant and a velarized consonant by a velarized one."&lt;ref&gt;Ó Cuív, Brian (1967). 'The Phonetic Basis of Classical Modern Irish Rhyme'. ''Ériu 20, pp. 96-97''&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-Classical period, these rules fell into desuetude, and in popular verse simple assonance often suffices, as can be seen in an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from the traditional song ''Bríd Óg Ní Mháille'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ga|Is a Bhríd Óg Ní Mháille}}
{{IPA-ga|is ə vrʲiːdʲ oːɡ nʲiː wɒːlʲə|}}
{{lang|ga|'S tú d'fhág mo chroí cráite}}
{{IPA-ga|stuː dɒːɡ mə xriː krɒːtʲə|}}
|
Oh young Bridget O'Malley

You have left my heart breaking}}

Here the vowels are the same, but the consonants, although both palatalized, do not fall into the same class in the bardic rhyming scheme.

===Chinese===
{{Further|Rime dictionary}}
Besides the vowel/consonant aspect of rhyming, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] rhymes often include [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] quality (that is, [[Contour (linguistics)|tonal contour]]) as an integral linguistic factor in determining rhyme.

Use of rhyme in [[Classical Chinese poetry]] typically but not always appears in the form of paired couplets, with end-rhyming in the final syllable of each couplet.

Another important aspect of rhyme in regard to Chinese language studies is the study or reconstruction of past [[varieties of Chinese]], such as [[Middle Chinese]].

===English===
{{see also|English poetry}}
[[Old English poetry]] is mostly [[alliterative verse]]. One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is [[The Rhyming Poem]].

As [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] is important in English, lexical stress is one of the factors that affects the similarity of sounds for the perception of rhyme. Perfect rhyme can be defined as the case when two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical.&lt;ref name=Stillman&gt;{{cite book|last=Stillman|first=Frances|title=The Poet's Manual and Rhyming Dictionary|year=1966|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0500270309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words in English, such as "[[Orange (word)|orange]]" and "silver", are commonly regarded as having no rhyme. Although a clever writer can get around this (for example, by obliquely rhyming "orange" with combinations of words like "door hinge" or with &lt;!--POV: far-fetched--&gt; lesser-known words like "[[Blorenge]]" – a hill in Wales – or the surname [[Gorringe (disambiguation)|Gorringe]]), it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a [[synonym]] ("orange" could become "amber", while "silver" could become a combination of "bright and argent").

One view of rhyme in English is from [[John Milton]]'s preface to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'':
{{quote|The Measure is ''English'' Heroic  Verse without Rime, as that of ''Homer'' in ''Greek'', and of ''Virgil'' in ''Latin''; Rime being no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse, in longer Works especially, but the Invention of a barbarous Age, to set off wretched matter and lame Meeter; grac't indeed since by the use of some famous modern Poets, carried away by Custom...&lt;!--carefully proofread --&gt;}}

A more tempered view is taken by [[W. H. Auden]] in [[The Dyer's Hand]]:
{{quote|Rhymes, meters, stanza forms, etc., are like servants. If the master is fair enough to win their affection and firm enough to command their respect, the result is an orderly happy household. If he is too tyrannical, they give notice; if he lacks authority, they become slovenly, impertinent, drunk and dishonest.}}

Forced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of [[doggerel]].

===French===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Meter (poetry)]] --&gt;

In [[French poetry]], unlike in English, it is common to have ''identical rhymes'', in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme, but their onset consonants ("consonnes d'appui") as well. To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse, this often sounds like a very weak rhyme. For example, an English perfect rhyme of homophones, ''flour'' and ''flower'', would seem weak, whereas a French rhyme of homophones ''doigt'' and ''doit'' or ''point'' ("point") and ''point'' ("not") is not only acceptable but quite common.

Rhymes are sometimes classified into the categories "rime pauvre" ("poor rhyme"), "rime suffisante" ("sufficient rhyme"), "[[rime riche]]" ("rich rhyme") and "rime richissime" ("very rich rhyme"), according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example, to rhyme "tu" with "vu" would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme "pas" with "bras" a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and "tante" with "attente" a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute "e" in common). Authorities disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories.

''[[Holorime]]''  is an extreme example of ''rime richissime'' spanning an entire verse. [[Alphonse Allais]] was a notable exponent of holorime. Here is an example of a holorime couplet from [[Marc Monnier]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|Gall, amant de la Reine, alla (tour magnanime)
Galamment de l'Arène à la Tour Magne, à Nîmes.}}
|
Gallus, the Queen's lover, went (a magnanimous gesture)
Gallantly from the Arena to the Great Tower, at Nîmes.}}

Classical French rhyme not only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants. It also treats coda consonants in a distinctive way.

French spelling includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced, and that in many cases have never been pronounced. Such final unpronounced letters continue to affect rhyme according to the rules of Classical French versification. They are encountered in almost all of the pre-20th-century French verse texts, but these rhyming rules are almost never taken into account from the 20th century.

The most important "silent" letter is the "[[Silent letter#Vowels|mute e]]". In spoken French today, final "e" is, in some regional accents (in Paris for example), omitted&lt;!--leads a kind of half-life: this is an abuse of the term "half-life"--&gt; after consonants; but in Classical French prosody, it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel. "Joue" could rhyme with "boue", but not with "trou". Rhyming words ending with this silent "e" were said to make up a "double rhyme", while words not ending with this silent "e" made up a "single rhyme". It was a principle of stanza-formation that single and double rhymes had to alternate in the stanza. Virtually all 17th-century French plays in verse alternate single and double [[alexandrine]] couplets.

The now-silent final consonants present a more complex case. They, too, were traditionally an integral part of the rhyme, such that "pont" rhymed with "vont" but not with "long"; but spelling and pronunciation did not coincide exactly—"pont" also rhymed with "rond". There are a few rules that govern most word-final consonants in archaic French pronunciation:
* The distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants is lost in the final position. So "d" and "t" (both pronounced /t/) rhyme. So too with "g" and "c" (both /k/), "p" and "b" (both /p/), and "s", "x" and "z" (all /z/). Rhymes ending in /z/ are called "plural rhymes".
* Nasal vowels rhyme whether they are spelled with "m" or "n". ("Essaim" rhymes with "sain" but not with "saint" because of the final "t".)
* If a word ends in a stop followed by "s", the stop is silent (therefore "temps" rhymes with "dents"). In the archaic orthography some of these silent stops are omitted from the spelling as well (e.g. "dens" for "dents").

===Greek===
:''See [[Homoioteleuton]]'' rhyme

Ancient Greek poetry seldom if ever uses rhyme. Modern Greek poetry uses it extensively.

===Hebrew===
Ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] rarely employed rhyme, e.g. in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 29 35: ועשית לאהרן ולבניו כָּכה, ככל אשר צויתי אֹתָכה (the identical part in both rhyming words being / 'axa/ ). Rhyme became a permanent - even obligatory - feature of poetry in Hebrew language, around the 4th century CE. It is found in the [[piyyut|Jewish liturgical poetry]] written in the [[Byzantine empire]] era. This was realized by scholars only recently, thanks to the thousands of [[piyyut|piyyuts]] that have been discovered in the [[Cairo Geniza]]. It is assumed that the principle of rhyme was transferred from Hebrew liturgical poetry to the poetry of the [[Syriac Christianity]] (written in [[Aramaic]]), and through this mediation introduced into [[Latin poetry]] and then into all other languages of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt; See: Benjamin Harshav (Hrushovski)'s article on Hebrew Prosody in the [[Encyclopedia Judaica]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Latin===
In [[Latin]] rhetoric and poetry [[homeoteleuton]] and [[Alliteration (Latin)|alliteration]] were frequently used devices.

[[Rhyme#Classification by position|Tail rhyme]] was occasionally used, as in this piece of poetry by [[Cicero]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|la|O Fortu'''natam''' '''natam''' me consule '''Romam'''.}}
|
O fortunate Rome, to be born with me consul}}

But [[Rhyme#Classification by position|tail rhyme]] was not used as a prominent structural feature of [[Latin poetry]] until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early [[Middle Ages]]. This is the [[Latin]] [[hymn]] ''[[Dies Irae]]'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|la|Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum Sybilla}}
|
The day of wrath, that day
which will reduce the world to ashes,
as foretold by David and the Sybil.}}

[[Medieval poetry]] may mix Latin and [[vernacular]] languages. Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed [[macaronic]].

===Portuguese===
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] classifies rhymes in the following manner:

*'''rima pobre''' (poor rhyme): rhyme between words of the same [[grammatical category]] (e.g. noun with noun) or between very common endings (''-ão'', ''-ar'');
*'''rima rica''' (rich rhyme): rhyme between words of different grammatical classes or with uncommon endings;
*'''rima preciosa''' (precious rhyme): rhyme between words with a different [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], for example ''estrela'' (star) with ''vê-la'' (to see her);
*'''rima esdrúxula''' (odd rhyme): rhyme between [[Proparoxytone|proparoxytonic]] words (example: ''ânimo'', "animus", and ''unânimo'', "unanimous").

===Russian===
Rhyme was introduced into [[Russian language|Russian]] poetry in the 18th century. Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed, relying more on dactylic line endings for effect. Rhyme depends on a vowel and adjacent consonant (which may include the [[semivowel]] ''[[Short I]]''). Vowel pairs rhyme - even though non-Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound. Consonant pairs rhyme if both are devoiced. Early 18th century poetry demanded perfect rhymes that were also grammatical rhymes—namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings, verb endings with verb endings, and so on. Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry, and greater use is made of approximate rhymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wachtel|first=Michael|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Russian Poetry|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780511206986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish=== 
In Polish literature rhyme was used from the beginning. Unrhymed verse was never popular, although sometimes it was sometimes imitated form Latin. [[Homer]]'s, [[Virgil]]'s and even [[John Milton|Milton]]'s epic poems were furnished with rhymes by Polish translators.&lt;ref&gt;Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, Mały przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Kraków 2003, p. 19 (in Polish).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of paroxytonic accentuation in Polish, feminine rhymes always prevailed. Rules of Polish rhyme were established in 16th century. Then only feminine rhymes were allowed in syllabic verse system. Together with introducing syllabo-accentual metres, masculine rhymes began to occur in Polish poetry. They were most popular at the end of 19th century. The most frequent rhyme scheme in Old Polish (16th - 18th centuries) was couplet AABBCCDD..., but Polish poets, having perfect knowledge of Italian language and literature, experimented with other schemes, among others [[ottava rima]] (ABABABCC) and [[sonnet]] (ABBA ABBA CDC DCD or ABBA ABBA CDCD EE).
{{Verse translation|

|attr1=Adam Mickiewicz,&lt;br&gt;"{{lang|pl|Stepy akermańskie}}", ''{{lang|pl|Sonety krymskie}}'', lines 1-4
|

The metre of Mickiewicz's sonnet is the [[Polish alexandrine]] (tridecasyllable, in Polish "trzynastozgłoskowiec"): 13(7+6) and its rhymes are feminine: [anu] and [odzi].

===Arabic===
Rhymes were widely spread in the [[Arabian peninsula]] around the 6th century, in letters, poems and songs, as well as long, rhyming qasidas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10387-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the Koran uses a form of rhymed prose named [[saj']].

===Sanskrit===
Patterns of rich rhyme (''prāsa'') play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry, but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts. They are classified according to their position within the ''pada'' (metrical foot): ''ādiprāsa'' (first syllable), ''dvitīyākṣara prāsa'' (second syllable), ''antyaprāsa'' (final syllable) etc.

===Tamil===
There are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil. Specifically, the rhyme called ''etukai'' (anaphora) occurs on the second consonant of each line.

The other rhyme and related patterns are called ''mō&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;ai'' ([[alliteration]]), ''toṭai'' ([[epistrophe|epiphora]]) and ''iraṭṭai kiḷavi'' ([[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]).

Some classical Tamil poetry forms, such as ''veṇpā'', have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]].

===Vietnamese===
Rhymes are used in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] to produce similes. The following is an example of a Rhyming Simile:

'''Nghèo''' như con '''mèo'''
&lt;br&gt;/'''ŋɛu''' ɲɯ kɔn '''mɛu'''/ 
&lt;br&gt;"Poor as a cat"
&lt;br&gt;

Compare the above Vietnamese example, which is a ''rhyming'' simile, to the English phrase "(as) poor as a church mouse", which is only a ''semantic'' simile.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 98 in Thuy Nga Nguyen and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] (2012), "Stupid as a Coin: Meaning and Rhyming Similes in Vietnamese", ''International Journal of Language Studies'' 6 (4), pp. 97-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Porth Hellick Down - geograph.org.uk - 1036.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance grave at Porth Hellick Down]]
The [[entrance grave]]s of [[Cornwall]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]], and south east [[Ireland]] are megalithic [[chamber tomb]]s of the [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]] in the [[British Isles]]. Comparable sites are also known in [[Brittany]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. They are generally known as the '''Scillonian''' group as the greatest concentration of the tombs is found on the [[Isles of Scilly]].

Examples include [[Bant's Carn]] and the [[Innisidgen]] and [[Porth Hellick Down]] tombs, all on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]].

They consist of a narrow entrance which leads into a rectangular burial chamber covered by a small round stone [[cairn]] usually revetted with a [[Megalithic architectural elements#Kerb or peristalith|kerb]]. In some examples a [[sill stone]] blocks the entrance. The walls of the chamber themselves are of either [[orthostat]] slabs or stone courses, covered with several large capstones. Both the cairn and the chamber often exploit natural stone outcrops or boulders in their construction.

Entrance orientations in Scillonian graves follow no discernible pattern and they appear to have been used for deposition of multiple [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials with up to 60 individuals found at [[Knackyboy Cairn]] on the island of [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]]. [[Occupation debris]] has also been found in the graves which implies that they were actively used sites possibly for wider ritual purposes and/or as territorial markers.

The small size and simplicity of these monuments compared with the more complex tombs being built elsewhere in Britain imply that the areas where they are found preserved older methods of burial. The earliest known finds from Scillonian entrance graves include fragments of middle Neolithic [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] type ware and have led some archaeologists such as [[Paul Ashbee]] to argue that they are in fact of early Neolithic or even [[Mesolithic]] date. Much of the Bronze Age material excavated from entrance graves is considered to be related to later re-use.

'''Singing''' is the act of producing [[music]]al sounds with the [[human voice|voice]] and augments regular [[speech]] by the use of sustained [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a '''singer''' or '''vocalist''' (in [[jazz]] and [[popular music]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vocalist ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/vocalist | title=Vocalist &amp;#124; Definition of vocalist in US English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singers perform music ([[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, [[song]]s, etc.) that can be sung [[accompaniment|with]] or [[a cappella|without accompaniment]] by [[musical instrument]]s. Singing is often done in an [[ensemble (music)|ensemble]] of musicians, such as a [[choir]] of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in [[art song]] or some [[jazz]] styles) up to a [[symphony orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Different singing styles include [[art music]] such as [[opera]] and [[Chinese opera]], [[Hindustani classical music|Indian music]] and [[religious music]] styles such as [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[traditional music]] styles, [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[gazal]] and popular music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic dance music]] and [[filmi]] (film songs).

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of [[music education]] or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular [[practice (learning method)|practice]]. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.&lt;ref name="Musicguides"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional singers usually build their [[career]]s around one specific [[musical genre]], such as [[Classical music|classical]] or [[Rock music|rock]], although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). They typically take [[vocal pedagogy|voice training]] provided by voice teachers or [[vocal coach]]es throughout their careers.

[[File:Gray1204.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords]]

In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or [[bellows]]; on the [[larynx]], which acts as a [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrator]]; on the [[chest]], head cavities and skeleton, which have the function of an [[amplifier]], as the tube in a [[wind instrument]]; and on the [[tongue]], which together with the [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[lip]]s articulate and impose [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a [[vocal technique]] and are made to interact upon one another.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

 |title=Singing

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the [[abdominal]], [[internal intercostal]] and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of [[external intercostals]], [[scalenes]], and [[sternocleidomastoid muscles]]. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is altered with the [[vocal cords]]. With the lips closed, this is called [[humming]].

The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's [[vocal cords]] but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the [[chest]] and [[neck]], the position of the [[tongue]], and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume ([[loudness]]), [[timbre]], or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].&lt;ref name="Vennard"&gt;polka dots

{{Vocal registration}}

''Vocal registration'' refers to the system of vocal registers within the voice. A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chest‐ and falsetto‐like oscillations in a two‐mass model of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355–3359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name="Large"&gt;

The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"&gt;

* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process (phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract)
* A certain vocal [[timbre]] or vocal "color"
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system. Within [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

=== Vocal resonation ===
{{Main|Vocal resonation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the head and neck]]

'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].&lt;ref name="Greene2001"&gt;

===Chest voice and head voice===
{{Main|Chest voice|Head voice}}

''Chest voice'' and ''head voice'' are terms used within [[vocal music]]. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]]; a [[vocal resonance]] area; or a specific vocal timbre.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] or a [[vocal resonance]] area.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.

====History and development====
The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the "throat voice" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;

Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into "chest register", "head register", and "falsetto register" and woman's voices into "chest register", "middle register", and "head register". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a [[vocal]] technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.&lt;ref name="Headv"&gt;

However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at [[Indiana University]] and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]], have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt; In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including [[speech pathology]], [[phonetics]], and [[linguistics]]. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal register]] or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the [[modal register]]. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;

However, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;

===Classifying singing voices===
{{Main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}
{{Vocal range}}

In [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;

However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, [[Boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

Within [[choral music]], singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[contemporary commercial music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Vocal pedagogy''' is the study of the teaching of singing. The art and science of vocal pedagogy has a long history that began in [[Ancient Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Music/|title=Ancient Greek Music|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to develop and change today. Professions that practice the art and science of vocal pedagogy include [[vocal coaches]], [[choral music|choral directors]], [[Music education|vocal music educators]], [[List of opera directors|opera directors]], and other teachers of singing.

Vocal pedagogy concepts are a part of developing proper [[vocal technique]]. Typical areas of study include the following:&lt;ref name="Titze2008"&gt;

===Vocal technique===
[[File:Morphometric-Differences-of-Vocal-Tract-Articulators-in-Different-Loudness-Conditions-in-Singing-pone.0153792.s004.ogv|thumb|[[Real-time MRI]] of a [[vocal tract]] while singing.]]

Singing when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing. There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence:
# Breath is taken
# Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]
# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units
Although these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

Since singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.

Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;
:
# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential
# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
# Developing flexibility and agility
# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]

====Developing the singing voice====
Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; "lining up" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.

Vocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.&lt;ref name="Appelman" /&gt;

Learning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Extending vocal range===
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much can a singer sing before they reach their limits? May 16, 2014, from |url=http://howikis.com/How_much_can_a_singer_sing_before_they_reach_their_limit}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.&lt;ref name=Vennard/&gt;

There are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:

# The ''energy'' factor – "energy" has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.
# The ''space'' factor – "space" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the "beginning of a yawn".
# The ''depth'' factor – "depth" has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.

McKinney says, "These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less."&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

===Posture===
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.&lt;ref name="Vennard"/&gt;

There are eight components of the ideal singing posture:

# Feet slightly apart
# Legs straight but knees slightly bent
# Hips facing straight forward
# Spine aligned
# Abdomen flat
# Chest comfortably forward
# Shoulders down and back
# Head facing straight forward

===Breathing and breath support===
Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.

These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.&lt;ref name=Sundberg&gt;

===Vibrato===
[[Vibrato]] is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Singing|page=64|author=Phyllis Fulford|author2=Michael Miller |year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=max+schoen+vibrato+neuro+muscular+tremor#v=onepage&amp;q=max%20schoen%20vibrato%20neuro%20muscular%20tremor&amp;f=false|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|last=Stark|first=James|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0802086143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.

===[[Extended vocal technique]]===

==Vocal music==
{{Main|Vocal music}}
'''Vocal music''' is [[music]] performed by one or more singers, which are typically called [[song]]s, and which may be performed with or without [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some [[blues rock]] songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a [[song]], although, in [[classical music]], terms such as [[aria]] are typically used.

===Genres of vocal music===
{{Main|Music genre}}
[[File:Divine trio 2016.jpg|thumb|A trio of female singers performing at the [[Berwaldhallen|Berwald Hall]] in 2016.]]
Vocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include [[Hindustani classical music|Indian classical music]], [[Art music]], [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], regional and national music, and [[fusion genre|fusions]] of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music]], [[easy listening]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music]], and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as [[vocalese]] and [[scat singing]] in jazz.

====Popular and traditional music====
In many modern pop [[musical group]]s, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or [[melody]] of a [[song]], as opposed to a [[Backing vocalist|backing singer]] who sings backup vocals or the [[harmony]] of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or [[Hum (sound)|humming]] in the background. An exception is five-part [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[a cappella]] music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a [[descant]] and not the [[melody]]. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.

Popular music includes a range of vocal styles. [[Hip-hop]] uses [[rapping]], the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s in a rhythmic speech over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican "[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. [[Blues]] singing is based on the use of the [[blue note]]s–notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as [[screaming (music)|screams]], shouts, and unusual sounds such as the "[[death growl]]".

One difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a [[microphone]] and [[PA system]] (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as "[[crooning]]" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop [[beatboxer]]s, doing plosive "p" and "b" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. It n the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act [[Milli Vanilli]], lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.

While some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as [[rhythm guitar]], electric bass, or drums. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]] groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows

Aspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.  Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.menc.org |title=National Association for Music Education (NAfME) |website=Menc.org |date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420155809/http://www.menc.org/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professional singers continue to seek out [[vocal coach]]ing to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, [[sight singing]] and memorizing songs, and  vocal exercises.

In order to become independent and survive  the competitive atmosphere and stay for a longer time and have a long career, singers must learn the skill of [[Composing (music)|Music composing]], [[Music Producer|Music producing]] and [[Lyrics]] writing, they should take advantage of social media platforms like [[YouTube]] and upload their musical contents. Many musicians gained popularity because of social media and got recognition, example [[Justin Bieber]]. After getting recognition and popularity for their "original" or "cover" songs, they can get offers for doing [[Concerts|Live shows]] from the event organisers, which is a large source of income for musicians across the world, [[YouTube]] also pays if the channel of the singer in YouTube is popular and have significant amount of subscribers and viewership. This they can also monetise (earn revenues) from [[Streaming media|Streaming]] apps.
They must also take steps to market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing [[audition]]s in front of an  [[Music Director]]. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the "talent buyers" that they seek out may be [[Record company]], [[A&amp;R]] representatives, [[Music Director]], choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.

==Singing competitions==
In recent years, the talent of singing has become competitive. Currently, there are several television shows that showcase these talents. ''[[American Idol]]'' was one of the prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, it was one of the first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]] launched by [[Zee TV]] in the 1995.&lt;ref name="year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Contestants-On-SaReGaMaPa/|title=Contestants on Saregamapa|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[American Idol]] Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' and ''[[The Sing-Off]]''.

==Health benefits==
Scientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.  A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits.&lt;ref name="Clift2001"&gt;

A multinational collaboration to study the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called ''Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing'' (AIRS).&lt;ref name="AIRS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |title=Doctor's prescription: 2 arias + a chorus |last=Mick |first=Hayley |date=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150118161443/http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing provides physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits to participants. When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphin's, and increased lung capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774037978|title=Chronicle-Herald|last=Clarke|first=Heather Laura|date=June 20, 2014|work=|access-date=November 11, 2016|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on the brain ===
John Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that "people who sing are more likely to be happy." This is because "singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being." Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that "music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication" and that "singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech" (260).&lt;ref name="brain on music"&gt;{{Cite book|title = This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last = Levitin|first = Daniel J.|publisher = Plume|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0452288522|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who "argued that language is an adaptation and music is its [[Spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]] ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language" (248).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt;

Studies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.

Singing is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dingle|first=Genevieve|year=2012|title="To be heard": The social and mental health benefits of choir singing for disadvantaged adults|doi=10.1177/0305735611430081|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=41|issue=4|pages=405–421|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:267353/UQ267353_post_print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on body===
A recent study by [[Tenovus Cancer Care]] found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. "Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160404221004.htm|title=Choir singing boosts immune system activity in cancer patients and carers, study shows|last=sciencedaily|first=from ecancermedicalscience|date=April 4, 2016|work=|access-date=November 10, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent newspaper article by the ''Toronto Star'' states that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|title=The Star|last=Rozien Oz|first=Mike Mehmet|date=April 25, 2011|work=|access-date=November 25, 2011|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing and language ==
Every natural or non natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.

=== Neurological aspects ===
Much research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter "speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits" (130).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, Brodmann Area 47. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, "listening to music and attending its syntactic features," similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, "musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca's area" and "the regions involved in musical semantics ..  appear to be [localized] near Wernicke's area." Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.

Singing has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Singing 'rewires' damaged brain |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |publisher = BBC News|date = 2010-02-21|access-date = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is casually known as the "singing center." By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that "regional specificity," such as that for speech, "may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage."&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the "singing center" may be [[neuroplasticity|retrained]] to help produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://musicianbrain.gottfriedschlaug.org/papers/Loui_Wan_Schlaug_2010_Acoustics_Today.pdf |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=6 |issue=3 | date=July 2010 |authors=Psyche Loui, Catherine Y. Wan, Gottfried Schlaug |title=Neurological Bases of Musical Disorders and Their Implications for Stroke Recovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accents and singing ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}

The speaking dialect or accent of a person may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Rock 'n' roll best sung in American accents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=L.V.|title=Why Do British Singers Sound American?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/explainer/2012/11/skyfall_theme_song_by_adele_why_do_british_singers_sound_american.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing animals ==
Scholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marler | first1 = Peter | year = 1970 | title = Birdsong and speech development: Could there be parallels? | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 669–73 | pmid = 5480089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, Nils, Bjorn Merker, Steven Brown. (Editors) (2000). The origins of music. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wide dispersal of singing behavior among very different animal species, like [[bird]]s, [[gibbon]]s, [[whale]]s, and many others strongly suggests that singing appeared independently in different species. Currently, there are about 5400 species of animals that are known to sing. At least some singing species demonstrate the ability to [[learn]] their songs, to [[improvise]] and even to [[Composer|compose]] new melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Katherine (2000). "The progressively changing songs of humpback whales: a window on the creative process in a wild animal." In The Origins of Music. Edited by N. L. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 135–150. Cambridge, Massachusetts:MIT&lt;/ref&gt;  In some animal species singing is a group activity (see, for example, singing in [[gibbon]] families&lt;ref&gt;Geissmann, Thomas. 2000. "Gibbon songs and human music from an evolutionary perspective." In ''The origins of Music''. Edited by N. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 103–124.

'''''Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire''''' is a multimedia project created by [[Lucasfilm]] in 1996. The original idea was to create a story set between the films ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (a time no ''[[Star Wars]]'' novel had explored before), and to explore all commercial possibilities of a full motion picture release without actually making a film. The venture reinvigorated interest in the franchise ahead of the theatrical [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|Special Editions]] of the [[Star Wars Trilogy|''Star Wars'' trilogy]] released in the following year.

Several products were released, including a novel, a junior novelization, a comic book series, a video game, a soundtrack, trading cards, [[role-playing game]]s, posters, model kits, [[Micro Machines]] toys, statuettes, vinyl dolls, and a series of [[action figure]]s and vehicles.&lt;ref name="GPro96"&gt;{{cite magazine|editor=Wes Nihei|title=Shopping for Shadows|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the narratives in the print media seldom intersected, it was necessary that characters, scenes, and dialogue match when they did come together. Author [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]] has expressed his support of adapting the story as an animated film.&lt;ref name=SWinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=https://starwarsinterviews.com/various/authors/steve-perry-author/|title=Steve Perry (Author)|website=Star Wars Interviews|last=Perry|first=Steve|date=March 2010|accessdate=October 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire TPB|last=Wagner|first=John|year=1997|publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]]|isbn=978-1569711835|page=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed (project)|The Force Unleashed]]'' later followed in the project's footsteps by creating multimedia involved in a film's release without making a movie.

The main plotline is told in a novel by [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]]. [[Princess Leia]] leads an attempt to liberate the frozen [[Han Solo]] from [[Boba Fett]], but is unsuccessful. [[Darth Vader]] searches for his son [[Luke Skywalker]], whom is being targeted by [[Prince Xizor]], the most powerful crimelord in the galaxy. [[Emperor Palpatine]] orders Vader to trust Xizor, even though the latter is plotting to overthrow them. Xizor kidnaps Leia in his attempt to bait Luke. [[Lando Calrissian]] and [[Dash Rendar]] sneak into the crimelord's palace on [[Coruscant ]] to save her. Luke and Leia discuss plans to rescue Han from [[Jabba the Hutt]], and Luke constructs his new [[lightsaber]].

Author Steve Perry got the job after writing the novelizations of ''[[The Mask (film)|The Mask]]'' for Bantam, and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' based upon graphic novels by [[Dark Horse Comics]], which had been licensed by [[Lucasfilm]] to create ''Star Wars'' comics. In addition to the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, Perry read the first spin-off novel in the franchise, ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'', to get an idea of how to write for Vader.&lt;ref name=SWinterview/&gt;

A prequel novel was planned, to be written by author [[Charles L.

The comic book emphasizes the destiny of Boba Fett and his fellow bounty hunters, first seen in a brief scene on ''The Empire Strikes Back''. It also tells the story of Jix, Darth Vader's assistant, who infiltrated Jabba the Hutt's gang of bikers to prevent that band's attempt to murder Luke Skywalker. The series was written by [[John Wagner]] and illustrated by Kilian Plunkett.

The comics were written and drawn at the same time of the novel, so the first issue could be released immediately after the book. However, the story told by the comics is unique in many ways. The primary difference is that the comics tell what happened to Boba Fett and the other bounty hunters hired by Darth Vader to find the ''Millennium Falcon'' in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Steve Perry, author of the project's novel, was a story consultant.

===Sequel===
A sequel comic was written, called ''Shadows of the Empire: Evolution'', which was created over five issues and later combined in a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]. The series was written by Steve Perry, and was his first foray into comics.&lt;ref name=SWinterview/&gt; It was pencilled by [[Ron Randall]], inked by [[P. Craig Russell]], and colored by [[Dave Nestelle]].

The story is set around the time of ''Return of the Jedi''. Xizor, the leader of the Black Sun criminal organization, has been destroyed, and Guri, an attractive human replica droid who was Xizor's personal assassin in the original novel, is left wondering what her future will hold now that she no longer has a master. During the ongoing struggle for supremacy in the underworld, Guri endeavors to discover her human side—if it even exists. But in her quest to alter her programming and gain humanity, Guri is pursued by both bounty hunters and Rebels led by Luke Skywalker. Secrets lying in her android mind make her a valuable asset.

==Game==
{{Main|Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire (video game)}}
[[LucasArts]]'s ''Shadows of the Empire'' was one of the first games available for the [[Nintendo 64]], and later for Windows. The most commercial product in the ''Shadows of the Empire'' line, the game was first released in December 1996 as an exclusive N64 title five months after the console's launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-shadows-of-the-empire/ Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire], MobyGames, accessed December 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The PC version came nearly a year later in September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/objects/003/003033.html IGN: Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire], IGN PC, accessed December 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game, players control mercenary [[List of Star Wars characters#R|Dash Rendar]] in his efforts to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from Prince Xizor's hands. It is divided into four parts (or chapters):
* '''Chapter 1''': Dash is drawn into the [[Battle of Hoth]].
* '''Chapter 2''': Dash Rendar confronts bounty hunters from the original films—[[IG-88]] and [[Boba Fett]]—in an attempt to reacquire Han Solo.
* '''Chapter 3''': Boba Fett has escaped and the player's mission changes: you must now save Luke Skywalker's life by fighting a deadly gang of [[Speeder bike|swoop bikers]] in [[Mos Eisley]], then recover secret Imperial plans for the second [[Death Star]] with Luke's help.
* '''Chapter 4''': Dash Rendar, with Luke and Lando Calrissian, travels to [[Coruscant]] to rescue Princess Leia from Prince Xizor's stronghold.

Certain parts of the game contradict elements from the book and comic, but the overall story remains the same.

The N64 and PC versions of the video game differ somewhat. The PC version has sharper and smoother gameplay graphics when using a 3D card. Both versions have slightly different cutscenes—the PC version has full-motion cinematic cutscenes with sound effects and voices, while the N64 version utilizes artwork with text at the bottom of the screen.

[[Varèse Sarabande]] published a score composed by [[Joel McNeely]], after a suggestion by [[John Williams]], and performed by the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]] and Chorus. Themes from the movies can be heard in tracks one (the main theme from ''Star Wars'' and "Carbon Freeze") and eight ("[[The Imperial March]]" and "The Force Theme"). The tenth track also contains credited appearances of "The Imperial March". The disc also includes an interactive track for personal computers, containing concept art and additional information about the project. The multimedia track includes an overview of the ''Shadows of the Empire'' project; a creative team gallery; information about McNeely, the orchestra, and the efforts to put together a soundtrack for the novel; and information about the book, the game, the comic series, and the toys based on the characters. The liner notes give plot summaries for each track's corresponding section of the novel. McNeely wrote, "Unlike with film music, I have been allowed to let my imagination run free with the images, characters and events from this story. I have also had the luxury to loiter as long as I like with a character or scene. Every passage represents some person, place or event in this story."

[[Ben Burtt]] wrote a poem for the liner notes, about an ancient battle on [[Coruscant]], which McNeely used in some compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=[[Star Wars Insider]]|title=Scoring the Trilogy|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|issue=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lyrics, Burtt made references to the ''[[Star Wars: Droids|Droids]]'' series he was involved in writing.

==Toys==
&lt;!-- [[Image:Sote2pakvadercard.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|An example of an action figure produced for the project.]] --&gt;
[[Kenner Products|Kenner]] was one of the companies that made the toy line for the ''Shadows of the Empire'' project.&lt;ref name="GPro96"/&gt; Their line contained action figures (including new characters such as Xizor and Dash Rendar), vehicles (from the Outrider to swoop bikes) and "two-pack" pairings of new and classic characters (such as IG-88 and Boba Fett). The classic characters figures were given a new spin with Chewbacca disguised as Snoova, a Wookiee bounty hunter, and Luke Skywalker costumed in an Imperial uniform (all the better to infiltrate Imperial City).

[[Galoob|Lewis Galoob Toys]], famous for their line of "[[Micro Machines]]" miniature toys and playsets, also developed a full ''Shadows of the Empire'' toy line. It included three sets of miniatures and a boxed Action Fleet set with two swoop bikes and riders and four miniature articulated figures. Also included in the sets are the classic ''Star Wars'' characters (Luke, Vader, the Emperor) as well as the new ''Shadows'' characters (Xizor, Dash Rendar, Guri and Leebo).

===Kenner action figures===
* [[Boba Fett]] vs. [[IG-88]]
* [[Chewbacca]] in Bounty Hunter Disguise (with Vibro-Axe and Heavy Blaster Rifle)
* [[Dash Rendar]] (with Heavy Weapons Pack)
* [[Princess Leia|Leia]] in [[Princess Leia|Boushh]] Disguise (with Blaster Rifle and Bounty Hunter Helmet)
* [[Luke Skywalker]] in Imperial Guard Disguise (with Taser Staff Weapon)
* [[Prince Xizor]] (with Energy Blade Shields)
* Prince Xizor vs. [[Darth Vader]]

===Kenner vehicles===
* ''[[Outrider (Star Wars)|Outrider]]'' - Dash Rendar's spaceship
* ''[[Slave I]]'' - Boba Fett's spaceship
* [[Speeder bike|Swoop bike]] with Swoop Trooper

The model making company [[Ertl Company|Ertl]] released several plastic model kits of ''Shadows of the Empire'', including the Virago (Xizor's spaceship), Prince Xizor, and the Emperor.

Collectible and gift company Applause released two vinyl figures, of Dash Rendar and Prince Xizor as well as a cold-cast resin statuette of the villains: Xizor, the Emperor and Darth Vader.

==Trading cards==
The [[Topps]] company developed the ''Shadows of the Empire'' trading card line.&lt;ref name="GPro96"/&gt; The 100-piece ''Shadows of the Empire'' card set from Topps represents all three platforms that tell the story—the book, comic series, and game. The cards are the work of [[The Brothers Hildebrandt|Greg and Tim Hildebrandt]], the twin artists who painted one of the more popular original ''Star Wars'' release posters. The 100 card set featured double UV-coating and an extra-thick 20 pt. card stock, all with full-bleed painted images on a 21/2" x 31/2" card. The ''Shadows of the Empire'' card series is highlighted by 72 cards that virtually storyboard the events in Steve Perry's novel. The series also contains six cards dedicated to vehicles, another six to the comics, and six more keyed to the video game. Each pack came with nine cards.

==References in other media==
The 1996 [[Star Wars (radio)#Return of the Jedi|''Return of the Jedi'' radio drama]] by [[Brian Daley]] makes several references to ''Shadows of the Empire''.

In the 1997 Special Edition re-release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'', [[Speeder bike|swoop bikes]] and ASP labor droids make an appearance, as does Dash Rendar's ship, the ''[[Outrider (Star Wars)|Outrider]]''. Though originally developed for the Special Edition of ''A New Hope'', the [[Sentinel-class landing craft]] (also known as the "Imperial landing craft") also made its first appearance in ''Shadows of the Empire''.

Several missions in the ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance|X-Wing Alliance]]'' (1999) computer game refer to ''Shadows of the Empire''. The game involves assisting Dash Rendar in the capture of the Imperial freighter ''Suprosa'', which was carrying the design schematics of the second [[Death Star]]. Dash Rendar's ''Outrider'' can be seen in the game, as well as in the game ''[[Star Wars: Bounty Hunter|Bounty Hunter]]'' (2002).

A one-shot comic book was released from writer [[Ryder Windham]] in January 2000. It was called ''Shadow Stalker'', and was a prelude to ''Shadows of the Empire'' expanding on the adventures of Jix. The series also incorporated characters from the [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] ''Star Wars'' newspaper strip story "Iceworld".

[[Image:Silk picture of the London and York royal mail coach.JPG|thumb|Stevengraph showing the London and York Royal Mail Coach, [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]].]] '''Stevengraphs''' are pictures woven from [[silk]], originally created by [[Thomas Steven (weaver)|Thomas Stevens]] in the 19th century. They were popular collectable items during the revival of interest in [[Victoriana]] in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt; Thorncroft, Antony. ''Memories are made of this'' FT.com 29 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detail==
[[File:Thomas Stevens HAGAM.tif|thumb|Thomas Stevens senior]]In the mid-19th century the town of [[Coventry]], [[England]], was the centre of a [[ribbon]] weaving industry. In 1860 the [[Cobden–Chevalier Treaty]] was signed; this [[free trade]] treaty introduced new competition into the industry, leading to a collapse in the local economy.

Thomas Stevens, a local weaver, responded by adapting the [[Jacquard loom]]s used in Coventry to weave colourful pictures from silk. By 1862, Stevens could produce four different designs and by the late 1880s this had to over 900; they became known as "Stevengraphs", after their maker. Many of these designs were used to produce [[bookmark]]s, while others were used to make [[greeting card]]s and other silk objects.&lt;ref name=Association1&gt;''[http://www.stevengraphcollectors.com/page2.htm Stevengraphs - What are they?]'', Stevengraph Collectors Association, accessed 4 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, Stevengraphs were considered collectable items, but the hobby was considered eccentric and mainly confined to female collectors. During the [[Second World War]] Coventry was attacked by [[Germany|German]] bombers; on 14 November 1940 the [[Coventry Blitz]] occurred, destroying the Stevens factory and apparently all records of the Stevengraphs.

In the late 1950s it emerged that Henry Stephens, a descendent of Thomas, had saved one of the pattern books the night before the attack and kept it in safe storage; Henry donated it to the [[Coventry City Council]], who in turn entrusted it with the [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]]. Stevengraphs became valuable, with more male collectors entering the hobby.&lt;ref&gt;Wollen, pp.68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Prices rose, particularly for unusual or rarer images less popular during the Victorian period.&lt;ref name=Association1/&gt;

Stevengraphs normally measured 140mm x 64mm (5½ x 2½ inch) and were often mounted on cardboard. A printed label on the reverse would indicate that the design was registered and could not be copied. Several other Coventry firms also produced silk-work pictures including ''W H Grant'' and ''Welch &amp; Lambton''.&lt;ref&gt;Godden (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="979">The '''''Symphony in B-Flat Major ("Mannheim No. 3")''''' is a Mannheim symphony by [[Johann Stamitz]], probably written sometime from 1741 to 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notes to Johann Stamitz Symphonies Vol. 1 on Naxos|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553194&amp;catNum=553194&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English#|accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It might be Stamitz' first symphony.  It is formed in the standard 3-movement symphonic scheme of the time:
#Alla Breve
#Andante
#Allegro

This symphony, just like the others by Stamitz, definitely influenced [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Mozart]].  It is about 8 minutes long.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3724">'''''The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn''''' ({{lang-ga|'''Macgnímartha Finn'''}}) is a medieval [[Ireland|Irish]] narrative belonging to the [[Fenian Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. As its title implies, it recounts the boyhood exploits of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], the cycle's central figure. The most important manuscript is Laud 610: folio 118Rb-121Va, which is missing the ending; [[Kuno Meyer]] assigned the text to the 12th century.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;Meyer, "Macgnimartha Find."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and development==
The Laud 610 manuscript was first edited by [[Kuno Meyer]] in 1881 for the [[France|French]] journal ''[[Revue Celtique]]''.&lt;ref name="Meyer"/&gt; The text breaks off while Fionn investigates a ''[[sídhe]]'' or fairy mound, before his trip to Tara. Scholars have pointed out similarities between earlier versions of ''The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn'' and tales of the youth of the [[Ulster Cycle]] hero [[Cúchulainn]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, ''[[The Boyhood Deeds of Cúchulainn]]'' and ''[[Tochmarc Emire|The Wooing of Emer]]'', both found within the epic ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'', recount Cúchulainn's earning of a nickname through his feats, his training by a warrior woman ([[Scáthach]]) and his earning of a deadly spear (the [[Gáe Bulg]]).

==Plot==
The story begins with the death of Fionn's father [[Cumhal]], leader of the [[Fianna]], at the hands of [[Goll mac Morna]]. Cumhal's wife [[Muirne]] was pregnant at the time and eventually gave birth to their son, called Demne in his youth. Fearing for his safety, she sends the boy to be raised by Cumhal's sister, the druidess [[Bodhmall]], and her companion [[Liath Luachra]]. The two warrior women raise him and accompany him on several adventures, including one in which he receives his nickname, ''Fionn'' (the fair; the pale). As he grows, his exploits attract increasing attention, and finally his foster mothers send him away for fear that Goll's men will find him. Subsequent episodes depict his service to the king of [[Bantry]], his recovery of Cumhal's treasures by slaying [[Liath Luachra]] (a different character than his caretaker), and his meeting with the aged and dispossessed Fianna who had fought with his father. 

Another famous episode recounts how Fionn inadvertently eats the [[Salmon of Wisdom]], which would grant universal knowledge to whoever consumed it. He had been studying under the poet [[Finn Eces]], who had sought the fish for seven years. Finally he catches it, and has Fionn cook it for him. Fionn burns his thumb on the fish and puts it in his mouth, thereby receiving its gift of wisdom. 

Fionn travels to the capital of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]], which is set aflame each [[Samhain]] by [[Aillén]] the Burner, one of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]]. Goll and the Fianna are powerless to stop it, since Aillén puts everyone to sleep with a magical tune. Fionn inhales poison from his own spear to prevent sleep, and dispatches Aillén. He reveals his identity to the court, and the king grants Fionn his rightful position as leader of the Fianna. Goll steps down, and engages in a truce with his enemy.

'''''The Melody Haunts My Reverie''''' is a 1965 [[screen printing|screen print]] by [[Roy Lichtenstein]], referencing Mitchell Parish's 1929 lyrics for the 1927 song "[[Stardust (song)|Stardust]]" by [[Hoagy Carmichael]], and possibly rooted in the artist's love of jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artsjournal.com/rifftides/2011/12/correspondence-on-hoagy.html| title = Correspondence: On Hoagy|publisher =ArtsJournal|author=Doug Ramsey|date=December 28, 2011| accessdate = 28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/23/roy-lichtenstein-heresy-to-visionary| title = Roy Lichtenstein: from heresy to visionary|publisher =[[guardian.co.uk]]|author=Sarah Churchwell|date=23 February 2013| accessdate = 28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The print was issued under the title ''Reverie''.&lt;ref name=MomaReverie /&gt;

The work was created as part of the portfolio, ''11 Pop Artists'', published by Original Editions in New York City, and printed at Knickerbocker Machine &amp; Foundry Inc., also in New York.&lt;ref name="MomaReverie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roy Lichtenstein, ''Reverie'' from ''11 Pop Artists''|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/65784|website=Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete portfolio consists of 33 prints by 11 artists and was issued in an edition of 200.  Other works by Lichtenstein in the portfolio are ''Sweet Dreams, Baby!'', 1965 and ''Moonscape'', 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Various Artists, ''11 Pop Artists'', 1966|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/65769|website=Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An impression of ''The Melody Haunts My Reverie'' sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2016 for $137,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/prints-n09496/lot.26.html|title=Roy Lichtenstein (b. 1923) ''The Melody Haunts My Reverie'', from ''11 Pop Artists, Volume II'' (Bianchini 10; Corlett 38)|publisher=Sotheby's|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman in the image, holding a microphone, was likened to modern character of [[Betty Draper]] from ''[[Mad Men]]''.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; The print was described as being among those that "don't lower art to the level of the comic strip but raise the comic strip to the level of high art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-10-01/features/1997274133_1_roy-lichtenstein-warhol-high-art| title = He raised comics to high art Appreciation: A shy man, Roy Lichtenstein paid homage to the art of the past with his exuberant works.|publisher =''[[Baltimore Sun]]''|author=John Dorsey|date=October 1, 1997| accessdate = 28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tough Call''''' – also known as '''''Game Called Because of Rain''''', '''''Bottom of the Sixth''''', or '''''The Three Umpires''''' – is a 1948 painting by American artist [[Norman Rockwell]], painted for the April 23, 1949, cover of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=center&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rockwell-center.org/essays-illustration/game-called-because-of-rain/ |title=Game Called Because of Rain |first=Corry |last=Kazenberg |website=Rockwell Center |date=August 13, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original painting is in the collection of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportscollectorsdigest.com/norman-rockwell-baseball-memories/ |title=Edgerton shares Norman Rockwell baseball memories |first=Paul |last=Post |website=Sports Collectors Digest |date=October 12, 2016 |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10890174/rockwell_painting_hof/ |title=All in the POST STRIDE |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=June 8, 1949 |accessdate=May 10, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered the best known of Rockwell's baseball-themed works,&lt;ref name=gerlach/&gt; and appears in at least ten Rockwell commentary books.&lt;ref name=best&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.best-norman-rockwell-art.com/norman-rockwell-saturday-evening-post-cover-1949-04-23-game-called-because-of-rain-three-umpires.html |title=''Game Called Because of Rain'' or ''Three Umpires'' by Norman Rockwell |website=Best Norman Rockwell Art |accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is set at a [[baseball park|ballpark]], where a group of three [[Umpire (baseball)|baseball umpire]]s is looking skyward, as rain is starting to fall. Behind them is a scoreboard showing the game to be in the bottom of the 6th inning, with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] leading the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] by a score of 1–0. Also shown is a Brooklyn [[Coach (baseball)|coach]] or [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] in conversation with his Pittsburgh counterpart.

==Creation==
During the {{mlby|1948}} season, Rockwell visited [[Ebbets Field]], home ballpark of the Dodgers, with a photographer.  The photographer took pictures of the umpires, some players, and the ballpark, which Rockwell used for reference in painting a ''Post'' cover image that he completed in [[California]] that winter. While in California, Rockwell also visited [[Ralph Kiner]], to view his Pirates uniform for additional reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10932109/kinerisms_liven_dull_moments/ |title=Kiner-isms liven dull moments |first=Stan |last=Isaacs |author-link=Stan Isaacs |newspaper=[[Asbury Park Press]] |location=[[Asbury Park, New Jersey]] |date=June 29, 1985 |accessdate=May 11, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Pittsburgh fielders are visible in the distance. While lacking reference photographs, they are identified, standing from left to right, as;&lt;ref name=gerlach&gt;{{cite journal |first=Larry R. |last=Gerlach |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |date=June 13, 2014 |title=Norman Rockwell and Baseball: Images of the National Pastime |url=https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/university-of-nebraska-press/norman-rockwell-and-baseball-images-of-the-national-pastime-9CYZXeCJ5p |url-access=limited |journal=NINE: A Journal of Baseball History and Culture |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=41–63 |issn=1534-1844 |access-date=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* second baseman [[Danny Murtaugh]], with arms akimbo
* center fielder [[Johnny Hopp]]
* right fielder [[Dixie Walker]]

On the scoreboard, part of the Brooklyn batting order can be seen, and number 20 is listed as being [[at bat]], while the [[Box score (baseball)#Line score|line score]] shows just a single run in the game, scored by Pittsburgh in the top of the 2nd inning.

Not all details of the painting match actual game events of September 14, such as;
* Pittsburgh did not have a 1–0 lead in either game of the doubleheader
* Johnny Hopp played first base in both games
* no Brooklyn player wearing number 20 played that day

==Reception==
The cover image was well received by the public.&lt;ref name=center/&gt; It has been the subject of confusion, however, and it caused some controversy between Rockwell and the ''Post''.

The source of confusion is the depiction of Sukeforth and Meyer, and the score, which has Pittsburgh leading. If the game is ended by the umpires due to rain, Pittsburgh will win, given that they have the lead with five innings already completed. If so, why does Sukeforth (Brooklyn coach) look happy, while Meyer (Pittsburgh manager) appears unhappy?&lt;ref name=center/&gt;&lt;ref name=gerlach/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10892025/rockwell_bottom_of_the_sixth/ |title=Kids, don't try this at home |first=Stan |last=Hochman |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] |date=May 10, 1991 |accessdate=May 11, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Post'' provided an explanation for their readers;
:In the picture, Clyde Sukeforth, a Brooklyn coach, could well be saying, ‘You may be all wet, but it ain’t raining a drop!’ The huddled Pittsburgher—Bill Meyer, Pirate manager—is doubtless retorting, ‘For the love of Abner Doubleday, how can we play ball in this cloudburst?'&lt;ref name=center/&gt;
[[File:Turks&amp;Caicos-ThreeUmpires.png|thumb|right|bottom|1982 postage stamp]]
Other explanations are also possible; since the manually operated scoreboard at Ebbets Field was only updated after each team had batted, it's possible that Brooklyn is actually leading (due to scoring two or more runs in the bottom of the 6th inning), yet the score hasn't been updated yet.&lt;ref name=gerlach/&gt; Ultimately, the painting is open to interpretation as "a fictional creation intended to do nothing other than elicit emotions
of the moment, leaving the viewer to extrapolate various scenarios."&lt;ref name=gerlach/&gt;

The source of controversy was changes the ''Post'' made to the image, without Rockwell's consent.&lt;ref name=center/&gt;&lt;ref name=gerlach/&gt;&lt;ref name=best/&gt; The ''Post'' used an artist to adjust illustrations prior to publication; for example, to remove brand names. That artist adjusted Rockwell's original image to lighten the sky, and also darken the Pirates' uniforms. This upset Rockwell, who complained that the ''Post'' "had the piece of sky added when I still feel it was better as I conceived and painted it"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collection.nrm.org/search.do?id=564091&amp;db=object&amp;view=full |title=Curtis Publishing Co 1949: Saturday Evening Post correspondence |website=Norman Rockwell Museum |accessdate=May 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a letter to their art editor. After a total of four Rockwell paintings were adjusted by the ''Post'' in 1948 and 1949, Rockwell's objections resulted in the ''Post'' changing its policy.

The '''Tree of Jesse''' is a depiction in art of the ancestors of Christ, shown in a tree which rises from [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]], the father of King David and is the original use of the [[family tree]] as a schematic representation of a genealogy.  It originates in a passage in the biblical [[Book of Isaiah]] which describes metaphorically the descent of the [[Messiah]], and is accepted by Christians as referring to [[Jesus]].  The various figures depicted in the lineage of Jesus are drawn from those names listed in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]].

The subject is often seen in [[Christian art]], particularly in that of the [[Medieval art|Medieval]] period. The earliest example dates from the 11th century and in an [[illuminated manuscript]].  There are many examples in Medieval psalters, because of the relation to King David, son of Jesse, and writer of the [[Psalms]]. Other examples are in [[stained glass]] windows, stone carvings around the portals of medieval cathedrals and painting on walls and ceilings.  The Tree of Jesse also appears in smaller art forms such as embroideries and ivories.

==Origins==
Depictions of the Jesse Tree are based on a passage from the [[Book of Isaiah]].  
{{quote|"And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots" ([[King James Version]]).}}

From the Latin [[Vulgate]] Bible used in the Middle Ages:
{{quote|''et egredietur virga de radice Iesse et flos de radice eius ascendet'' ({{bibleref|Isaiah|11:1|VULGATE}}). }}

''Flos'', pl ''flores'' is Latin for flower. ''Virga'' is a "green twig", "rod" or "broom", as well as a convenient near-pun with ''Virgo'' or Virgin, which undoubtedly influenced the development of the image. Thus Jesus is the ''Virga Jesse'' or "stem of Jesse".

In the [[New Testament]] the lineage of Jesus is traced by two of the [[Gospel]] writers, [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]] in descending order, and [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] in ascending order. [[Gospel of Luke|Luke's Gospel's]] description in chapter 3 begins with Jesus himself and is traced  all the way back, via [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] to [[David]] and then on to "[[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], which was ''[the son]'' of God.". ({{bibleref|Luke|3:23-38|9}}) [[Matthew's Gospel]] opens with the words: "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham." ({{bibleref|Matthew|1:1|9}}) With this beginning, Matthew shows the Abrahamic and royal descent, passing through [[David]], but then through [[Solomon]].

See [[Genealogy of Jesus]] for more explanation of the differences, but both lineages permit the interpretation that Jesus is the "stem of Jesse" by his descent from Jesse's son, [[David]].

==Use==
Pictorial representations of the ''Jesse Tree'' show a symbolic tree or vine with spreading branches to represent the genealogy in accordance with [[Isaiah]]'s prophecy. The 12th-century monk [[Hervé de Bourg-Dieu|Hervaeus]] expressed the medieval understanding of the image, based on the [[Vulgate]] text: "The patriarch Jesse belonged to the royal family, that is why the root of Jesse signifies the lineage of kings. As to the rod, it symbolises Mary as the flower symbolises Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;[[Émile Mâle]], ''The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'', p 165-8, English trans of 3rd edn, 1913, Collins, London (and many other editions)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the medieval period, when heredity was all-important, much greater emphasis than today was placed on the actual royal descent of Jesus, especially by royalty and the nobility, including those who had joined the clergy. Between them, these groups were responsible for much of the patronage of the arts.

During the Medieval era the symbol of the tree as an expression of lineage was adopted by the nobility and has passed into common usage initially in the form of the [[family tree]] and later as a mode of expressing any line of descent. The form is widely used as a table in such disciplines as [[biology]]. It is also used to show lines of responsibility in personnel structures such as government departments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tree structure]], [[Root directory]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints==

===The Rod and Root of Jesse===

When the angel [[Angel Moroni|Moroni]] spoke to [[Joseph Smith]], he cited Old Testament passages telling of significant figures who would be involved with Christ's millennial reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.40?lang=eng|title=Joseph Smith—History 1|author=|date=|website=www.lds.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As prophesied in Isaiah, it appears that two persons are spoken of, a "rod" and a "root" &amp;ndash; the rod being a leader "on whom there is laid much power," the root being a person with special priesthood keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/11.1?lang=eng|title=Scriptures - LDS.org|author=|date=|website=www.lds.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/113.3-6?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 113|author=|date=|website=www.lds.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These leaders are believed by some to be two forerunners, spoken of in rabbinic literature, one from Joseph and one from Judah (''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 11:1411).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Messiah ben Joseph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Messiah in Judaism|''Messiah ben David'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rod of Jesse has usually been identified with the latter-day prophet Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibrationdata.com/Joseph_Smith_Rod.htm|title=Joseph Smith Jr., Prophet, Seer, Revelator, Rod of the Stem of Jesse|author=|date=|website=www.vibrationdata.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1989/01/prophecies-in-the-bible-about-joseph-smith?lang=eng|title=Prophecies in the Bible about Joseph Smith - ensign|author=|date=|website=www.lds.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of depiction==

[[File:Vratislav.jpg|thumb|The lower half of this page from the ''[[Vyšehrad Codex]]'' shows the earliest known depiction of a Tree of Jesse]] 
[[File:12th-century painters - The Tree of Jesse - WGA15728.jpg|thumb|The Jesse Tree in the [[Lambeth Psalter]], unknown English miniaturist, (1140s). Many characteristics of later representations are fully developed.]]

The ''Jesse Tree'' has been depicted in almost every medium of Christian art. In particular, it is the subject of many [[stained glass]] windows and [[illuminated manuscript]]s. It is also found in wall [[painting]]s, architectural carvings, funerary monuments, floor tiles and [[embroidery]].  Generally only a few of the most well known individuals, like Kings David and Solomon, are represented on Jesse Trees, rather than an attempt to display the entire lineage.

The first representations of the passage in Isaiah, from about 1000 AD in the West, show a "shoot" in the form of a straight stem or a flowering branch held in the hand most often by the Virgin, or by Jesus when held by Mary, by the prophet Isaiah or by an ancestor figure. The shoot as an attribute acted as a reminder of the prophecy, see also the tradition, apparently older, of the ''Golden Rose'' given by the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06629a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Golden Rose |work=Newadvent.org |date=1909-09-01 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Byzantine world, the Tree figures only as a normal-looking tree in the background of some Nativity scenes, also a reminder to the viewer.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'',1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p15-22 &amp; figs 17-42, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, the Tree was always far more common in Northern Europe, where it may have [[Tree of Jesse#The Vysehrad Codex and Lambeth Palace Bible|originated]], than Italy.

There exist also other forms of representation of the [[Genealogy of Jesus]] which do not employ the ''Jesse Tree'', the most famous being that painted in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|Sistine Chapel]] by [[Michelangelo]].

'''The typical form of the image'''

The most typical form which the ''Jesse Tree'' takes is to show the figure of [[Jesse]], often larger than all the rest, reclining or sleeping (perhaps by analogy to Adam when his rib was taken) at the foot of the pictorial space. From his side or his navel springs the trunk of a tree or vine which ascends, branching to either side. On the branches, usually surrounded by formally scrolling tendrils of foliage, are figures representing the ancestors of Christ. The trunk generally ascends vertically to Mary and then Christ at the top.

The number of figures depicted varies greatly, depending on the amount of room available for the design. As a maximum, if the longer ancestry from Luke is used, there are 43 generations between Jesse and Jesus. The identity of the figures also varies, and may not be specified, but [[Solomon]] and [[David]] are usually included, and often all shown wear crowns. Most Jesse Trees include Mary immediately beneath the figure of Jesus (or, in the Gothic period, show a Virgin and Child), emphasising that she was the means by which the ''shoot of Jesse'' was born. See for example, Sermon 24 of [[St Leo the Great]]: "In which rod, no doubt the blessed Virgin Mary is predicted, who sprung from the stock of Jesse and David and fecundated by the Holy Ghost, brought forth a new flower of human flesh, becoming a virgin-mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/360324.htm |title=CHURCH FATHERS: Sermon 24 (Leo the Great) |work=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Saint Joseph]] is rarely shown, although unlike Mary he is a link in the Gospel genealogies. It was believed in the Middle Ages that the [[Davidic line|House of David]] could only marry within itself, and that she was independently descended from Jesse. Sometimes Jesus and other figures are shown in the cups of flowers, as the fruit or blossom of the Tree.&lt;ref name="EM"/&gt;
 
The Jesse Tree was the only prophecy in the Old Testament to be so literally and frequently illustrated, and so came also to stand for the Prophets, and their foretelling of Christ, in general. Both the St-Denis and Chartres windows include columns of prophets, as do many depictions. Often they carry [[Banderole (pennant)|banderoles]] with a quotation from their writings, and they may point to Christ, as the foretold Messiah.&lt;ref name="EM"/&gt;  The inclusion of kings and prophets was also an assertion of the inclusion and relevance in the biblical canon of books that some groups had rejected in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 214-215&lt;/ref&gt;

While particularly popular in the [[Medieval era]], there were also many depictions of the ''Jesse Tree'' in [[Gothic Revival]] art of the 19th century. The 20th century has also produced a number of fine examples.

==Illuminated manuscripts==

===The Vysehrad Codex and Lambeth Palace Bible===

The earliest known representation of the ''Jesse Tree'' can be firmly dated to 1086 and is in the ''[[Vyšehrad Codex]]'', the Coronation Gospels of [[Vratislav II]], the first monarch of [[Bohemia]], which was previously a dukedom.&lt;ref name=JAHW&gt;{{cite web |author=Jean Anne Hayes Williams |title=The Earliest Dated Tree of Jesse File: Thematically reconsidered |url=http://www.fsu.edu/~arh/events/athanor/athxviii/AthanorXVIII_williams.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Fsu.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125034845/http://www.fsu.edu/~arh/events/athanor/athxviii/AthanorXVIII_williams.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper analysing this image, J.A. Hayes Williams points out that the iconography employed is very different from that usually found in such images, which she argues relates to an assertion of the rightful kingship of the royal patron. The page showing the ''Jesse Tree'' is accompanied by a number of other [[Manuscript illumination|illuminated]] pages of which four depict the [[Ancestors of Christ]]. The ''Jesse Tree'' has not been used to support a number of figures, as is usual. Instead, the passage from Isaiah has been depicted in a very literal way. In the picture, the prophet [[Isaiah]] approaches [[Jesse]] from beneath whose feet is springing a tree, and wraps around him a banner with words upon it which translate literally as:- "A little rod from Jesse gives rise to a splendid flower", following the language of the Vulgate. Instead of the ancestors seen in later depictions, seven doves (with [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]es) perch in the branches. These, in a motif from [[Byzantine art]], represent the [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] as described by the [[Apostle Paul]].&lt;ref name= JAHW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Romans]], Chapter 12: verses 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;
Williams goes on to compare it with two other famous images, the ''Tree of Jesse'' window at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the ''[[Lambeth Bible]]'' in England.&lt;ref name= JAHW /&gt;

Williams says:- 
{{quote|"While depictions of the ''Jesse Tree'' originated in Bohemia, the concept became widely popular throughout Europe and the British Isles. Within sixty years the composition had exploded and expanded, with rearranged original elements and new ones added."&lt;ref name= JAHW /&gt;}}

However this claim of Bohemian origin may be somewhat overstated, as there is an incipient version in an Anglo-Norman manuscript of similar date to the Vysehrad Codex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reginald Dodwell|Dodwell, C.R.]]; ''The Pictorial arts of the West, 800-1200'', pp. 193–4, 1993, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-06493-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first decades of the 12th century, the early [[Cistercian]] illuminators of [[Cîteaux Abbey]] played an important part in the development of the image of the Tree of Jesse, which was used to counter renewed tendencies to deny the humanity of Mary, which culminated in [[Catharism]].  However, as Bernard of Clairvaux, strongly hostile to imagery, increased in influence in the order, their use of imagery ceased.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, pp. 211–215&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Lambeth Bible'' is dated between 1140 and 1150. The ''Jesse Tree'' illustration comes at the start of Isaiah and differs greatly from the earlier one, having much more the form that is familiar from both manuscript and stained glass versions. In it, Jesse lies at the border of the page with the tree springing from his side. The branches of the tree are depicted as highly formalised circular tendrils which enclose six pairs or trios of figures. At the centre, tall and highly stylised in the same manner as 12th-century columnar statues, stands a full length [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] from whose head spring tendrils which enclose a bust of her Son, [[Jesus]]. He is encircled by the seven doves, with outspread wings; this became the usual depiction of them. Four Prophets with scrolls occupy medallions in the corners.

[[File:JesseTree.jpg|thumb|left|''Capuchin's Bible'', c. 1180, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris]]

=== Other illuminated manuscripts ===
The Tree appears in several other Romanesque Bibles apart from the ''Lambeth Bible'', usually as a large [[historiated initial]] at the start of either Isaiah or Matthew. The [[Saint-Bénigne Bible]] is perhaps the earliest appearance, with just Jesse and the doves of the "Seven Gifts". The [[Capuchin's Bible]] (see picture) is a later example, c. 1180, in which a Jesse Tree forms the L of ''Liber generationis..'' at the start of the [[Gospel of Matthew]].&lt;ref&gt;Dijon, Public Library, Ms 12-15, and BnF, Paris Ms. lat 16746, f 7v, respectively. Both illustrated in Cahn, Walter, Romanesque Bible Illumination, Cornell UP, 1982, {{ISBN|0-8014-1446-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tree is also often found in [[Psalter]]s, especially English manuscripts, illustrating the B initial of ''[[Beatus Vir]]'', the beginning of [[Psalm 1]], which often occupies a whole page. Sometimes this is the only fully illuminated page, and if it is historiated (i.e. contains a pictured scene) the Tree is the usual subject. When not historiated, the initial had for about two hundred years been most often made up of, or filled with, spiraling plant tendrils, often with animals or men caught up in them, so the development to the tree was a relatively easy step. Indeed, although Jesse's son David was believed to be the author of the [[Psalm]]s, it has been suggested that the tradition of using a Jesse Tree here arose largely because it was an imposing design that worked well filling a large B shape.

An early example is the late 12th-century [[Huntingfield Psalter]], and an especially splendid one from the early 14th century is the [[Gorleston Psalter]] in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierpoint Morgan Library M.43, f33v (Huntingfield Psalter); BL Add. Ms 49622 f8. Both illustrated in Otto Pächt, ''Book Illumination in the Middle Ages'' (trans fr German), 1986, Harvey Miller Publishers, London, {{ISBN|0-19-921060-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these and most other examples Jesse lies at the bottom of the B, and the Virgin is no larger than other figures. In the recently re-discovered [[Macclesfield Psalter]] of about 1320 another very elaborate Tree&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Fitzwilliam Museum : Photo Gallery | accessdate = 2009-01-03 | url = http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/gallery/macclesfield/gallery/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; grows beyond the B, sending branches round the sides and bottom of the text. In the Psalter and Hours of [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John, Duke of Bedford]] (British Library Ms Add 42131), of about 1420-23, the Tree frames the bottom and both sides of the page, while the initial B at the top of the page contains the ''anointing of King David''.

Some continental manuscripts give the scene a whole page with no initial.  "Various selections" of the elements appear, and prophets and sometimes even the [[Cumaean Sybil]] (Ingeburg Psalter c. 1210) stand in the corners or to the side. A [[Lectionary]] of before 1164 from Cologne unusually shows Jesse dead in a tomb or coffin, from which the tree grows.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;  Romanesque depictions usually show Jesse asleep on open ground or on a simple couch - all that can be told from the Bible about his circumstances is that he had sheep, which David herded. By the Gothic period small Trees are found in many types of manuscript, and Jesse is often more comfortably accommodated in a large bed.

Stained glass was a popular medium used in many eras to illuminate the sacred mysteries of the Old Covenant's relationship with the genealogy of Christ in the New Covenant.

====Jesse Tree at Chartres Cathedral====
Among the famous stained glass windows of [[Chartres Cathedral]] in Northern France is the ''Jesse Tree'' window, of 1140-50, the far right of three windows above the ''Royal Portal'' and beneath the western [[rose window]]. It derives from the oldest known (and almost certainly the original) complex form of the ''Jesse Tree'', with the tree rising from a sleeping Jesse, a window placed in the [[Saint-Denis Basilica]] by [[Abbot Suger]] in about 1140, which is now heavily restored.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vrcoll.fa.pitt.edu/medart/menufrance/sdenis/windows/Sdenwind-Jesse.html |title=Medieval Art and Architecture |work=Vrcoll.fa.pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chartres window comprises eight square central panels, with seven rectangular ones on either side, separated, as is usual in 12th-century windows with no stone tracery, by heavy iron armatures. In the lowest central panel reclines the figure of Jesse, with the tree rising from his middle. In each of the seven sections it branches out into a regular pattern of scrolling branches, each bearing a bunch of leaves that take on the heraldic form of the [[Fleur de Lys]], very common in French stained glass. Central to each panel is a figure:- [[David]], [[Solomon]], two more crowned figures, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)]] and, surrounded by the doves bearing the gifts of the Spirit, a majestic figure of [[Christ]], larger than the rest. In each of the narrower panels, edged by richly patterned borders, are the figures of fourteen [[prophet]]s bearing scrolls.

Apart from the theological importance the design is one of the few subjects that works very well as a unified composition for one of the tall vertical spaces of the windows of Romanesque and Gothic churches; most other tall windows were divided into separate scenes. Saint-Denis and Chartres provided a model for many other such windows, notably the Jesse Tree windows of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], c. 1200, probably also made in France, and St. Kunibert, [[Cologne]] of 1220-35.

====York Minster, England====
A small and much fragmented panel from a ''Jesse Tree'' window, at [[York Minster]] is thought to be the oldest surviving stained glass in England, dating from perhaps as early as 1150.&lt;ref name= Brown /&gt;

====Canterbury Cathedral, England====
This window, dating from c. 1200, had an unfortunate history. Having survived the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], the depredations of the [[Puritans]] and the ravages of time, it was dismantled and removed, with many other original windows during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and replaced by a copy. Fortunately two surviving panels were later returned and are in place in the ''Corona Chapel''&lt;ref&gt;The Corona Chapel was built to hold the relic of the top of Becket's head, severed at the time of his assassination.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the eastern end of the building.

====Wells Cathedral====
[[Wells Cathedral]] has a rare example of an intact 14th-century Jesse Tree window which survived the iconoclasm of the 17th-century and the losses of World War II.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;Wells Cathedral website, [http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/history/historical-highlights/the-jesse-window/ Jesse Tree window] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810060121/http://www.wellscathedral.org.uk/history/historical-highlights/the-jesse-window/ |date=2011-08-10 }}, (retrieved 21-11-2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The window is located high up in the eastern end of the choir. The colours of this window are red, yellow, green, white and brown, with very little blue. The window is wide for its height, having seven lights, and being topped by tracery. Consequently, the tendrils of the Tree spread out sideways and the central panel has only three figures: the reclining Jesse at the bottom; the Blessed Virgin holding the Christ Child in her arms and above, the crucified Christ. There are fourteen more figures in the window, identifiable in some cases by their attributes, such as David's harp and Solomon's model of the Temple of Jerusalem. As well as the tendrils, the figures are framed by typical 14th-century canopies and bases displaying the name of each person.  The window is currently undergoing extensive conservation.&lt;ref name= Wells/&gt;

====St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury====

[[St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury|St Mary's Church]] in Shrewsbury, England contains an enormous 14th-century depiction of the Jesse Tree. By tradition, it was made for the [[Franciscan]] church in Shrewsbury, moved to [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury|St Chad's Church]] after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and then to St Mary's in 1792. Although it was much [[Victorian restoration|restored]] in 1858 by David and Charles Evans, much of the original glass remains and is dated between 1327 and 1353.

'''Other examples''' are at the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris (1247), the [[Cathédrale St-Julien du Mans|Cathedral of Le Mans]] (13th century) and [[Evreux Cathedral]] in Normandy (15th century).

===Renaissance and classical===

'''Dorchester Abbey, Dorchester, Oxfordshire'''

The north window in the sanctuary is unique as it combines tracery and sculpture with stained glass in a single theme. It shows the ascent of [[Christ]] from [[Jesse]]. The tree with five undulating branches carved in foliage rises from the sculptured recumbent form of Jesse. Much of the 14th-century glass is fragmentary, but still in its original tracery.

[[File:Hildesheim-st.Michael-Holzdecke-Maria-Hildesia.jpg|thumb|The [[Virgin Mary]] from the ceiling of St Michael's, Hildesheim]]

The large flat wooden ceiling in the [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|Church of St Michael, Hildesheim]] of c. 1200 has the space to include a complex iconographic scheme based around the tree, which encompasses [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and [[Eve]], the Prophets and the [[Four Evangelists]].{{small|(whole ceiling [[#References|illustrated below]])}} Panel paintings are rare, but a German example of c. 1470 ([[Darmstadt]]) shows a Tree on the outside of the wings of a [[triptych]].&lt;ref name="S"/&gt; A large Polish baroque oil by Michael Willmann (1678, Kościół Wniebowzięcia NMP, Krzeszów) shows a typically crowded Baroque apotheosis scene, with thin tendrils lacing round the figures, but not supporting them.

The nave ceiling of [[Ely Cathedral]] was painted with a scheme rather similar to Hildesheim by the gentleman artist [[Henry Styleman Le Strange]], who began in 1858. After his death (leaving no detailed drawings for the remainder) in 1862, it was completed by another amateur artist, [[Thomas Gambier Parry]] using his special [[Gambier Parry process]] with [[lavender]] oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathedral.ely.anglican.org/pdf/THE_NAVE_CEILING.pdf |title=On the ceiling from Ely Cathedral|work=Cathedral.ely.anglican.org|accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural stone-carving==
[[File:Worms Dom st peter tympanum 006.JPG|thumb|Relief of Tree of Jesse, [[Worms Cathedral|Cathedral St. Peter]], Worms, Germany]]

Relatively small-scale Jesse Trees feature in prominent positions in many medieval churches, most notably under a statue of St James on the central column of the famous main entrance (the ''Portico de la Gloria'' of 1168-88) of the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]]. Another masterpiece of Romanesque stone-carving, the cloister of the [[Monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos]], has a Tree on a flat panel carved in [[relief]]. Several 13th-century French cathedrals have Trees in the arches of doorways: [[Notre-Dame of Laon]], [[Amiens Cathedral]], and Chartres (central arch, North portal - as well as the window). However these mostly show the ancestors in [[archivolt]]s on both sides of an arch, and although they are connected by tendrils, the coherence of the image is rather lost. Another popular way of showing the ancestry of Christ was to have a row or gallery of statues of the [[Kings of Judah]] (part of the ancestral line from Jesse) on the facade, as at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], but these too go beyond the image of the Tree.&lt;ref name="EM"/&gt; In a shorthand version, a statue of the Virgin and Child on an entrance trumeau to [[Freiburg]] [[Minster (church)|Minster]] is supported by a Jesse sleeping on a chair (c. 1300).&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;

'''Church of St Cuthbert, Wells, Somerset.'''
[[Church of St Cuthbert, Wells|St Cuthbert's Church]] formerly held a sculpted Tree of Jesse forming the [[reredos]] in its south transept, its components arranged around the east window. The contract survives, and shows that it was made in 1470 by John Stowell. It was destroyed during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] or [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], but the outline of the figure of Jesse is still visible, and many fragments of sculpture also survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nikolaus |last=Pevsner |authorlink=Nikolaus Pevsner |title=North Somerset and Bristol |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]] |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |year=1958 |isbn=0-14-071013-2 |pages=324–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood carving==
'''Priory Church of St Mary, Abergavenny, Wales.'''
The [[Priory Church of St Mary, Abergavenny]], formerly held a 15th-century composition, described  by [[Thomas Churchyard]] in 1587 as "a most famous worke in maner of a genealogie of Kings, called the roote of Jesse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Churchyard |authorlink=Thomas Churchyard |title=The Worthines of Wales |place=London |year=1587 |page=[F4]r–v |url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t3fx78365;view=1up;seq=57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this date it had been destroyed during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], but what survives is the larger than life-sized recumbent figure of Jesse himself, carved from a single piece of oak. It has been described by [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]] as "the most impressive wood carving to have escaped the bonfires of the Reformation in Wales";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Graham-Dixon |authorlink=Andrew Graham-Dixon |title=A History of British Art |place=London |publisher=BBC |year=1996 |ISBN=0-563-37044-0 |pages=24–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Phillip Lindley as "without doubt one of the finest pieces of fifteenth-century wood sculpture remaining in England or Wales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Deacon |authorlink1=Richard Deacon (sculptor) |first2=Phillip |last2=Lindley |title=Image and Idol: medieval sculpture |publisher=Tate |place=London |year=2001 |isbn=1-85437-400-1 |pages=50–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear what form the rest of the tree originally took, but in 2016 a new stained-glass Jesse window designed by Helen Whittaker was installed in the church, incorporating the wooden Jesse at its foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stmarysprioryabergavenny.wordpress.com/2016/06/16/the-jesse-window-explained/ |title=The Jesse Window explained |publisher=St Mary's Priory, Abergavenny |date=16 June 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stainedglasswales.wordpress.com/2016/06/23/the-jesse-window-explained/ |first=Martin |last=Crampin |title=The Jesse Window explained |work=Stained glass from Welsh churches |date=23 June 2016 |accessdate=9 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Tree of Jesse is also referenced in the medieval series of lyrical poems known as the [[Cantigas de Santa Maria]], written during the reign of [[Alfonso X]] in the thirteenth century. Cantiga 20, "Virga de Jesse" makes use of the Tree of Jesse in the refrain of the song, further demonstrating its influence on medieval culture and thought:
::Virga de Jésse
::quen te soubésse
::loar como mereces
::e sen ouvésse per
::que dissésse quanto
::por nós padeces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cantigasdesantamaria.com/csm/20|title=Cantigas de Santa Maria for Singers|first=Andrew|last=Casson|date=|website=Cantigas de Santa Maria for Singers|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol of the Virgin Mary as a rose flowering from the Tree of Jesse forms the central image of the 15th-century German hymn, ''[[Es ist ein Ros entsprungen]]'', commonly sung to a melody by [[Michael Praetorius]]. Various translations exist of this popular hymn, including [[Theodore Baker]]'s "Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming"(1894) and "A Spotless Rose" by [[Catherine Winkworth]].

==Modern use==
{{further|Christmas tree#Chrismon tree}}
The [[Christmas Tree]], and the [[Advent calendar]], have been adapted in recent years by some modern [[Christian]]s, who may use the term "Jesse Tree", although the tree does not usually show Jesse or the Ancestors of Christ, and so may have little or no relation to the traditional Tree of Jesse.  This form is a poster or a real tree in the church or home, which over the course of [[Advent]] is decorated with symbols to represent stories leading up to the [[Nativity of Christ|Christmas story]], for the benefit of children.  The symbols are simple, for example a burning bush for [[Moses]] and a ram for [[Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crivoice.org/jesse.html|title=The Jesse Tree|work=crivoice.org|publisher=the Voice|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
