In the [[Roman funerals and burial|burial practices of ancient Rome]] and [[Roman funerary art]], marble and limestone [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] elaborately carved in [[relief]] were characteristic of elite [[inhumation]] burials from the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zahra Newby]]. "Myth and Death: Roman Mythological Sarcophagi" in ''A Companion to Greek Mythology'' (Blackwell, 2011), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 10,000 Roman sarcophagi have survived, with fragments possibly representing as many as 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jas Elsner|Jaś Elsner]], introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation: Some New Work on Roman Sarcophagi'' (De Gruyter, 2011), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although  [[classical mythology|mythological scenes]] have been mostly widely studied,&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; sarcophagus [[relief]] has been called the "richest single source of Roman iconography,"&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and may also depict the deceased's occupation or life course, military scenes, and other subject matter. The same workshops produced sarcophagi with Jewish or Christian imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, introduction to ''Life, Death and Representation'', pp. 1, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Early Christian sarcophagi]] produced from the late 3rd century onwards, represent the earliest form of large Christian sculpture, and are important for the study of [[Early Christian art]].

They were mostly made in a few major cities, including Rome and [[Athens]], which exported them to other cities. Elsewhere the [[stela]] gravestone remained more common.  They were always a very expensive form reserved for the elite, and especially so in the relatively few very elaborately carved examples; most were always relatively plain, with inscriptions, or symbols such as garlands.  Sarcophagi divide into a number of styles, by the producing area. "Roman" ones were made to rest against a wall, and one side was left uncarved, while "Attic" and other types were carved on all four sides; but the short sides were generally less elaborately decorated in both types.&lt;ref name="Hennig, 93-94"&gt;Hennig, 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

The time taken to make them encouraged the use of standard subjects, to which inscriptions might be added to personalize them, and  portraits of the deceased were slow to appear.  The sarcophagi offer examples of intricate reliefs that depict scenes often based on [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] or [[mystery religions]] that offered personal salvation, and [[allegory|allegorical]] representations. Roman [[funerary art]] also offers a variety of scenes from everyday life, such as game-playing, hunting, and military endeavors.&lt;ref name="Hennig, 93-94"/&gt;  [[Early Christian art]] quickly adopted the sarcophagus, and they are the most common form of early Christian sculpture, progressing from simple examples with symbols to elaborate fronts, often with small scenes of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] in two rows within an architectural framework. The [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] (c. 359) is of this type, and the earlier [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]] rather simpler. The huge [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina]] are grand Imperial examples.

[[Cremation]] was the predominant means of disposing of remains in the [[Roman Republic]]. Ashes contained in [[cinerary urn]]s and other monumental vessels were placed in tombs. From the 2nd century AD onward, [[inhumation]] became more common, and after the [[Roman Empire]] came under Christian rule, was standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;Glenys Davies, "Before Sarcophagi," in ''Life, Death and Representation,'' p. 20ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]] is a rare example from much earlier.  A sarcophagus, which means "flesh-eater" in Greek, is a stone coffin used for inhumation burials.&lt;ref name="Awan"&gt;{{harvp|Awan|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarcophagi were commissioned not only for the elite of Roman society (mature male citizens),&lt;ref name="Davies_47"&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also for children, entire families, and beloved wives and mothers. The most expensive sarcophagi were made from marble, but other stones, lead, and wood were used as well.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Along with the range in production material, there existed a variety of styles and shapes, depending on where the sarcophagus was produced and whom it was produced for.

==History==

===Before sarcophagi===
Inhumation burial practices and the use of sarcophagi were not always the favored Roman funerary custom. The [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s and Greeks used sarcophagi for centuries before the Romans finally adopted the practice in the second century.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Prior to that period, the dead were usually cremated and placed in marble ash chests or ash altars, or were simply commemorated with a grave altar that was not designed to hold cremated remains. Despite being the main funerary custom during the Roman Republic, ash chests and grave altars virtually disappeared from the market only a century after the advent of the sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often assumed that the popularity for sarcophagi began with the Roman aristocracy and gradually became more accepted by the lower classes.&lt;ref name="Davies_47"/&gt; However, in the past, the most expensive and ostentatious grave altars and ash chests were commissioned more frequently by wealthy freedmen and other members of the emerging middle class than by the Roman elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this fact and the lack of inscriptions on early sarcophagi, there is not enough evidence to make a judgment on whether or not the fashion for sarcophagi began with a specific social class. Surviving evidence does indicate that a great majority of early sarcophagi were used for children. This suggests that the change in burial practice may not have simply stemmed from a change in fashion, but perhaps from altered burial attitudes. It is possible that the decision to begin inhuming bodies occurred because families believed that inhumation was a kinder, and less disturbing burial rite than cremation, thus necessitating a shift in burial monument.&lt;ref name="Davies_47"/&gt;

===Stylistic transition from altars and ash chests to sarcophagi===
Although grave altars and ash chests virtually disappeared from the market in the second century, aspects of their decoration endured in some stylistic elements of sarcophagi. The largest stylistic group of early sarcophagi in the second century is garland sarcophagi, a custom of decoration that was previously used on ash chests and grave altars. Though the premise of the decoration is the same, there are some differences. The garland supports are often human figures instead of the animal heads used previously. In addition, specific mythological scenes fill the field, rather than small birds or other minor scenes. The inscription panel on garland ash altars and chests is also missing on garland sarcophagi. When a sarcophagus did have an inscription, it seemed to be an extra addition and usually ran along the top edge of the chest or between the decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that early garland sarcophagi continued the tradition of grave altars with decorated garlands suggests that the customers and sculptors of sarcophagi had similar approaches to those who purchased and produced grave altars. Both monuments employed a similar collection of stylistic motifs with only subtle shifts in iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Davies|2010|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic sarcophagus production centers===
[[File:Roman - Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus - Walters 2331.jpg|thumbnail|The Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus is a good example of a Metropolitan Roman style sarcophagus with its flat lid, three-sided decoration, and Dionysian scenes from Greek mythology.]]
Sarcophagi production of the ancient Roman Empire involved three main parties: the customer, the sculpting workshop that carved the monument, and the quarry-based workshop that supplied the materials. The distance between these parties was highly variable due to the extensive size of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Russell|2010|pp=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metropolitan Roman, Attic, and Asiatic were the three major regional types of sarcophagi that dominated trade throughout the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Although they were divided into regions, the production of sarcophagi was not as simple as it might appear. For example, Attic workshops were close to [[Mount Pentelikon]], the source of their materials, but were usually very far from their client. The opposite was true for the workshops of Metropolitan Rome, who tended to import large, roughed out sarcophagi from distant quarries in order to complete their commissions. Depending on distance and customer request (some customers might choose to have elements of their sarcophagi left unfinished until a future date, introducing the possibility of further work after the main commission), sarcophagi were in many different stages of production during transport. As a result, it is difficult to develop a standardized model of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Elsner|Huskinson|Russell|2010|pp=125–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metropolitan Rome====
Rome was the primary production center in the western part of the empire. A Metropolitan Roman sarcophagus often took the shape of a low rectangular box with a flat lid. As the sarcophagus was usually placed in a niche or against a wall in a mausoleum, they were usually only decorated on the front and two shorter sides. Many were decorated with carvings of garlands and fruits and leaves, as well as narrative scenes from Greek mythology. Battle and hunting scenes, biographical events from the life of the deceased, portrait busts, the profession of the deceased and abstract designs were also popular.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt;

====Attic====
[[File:Roman - Garland Sarcophagus - Walters 2329.jpg|thumb|Asiatic garland sarcophagus, the predominant type during the reigns of [[Trajan]] and [[Hadrian]] ''([[Walters Art Museum]])'',&lt;ref&gt;Davies, "Before Sarcophagi," in ''Life, Death and Representation,'' pp. 21, 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; dated between 150 and 180, in Dokimeion marble, so probably made in Phrygia and then shipped to Rome. The gable-roof lid exemplifies the garland tradition common on ash altars and chests. It also has several incomplete parts on its four sides, suggesting the work was interrupted or it was needed on short notice.]]
Athens was the main production center for Attic style sarcophagi. These workshops mainly produced sarcophagi for export. They were rectangular in shape and were often decorated on all four sides, unlike the Metropolitan Roman style, with ornamental carvings along the bottom and upper edge of the monument. The lids were also different from the flat metropolitan Roman style and featured a pitched gable roof,&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; or a kline lid, which is carved in the style of couch cushions on which the form of the deceased reclines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strong|Toynbee|1995|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great majority of these sarcophagi also featured mythological subjects, especially the [[Trojan War]], Achilles, and battles with the [[Amazons]].&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt;

====Asia Minor (Asiatic)====
The [[Dokimeion]] workshops in [[Phrygia]] specialized in architecturally formed large-scale Asiatic sarcophagi. Many featured a series of columns joined together by an entablature on all four sides with human figures in the area between the columns. The lids were often made in the gabled-roof design in order to complete the architectural-style sarcophagi so the coffin formed a sort of house or temple for the deceased. Other cities in Asia Minor produced sarcophagi of the garland tradition as well. In general, the sarcophagi were decorated on either three or four sides, depending on whether they were to be displayed on a pedestal in an open-air setting or against the walls inside tombs.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt;

===Myth and meaning on ancient Roman sarcophagi===
A transition from the classical garland and seasonal reliefs with smaller mythological figures to a greater focus on full mythological scenes began with the break up of the classical style in the late second century towards the end of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift led to the development of popular themes and meanings portrayed through mythological scenes and allegories. The most popular mythological scenes on Roman sarcophagi functioned as aids to mourning, visions of life and happiness, and opportunities for self-portrayal for Roman citizens.

Images of [[Meleager]], the hero who slew the [[Calydonian Boar]], being mourned by his lover and hunting companion Atlanta, as well as images of [[Achilles]] mourning [[Patroclus]] were very common on sarcophagi that acted as grieving aids. In both cases, the mythological scenes were akin to mourning practices of ordinary Roman citizens in an effort to reflect their grief and comfort them when they visited the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playful images depicting [[Nereid]]s, Dionysiac triumphs, and love scenes of [[Dionysus]] and [[Ariadne]] were also commonly represented on sarcophagi.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=128–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that these scenes of happiness and love in the face of death and mourning encouraged the living to enjoy life while they could, and reflected the celebration and meals that the mourners would later enjoy in the tomb when they returned to visit the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third century involved the return in popularity of self-representation on Roman sarcophagi.

There were several different ways Roman citizens approached self-representation on sarcophagi. Some sarcophagi had actual representations of the face or full figure of the deceased. In other cases, mythological portraits were used to connect characteristics of the deceased with traits of the hero or heroine portrayed. For example, common mythological portraits of deceased women identified them with women of lauded traits in myth, such as the devoted [[Selene]] or loyal [[Alcestis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=199–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes featuring the figures of Meleager and Achilles expressed bravery and were often produced on sarcophagi holding deceased men.&lt;ref name="Awan"/&gt; Biographical scenes that emphasize the true virtues of Roman citizens were also used to commemorate the deceased. Scholars argue that these biographical scenes as well as the comparisons to mythological characters suggest that self-portrayal on Roman sarcophagi did not exist to celebrate the traits of the deceased, but rather to emphasize favored Roman cultural values&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrate that the family of the deceased were educated members of the elite that could understand difficult mythological allegories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third- and fourth-century sarcophagi===
The breakup of the classical style led to a period in which full mythological reliefs with an increase in the number of figures and an elongation of forms became more popular, as discussed above. The proportion of figures on the reliefs also became increasingly unbalanced, with the main figures taking up the greatest area with smaller figures crowded in the small pockets of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third century, another transition in theme and style of sarcophagi involved the return in popularity of representing mythological and non-mythological portraits of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagery of the four seasons also becomes popular during the third and fourth centuries. With the advent of Christianity in the third century, traditional motifs, like the seasons, remained, and images representing a belief in the afterlife appeared. The change in style brought by Christianity is perhaps most significant, as it signals a change in emphasis on images of retrospection, and introduced images of an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Zanker|Ewald|2012|pp=261–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personalization==
[[Image:Sarcophagus Portonaccio Massimo.jpg|thumb|280px|The [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]]]]
'''Sarcophagi personalization''' is the customization of a [[sarcophagus]] to display the attributes, achievements, or history of the deceased through art and/or [[inscription]]s.

=== Sarcophagus of Lars Pulena ===
The sculpted scene on the front of the coffin shows the deceased in the Underworld between two [[Charuns]] ([[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]] death demons) in which signified that his journey to the afterlife was successful.&lt;ref name=GART&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kleiner |first= Fred S. |title= Gardner's Art Through The Ages |edition= 13th |publisher= [[Thomson Wadsworth]] |year= 2009 |origyear= 2005 |isbn= 0-495-09307-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the lid, Pulena is shown laid across, in a reclining position, resting on his left arm and in front of him, a list of his life’s achievements which were inscribed on an open scroll.&lt;ref name=GART/&gt;

=== Melfi Sarcophagus ===
The Asiatic sarcophagus with kline portrait of a woman also carried an Etruscan influence of sculpting portraiture on the lid.&lt;ref name=GART/&gt; Made of marble, with reliefs on all four sides of the box (a feature in Eastern Sarcophagi production), and sculpted mini statues of [[Greek gods]] and heroes in frames are depicted.  The lid displays a portrait of the woman with [[Cupid]] (right end) and a little dog (in which the paws only remain at the left end).

=== Battle of Romans and barbarians ===
The [[Portonaccio sarcophagus]] is an example of one of a group of about twenty-five late Roman battle sarcophagi, with one exception all apparently dating to 170-210, made in Rome or in some cases [[Athens]].  These derive from [[Hellenistic]] monuments from [[Pergamon]] in [[Asia Minor]] showing Pergamene victories over the [[Gauls]], and were all presumably commissioned for military commanders.  The Portonaccio sarcophagus is the best known and most elaborate of the main [[Antonine]] group, and shows both considerable similarities to the [[Great Ludovisi sarcophagus]], the late outlier from about 250, and a considerable contrast in style and mood.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

The face of the general is unfinished, either because the sculptors awaited a model to work from, or they had produced the work speculatively with no specific commission. The general and his wife are also each shown twice on the lid frieze, together holding each other's hands at the centre, and singly at the ends, again with unfinished faces.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 93&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The unusually large [[Ludovisi Battle sarcophagus]] shows a chaotic battle scene between the Romans and barbarian foes.  At the centre, a young general wears no helmet nor wields any weapon and has emblem of [[Mithras]], the Persian god of light, truth, and victory over death carved into his forehead.  Several scholars have identified him as one of the sons of [[Trajan Decius]],&lt;ref name=GART/&gt; who died of plague.

=== Santa Maria Antiqua Sarcophagus ===
A sarcophagus from the church of [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] with philosopher, [[orant]], and [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament|New]] Testament scenes is [[Early Christian art]] in which displays the story of [[Jonah]] on the left one-third, heads of a praying woman and a seated man reading from a scroll which are unfinished (intended to be portraits of the deceased) in the center, and continuing on, Christ as [[Good Shepherd]], and the baptism of Christ.&lt;ref name=GART/&gt;

{{Western art history}}

The '''art of Europe''', or '''Western art''', encompasses the history of [[visual art]] in [[Europe]]. European [[prehistoric art]] started as mobile [[rock art|rock]] and [[cave painting]] art and was characteristic of the period between the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="Europeart"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oosterbeek|first=Luíz|title=European Prehistoric Art|url=http://www.europreart.net/|work=Europeart|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Written histories of European art often begin with the art of the [[Ancient Middle East]] and the [[Aegean civilisation|Ancient Aegean civilization]]s, dating from the 3rd millennium BC. Parallel with these significant cultures, art of one form or another existed all over Europe, wherever there were people, leaving signs such as carvings, decorated artifacts and huge standing stones. However a consistent pattern of artistic development within Europe becomes clear only with the [[Ancient Greek art|art of Ancient Greece]], adopted and transformed by [[Roman art|Rome]] and carried; with the Empire, across much of Europe, [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boardman (art historian)|Boardman, John]] ed., ''The Oxford History of Classical Art'', pp. 349-369, [[Oxford University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0198143869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the art of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] waxed and waned throughout the next two thousand years, seeming to slip into a distant memory in parts of the [[Medieval art|Medieval]] period, to re-emerge in the [[Renaissance]], suffer a period of what some early art historians viewed as "decay" during the [[Baroque]] period,&lt;ref&gt;[[Banister Fletcher]] excluded nearly all Baroque buildings from his mammoth tome ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''. The publishers eventually rectified this.&lt;/ref&gt; to reappear in a refined form in [[Neo-Classicism]]&lt;ref name=mur&gt;Murray, P. and Murray, L. (1963) ''The Art of the Renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20008-7}}.  "...in 1855 we find, for the first time, the word 'Renaissance' used — by the French historian Michelet — as an adjective to describe a whole period of history and not confined to the rebirth of Latin letters or a classically inspired style in the arts."&lt;/ref&gt; and to be reborn in [[Post-Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, pp. 245–246). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1800s, the Christian church was a major influence upon European art, the commissions of the Church, architectural, painterly and sculptural, providing the major source of work for artists. The history of the Church was very much reflected in the history of art, during this period. In the same period of time there was renewed interest in heroes and heroines, tales of mythological gods and goddesses, great wars, and bizarre creatures which were not connected to religion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of Europe|url=http://www.slam.org/european/intro.html|work=Saint Louis Art Museum|publisher=Slam|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most art of the last 200 years has been produced without reference to religion and often with no particular [[ideology]] at all, but art has often been influenced by political issues, whether reflecting the concerns of patrons or the artist.

European art is arranged into a number of stylistic periods, which, historically, overlap each other as different styles flourished in different areas. Broadly the periods are, [[classical antiquity|Classical]], [[Byzantine]], [[Medieval]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]], [[Modernism|Modern]] and [[Postmodern]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Prehistoric art==
{{main article|Prehistoric_art#Europe}}

European prehistoric art is an important part of the European cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oosterbeek|first=Luíz|title=European Prehistoric Art|url=http://www.europreart.net/prese.htm|work=Europeart|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prehistoric art history is usually divided into four main periods: [[Stone age]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze age]], and [[Iron age]]. Most of the remaining artifacts of this period are small sculptures and cave paintings.

[[File:Venus of Willendorf frontview retouched 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venus of Willendorf]].]]
Much surviving [[prehistoric art]] is small portable sculptures, with a small group of female [[Venus figurines]] such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]] (24,000–22,000 BC) found across central Europe;&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 8-16, 29-31&lt;/ref&gt; the 30&amp;nbsp;cm tall [[Löwenmensch figurine]] of about 30,000 BCE has hardly any pieces that can be related to it.  The [[Swimming Reindeer]] of about 11,000 BCE is one of the finest of a number of [[Magdalenian]] carvings in bone or antler of animals in the [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]], though they are outnumbered by engraved pieces, which are sometimes classified as sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Joachim, "Prehistoric Europe, §II: Palaeolithic 3. Portable art" in [[Oxford Art Online]], accessed August 24, 2012; Sandars, 37-40&lt;/ref&gt; With the beginning of the [[Mesolithic]] in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced,&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 75-80&lt;/ref&gt; and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the [[Gundestrup cauldron]] from the [[European Iron Age]] and the Bronze Age [[Trundholm sun chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 253-257, 183-185&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest European cave art dates back 40,800, and can be found in the [[El Castillo Cave]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kwong|first=Matt|title=Oldest cave-man art in Europe dates back 40,800 years|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/06/14/cave-paintings-europe.html|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cave painting sites include [[Lascaux]], [[Cave of Altamira]], [[Grotte de Cussac]], [[Pech Merle]], [[Cave of Niaux]], [[Chauvet Cave]], [[Font-de-Gaume]], Creswell Crags, Nottinghamshire, England, (Cave etchings and bas-reliefs discovered in 2003), [[Coliboaia cave]] from [[Romania]] (considered the oldest cave painting in central [[Europe]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/06/romanian-cave-may-boast-central.html |title=Romanian Cave May Boast Central Europe's Oldest Cave Art &amp;#124; Science/AAAS &amp;#124; News |publisher=News.sciencemag.org |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Magura,&lt;ref name="Europeart" /&gt; Belogradchik, Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of Prehistoric Europe|last=Gunther|first=Michael|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/timelines/europe/prehistoric.html|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those have survived because of erosion.  One well-known example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi in the Saimaa area of Finland. When Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola first encountered the Magdalenian paintings of the Altamira cave, Cantabria, Spain in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes.  Recent reappraisals and numerous additional discoveries have since demonstrated their authenticity, while at the same time stimulating interest in the artistry of Upper Palaeolithic peoples.  Cave paintings, undertaken with only the most rudimentary tools, can also furnish valuable insight into the culture and beliefs of that era.

The [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]] represents a very different style, with the human figure the main focus, often seen in large groups, with battles, dancing and hunting all represented, as well as other activities and details such as clothing.  The figures are generally rather sketchily depicted in thin paint, with the relationships between the groups of humans and animals more carefully depicted than individual figures. Other less numerous groups of rock art, many engraved rather than painted, show similar characteristics. The Iberian examples are believed to date from a long period perhaps covering the Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic and early Neolithic.

Prehistoric [[Celtic art]] comes from much of [[Iron Age Europe]] and survives mainly in the form of high-status metalwork skillfully decorated with complex, elegant and mostly abstract designs, often using curving and spiral forms. There are human heads and some fully represented animals, but full-length human figures at any size are so rare that their absence may represent a religious taboo.  As the Romans conquered Celtic territories, it almost entirely vanishes, but the style continued in limited use in the [[British Isles]], and with the coming of Christianity revived there in the [[Insular style]] of the Early Middle Ages.

==Ancient Classical art==
{{Main article|Minoan art|Ancient Greek art|Roman art}}
[[File:Minoan Ceramic - Can.jpg|thumb|upright|Minoan Ceramic Art]]

The [[Minoan culture]] is regarded as the oldest civilization in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaniotis|first=Angelos|title=Ancient Crete|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0071.xml;jsessionid=B732A8D81DF46C77A25A3DA2625360A9|work=Oxford Bibliographies|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minoan culture existed in [[Crete]] and consisted of four periods: Prepalatial, Protopalatial, Neopalatial, and the Postpalatial period between 3650 BC and 1100 BC. Not much of the art remained from the Prepalatial times, and most of artefacts still existing today are Cycladic [[statuettes]] and [[pottery]] fragments. The most prosperous period of the Cretan civilization was Neopalatial period and most of the artefacts are from this era. A large number of artefacts from the Protopalatial can be seen today in Cretan museums.
Pottery – most popular in the Protopalatial period (1900-1700 BC) – was characterized by thin walled vessels, subtle, symmetrical shapes, elegant spouts, and decorations, and dynamic lines. Dark and light values were often contrasted in Minoan pottery.  The spontaneity and fluidity of the Protopalatial period later were transformed to a more stylized form of art with dissociation of naturalism in the Neopalatial period.&lt;br /&gt;The [[palace]]s served as organizational, commercial, artistic, worshipping, and agricultural centres in the Cretan civilization. Cretan palaces were built without defensive walls and exhibited a central [[courtyard]] which was embraced by a number of buildings. The central courtyard served as the main meeting place of the people. The palaces had [[throne room]]s, cult chambers, and [[theatre]]s where people could gather at special events. Columns and staircases were part of the artistic expression and it is believed that they served as metaphorical elements.&lt;br /&gt;The Minoan palaces are richly painted with [[painting]]s. Minoan painting was unique in that it used wet fresco techniques; it was characterized by small waists, fluidity, and vitality of the figures and was seasoned with elasticity, spontaneity, vitality, and high-contrasting colours.&lt;br /&gt;Not much of the [[sculpture]] survived from the Minoan civilization. The best known example of sculptures is the [[Snake Goddess]] figurine. The sculpture depicts a goddess or a high priestess holding a snake in both hands, dressed in traditional Minoan attire, cloth covering the whole body and leaving the breasts exposed. Exquisite [[metal work]] was also a characteristic of the Minoan art. Minoan metal masters worked with imported gold and copper and mastered techniques of wax casting, [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossing]], [[gilding]], nielo, and [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minoan art|url=http://www.ancient-greece.org/art/minoan-art.html|work=Greek art|publisher=Ancient-Greece.org|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Art of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]] had great painters, great sculptors, and great architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek [[marble sculpture]] is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art.  Painting on the [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramic art|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or by later Romans.  Zeuxis lived in 5–6 BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes.  Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

[[File:Fayum-34.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Mummy portrait of a young girl, 2nd century AD, [[Louvre]].]]

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting and sculpture, but was also strongly influenced by the more local [[Etruscan art]] of Italy. [[Roman sculpture]], is primarily portraiture derived from the upper classes of society as well as depictions of the gods. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics.  Among surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy, especially at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into four main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=Art-and-archaeology.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'oeil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Painting|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropt/hd_ropt.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the surviving painted portraits from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portrait]]s of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]].  They give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had.  A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period. [[Early Christian art]] grew out of Roman popular, and later Imperial, art and adapted its [[iconography]] from these sources.

==Medieval==
{{main article|Medieval art}}

[[File:Meister des Book of Lindisfarne 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''[[Saint Matthew]]'' from the ''[[Lindisfarne Gospels]].]]

Most surviving art from the [[Medieval]] period was religious in focus, often funded by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], powerful ecclesiastical individuals such as [[bishop]]s, communal groups such as [[abbey]]s, or wealthy secular [[patron]]s. Many had specific liturgical functions—processional [[Christian cross|crosses]] and [[altarpiece]]s, for example.

One of the central questions about Medieval art concerns its lack of realism. A great deal of knowledge of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in art and understanding of the human figure was lost with the fall of [[Roman Empire|Rome]]. But realism was not the primary concern of Medieval artists. They were simply trying to send a religious message, a task which demands clear iconic images instead of precisely rendered ones.

'''Time Period''': 6th century to 15th century

===Byzantine===
[[File:Helios in His Chariot.jpg|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
{{main article|Byzantine art}}
Byzantine art overlaps with or merges with what we call Early Christian art until the [[iconoclasm]] period of 730-843 when the vast majority of artwork with figures was destroyed; so little remains that today any discovery sheds new understanding. After 843 until 1453 there is a clear Byzantine art tradition. It is often the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with production centered on Constantinople. Byzantine art's crowning achievement were the monumental frescos and mosaics inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to mosques.

===Early Medieval art===
[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
[[Migration period art]] is a general term for the art of the "barbarian" peoples who moved into formerly Roman territories.  [[Celtic art]] in the 7th and 8th centuries saw a fusion with Germanic traditions through contact with the [[Anglo-Saxons]] creating what is called the Hiberno-Saxon style or [[Insular art]], which was to be highly influential on the rest of the Middle Ages.  [[Merovingian art]] describes the art of the [[Franks]] before about 800, when [[Carolingian art]] combined insular influences with a self-conscious classical revival, developing into [[Ottonian art]]. [[Anglo-Saxon art]] is the art of England after the Insular period.  [[Illuminated manuscript]]s contain nearly all the surviving painting of the period, but architecture, metalwork and small carved work in wood or ivory were also important media.
{{Clear}}

===Romanesque===
[[File:WinchesterBibleJeremiah(cover).GIF|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
{{main article|Romanesque art}}
Romanesque art refers to the period from about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century.  This was a period of increasing prosperity, and the first to see a coherent style used across Europe, from Scandinavia to Switzerland.  Romanesque art is vigorous and direct, was originally brightly coloured, and is often very sophisticated. [[Stained glass]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] on metalwork became important media, and larger sculptures in the round developed, although [[high relief]] was the principal technique.  Its architecture is dominated by thick walls, and round-headed windows and arches, with much carved decoration.

{{main article|Gothic art}}
Gothic art is a variable term depending on the craft, place and time. The term originated with Gothic architecture in 1140, but Gothic painting did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style. Gothic sculpture was born in France in 1144 with the renovation of the Abbey Church of S. Denis and spread throughout Europe, by the 13th century it had become the international style, replacing Romanesque. International Gothic describes Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art merges into Renaissance art at different times in different places. During this period forms such as painting, in fresco and on panel, become newly important, and the end of the period includes new media such as prints. {{Clear}}

{{main article|Renaissance art}}
The [[Renaissance]] is characterized by a focus on the arts of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]], which led to many changes in both the technical aspects of painting and sculpture, as well as to their subject matter. It began in [[Italian Renaissance|Italy]], a country rich in Roman heritage as well as material prosperity to fund artists. During the Renaissance, painters began to enhance the realism of their work by using new techniques in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], thus representing three [[dimension]]s more authentically. Artists also began to use new techniques in the manipulation of light and darkness, such as the tone contrast evident in many of [[Titian]]'s portraits and the development of [[sfumato]] and [[chiaroscuro]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. [[Sculpture|Sculptors]], too, began to rediscover many ancient techniques such as [[contrapposto]]. Following with the [[Humanism|humanist]] spirit of the age, art became more secular in subject matter, depicting ancient [[mythology]] in addition to Christian themes. This genre of art is often referred to as [[Renaissance Classicism]]. In the North, the most important Renaissance innovation was the widespread use of [[oil paint]]s, which allowed for greater colour and intensity.

===From Gothic to the Renaissance===
During the late 13th century and early 14th century, much of the painting in Italy was Byzantine in Character, notably that of [[Duccio]] of Siena and [[Cimabue]] of Florence, while [[Pietro Cavallini]] in [[Rome]] was more [[Gothic art|Gothic]] in style.

In 1290 [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] began painting in a manner that was less traditional and more based upon observation of nature. His famous cycle at the [[Scrovegni Chapel]], [[Padua]], is seen as the beginnings of a Renaissance style.

Other painters of the 14th century were carried the Gothic style to great elaboration and detail. Notable among these painters are [[Simone Martini]] and [[Gentile da Fabriano]].

In the [[Netherlands]], the technique of painting in [[oil paint|oil]]s rather than [[tempera]], led itself to a form of elaboration that was not dependent upon the application of gold leaf and embossing, but upon the minute depiction of the natural world. The art of painting textures with great realism evolved at this time. Dutch painters such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]] were to have great influence on Late Gothic and Early Renaissance painting.

===Early Renaissance===
The ideas of the Renaissance first emerged in the city-state of [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The sculptor [[Donatello]] returned to classical techniques such as [[contrapposto]] and classical subjects like the unsupported nude—his second sculpture of ''[[Donatello's David|David]]'' was the first free-standing bronze nude created in Europe since the Roman Empire. The sculptor and architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] studied the architectural ideas of ancient Roman buildings for inspiration. [[Tommaso Masaccio|Masaccio]] perfected elements like composition, individual expression, and human form to paint frescoes, especially those in the [[Brancacci Chapel]], of surprising elegance, drama, and emotion.

A remarkable number of these major artists worked on different portions of the [[Florence Cathedral]]. Brunelleschi's dome for the cathedral was one of the first truly revolutionary architectural innovations since the Gothic flying buttress. Donatello created many of its sculptures. Giotto and [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] also contributed to the cathedral.

===High Renaissance===
High Renaissance artists include such figures as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raffaello Sanzio]].

The 15th-century artistic developments in Italy (for example, the interest in perspectival systems, in depicting anatomy, and in classical cultures) matured during the 16th century, accounting for the designations "Early Renaissance" for the 15th century and "High Renaissance" for the 16th century. Although no singular style characterizes the High Renaissance, the art of those most closely associated with this Period—Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Titian—exhibits an astounding mastery, both technical and aesthetic. High Renaissance artists created works of such authority that generations of later artists relied on these artworks for instruction.
These exemplary artistic creations further elevated the prestige of artists. Artists could claim divine inspiration, thereby raising visual art to a status formerly given only to poetry. Thus, painters, sculptors, and architects came into their own, successfully claiming for their work a high position among the fine arts. In a sense, 16th- century masters created a new profession with its own rights of expression and its own venerable character.

===Northern art up to the Renaissance===
[[Early Netherlandish painting]] developed (but did not strictly invent) the technique of [[oil painting]] to allow greater control in painting minute detail with realism—[[Jan van Eyck]]&amp;nbsp;(1366–1441) was a figure in the movement from [[illuminated manuscript]]s to [[panel painting]]s.

[[Hieronymus Bosch]] (1450?–1516), a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter, is another important figure in the Northern Renaissance. In his paintings, he used religious themes, but combined them with grotesque fantasies, colourful imagery, and peasant folk legends. His paintings often reflect the confusion and anguish associated with the end of the Middle Ages.

[[Albrecht Dürer]] introduced Italian Renaissance style to Germany at the end of the 15th century, and dominated [[German Renaissance art]].

In European art, Renaissance Classicism spawned two different movements—[[Mannerism]] and the [[Baroque]]. Mannerism, a reaction against the idealist perfection of Classicism, employed distortion of light and spatial frameworks in order to emphasize the emotional content of a painting and the emotions of the painter. The work of [[El Greco]] is a particularly clear example of [[Mannerism]] in painting during the late 16th, early 17th centuries. [[Northern Mannerism]] took longer to develop, and was largely a movement of the last half of the 16th century.   Baroque art took the representationalism of the Renaissance to new heights, emphasizing detail, movement, lighting, and drama in their search for beauty. Perhaps the best known Baroque painters are [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and [[Diego Velázquez]].

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], which had very little religious art, and little [[history painting]], instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]]s of everyday scenes, and [[landscape painting]].  While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less use for [[Vermeer]] and many other Dutch artists.  [[Flemish Baroque painting]] shared a part in this trend, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories.

Baroque art is often seen as part of the [[Counter-Reformation]]—the artistic element of the revival of spiritual life in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Additionally, the emphasis that Baroque art placed on grandeur is seen as [[Political absolutism|Absolutist]] in nature. Religious and political themes were widely explored within the Baroque artistic context, and both paintings and sculptures were characterised by a strong element of drama, emotion and theatricality. Famous Baroque artists include [[Caravaggio]] or [[Rubens]].&lt;ref name="arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com/BaroqueArt.html |title=Baroque Art |publisher=Arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque art was particularly ornate and elaborate in nature, often using rich, warm colours with dark undertones. Pomp and grandeur were important elements of the Baroque artistic movement in general, as can be seen when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] said, "I am grandeur incarnate"; many Baroque artists served kings who tried to realize this goal. Baroque art in many ways was similar to Renaissance art; as a matter of fact, the term was initially used in a derogative manner to describe post-Renaissance art and architecture which was over-elaborate.&lt;ref name="arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com"/&gt; Baroque art can be seen as a more elaborate and dramatic re-adaptation of late Renaissance art.

By the 18th century, however, Baroque art was falling out of fashion as many deemed it too melodramatic and also gloomy, and it developed into the [[Rococo]], which emerged in France. Rococo art was even more elaborate than the Baroque, but it was less serious and more playful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html |title=Ancien Regime Rococo |publisher=Bc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the Baroque used rich, strong colours, Rococo used pale, creamier shades. The artistic movement no longer placed an emphasis on politics and religion, focusing instead on lighter themes such as romance, celebration, and appreciation of nature. Rococo art also contrasted the Baroque as it often refused symmetry in favor of asymmetrical designs. Furthermore, it sought inspiration from the artistic forms and ornamentation of [[Far East|Far Eastern Asia]], resulting in the rise in favour of [[porcelain]] figurines and [[chinoiserie]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/chinoiserie.aspx#3-1E1:chinoise-full|title=chinoiserie facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about chinoiserie|author=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century style flourished for a short while; nevertheless, the Rococo style soon fell out of favor, being seen by many as a gaudy and superficial movement emphasizing aesthetics over meaning. [[Neoclassicism]] in many ways developed as a counter movement of the Rococo, the impetus being a sense of disgust directed towards the latter's florid qualities.

==Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Academism and Realism==
{{Main article|Neoclassicism|Romantic art|Academic art|Realism (arts)}}
[[File:Amor-Psyche-Canova-JBU01.JPG|thumb|right|Neoclassical art, inspired by different classical themes, was characterised by an emphasis on simplicity, order and idealism. In the image [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'' (1787-1793)]]

Throughout the 18th century, a counter movement opposing the Rococo sprang up in different parts of Europe, commonly known as [[Neoclassicism]]. It despised the perceived superficiality and frivolity of Rococo art, and desired for a return to the simplicity, order and 'purism' of classical antiquity, especially ancient Greece and Rome. The movement was in part also influenced by the Renaissance, which itself was strongly influenced by classical art. Neoclassicism was the artistic component of the intellectual movement known as [[the Enlightenment]]; the Enlightenment was idealistic, and put its emphasis on objectivity, reason and empirical truth. Neoclassicism had become widespread in Europe throughout the 18th century, especially in the [[United Kingdom]], which saw great works of Neoclassical architecture spring up during this period; Neoclassicism's fascination with classical antiquity can be seen in the popularity of the [[Grand Tour]] during this decade, where wealthy aristocrats travelled to the ancient ruins of Italy and Greece. Nevertheless, a defining moment for Neoclassicism came during the [[French Revolution]] in the late 18th century; in France, Rococo art was replaced with the preferred Neoclassical art, which was seen as more serious than the former movement. In many ways, Neoclassicism can be seen as a political movement as well as an artistic and cultural one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsz.org/neoclassicism-art/ |title=Art in Neoclassicism |publisher=Artsz.org |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical art places an emphasis on order, symmetry and classical simplicity; common themes in Neoclassical art include courage and war, as were commonly explored in ancient Greek and Roman art. [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Antonio Canova|Canova]], and [[Jacques-Louis David]] are among the best-known neoclassicists.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;James J. Sheehan, "Art and Its Publics, c. 1800," United and Diversity in European Culture c. 1800, ed. [[Tim Blanning]] and [[Hagen Schulze]] (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|[[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' 1830, [[Romanticism|Romantic art]].]] 

Just as Mannerism rejected Classicism, so did [[Romanticism]] reject the ideas of the Enlightenment and the aesthetic of the Neoclassicists. Romanticism rejected the highly objective and ordered nature of Neoclassicism, and opted for a more individual and emotional approach to the arts.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/introduction.html |title=General Introduction to Postmodernism |publisher=Cla.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanticism placed an emphasis on nature, especially when aiming to portray the power and beauty of the natural world, and emotions, and sought a highly personal approach to art. Romantic art was about individual feelings, not common themes, such as in Neoclassicism; in such a way, Romantic art often used colours in order to express feelings and emotion.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt; Similarly to Neoclassicism, Romantic art took much of its inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman art and mythology, yet, unlike Neoclassical, this inspiration was primarily used as a way to create symbolism and imagery. Romantic art also takes much of its aesthetic qualities from [[medieval]]ism and [[Gothic art|Gothic]]ism, as well as mythology and [[folklore]]. Among the greatest Romantic artists were [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[J.M.W. Turner]], [[John Constable]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Thomas Cole]], and [[William Blake]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Most artists attempted to take a centrist approach which adopted different features of Neoclassicist and Romanticist styles, in order to synthesize them. The different attempts took place within the French Academy, and collectively are called [[Academic art]]. [[Adolphe William Bouguereau]] is considered a chief example of this stream of art.

In the early 19th century the face of Europe, however, became radically altered by [[industrialization]]. Poverty, squalor, and desperation were to be the fate of the new [[working class]] created by the "revolution". In response to these changes going on in society, the movement of [[realism (arts)|Realism]] emerged. Realism sought to accurately portray the conditions and hardships of the poor in the hopes of changing society. In contrast with Romanticism, which was essentially optimistic about mankind, Realism offered a stark vision of poverty and despair. Similarly, while Romanticism glorified nature, Realism portrayed life in the depths of an urban wasteland. Like Romanticism, [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] was a literary as well as an artistic movement. The great [[Realism (visual arts)|Realist]] painters include [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]] (both considered as [[Impressionism|Impressionist]]s), and [[Thomas Eakins]], among others.

The response of architecture to industrialisation, in stark contrast to the other arts, was to veer towards historicism. Although the railway stations built during this period are often considered the truest reflections of its spirit – they are sometimes called "the cathedrals of the age" – the main movements in architecture during the Industrial Age were revivals of styles from the distant past, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]]. Related movements were the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], who attempted to return art to its state of "purity" prior to [[Raphael]], and the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which reacted against the impersonality of mass-produced goods and advocated a return to medieval craftsmanship.

==Modern art==
{{main article|Impressionism|Post Impressionism|Fauvism|Cubism|Modern art|Modernism|Late modernism}}
[[File:Monet Houses of Parliament, Sunset.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Impressionism was known for its usage of light and movement in its paintings, as in [[Claude Monet]]'s 1902 ''[[Houses of Parliament (Monet series)|Houses of Parliament, sunset]]]]''
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|right|[[Art &amp; Language]] are known for their major input on conceptual art.|299x299px]]
Out of the naturalist ethic of Realism grew a major artistic movement, [[Impressionism]]. The Impressionists pioneered the use of light in painting as they attempted to capture light as seen from the human eye. [[Edgar Degas]],
[[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], were all involved in the Impressionist movement. As a direct outgrowth of Impressionism came the development of [[Post-Impressionism]]. [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] are the best known Post-Impressionists.

Following the Impressionists and the [[Post-Impressionists]] came [[Fauvism]], often considered the first "modern" genre of art. Just as the Impressionists revolutionized light, so did the fauvists rethink [[color]], painting their canvases in bright, wild hues. After the Fauvists, [[modern art]] began to develop in all its forms, ranging from [[Expressionism]], concerned with evoking emotion through objective works of art, to [[Cubism]], the art of transposing a three-dimensional reality onto a flat canvas, to [[Abstract art]]. These new art forms pushed the limits of traditional notions of "art" and corresponded to the similar rapid changes that were taking place in human society, technology, and thought.

[[Surrealism]] is often classified as a form of Modern Art. However, the Surrealists themselves have objected to the study of surrealism as an era in art history, claiming that it oversimplifies the complexity of the movement (which they say is not an artistic movement), misrepresents the relationship of surrealism to [[aesthetics]], and falsely characterizes ongoing surrealism as a finished, historically encapsulated era. Other forms of Modern art (some of which border on [[Contemporary art]]) include:

{{Main article|Contemporary art|Postmodern art}}
Modern art foreshadowed several characteristics of what would later be defined as postmodern art; as a matter of fact, several modern art movements can often be classified as both modern and postmodern, such as [[pop art]]. Postmodern art, for instance, places a strong emphasis on irony, parody and humour in general; modern art started to develop a more ironic approach to art which would later advance in a postmodern context. Postmodern art sees the blurring between the high and fine arts with low-end and commercial art; modern art started to experiment with this blurring.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt;
Recent developments in art have been characterised by a significant expansion of what can now deemed to be art, in terms of materials, media, activity and concept. [[Conceptual art]] in particular has had a wide influence. This started literally as the replacement of concept for a made object, one of the intentions of which was to refute the commodification of art. However, it now usually refers to an artwork where there is an object, but the main claim for the work is made for the thought process that has informed it. The aspect of commercialism has returned to the work.

There has also been an increase in art referring to previous movements and artists, and gaining validity from that reference.

[[Postmodernism]] in art, which has grown since the 1960s, differs from [[Modernism]] in as much as Modern art movements were primarily focused on their own activities and values, while Postmodernism uses the whole range of previous movements as a reference point. This has by definition generated a relativistic outlook, accompanied by irony and a certain disbelief in values, as each can be seen to be replaced by another. Another result of this has been the growth of commercialism and celebrity. Postmodern art has questioned common rules and guidelines of what is regarded as '[[fine art]]', merging [[low culture|low art]] with the fine arts until none is fully distinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas About Art'', Desmond, Kathleen K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International postmodernism: theory and literary practice'', Bertens, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], Routledge, 1997, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; Before the advent of postmodernism, the fine arts were characterised by a form of aesthetic quality, elegance, craftsmanship, finesse and intellectual stimulation which was intended to appeal to the [[upper class|upper]] or educated classes; this distinguished high art from low art, which, in turn, was seen as tacky, [[kitsch]], easily made and lacking in much or any intellectual stimulation, art which was intended to appeal to the masses. Postmodern art blurred these distinctions, bringing a strong element of kitsch, commercialism and [[camp (style)|campness]] into contemporary fine art;&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt; what is nowadays seen as fine art may have been seen as low art before postmodernism revolutionised the concept of what high or fine art truly is.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt; In addition, the postmodern nature of contemporary art leaves a lot of space for individualism within the art scene; for instance, postmodern art often takes inspiration from past artistic movements, such as Gothic or Baroque art, and both juxtaposes and recycles styles from these past periods in a different context.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt;

Some [[Surrealism|surrealist]]s in particular [[Joan Miró]], who called for the "murder of painting" (In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Miró expressed contempt for conventional painting methods and his desire to "kill", "murder", or "rape" them in favor of more contemporary means of expression).&lt;ref&gt;M. Rowell, ''Joan Mirό: Selected Writings and Interviews'' (London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], 1987) pp. 114–116.&lt;/ref&gt;  have denounced or attempted to "supersede" painting, and there have also been other anti-painting trends among artistic movements, such as that of [[Dada]] and [[conceptual art]]. The trend away from painting in the late 20th century has been countered by various movements, for example the continuation of [[Minimal Art]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], [[New Realism]], [[Photorealism]], [[Neo-minimalism|Neo Geo]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and [[Stuckism]] and various other important and influential painterly directions.

Lewin had a training analysis with [[Franz Alexander]] in Berlin in the 1920s, before publishing his first analytic article in 1930.  This was followed by ten more over the next decade, on subjects ranging from diabetes and [[claustrophobia]] to the body as [[phallus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 636&lt;/ref&gt;  The main focus of his interest, however, was in manic states, which he saw as characterised by fleeting identifications with a multiple of outside figures.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he published the fruits of his investigations in ''The Psychoanalysis of Elation'' (1951).  There he stressed the role of [[denial]] in mania – denial particularly of feelings of separation and loss.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Skubal, ''Word of Mouth'' (2013) p. 35-6&lt;/ref&gt;  He also explored the paradox in elation's dark counterpart, depression, whereby the melancholic in seeking to punish the effigy of their loved one in fact punishes themselves having incorporated this effigy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Darian Leader]], ''The New Black'' (2008) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

By that point he had also published his seminal article (1946) on the dream screen – the backcloth formed from primitive memories of the breast onto which the dream is projected.&lt;ref&gt;L. Fischer, ''Shot/Countershot'' (2014) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept would be fruitfully followed up both within analysis,&lt;ref&gt;J. Pearson, ''Analyst of the Imagination'' (2004) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and in the context of [[film theory]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Fischer, ''Cinematernity'' (2014) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3163">The '''Berwick Gymnasium Arts Fellowships''' were established in 1993 and were offered annually to professional artists who had demonstrated a consistent commitment to their art practice. The Fellowships were an internationally renowned programme open to all artists; national and international. Located in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]], England, the Fellowships were intended to give artists a period of time when they could reflect upon their practice and focus on the development of their work, responding to the border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and its coastal location.&lt;ref&gt;The Berwick Gymnasium Fellowships: An Archival Record, ed.

'''''Cattleya Orchid and Three Hummingbirds''''' (1871) is an [[oil on wood|oil on mahogany panel]] picture by [[Martin Johnson Heade]] acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in 1982. Inspired perhaps by the works of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Frederic Edwin Church]], Heade planned to produce a deluxe book in the 1860s depicting Brazilian [[hummingbird]]s in tropical settings, and, to that end, created a series of 40 small pictures called ''The Gems of Brazil''. The project was abandoned, but Heade retained his interest in hummingbirds and continued to paint them in combination with [[orchid]]s and jungle backgrounds through the 1870s. The NGA describes the work: "Lichen covers dead branches; moss drips from trees; and, a blue-gray mist veils the distant jungle. An opulent pink orchid with light-green stems and pods dominates the left foreground." On the right, two green-and-pink Brazilian Amethysts hover about a nest while a red-tailed Sappho Comet perches nearby.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
A '''composite film''' is a [[feature film]] whose [[screenplay]] is composed of two or more distinct stories. More generally, '''composite structure''' refers to an [[aesthetics|aesthetic principle]] in which the [[narrative structure]] relies on contiguity and linking rather than linearity. In a composite text or film, individual pieces are complete within themselves, yet they form a whole work that is greater than the sum of its individual parts.&lt;ref name="Dunn-Morris"&gt;Dunn, Morris (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of composite films begins with composite novels. The composite novel is a literary work composed of shorter texts that—though individually complete and autonomous—are interrelated in a coherent whole according to one or more organizing principles.

Although the composite-text aesthetic can be traced back through [[Frame story|framework-stories]] (such as the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''), story cycles (such as the [[Arthurian]] stories), and sacred composites (such as the [[Bible]]), composite texts had specific precursors in the village sketch of nineteenth century Europe and America. Reflecting its roots in the framework-story and/or the cycle, a typical village sketch may feature an introductory story and a summary story, with individually titled internal stories that do not necessarily depend upon specific sequencing.

Twentieth century experimentation with the composite whole-text aesthetic, i.e., combining individual short stories into a whole-text narrative, began with [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Dubliners]]'' and [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]] and accelerated thereafter, but the composite novel remained controversial among readers, reviewers, and critics. Some wanted to call these works "[[novel]]s" while others wanted to call them "collections". To their authors, however, these works were clearly not just collections of stories. Joyce insisted that ''Dubliners'' was a planned, integrated whole text. [[William Faulkner]] fought both publishers and critics over the whole-text coherence of ''[[Go Down, Moses]]'', refusing to append "And Other Stories" to the book's title. Later, [[Maxine Hong Kingston]] and [[Tim O'Brien (author)|Tim O'Brien]] would wage similar battles over ''The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Childhood Among Ghosts'' (1976) and ''[[The Things They Carried]]'' (1990), respectively. By the end of the twentieth century, authors were announcing their whole-text intentions by insisting on such sub-titles as "A Novel in Stories", or simply "A Novel".&lt;ref name="Dunn-Morris" /&gt;

Composite novels have been referred to as a number of other genre-names including short story cycle, framed miscellany, multi-faceted novel, story-novel, short story blend, double-novel, short story compound, short story composite, composite, anthology novel, para novel, triptych, [[mosaic novel]], loose-leaf novel, and short story sequence.

== Titles ==
Within a composite film, the individual stories may or may not be titled. Most highly integrated composite films, such as ''[[Love Actually]]'', ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' etc., do not have individually titled components while more traditional composite films, such as ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]'', ''[[Coffee &amp; Cigarettes]]'', ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' etc., do. Titling each component reinforces its autonomy and helps viewers experience it both individually and as part of the whole film.

== Unifying elements ==
Many different devices are used to connect the individual stories to each other and to the film in its entirety. Unifying elements include repeated images (such as coffee cups and ash trays in ''Coffee &amp; Cigarettes''), recurring characters (the women within ''Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her'' appear in at least one story other than their own), shared incidents (drug addiction in ''[[Requiem for a Dream]]''), common settings (the dark streets of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''), similar themes (the three women of ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]''), a single protagonist (Tommy in ''[[The Fountain]]''), collective protagonists (a group of people like generations of a family, coworkers, a club etc.), etc.

== Story sequencing ==
The sequence in which the individual stories unfold is often significant to the overall meaning of the film. Component pieces can be arranged in a number of different ways (chronologically, thematically, geographically etc.) and each method produces different results.

== Composite film scores ==
In regards to issues with connectivity, it is important to consider the musical score of composite films. Much like visual repetition or thematic similarities, the score offers another medium through which stories can be linked. Rather than leaving viewers with content to process, decode, intellectualize and then react to, the film score can produce emotional reactions immediately, before viewers have a chance to analyze their own responses. There are three main categories of composite film scores:

===Unified score===
In a unified score, there is no discernible difference between the music playing during each story segment. For example, in ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', the highly stylized background music offers ambiance and contributes to the setting and does not vary between characters and stories.  In ''[[Love Actually]]'', pop music blares through happy moments, ballads wail during morose moments, and triumphant strings swell when all things are as they should be.
  
===Composite score===
In a composite score, the music within each individual segment is independent and distinct from the music within other segments. For example, in ''[[Paris, je t'aime]]'', each titled piece is accompanied by music that relates only to that single piece rather than the film as a whole. In this example, rather than linking the story lines, the music serves to further distinguish each neighborhood from the others.

===Theme and variation===
Theme and variation refers to a main theme that varies slightly by story segment. For example, in ''[[The Fountain]]'', one main theme appears in each character's story, but there are also variations on that theme specific to those individual characters (tribal drums accompany the conquistador in Mayan territory, etc.). In ''[[Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her]]'', the main theme throughout the film consists of somber classical guitar and accompanying piano, but within each individually titled segment, there are minor differences. Sultry horns are added to the banker's scenes, as she is having an affair, and as the detective investigates the death of her Hispanic friend, the music takes on a subtle Latin sound, etc.

'''The DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program''' (German: ''Berliner Künstlerprogramm des DAAD'') is a residential program for artists of all countries and ages run by the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (German: ‘Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst', DAAD) in [[Berlin]]. Originally initiated by the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1963, the program has been run by the DAAD – with the assistance of the [[German Federal Foreign Office]] and the [[Senate of Berlin]] – since 1965. The program annually invites around 20 artists working within [[visual arts]], [[literature]], [[music]] and [[film]] to spend a year (in the case of film, six months) living and working in Berlin. It is aimed at artists who have already demonstrated considerable talent, but are yet to become fully established. It is one of the foremost artistic programs in Europe, and has hosted artists, filmmakers and writers such as [[Steve McQueen]], [[Susan Sontag]], [[John Cage]], [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Asghar Farhadi]], [[Damien Hirst]], [[Nan Goldin]], [[Shahzia Sikander]], [[Chirikure Chirikure]] and [[AA Bronson]].  Katharina Narbutovič is currently head of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-kuenstlerprogramm.de/en/index_en.php |title=Berliner Künstlerprogramm |publisher=Berliner-kuenstlerprogramm.de |date=2013-11-08 |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Artists-in-Berlin Program ==

In 1963, a year and a half after the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]], the Ford Foundation created a three-year program aimed at expanding and strengthening the cultural and educational resources of West Berlin. The Foundation made an initial donation of three million US dollars and placed James B. Conant, former president of [[Harvard University]] and former [[United States Ambassador to Germany]], in charge. 300,000 and 350,000 dollars respectively were allocated to the creation of two new courses at the [[Free University of Berlin]] – one in American Studies, and another in Comparative Music Studies. 590,000 dollars were used to make it possible for ‘artists, writers, academics, scientists and composers’ to spend ‘an extended period of time living and working in Berlin.’
In 1965 the DAAD took over the running of the program, and renamed it the Artists-in-Berlin Program. It now gained additional support from the German Federal Foreign Office and the Senate of Berlin. Hansgerd Schulte, president of the DAAD from 1972 to 1987, called it ‘the jewel in the crown’ – a unique entity amongst the many programs run by the DAAD.
In 2013, the program is preparing to celebrate its 50th anniversary. This will be marked by a two-day celebration hosted at the Berlin Academy of Art, featuring performances from [[Antjie Krog]], [[Sjòn]], [[Jennifer Walshe]] and [[Phil Collins]], among others.  A 50th anniversary countdown blog has also been created, featuring contributions from various guests about their time in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daadartistsinberlin.tumblr.com/ |title=50 years of the DAAD artists-in-berlin program |publisher=Daadartistsinberlin.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ford Foundation Annual Report 1963|year=1963|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hellmann|first=Friedrich W.|title=Spuren in die Zukunft|year=2000|publisher=DAAD|location=Bonn|isbn=3-87192-750-3|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guests ==

In essence, the Artists-in-Berlin Program consists of a grant, allowing an artist to spend one year in Berlin. Each year, following the recommendations of a jury, the program awards around 20 grants in the fields of the visual arts, film, literature and music. The program also assists its guests with displaying or performing the work they have produced in Berlin –for visual artists, for instance, individual exhibitions are organized in the program’s gallery, the daadgalerie, often accompanied by a publication. Since 1964, around 1000 artists have come to Berlin as guests of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schulte am Hülse|first=Jessica|title=Hier sind die Großen der Kunst zu Hause|url=https://www.welt.de/wams_print/article2531228/Hier-sind-die-Grossen-der-Kunst-zu-Hause.html|newspaper=Die Welt|date=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Between 1963 and 2013, around 394 visual artists have taken part in the program. They include [[Jorge Castillo (artist)|Jorge Castillo]] (1969), [[Daniel Spoerri]] (1973), [[Joel Fisher (artist)|Joel Fisher]] (1973), [[Gunter Christmann]] (1974), [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] (1974), [[Duane Hanson]] (1974), [[Christian Boltanski]] (1975), [[Lawrence Weiner]] (1975), [[On Kawara]] (1976), [[Jannis Kounellis]] (1980), [[Nam June Paik]] (1983), [[Erwin Wurm]] (1987), [[Ilja Kabakow]](1989), [[Nan Goldin]] (1991), [[Marina Abramović]] (1992), [[Rachel Whiteread]] (1992), [[Damien Hirst]] (1993), [[Andrea Zittel]] (1995), [[Pipilotti Rist]] (1996), [[Douglas Gordon]] (1997), [[Allan Sekula]] (1997), [[Rineke Dijkstra]] (1998), [[Steve McQueen]] (1999), [[Mark Wallinger]] (2001), [[Mona Hatoum]] (2003), [[Helen Mirra]] (2005), [[Shahzia Sikander]] (2007), [[Tim Lee (artist)|Tim Lee]] (2009), [[Brandt Junceau]] (2010), and [[AA Bronson]] (2013). Due to the extremely high demand for grants in this field, the program no longer takes on applications from individual artists – they must instead be sought out and suggested by a committee.

== The daadgalerie ==

From the very beginning, the Artists-in-Berlin Program was intended to provide more than just funding and accommodation. Its mission was to connect isolated West Berlin with a wider cultural and creative world. As such, the program coordinators invited guest artists to city events, introduced them to influential figures in the German cultural scene, and ensured that they were able to publicly perform and display their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kostelanetz|first=Richard|title=A dictionary of the avant-gardes|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-93764-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To give these activities a concrete physical focus, the daadgalerie was created in 1978, providing the program’s artists with a set platform for their creative activities. To begin with, it was based in silent film star [[Henny Porten]]’s former villa in the Kurfürstenstraße, in what was then West Berlin. However, in 2005 it was moved to new premises in the Zimmerstraße, close to [[Checkpoint Charlie]] in the centre of Berlin. It continues to host a wide range of events, including readings, concerts, film showings and performances.

The '''Decadent Movement''' was a late 19th-century [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[literary movement|literary]] movement, centered in [[Western Europe]], that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The visual artist [[Félicien Rops]]'s body of work and [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]'s novel ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement. It first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Critical Theory - Oxford Reference, pp.113-114&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was characterized by self-disgust, sickness at the world, general skepticism, delight in perversion and employment of crude humor and a belief in the superiority of [[human creativity]] over logic and the natural world.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Symbolist Landscapes: The Place of Painting in the Poetry and Criticism of Mallarmé and His Circle|last=Kearns|first=James|publisher=MHRA|year=1989|isbn=094762323X|location=|pages=15|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Against the Grain|last=Huysmans|first=Joris-Karl|publisher=Lieber &amp; Lewis|year=1922|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Project Gutenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from the writings of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher who suggested that the decline (''[[decadence|décadence]]'') of the Roman Empire was in large part due to their moral decay and loss of cultural standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.constitution.org/cm/ccgrd_l.htm|title=Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline|last=Montesqieu|first=Charles-Louis de Secondat|publisher=The Free Press, New York.  Collier-Macmillan, London.|others=Translated by David Lowenthal|year=1965|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Constitution Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When Latin scholar [[Désiré Nisard]] turned toward French literature, he compared [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Romanticism]] in general to the Roman decadence, men sacrificing their craft and their cultural values for the sake of pleasure.  The trends that he identified, such as an interest in description, a lack of adherence to the conventional rules of literature and art, and a love for extravagant language were the seeds of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Desmarais|first=Jane|date=|year=2013|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Perfume Clouds: Olfaction, Memory, and Desire in Arthur Symon's London Nights (1895)|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|page=|pages=62–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== French Decadent Movement ===
The first major development in French decadence would come when writers [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]] used the word proudly, to represent a rejection of what they considered banal "progress."&lt;ref name="Drowninginlimbo"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=0947757813|title=An anthology of French symbolist &amp; decadent writing|publisher=Atlas Press|year=1994|isbn=0947757813|page=12|author=Remy de Gourmont|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudelaire referred to himself as decadent in his 1857 edition of [[Les Fleurs du mal|''Les Fleurs du Mal'']] and exalted the Roman decline as a model for modern poets to express their passion. He would later use the term ''decadence'' to  include the subversion of traditional categories in pursuit of full, sensual expression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism|last=Calinescu|first=Matei|publisher=Duke University|year=1987|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his lengthy introduction to Baudelaire in the front of the 1868 ''Les Fleurs du Mal,'' Gautier at first rejects the application of the term  decadent, as meant by the critic, but then works his way to an admission of decadence on Baudelaire's own terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gautier|first=Theophile|year=1868|others=Collection authored by Charles Baudelaire|title=Charles Baudelaire|url=|journal=Les Fleurs du Mal|volume=|pages=|via=WikiSource (France)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he was Belgian, [[Félicien Rops]] was instrumental in the development of this early stage of the Decadent Movement.  A friend of Baudelaire,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Censorship Effect: Baudelaire, Flaubert, and the Formation of French Modernism|last=Olmsted|first=William|publisher=Oxford|year=2016|isbn=9780190238636|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also a frequent illustrator of Baudelaire's writing, at the request of the author himself.  Rops delighted in breaking artistic convention and shocking the public with gruesome, fantastical horror.  He was explicitly interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat of Satan and Woman.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egoists, a Book of Supermen: Stendahl, Baudelaire, Flaubert, Anatole France, Huysmans, Barrès, Nietzsche, Blake, Ibsen, Stirner, and Ernest Hello|last=Huneker|first=James|publisher=|year=1909|isbn=0404105254|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Kindle Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Colour of Angels: Cosmology, Gender and the Aesthetic Imaginatio|last=Classen|first=Constance|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=0415180740|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At times, his only goal was the portrayal of a woman he'd observed debasing herself in the pursuit of her own pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hideous Absinthe: A History of the Devil in a Bottle|last=Adams|first=Jad|publisher=Tauris Parke|year=2008|isbn=1845116844|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that, no matter how horrific and perverse his images could be, Rops' invocation of supernatural elements was sufficient to keep Baudelaire situated in a spiritually-aware universe that maintained a cynical kind of hope, even if the poetry "requires a strong stomach."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Their work was the worship of beauty disguised as the worship of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charles Baudelaire: A Study|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=Eklin Matthews|year=1920|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For both of them, mortality and all manner of corruptions were always on their mind.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  The ability of Rops to see and portray the same world as they did, made him a popular illustrator for other decadent authors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The concept of decadence lingered after that, but it wasn't until 1884 that Maurice Barrès referred to a particular group of writers as ''Decadents.'' He defined this group as those who had been influenced heavily by Baudelaire, though they were also influenced by [[Gothic novel]]s and the poetry and fiction of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  Many were associated with [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], others with [[Aestheticism]].&lt;ref name="Stephan1974"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRoNAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165|title=Paul Verlaine and the Decadence, 1882-90|first=Philip|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1974|isbn=978-0-7190-0562-6|location=|page=|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Stephan|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/symbolist/texts/decadence_chronology.html A Chronology], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weir1995"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOb26cxGBfMC&amp;pg=PA16|title=Decadence and the Making of Modernism|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87023-992-2|page=16|author=David Weir|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pursuit of these authors, according to [[Arthur Symons]], was "a desperate endeavor to give sensation, to flash the impression of the moment, to preserve the very heat and motion of life," and their achievement, as he saw it, was "to be a disembodied voice, and yet the voice of a human soul."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harpers.org/sponsor/balvenie/arthur-symons.1.html|title=The Decadent Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|date=1893|website=Harpers.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1884 decadent novel ''[[À rebours|À Rebours]] (''English, ''Against Nature'' or ''Against the Grain''), [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] overthrew the past, subordinated nature to the human creative will, and suggested the primacy of, but inherent disillusion in, pleasure.  He also identified likely candidates for the core of the Decadent Movement, which he seemed to view Baudelaire as sitting above: [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Tristan Corbière]], Theodore Hannon, and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].  His character Des Esseintes hailed these writers for their creativity and their craftsmanship, suggesting that they filled him with "insidious delight" as they used a "secret language" to explore "twisted and precious ideas."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Not only did ''Against Nature'' define an ideology and a literature, but it also created an influential perspective on visual art.  The character of Des Esseintes explicitly heralded the work of [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Jan Luyken]], and [[Odilon Redon]].  None of these artists would have identified themselves as part of this movement.  Nevertheless, the choice of these three established a decadent perspective on art which favored madness and irrationality, graphic violence, frank pessimism about cultural institutions, and a disregard for visual logic of the natural world.  It has also been suggested that a dream vision that Des Esseintes describes is based on the series of satanic encounters painted by Félicien Rops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valazza|first=Nicolas|year=2010|others=Edited by Amaleena Damle and Aurelie L'Hostis|title=The Flower and the Monster: On Huysmans' Painters|url=|journal=The Beautiful and the Monstrous: Essays in French Literature, Thought and Culture|series=Modern French Identities|volume=|page=96|pages=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on the momentum of Huysmans' work, Anatole Baju founded the magazine ''Le Décadent'' in 1886, an effort to define and organize the Decadent Movement in a formal way.  This group of writers did not only look to escape the boredom of the banal, but they also sought to shock, scandalize, and subvert the expectations and values of society, believing that such freedom and creative experimentation would better humanity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not everyone was comfortable with Baju and ''Le Décadent,'' even including some who had been published in its pages.  Rival writer [[Jean Moréas]] published his [[Symbolist Manifesto]], largely to escape association with the Decadent Movement, despite their shared heritage.  Moréas and [[Gustave Kahn]], among others, formed rival publications to reinforce the distinction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Legitimizing the Artist: Manifesto Writing and European Modernism, 1885-1915|last=Somigli|first=Luca|publisher=University of Toronto|year=2003|isbn=1442657731|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Verlaine embraced the label at first, applauding it as a brilliant marketing choice by Baju.  After seeing his own words exploited and tiring of ''Le Décadent'' publishing works falsely attributed to [[Arthur Rimbaud]], however, Verlaine came to sour on Baju personally, and he eventually rejected the label, as well.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Decadence continued on in France, but it was limited largely to Anatole Baju and his followers, who refined their focus even further on perverse sexuality, material extravagance, and up-ending social expectations.  Far-fetched plots were acceptable if they helped generate the desired moments of salacious experience or glorification of the morbid and grotesque.  Writers who embraced the sort of decadence featured in ''Le Décadent'' include [[Albert Aurier]], [[Rachilde]], Pierre Vareilles, [[Miguel Hernández|Miguel Fernandez]], [[Jean Lorrain]], and [[Laurent Tailhade|Laurent Tailhaide]].  Many of these authors did also publish symbolist works, however, and it unclear how strongly they would have identified with Baju as decadents.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In France, the Decadent Movement is often said to have begun with either [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' ''[[À rebours|Against Nature]]'' (1884) or  Baudelaire's ''Les Fleur du Mal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiocleo.com/librarie/baudelaire/essay.html ''Baudelaire and the Decadent Movement''] by [[Paul Bourget]], retrieved December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  This movement essentially gave way to Symbolism when ''Le Décadent'' closed down in 1889 and Anatole Baju turned toward politics and became associated with anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  A few writers continued the decadent tradition, such as Octave [[Octave Mirbeau|Mirbeau]], but Decadence was no longer a recognized movement, let alone a force in literature or art.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought|last=Everdell|first=William R.|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1997|isbn=9780226224817|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the association of decadence with cultural decline, it is not uncommon to associate decadence in general with transitional times and their associated moods of pessimism and uncertainty.  In France, the heart of the Decadent Movement was during the 1880s and 1890s, the time of [[fin de siècle]], or end-of-the-century gloom.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  As part of that overall transition, many scholars of Decadence, such as [[David Weir (academic)|David Weir]], regard Decadence as a dynamic transition between [[Romanticism]] and [[Modernism]], especially considering the decadent tendency to dehumanize and distort in the name of pleasure and fantasy.&lt;ref name="Weir1995" /&gt;

=== Distinction from Symbolism ===
[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] has often been confused with the Decadent Movement. Arthur Symons, a British poet and literary critic contemporary with the movement, at one time considered Decadence in literature to be a parent category that included both Symbolism and [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionism]], as rebellions against realism.  He defined this common, decadent thread as, "an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in research, an over-subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity."  He referred to all such literature as, "a new and beautiful and interesting disease."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Later, however, he would go on to instead describe the Decadent Movement as an "interlude, half a mock interlude" that distracted critics from seeing and appreciating the larger and more important trend, which was the development of Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Symbolist Movement in Literature|last=Symons|first=Arthur|publisher=E. P. Dutton|year=1919|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is true that the two groups share an ideological descent from Baudelaire and for a time they both considered themselves as part of one sphere of new, anti-establishment literature.  They worked together and met together for quite a while, as if they were part of the same movement.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Maurice Barrès referred to this group as decadents, but he also referred to one of them (Stéphane Mallarmé) as a symbolist.  Even Jean Moréas used both terms for his own group of writers as late as 1885.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

Only a year later, however, [[Jean Moréas]] wrote his [[Symbolist Manifesto]] to assert a difference between the symbolists with whom he allied himself and this the new group of decadents associated with Anatole Baju and ''Le Décadent''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Even after this, there was sufficient common ground of interest, method, and language to  blur the lines more than the manifesto might have suggested.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In the world of visual arts, it can be even more difficult to distinguish decadence from symbolism.  In fact, Stephen Romer has referred to [[Félicien Rops]], [[Gustave Moreau]], and Fernand Khnopff as "Symbolist-Decadent painters and engravers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=French Decadent Tales|last=Romer|first=Stephen|publisher=Oxford|year=2013|isbn=0199569274|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are clear ideological differences between those who continued on as symbolists and those who have been called "dissidents" for remaining in the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephan|first=Philip|year=1972|title=Naturalist Influences on Symbolist Poetry, 1882-86.|url=|journal=The French Review|volume=46|pages=299–311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, there was little doubt that Baju and his group were producing work that was decadent, but there is frequently more question about the work of the symbolists.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;

In a website associated with Dr. Petra Dierkes-Thrun's [[Stanford University]] course, Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents (2014), a student named Reed created a blog post that is the basis for much of what follows.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wildedecadence.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/the-differences-between-symbolism-and-decadence/|title=The Differences between Symbolism and Decadence|date=2014-03-03|website=Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Nature ====
Both groups reject the primacy of nature, but what that means for them is very different.  Symbolism uses extensive natural imagery as a means to elevate the viewer to a plane higher than the banal reality of nature itself, as when Stéphane Mallarmé mixes descriptions of flowers and heavenly imagery to create a transcendent moment in "Flowers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/54372|title=Flowers|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|date=|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, in contrast, actually belittles nature in the name of artistry. In Huysmans’ ''Against Nature'', for instance, the main character Des Esseintes says of nature: “There is not one of her inventions, no matter how subtle or imposing it may be, which human genius cannot create . . . There can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is no longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace her by artifice."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Language and Imagery ====
Symbolism treats language and imagery as devices that can only approximate meaning and merely evoke complex emotions and call the mind toward ideas it might not be able to comprehend.  In the words of symbolist poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Languages are imperfect because multiple; the supreme language is missing... no one can utter words which would bear the miraculous stamp of Truth Herself Incarnate... how impossible it is for language to express things... in the Poet's hands... by the consistent virtue and necessity of an art which lives on fiction, it achieves its full efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallarmé|first=Stéphane|year=1956|others=Translated by Bradford Cook|title=from Crisis in Poetry|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0076/mallarme.PDF|journal=Mallarmé: Selected Prose Poems, Essays &amp; Letters|volume=|pages=|via=Scan from an un-cited anthology on Amerhert's website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As Moréas would go on to assert in his manifest on symbolism, words and images serve to dress up the incomprehensible in such a way that it can be approached, if not understood.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mutablesound.com/home/?p=2165|title=Symbolist Manifesto|last=Moréas|first=Jean|date=1886|website=Mutable Sound|others=Translated by C. Liszt|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, sees no path to higher truth in words and images.  Instead, books, poetry, and art itself as the creators of valid new worlds, thus the allegory of decadent Wilde's [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|Dorian Gray]] being poisoned by a book like a drug.  Words and artifice are the vehicles for human creativity, and Huysmans suggests that the illusions of fantasy have their own reality: "The secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply enough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the dream reality for the reality itself."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== On Reality, Illusion, and Truth ====
Both groups are disillusioned with the meaning and truth offered by the natural world, rational thought, and ordinary society.  Symbolism turns its eyes toward Greater Purpose or on the Ideal, using dreams and symbols to approach these esoteric primal truths.  In Mallarme's poem “Apparition”, for instance, the word “dreaming” appears twice, followed by “Dream” itself with a capital D. In “The Windows,” he speaks of this decadent disgust of contentment with comfort and an endless desire for the exotic. He writes: “So filled with disgust for the man whose soul is callous, sprawled in comforts where his hungering is fed.” In this continuing search for the spiritual, therefore, Symbolism has been predisposed to concern itself with purity and beauty and such mysterious imagery as those of fairies.

In contrast, Decadence says there is no oblique approach to ultimate truth, because there is no secret, mystical truth.  They despise the very idea of searching for such a thing.  If there is truth of value, it is purely in the sensual experience of the moment.  The heroes of Decadent novels, for instance, have the unquenchable accumulation of luxuries and pleasure, often exotic, as their goal, would have space in its search for thrills for even the gory and the shocking.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In [[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (book)|''The'' ''Temptation of Saint Anthony'']], decadent [[Gustave Flaubert]] describes Saint Anthony's pleasure from watching disturbing scenes of horror.  Later Czech decadent Arthur Breisky has been quoted by scholars as speaking to both the importance of illusion and of beauty: "But isn’t it necessary to believe a beautiful mask more than reality?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bugge|first=Peter|year=2006|title=Naked Masks: Arthur Breisky or How to Be a Czech Decadent|url=http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/123|journal=Word and Sense: A Journal of Interdisciplinary Theory and Criticism in Czech Studies|volume=|pages=|access-date=19 February 2017|via=Word and Sense website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== On Art ====
Ultimately, the distinction may best be seen in their approach to art. Symbolism is an accumulation of “symbols” that are there not to present their content but to evoke greater ideas that their symbolism cannot expressly utter.  According to Moréas, it is an attempt to connect the object and phenomena of the world to "esoteric primordial truths" that cannot ever be directly approached.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Decadence, on the other hand, is an accumulation of signs or descriptions acting as detailed catalogs of human material riches as well as artifice.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was Oscar Wilde who perhaps lay this out most clearly in ''[[The Decay of Lying]]'' with the suggestion of three doctrines on art, here excerpted into a list:
# "Art never expresses anything but itself."
# "All bad art comes from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating them into ideals."
# "Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life"
After which, he suggested a conclusion quite in contrast to Moréas' search for shadow truth: "Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Abstracts/Wilde_1889.html|title=The Decay of Lying|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=|year=1889|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Collapse of the Decadent Movement ===
In France, the Decadent Movement could not withstand the loss of its leading figures. Many of those associated with the Decadent Movement became symbolists after initially associating freely with decadents.  Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé were among those, though both had been associated with Baju's ''Le Décadent'' for a time.&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt;  Others kept a foot in each camp.  Albert Aurier wrote decadent pieces for ''Le Décadent'' and also wrote symbolist poetry and art criticism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Decadent writer Rachilde was staunchly opposed to a symbolist take over of ''Le Décadent''&lt;ref name="Stephan1974" /&gt; even though her own one-act drama ''The Crystal Spider'' is almost certainly a symbolist work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiebuzinska|first=Christine|year=1994|title=Behind the Mirror: Madame Rachilde's "The Crystal Spider"|url=|journal=Modern Language Studies|volume=24|pages=28–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, once strong voices for decadence, abandoned the movement altogether.  Joris-Karl Huysmans grew to consider ''Against Nature'' as the starting point on his journey into Roman Catholic symbolist work and the acceptance of hope.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Anatole Baju, once the self-appointed school-master of French decadence, came to think of the movement as naive and half-hearted, willing to tinker and play with social realities, but not to utterly destroy them.  He left decadence for anarchy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The Decadent Movement beyond France ===
While the Decadent Movement, per se, was truly a French phenomenon, the impact was felt more broadly.  Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat [[Transgressive fiction|trangressive]] spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Picture of Dorian Gray: An Annotated, Uncensored Edition|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=Harvard University|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Frankel|editor-first=Nicholas|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many were also influenced by the Decadent Movement's aesthetic emphasis on art for its own sake.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Ruth|year=2015|others=Edited by Jane Ford, Kim Edwards Keates, Patricia Pulham|title=Always Leave Them Wanting More: Oscar Wilde's Salmoe and the Failed Cicrulations of Desire|url=|journal=Economies of Desire at the Victorian Fin de Siècle: Libidinal Lives|volume=|pages=21–34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bohemia'''

Czech writers who were exposed to the work of the Decadent Movement saw in it the promise of a life they could never know.  They were neither aristocrats nor bored bourgeoisie.  They were poor and hungry for something better.  The dreams of the decadents gave them that something better, but something that was hopelessly unattainable.  It was that melancholy that drove their art.  These Bohemian decadent writers included [[Karel Hlaváček]], Arnošt Procházka, [[Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic]], and Louisa Zikova.  One Czech writer, [[Arthur Breisky]], embraced the full spirit of ''Le Décadent'' with its exultation in material excess and a life of refinement and pleasure.  From the Decadent Movement he learned the basic idea of a [[dandy]], and his work is almost entirely focused on developing a philosophy in which the Dandy is the consummate human, surrounded by riches and elegance, theoretically above society, just as doomed to death and despair as they.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pynsent|first=Robert|year=1973|title=A Czech Dandy: An Introduction to Arthur Breisky|url=|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review|volume=51|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Britain'''
[[File:Beardsley-peacockskirt.PNG|thumb|upright|Aubrey Beardsley, ''[[The Peacock Skirt]]'', illustration for [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', 1892]]

Though influenced through general exposure but also direct contact, the leading decadent figures in Britain associated with decadence were Irish writer [[Oscar Wilde]], poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], and illustrator [[Aubrey Beardsley]], as well as other artists and writers associated with ''[[The Yellow Book]]''. Others, such as [[Walter Pater]], resisted association with the movement, even though their works seemed to reflect similar ideals.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Decadent Republic of Letters: Taste, Politics, and Cosmopolitan Community from Baudelaire to Beardsley|last=Potolsky|first=Matthew|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2012|isbn=0812244494|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While most of the influence was from figures such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, there was also very strong influence at times from more purely decadent members of the French movement, such as the influence that Huysmans and Rachilde had on Wilde, as seen explicitly in ''The Picture of Dorian Gray''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/october/rachilde-wilde-discovery-10-21-2014.html|title=Rebellious French cross-dresser played an overlooked role in shaping Oscar Wilde's legacy, Stanford scholar says|last=Beacock|first=Ian|date=21 October 2014|website=Stanford News|others=Scholarship by Petra Dierkes-Thrun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British decadents embraced the idea of creating art for its own sake, pursuing all possible desires, and seeking material excess.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  At the same time, they were not shy about using the tools of decadence for social and political purpose. Beardsley had an explicit interest in the improvement of the social order and the role of art-as-experience in inspiring that transformation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;  Oscar Wilde published an entire work exploring socialism as a liberating force: "Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soul of Man Under Socialism|last=Wilde|first=Oscar|publisher=Arthur L. Humphreys|year=1909|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swinburne wrote explicitly addressed Irish-English politics in poetry, as when he wrote, "Thieves and murderers, hands yet red with blood and tongues yet black with lies | Clap and clamour--'Parnell spurs his Gladstone well!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swinburne|first=Algernon Charles|year=1886|title=The Commonweal: A Song for Unionists|url=|journal=A Channel Passage and Other Poems|volume=|pages=|via=Gutenberg Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many of their personal lives, they also pursued decadent ideals.  Wilde had a secret homosexual life.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Swinburne had an obsession with flagellation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

'''Russia'''

[[File:Evfimia Nosova (Ryabushinskaya) by N.Feofilaktov (1913, priv.coll).jpg|thumb|Portrait of {{ill|Euphemia Pavlova Nosova|ru|Носова, Евфимия Павловна}} by {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}]]
The Decadent Movement reached into Russia primarily through exposure to the writings of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine.  The earliest Russian adherents lacked idealism and focused on such decadent themes as subversion of morality, disregard for personal health, and living in blasphemy and sensual pleasure.  Russian writers were especially drawn to the morbid aspects of decadence and in the fascination with death.  Dmitry Merezhkovsky is thought to be the first to clearly promote a Russian decadence that included the idealism that would eventually inspire the French symbolists to disassociate from the more purely materialistic Decadent Movement.  The first Russian writers to achieve success as followers of this Decadent Movement included Konstanin Balmont, [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Valery Bryusov]], and [[Zinaida Gippius]].  As they refined their craft beyond imitation of Baudelaire and Verlaine, most of these authors became much more clearly aligned with symbolism than with decadence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bristol|first=Evelyn|year=1980|title=Idealism and Decadence in Russian Symbolist Poetry|url=|journal=Slavic Review|volume=39|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some visual artists adhered to the Baju-esque late Decadent Movement approach to sexuality as purely an act of pleasure, often ensconced in a context of material luxury.  They also shared the same emphasis on shocking society, purely for the scandal. Among them were [[Konstantin Somov]], {{ill|Nikolai Kalmakov|ru|Калмаков, Николай Константинович}}, and Nikolay Feofilaktov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowlt|first=John E.|year=1982|title=Through the Glass Darkly: Images of Decadence in Early Twentieth-Century Russian Art|url=|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=17|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spain'''

Some art historians consider [[Francisco de Goya]] one of the roots of the Decadent movement in Spain, almost 100 years before its start in France. Their works were a cry of denouncement against injustice and oppression. However, Ramón Casas and José María López Mezquita can be considered the model artists of this period. Their paintings are an image of the social conflicts and police repression that was happening in Spain at the time.
Spaniard writers also wanted to be part of this movement. [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]] with works like [[Los Pazos de Ulloa]] where terror and decadent topics appear. [[El monstruo]] (The Monster), written by [[Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent]] belongs to Decadent Movement. But the Decadent Movement is overlapped by the [[Fin de Siglo Movement]] with the authors of the [[Generación del 98]] being part-decadent: [[Ramón María del Valle-Inclán]], [[Unamuno]] and [[Pío Baroja]] are the most essential figures of this period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Spanish Novel: From 1600 to the Present|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn= 9781139000222 |location=|pages= 138|quote=|via=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-companion-to-the-spanish-novel/decadence-and-innovation-in-fin-de-siglo-spain/DBB78766FF30C8855E20D9F9A59286B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''United States'''

Few prominent writers or artists in the [[United States]] were connected with the Decadent Movement.  Those who were connected struggled to find an audience, for Americans were reluctant to see value for them in what they considered the art forms of [[fin de siècle]] France.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscapes of Decadence: Literature and Place at the Fin de Siècle|last=Murray|first=Alex|publisher=Cambridge|year=2016|isbn=1107169666|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poet [[Francis Saltus Saltus]] was inspired by Charles Baudelaire, and his unpracticed style was occasionally compared to the French poet's more refined experimentation.  He embraced the most debauched lifestyle of the French decadents and celebrated that life in his own poetry.  At the time, mostly before Baju's ''Le Décadent'', this frivolous poetry on themes of alcohol and depravity found little success and no known support from those who were part of the Decadent Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man in the Mirror: William Marion Reedy and His Magazine|last=Putzel|first=Max|publisher=University of Missouri|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=43|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The younger brother of Francis, writer [[Edgar Saltus]] had more success.  He had some interaction with Oscar Wilde, and he valued decadence in his personal life.  For a time, his work exemplified both the ideals and style of the movement, but a significant portion of his career was in traditional journalism and fiction that praised virtue.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decadent Culture in the United States: Art and Literature Against the American Grain, 1890 - 1926|last=Weir|first=David|publisher=State University of New York|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time when he was flourishing, however, multiple contemporary critics, as well as other decadent writers, explicitly considered him one of them.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Writer James Huneker was exposed to the Decadent Movement in France and tried to bring it back with him to New York.  He has been lauded to his dedication to this cause throughout his career, but it has also been suggested that, while he lived as a decadent and heralded their work, his own work was more frustrated, hopeless, and empty of the pleasure that had attracted him to the movement in the first place.  Largely, he focused on cynically describing the impossibility of a true American decadence.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Critical studies ==
German doctor and social critic [[Max Nordau]] wrote a lengthy book entitled ''[[Degeneration (Max Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892).  It was an examination of decadence as a trend, and specifically attacked several people associated with the Decadent Movement, as well as other figures throughout the world who deviated from cultural, moral, or political norms.  His language was colorful and vitriolic, often invoking the worship of Satan.  What made the book a success was its suggestion of a medical diagnosis of "degeneration," a neuro-pathology  that resulted in these behaviors.  It also helped that the book named such figures as Oscar Wilde, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Paul Verlaine, and Maurice Barrès, members of the Decadent Movement who were in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J. A.|first=|year=1895|title=Max Nordau's Degeneration|url=|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Italian art and literature critic [[Mario Praz]] completed a broad study of morbid and erotic literature, translated and published in English as ''The Romantic Agony'' (1933).  The study included decadent writing (such as Baudelaire and Swinburne), but also anything else that he considered dark, grim, or sexual in some way.  His study centered on the 18th and 19th Centuries.  The danger of such literature, he believed it unnaturally elevated the instinctive bond between pain and pleasure and that, no matter the artists' intention, the essential role of art is to educate and teach culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mumford Jones|first=Howard|year=1936|title=Reviewed Work: The Romantic Agony. by Mario Praz, Angus Davidson|url=|journal=Modern Language Notes|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dora Gordine''' (8th June 1895 – 29 December 1991) was an Estonian Jewish [[Modernism|Modernist]] figurative and portraitist sculptor. Her early career was influenced by the [[Young Estonia|Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’)]] group of artists who favoured [[Art Nouveau]]. She moved to Paris and on her second marriage to Hon.Richard Hare (1907–66), her career expanded to the extent that some critics regarded her as amongst the finest sculptors of her generation.&lt;ref name=EJA&gt;In May 1925 Dora exhibited a Bronze (503) at the Salon Nationale (closed at the end of August 1925). She gave her birthplace as 'Libau', her nationality as 'Esthoniene'..." [http://eja.pri.ee/Culture/Gordin%20Dora_en.html Dora Gordine] Estonian Jewish Museum&lt;/ref&gt;She specialized 
in Portrait sculptures attracting international admirers from the: political, social, artistic, literary and theatrical worlds. Her legacy also includes a number of public space pieces. Her latter career was not as prolific or as fated with praise and Gordine was relatively unknown at the time of her death. Major exhibitions in London in 2006 and 2009 have revived her standing and her former home is now a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|publisher=Dorich House Museum|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122005604/http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Early life==
Dora Gordine's childhood has not been well documented. There is confusion over her date of birth with various dates 1895 (likely), 1898 and 1906 mentioned. She was the youngest of four children born to '''Morduch ("Mark") Gordin''' and '''Emma Ester Schepshelewitch''', both Russian Jews, in [[Liepāja|Liepāja, Latvia]], at a time when it was still part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Two of her siblings, Nikolai and Anna, died at the hands of the Nazis in [[Tallinn|Tallinn, Estonia]] in 1941. Another brother, Leopold, escaped and lived in London until his death. The Gordin family evidently belonged to a comfortable middle class. There was money available to pay Gordine’s elder brother, Leopold, to study engineering at [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]]. Later, it seems that Gordine’s father was also prepared to pay for Gordine’s elder sister, Anna, to study at one of Tallinn’s leading art schools.&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Encyclopedia'', 6th edition Gordin Family Document Archive 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. Gordin, application to the Home Secretary for British citizenship, 18 February 1930, HO 144/12019, NAKG&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912 the Gordin family had moved to [[Tallinn|Tallinn, Estonia]]. It is clear that Gordine’s approach to sculpture was considerably shaped by the example of the pre-First World War Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’) a group of artists who championed [[Art Nouveau]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Estonia|last=Lauer|first=M.|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=186-187}}&lt;/ref&gt; She exhibited bronze sculptures in Tallinn in 1917, 1920 and 1921. In the autumn of 1924 she came to [[Paris]] to study a course in [[French civilisation]], improving her knowledge of contemporary French sculptural practice. Then, surrounded by galleries and salons, she "instinctively felt a correlation between the rhythms of music and sculpture" and developed her sculptural vision. Gordin gallicised her surname by adding an “e" perhaps in an effort to make it sound more Russian and always denied or deflected suggestions that she was [[Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;In November 1928 printmaker Diana White asked Esther Pissarro (wife of the painter Lucien), who was Jewish by birth, 'Dora Gordine...is she Jewess? Some of her work...made me think she was...' D. White to E. Pissarro, 2 November 1928, Pissarro Papers, Department of Western Art, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford University [AMO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Mackenzie to F. Pearson, 14 February 1994, Archives, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 she worked as a painter on a mural for the [[British Pavilion]] at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, in Paris. It provided the means to cast a bronze for exhibition at the Beaux Arts Society. The following year she was invited to exhibit at the [[Salon des Tuileries]] where her design of the head &amp; torso of a Chinese philosopher earned enthusiastic reviews; The Straits Times (1932) wrote: "Like Byron, one morning Dora Gordine woke up famous". Between 1929 and 1935 she sculpted bronzes for the [[City Hall, Singapore]]. [[Leicester Galleries]] in [[London]] presented Gordine's sculpture in a solo show in 1928. It was a huge success and all her work was sold, amongst which Javanese Head was bought by [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]] for the [[Tate|Tate Gallery]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;Kwok Kian Chow.

==Marriage==
In 1930 she married her first husband, Englishman Dr [[George Herbert Garlick]] in [[Singapore]]. In 1936 she married her second husband, the Hon. [[Richard Gilbert Hare]] (5 September 1907 – 1966), son of [[Richard Granville Hare, 4th Earl of Listowel]] and Freda Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone on 21 November 1936. Through her marriage she became part of a liberal aristocratic cultural elite, a member of the top ten percent in Britain when three quarters of the nation belonged to the working class.&lt;ref&gt;In 1931 the working class comprised 78% of the British population. Twenty years later this had fallen to 72% though this still constituted of 36 million people. Hennessy P. Having It So Good: Britain in the Fifties (London: Penguin, 2006) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The independent income from Hare allowed Dora to build Dorich House in [[Kingston Vale]], her studio and a showcase for her work. As well as, a showcase for their collections of Indian, Chinese and nineteenth century Russian art and furniture.

==Career==
[[File:Male Torso by Dora Gordine, Senate House, University of London 01.jpg|thumb|''Male Torso'', Dora Gordine, Senate House, University of London.]]
Her husband introduced her to London society figures, many of whom sat for her, Dame [[Edith Evans]], Dame [[Beryl Grey]], [[Dorothy Tutin]], [[Siân Phillips]], [[Emlyn Williams]], Sir [[Kenneth Clark]], [[John Pope-Hennessy]] and Professor F. Brown, Head of the Slade School of Art. There were also overseas commissions including the Philosopher [[Kuu Nim]], whose head sculpture Gordine called 'the Chinese Lady of Peace' and a low-relief at [[Gray's Inn]] to [[Sun Yat-Sen]], the former leader of China.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Jonathan Black,Sculptor, artist, Designer: Sculptor, Designer and Artist, Classical serenity in a Troubled Age: Dora Gordine's Commissions During The 1940's, Philip Wilson (London 2009), {{ISBN|0-85667-644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each portrait head had its own patina according to Gordine's vision of her sitter. When interviewed by the [[BBC]] in 1972 Gordine commented that, ''"when you do portrait busts of somebody you do their noses and mouth – but it is nothing. You have to imagine what they are like inside and bring out their inner feeling and then put it in a form"''.&lt;ref&gt;1972 BBC interview subsequently partly repeated in February 2009 on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Woman's Hour]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Gordine’s career was brought to a halt. She no longer had access to Valsuani’s in Paris, her favourite foundry, and bronze quickly became rationed. All foundries in Britain were ordered stop all non-essential activity and concentrate on war production. It was not until late 1943 or early 1944 that she found a new foundry and was able to have some of her latest bronze work exhibited in the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;D. Gordine to Sir S. Cockerell, 7 October 1945, Cockerell Papers, BL, London.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s/50s Gordine's work was exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the Society of Portrait Sculptors and elsewhere. In October 1945 she had a solo exhibition at the [[Leicester Galleries]], in which [[The Times]] described her as having ‘much ability, though she is eclectic in her inspiration, being influenced by works from many schools and periods - Indian and Egyptian among others. Her best works are her portrait heads in bronze which are convincing and straightforward.’&lt;ref&gt;Times, 6 November 1945, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Bronzes from this time have ironic or humorous titles, relating to the pose, such as 'Great Expectations' or 'Mischief' and, of an RAF Officer, 'Above Cloud'. She was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal British Society of Sculptors]] in 1949. She occasionally did exotic or erotic pieces (e.g. for Elizabeth Choy). She travelled and lectured in [[United States|America]], working in Hollywood, art lecturing and designing film sets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Alicia|title=Tate Women Artists|year=2004|publisher=Tate Publishing|location=London|isbn=1-85437-311-0|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1947 and revisited the USA in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Jonathan Black, sculptor, artist, Designer: Sculptor, Designer and Artist, Philip Wilson (London 2009), {{ISBN|0-85667-644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948 she was commissioned to produce a sculpture to stand in the new mother and baby unit at [[HM Prison Holloway|Holloway Prison]] in north London. 'Happy Baby' was largely forgotten by 2009 languishing in an administration block at the prison for many years. Now regarded as an important piece in 'La Gordine's' professional history it formed the centre piece of an exhibition of her work at [[Kingston University]] in February–March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston University Press Office: Jailbreak Baby Goes On the Run from Holloway&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 [[Esso]] commissioned a 7' x 5' low-relief  'Power' for their new [[Milford Haven Refinery]], which was unveiled by the Duke of Edinburgh. Gordine's last public commission, the 8' long 'Mother and Child' was made for the entrance hall of the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]], Surrey, in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Professor R.Y. Goodden to J. Samson, 5 May 1960, Archives, DHM&lt;/ref&gt;

==Widowhood and Death==
Her husband's sudden death in 1966 from a heart attack left Gordine to live out her life alone in Dorich House. She had no children. As Gordine’s client base became smaller and health problems undermined her ability to work to the standard she had during the 1920s, her eyesight deteriorated and she had arthritis in her shoulders and arms causing her career to end in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Balfour, 'Dora Gordine', Independent, 7 January 1992, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; She had a great interest in her garden and, in particular, herbs and plants used for medicinal purposes, such as Tansy. [[Adrian Howells|Adrian Howes]] and [[Robert Ruthven]] were her part-time gardeners for nearly two years in the mid-seventies. She often invited the members of the [[Royal Ballet School]] to Dorich house to pose for her. She died in Dorich House in December 1991, aged around 96.

In subsequent years her work was to be revived by major exhibitions in London in 2006 at the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] in the [[London Jewish Museum of Art]], and in 2009 at Dorich House and [[Kingston University]].

==Dorich House==
Dorich House was designed by Gordine and completed in 1936. The name chosen for the house was a [[portmanteau]] of Dora and Richard's names. The house is spread across three floors; the ground and first floors devoted to the production and display of Gordine's work, with the upper floor forming the couple's private apartment. In 1994, it was acquired by Kingston University and was refurbished and formally opened as a museum in 1996, housing Gordine's collection of bronze and plaster sculptures and many of her paintings and drawings. There are also items from Hare's Imperial Russian art collection, which includes icons, paintings, ceramics, glassware, metalwork, folk art and furniture dating from the early 18th century to the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|publisher=Dorich House Museum|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122005604/http://www.dorichhousemuseum.org.uk/history.php|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Los Streetscapers Public Art Studios''' is a [[muralist]] [[art collective]] and [[fine art]] studio based in [[East Los Angeles, California]]. Its members have executed over twenty murals and large-scale [[public art]]works, primarily in the [[Los Angeles]] area.

It was founded by Wayne Alaniz Healy and David Rivas Botello in 1975.

Alaniz and Botello met in elementary school, and when in the third grade, collaborated on a mural. However, they lost touch when Botello's family moved to nearby [[City Terrace, California|City Terrace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1969, Botello co-founded Goez Art Studio, "the first" [[Chicano art]] studio,&lt;ref name="Goez"&gt;{{cite web

In 1973, he painted ''Dreams of Flight'', one of the early murals at [[Estrada Courts]].

In 1968, Healy earned Bachelor's degrees in [[aerospace engineering]] and [[mathematics]] from [[Cal Poly Pomona]]. He went on to earn a [[Master's degree|Master's]] in [[mechanical engineering]] from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1973. He began working with Mechicano Art Center in East Los Angeles, and in 1974, painted the mural ''Ghosts of the Barrio'' at the Los Angeles [[housing project]] Ramona Gardens. He has since earned a Master's of Fine Arts from [[California State University, Northridge]] and created numerous [[screen print]]s with [[Self-Help Graphics &amp; Art]].

In 1975 Healy and Botello teamed to form Los Dos Streetscapers. They were soon joined by other artists such as [[George Yepes]], Paul Botello, Rudy Calderon, Rich Raya, Ricardo Duffy, Charles Solares and Fabian Debora, which occasioned the renaming of the group to “East Los Streetscapers.”{{cref | Name change}} While collaborating artists have come and gone, Healy and Botello have remained the core of the group.

In 1990, Healy and Botello founded the Palmetto Gallery to provide exposure for younger artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

East Los Streetscapers have also sponsored projects for [[barrio]] youth.

==Work==
The collective used [[acrylic paint]] as the primary [[Media (arts)|medium]] for their early murals, but later incorporated such media as hand-painted tiles, cast bronze, and porcelain-enameled steel. Murals outside of Los Angeles include projects in [[San Jose, California]], [[Santa Maria, California]], [[Houston, Texas]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[Bellingham, Washington]]. Their work is characterized as "multicultural, strong, dynamic, colorful, site specific, and compositionally dramatic in line and texture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''''Father Serra statues''''' in [[Ventura, California]], consist of four statues of [[Junípero Serra]]: (i) an original made of clay in 1936 by Uno John Palo Kangas (1904–1957); (ii) a concrete version made by Kangas and displayed in front of [[Ventura County Courthouse|Ventura City Hall]] from 1936 to 1989; (iii) a wood replica created by local carvers from 1987 to 1988 and displayed in the atrium of City Hall since 1988; and (iv) a bronze cast made in 1989 and displayed in front of City Hall since October 1989.

All four versions of the ''Father Serra'' statue were nine feet, four inches in height. They depict Father Serra standing with his head facing to the left and wearing a Franciscan [[cassock]] with [[cowl]], sandals, and a rope belt (or [[cincture]]), a [[rosary]] hanging from the belt, a book in his left hand, and a walking stick (or staff) in his right hand.

In 1974, the original concrete ''Father Serra statue'' was designated as Ventura Historic Landmark No. 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of San Buenaventura Historic Landmarks &amp; Districts|publisher=City of Ventura|date=May 3, 2016|accessdate=April 15, 2018|url=https://www.cityofventura.ca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/7730}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public display of Serra statuary has been a source of controversy, particularly among those alleging that Father Serra was responsible for the suppression of the culture of [[Chumash people]].

==Junípero Serra==
{{main|Junípero Serra}}
Junípero Serra was a [[Roman Catholic]] Spanish [[Catholic priest|priest]] and [[friar]] of the [[Franciscan Order]] who founded nine [[Spanish missions in California]]. In 1782, Serra founded [[Mission San Buenaventura]], his ninth and final mission, on a site that became [[Ventura, California]]. In September 2015, Serra was [[canonised]] as a saint by [[Pope Francis]], drawing national attention to Ventura's Father Serra statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Latino Catholics See Reflection in a Friar Set for Sainthood|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 15, 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/us/latino-catholics-see-reflection-in-a-friar-set-for-sainthood.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kangas' original works==
In 1935, Uno John Palo Kangas (1904–1957), a sculptor born in Finland and raised in Michigan, was commissioned by Ventura County and the [[Works Progress Administration]] to create a statue of Father Serra as part of the [[Federal Art Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Replication of the Father Serra Statue: A Community Volunteer Project|author=Catherine Antolino Mervyn|publisher=Catherine Antolino Mervyn|isbn=1403309884|year=2002|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kangas was paid $5,000 for his work.&lt;ref name=LAT89/&gt; Kangas had gained some acclaim in 1935 for a heroic statue of a [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] worker titled "Conservation of Man and Nature" that was installed at [[Griffith Park]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sculptor Will Depict C.C.C. Youths in Camp|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 26, 1935|page=II-2|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19333039/roosevelt_may_unveil_work_sculptor/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The clay sculpture===
[[File:John Palo-Kangas with Father Serra statue.png|thumb|right|Kangas posing in 1936 with his original clay sculpture]]
Kangas began by visiting the Santa Barbara and Ventura Missions to study images of Serra and to learn about his life and style of dress.  He also made multiple sketches in preparation for the work.&lt;ref&gt;"Comparison of Three Statues", a paper by Shirley Week (Kangas' daughter), October 9, 1990, p. 3, contained in Serra Statue ephemera file at the Research Library of the Ventura County Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculpting process began with the creation of a full-size clay model; the clay model took four months to complete and was built at Kangas' studio at 3929 Fountain Avenue in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=LAT36/&gt; The clay sculpture was built around a frame of wood and chicken wire which Kangas then covered with layers of clay.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a contemporary of the artist, Kangas used Meiners Oak resident Gordon Douglas as a model for the face of Serra.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1936, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published on its front page a large photograph (shown to the right) of Kangas posing with the clay sculpture.&lt;ref name=LAT36&gt;{{cite news|title=Fra Serra Clay Statue Finished by Sculptor|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 26, 1936|page=1|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19279430/fra_serra_clay_statue_finished_by/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disposition of the original clay sculpture is unknown.  However, a newspaper story from April 1938 suggests that the original clay model may have been loaned to a museum in [[Butte, Montana]], for an exhibition on scale models of sculpture. The story announced: "'Fray Junipero Serra', by John Palo-Kangas, one of the scale models of sculpture to be shown at the Butte Art Center, beginning on April 21st, is in the original at the Ventura county courthouse at San Buenaventura, Calif."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Art Center To Show Sculpture|newspaper=Montana Standard|date=April 17, 1938|page=5|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19339283/art_center_to_show_sculpture/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concrete sculpture===
Kangas next built a breakaway mold of the clay sculpture using plaster of paris. The mold was placed in front of the courthouse, and a scaffolding was built around the mold.&lt;ref name=Mervyn6/&gt;  Kangas gathered sand and gravel from the [[Ventura River]],&lt;ref name=LAT89/&gt; which he used to make a concrete aggregate material that he poured on location into the mold.&lt;ref name=Mervyn6/&gt; After the concrete hardened, the mold was removed and Kangas smoothed the outer surface.&lt;ref name=Mervyn6&gt;Mervyn p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 27, 1936, Kangas' concrete sculpture was unveiled in front of the [[Ventura County Courthouse]] (later converted to Ventura City Hall). The unveiling ceremony was attended by Kangas, Governor [[Frank Merriam]], Mayor George A. Newell, Jr., and other notable persons. In his speech, Gov. Merriam said: "A beautiful statue is about to be made visible, exemplifying the spirit of this pioneering priest – noble, brave and holy – a patriot of patriots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Merriam Pays High Honor to Father Serra|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 28, 1936|page=7|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19279533/merriam_pays_high_honor_to_father_serra/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Concrete Father Serra Statue at OST yard in Ventura, April 2018.jpg|thumb|right|The concrete Father Serra statue in April 2018 stored outdoors in a wooden crate at the OST yard]]

Kangas' concrete statue remained in front of the courthouse/city hall for more than 50 years from 1936 to 1989. By the 1980s, it had deteriorated from years of exposure to Ventura's salt air and from the pooling of rainwater in the collar of the statue's robe, which formed a natural basin. In addition, the statue was painted by a vandal or vandals, and the City responded by sandblasting the statue, damaging the statue's smooth outer layer and accelerating the decay.&lt;ref name=LAT89/&gt;

The statue was removed from its pedestal in September 1989 to make room for installation of the bronze cast.&lt;ref name=LAT89/&gt; At the time of the removal, the City planned to store the concrete statue at the Hilford Moving and Storage building until the completion of a planned farm implements museum, where the concrete statue was to be installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra ending tour of duty: 53-year-old Downtown statue being replaced|newspaper=Ventura Star-Free Press|author=Jim McLain|date=July 2, 1989|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the statue never made it to the Hilford facility, and the farm implements museum was delayed when its chief proponent, Bob Pfeiler, became ill.&lt;ref name=Tale&gt;{{cite news|title=A tale of the three Father Serra statues|newspaper=Oxnard Star|author=Kim Lamb Gregory|date=June 1, 2001|pages=E1, E6|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the concrete statue was discovered by a reporter for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in a scrap yard operated by Oilfield Service &amp; Trucking Company (OST) along Ventura Avenue.&lt;ref name=LAT96&gt;{{cite news|title=Buried Treasure: Original Statue of Father Junipero Serra Found in Scrap Yard|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Hilary E.

===Deterioration and plans for replacement===
[[File:Head from Father Serra statue (wood).jpg|thumb|right|Close-up of head from wooden replica]]

Ownership of the concrete statue passed from Ventura County to the City of Ventura in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Ventura City Councilman Russell Burns, a mechanical engineer, presented a report to the City Council describing the deterioration of the statue and concluding that the statue "in the not too distant future will fall apart."&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The City in 1984 commissioned studies of the statue by an art conservator, an engineering firm, and a concrete expert.&lt;ref name=Mervyn13&gt;Mervyn p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  The studies reached the conclusion that the statue should be moved inside and that the statue was too fragile to be copied by molding.&lt;ref name=Mervyn13/&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT87/&gt;

Based on the findings, Councilman Burns proposed the creation of a wood replica of the statue which could then be used as a mold for a permanent bronze cast to be displayed in place of the decaying concrete statue.&lt;ref name=Mervyn13/&gt; In 1986, Burns' proposal was unanimously adopted by the Ventura City Council.  The City fronted an initial sum of $15,000 to begin the process, and local boosters also raised more than $100,000 through the sale of limited edition 18-inch bronze replicas (hand-tooled by Charles Kubilos),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former engineer creates Serra replicas|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|author=Brett Pauly|date=November 3, 1989|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serra statue stands tall|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=May 23, 1988|page=A1|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; posters/lithographs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra posters added to drive: $20 commemorative will help pay for statue repair|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|author=Michael Marlow|date=August 17, 1987|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lithographs available of Junipero Serra statue|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=October 14, 1989|via=The Museum of Ventura County ("Junipero Serra Statue" biographical file)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and T-shirts, hats, and pins bearing the phrase "I Support the Serra Statue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church Members on Mission to Get City's Serra Statue|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Tracy Wilson|date=November 1, 1995|pages=B1, B4|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19259992/church_members_on_mission_to_get_citys/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kids, corporations back Serra statue fund drive|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=May 27, 1988|page=A3|author=Michael E.

===Creation of the wooden replica===
The reproduction process began by taking precise measurements of all aspects of the concrete statue, using 1,782 points of reference.&lt;ref name=LAT87/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a book written on the process, "more than 4,000 charts, drawings, grids, and photographs were made from the measurements."&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Master carver Wilbur Rubottom and a team of 16 carvers from the Channel Islands Carvers club then painstakingly created the wood replica in a studio at the old livery building on Palm Street in Ventura.&lt;ref name=LAT87&gt;{{cite news|title=Transformation: Retired Cabinetmaker's Rendering of Father Serra Helps Resurrect a Statue Ravaged by Sea Air, Time|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Jesse Katz|date=October 29, 1987|page=IX-1, IX-6|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19261559/transformation_father_serra_statute/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mervyn&gt;Mervyn pp. 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wooden Serra statue replica taking shape Downtown|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|author=John Krist|date=April 23, 1987|page=D1|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serra statue reborn sans fanfare|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|author=Michael E.

The carving took 14 months from April 1987 to June 1988.  In all, 10,000 man hours were dedicated to creating the wood replica.&lt;ref name=Mervyn/&gt; The wood replica was installed at the atrium of Ventura City Hall on October 7, 1988.&lt;ref name=VCFP88&gt;{{cite news|title=New Serra no longer homeless: Dedication marks placement at City Hall|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=October 21, 1988|page=A5|author=Michael E.

===The bronze cast===
[[File:View of Father Serra Statue and California Street from steps of Ventura City Hall.jpg|thumb|Serra statue from City Hall]]
In 1988, the City of Ventura accepted a $17,000 bid from a group of student artists at the California Sculpture Center at [[College of the Desert]] in Palm Desert to create a bronze cast of the sculpture using the wood replica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra Pact OK'd|newspaper=Oxnard Press Courier|author=Jim Schultz|date=March 22, 1988|pages=1–2|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of the student artists visited the wood statue at the old livery building and made latex molds in multiple sections.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze figure was then cast in 20 pieces using the "lost wax" method.&lt;ref name=DP89&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra sculpture being recast at COD|newspaper=Desert Post|date=May 26, 1989|page=6|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19279292/father_serra_sculpture_being_recast_at/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATPD&gt;{{cite news|title=Palm Desert Sculpture School to Cast Bronze Copy of Junipero Serra Statue|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 24, 1988|page=IX-5|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19279371/palm_desert_sculpture_school_to_cast/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bronze cast was unveiled in front of Ventura City Hall at a ceremony on October 20, 1989, attended by more than 500 persons.&lt;ref name=LAT89&gt;{{cite news|title=Father Serra's Statute Gets New Life – in Bronze|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Bob Pool|date=October 19, 1989|pages=J1, J5|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19261090/father_serras_statute_gets_new_life/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bronze statue of Fray Serra in place|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=October 21, 1989|page=A3|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze cast stands on a concrete base with an outer layer of polished black granite from the Andes Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1989, the bronze cast has been on display in the middle of a pedestrian island at the top of California Street overlooking downtown Ventura and the Pacific Ocean. A plaque at the base of the statue states: "The citizens of the City of San Buenaventura gratefully recognize the extraordinary efforts of Councilman Russell Burns (1918–1994) and master carver Wilbur Rubottom (1914–1993) to replace the decaying concrete 1936 statue of Father Serra by John Palo-Kangas with this cherished bronze copy dedicated on October 20, 1989."&lt;ref&gt;Plaque displayed at the base of the Father Serra statue.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and vandalism==
[[File:Chumash petroglyph murals and wooden Father Serra statue.jpg|thumb|right|Chumash petroglyph murals and wooden ''Father Serra'' statue at Ventura City Hall]]
The City's plan to display the wooden replica in the atrium of Ventura City Hall was met with objections from the city art committee and the Candelaria American Indian Council. Members of the art committee felt the statue was too large to be placed in the atrium, and the Indian Council objected due to Father Serra's alleged abuse and enslavement of the [[Chumash people]]. The objectors did not prevail, though the City also commissioned a series of murals reproducing local Chumash petroglyphs which were installed next to the wooden Serra statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serra Statue to Be Shown Over Protests of 2 Groups|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|author=Jesse Katz|date=September 29, 1988|pages=IX-1, IX-14|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19261987/serra_statue_to_be_shown_over_protests/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VCFP88/&gt;

Ventura's ''Serra'' statues have also been subjected to vandalism over the years. In May 1980, primer paint was poured over the concrete statue; city workers sandblasted the paint from the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fouled figure|newspaper=unknown|date=May 22, 1980|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1991, four glass jars full of orange and blue paint were thrown at the bronze cast; the words "Spirit of Crazy Horse" and an image of a clenched fist were also spray-painted on the sidewalk at the base of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vandalized statue of Serra unscathed|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=January 16, 1991|author=Jim McLain|page=A4|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (biographical file for the ''Junipero Serra'' statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1992, the bronze cast's hand was painted with red paint, and a message was stenciled on the concrete below accusing Serra of having failed to honor God and claiming that Serra was a symbol of slavery to Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scarlet letters|newspaper=The Ventura County Star-Free Press|date=May 24, 1992|page=A3|via=Research Library at the Ventura County Museum (clippings file for the Serra statue)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some continue to object to the public display of Serra statuary, citing the mistreatment of the Chumash people. Following Serra's canonization in 2015, ''Serra'' statues were vandalized at [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo|Carmel Mission]] (smeared with green paint, "Saint of Genocide" written on a headstone),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mission statue of Serra sustains damage|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 28, 2015|page=4|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19318173/mission_statue_of_serra_sustains_damage/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]'s Lower Presidio Historic Park (decapitated),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/28/head-reattached-to-st-junipero-serra-statue-in-monterey/|title=Head reattached to St. Junipero Serra statue in Monterey|newspaper=The Mercury News|date=February 28, 2017|author=James Herrera}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mission San Fernando Rey de España|San Fernando Mission]] (hands painted red and word "murderer" scrawled),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St. Junipero Serra statue vandalized in Mission Hills|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 20, 2017|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-junipero-serra-vandalized-mission-hills-20170820-story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mission Santa Barbara]] (decapitated and covered in red paint),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decapitated and doused with red paint: Vandals target St. Junipero Serra statue at Santa Barbara mission|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 24, 2017|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-junipero-serra-statue-vandalized-santa-barbara-20170914-htmlstory.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel|San Gabriel Mission]] (cut with electric saw and splashed with red paint).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vandal damages Padre Serra statue in San Gabriel|newspaper=Ventura County Star|date=November 3, 2017|url=https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2017/11/03/vandal-damages-padre-serra-statue-san-gabriel/831785001/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, amid the controversy over public display and vandalism of ''Serra'' statues, the ''[[Ventura County Star]]'' published an editorial calling for the removal of ''Serra'' statues. The author of the editorial, Rellis Smith, wrote: "To have statues such as the one in front of Ventura City Hall is a direct slap in the face of all Chumash and other Native American cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remove Serra statues|newspaper=Ventura County Star|author=Rellis Smith|date=August 15, 2017|url=https://www.vcstar.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/08/15/remove-serra-statues/571088001/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''File sharing''' is the practice of distributing or providing access to [[digital media]], such as computer programs, [[multimedia]] (audio, images and video), documents or [[E-book|electronic books]]. File sharing may be achieved in a number of ways. Common methods of [[Computer data storage|storage]], [[Data transmission|transmission]] and dispersion include manual sharing utilizing removable media, centralized servers on [[computer network]]s, World Wide Web-based [[hyperlink]]ed documents, and the use of distributed [[peer-to-peer]] networking.

==Types==

===Peer-to-peer file sharing===
[[Peer-to-peer file sharing]] is based on the [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) application architecture. [[Shared resource|Shared files]] on the computers of other [[User (system)|users]] are indexed on directory servers. P2P technology was used by popular services like [[Napster]] and [[Limewire]]. The most popular protocol for P2P sharing is [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]].

===File sync and sharing services===
[[Cloud computing|Cloud-based]] [[file synchronization|file syncing and sharing]] services implement automated file transfers by updating files from a dedicated sharing directory on each user's networked devices. Files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and mobile app, and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or collaboration. Such services have become popular via consumer-oriented [[file hosting service]]s such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]] and [[Google Drive]].

[[rsync]] is a more traditional program released in 1996 which synchronizes files on a direct machine-to-machine basis.

[[Data synchronization]] in general can use other approaches to share files, such as [[distributed filesystem]]s, [[version control]], or [[Web mirror|mirrors]].

==History==
{{Main|File sharing timeline}}
&lt;!-- pre-1999 --&gt;Files were first exchanged on [[removable media]]. Computers were able to access remote files using [[filesystem]] mounting, [[bulletin board systems]] (1978), [[Usenet]] (1979), and [[FTP]] servers (1985). [[Internet Relay Chat]] (1988) and [[Hotline Communications|Hotline]] (1997) enabled users to communicate remotely through [[online chat|chat]] and to exchange files. The [[mp3]] encoding, which was standardized in 1991 and substantially reduced the size of [[Audio file format|audio files]], grew to widespread use in the late 1990s. In 1998, [[MP3.com]] and [[Audiogalaxy]] were established, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] was unanimously passed, and the first [[Portable media player|mp3 player]] devices were launched.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In June 1999, [[Napster]] was released as an unstructured centralized peer-to-peer system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KeIENcC2BPwC&amp;pg=PA532&amp;lpg=PA532&amp;dq=napster+first#PPA532,M1 |title=Reliable distributed systems: technologies, Web services, and applications - Kenneth P. Birman - Google Books |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905151657/https://books.google.com/books?id=KeIENcC2BPwC&amp;pg=PA532&amp;lpg=PA532&amp;dq=napster+first#PPA532,M1 |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring a central server for indexing and peer discovery. It is generally credited as being the first peer-to-peer file sharing system.

[[Gnutella]], [[eDonkey2000]], and [[Freenet]] were released in 2000, as MP3.com and Napster were facing litigation. [[Gnutella]], released in March, was the first decentralized file sharing network. In the gnutella network, all connecting software was considered equal, and therefore the network had no [[Single point of failure|central point of failure]]. In July, [[Freenet]] was released and became the first anonymity network. In September the [[eDonkey2000]] client and server software was released.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2001, [[Kazaa]] and [[Poisoned]] for the Mac was released. Its [[FastTrack]] network was distributed, though unlike gnutella, it assigned more traffic to 'supernodes' to increase routing efficiency. The network was proprietary and encrypted, and the Kazaa team made substantial efforts to keep other clients such as [[Morpheus (computer program)|Morpheus]] off of the FastTrack network.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In July 2001, Napster was sued by several recording companies and lost in [[A&amp;M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title=RIAA Sues Music Startup Napster for $20 Billion | date=December 9, 1999 | publisher=MP3 Newswire | url=http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/napster.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601112815/http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/napster.html | archivedate=June 1, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Napster, it has been ruled that an online service provider could not use the "transitory network transmission" safe harbor in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] if they had control of the network with a server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/p2p_copyright_wp.php |title=EFF: What Peer-to-Peer Developers Need to Know about Copyright Law |publisher=W2.eff.org |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115034129/http://w2.eff.org/IP/P2P/p2p_copyright_wp.php |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after its loss in court, Napster was shut down to comply with a court order. This drove users to other P2P applications and file sharing continued its growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Menta | first=Richard | title=Napster Clones Crush Napster.

Until its decline in 2004, Kazaa was the most popular file sharing program despite bundled [[malware]] and legal battles in the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States. In 2002, a Tokyo district court ruling shut down File Rogue, and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) filed a lawsuit that effectively shut down Audiogalaxy.

[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstrators protesting [[The Pirate Bay raid]] in 2006]]

From 2002 through 2003, a number of [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] services were established, including [[Suprnova.org]], [[isoHunt]], [[TorrentSpy]], and [[The Pirate Bay]]. In 2002, the RIAA was filing lawsuits against Kazaa users. As a result of such lawsuits, many universities added file sharing regulations in their school administrative codes (though some students managed to circumvent them during after school hours). With the shutdown of eDonkey in 2005, eMule became the dominant client of the eDonkey network. In 2006, police raids took down the [[Razorback2]] eDonkey server and temporarily took down [[The Pirate Bay]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

“The File Sharing Act was launched by Chairman Towns in 2009, this act prohibited the use of applications that allowed individuals to share federal information amongst one another. On the other hand, only specific file sharing application were made available to federal computers” (United States.Congress.House). In 2009, the [[Pirate Bay trial]] ended in a guilty verdict for the primary founders of the tracker. The decision was appealed, leading to a second guilty verdict in November 2010. In October 2010, Limewire was forced to shut down following a court order in [[Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC]] but the gnutella network remains active through open source clients like [[Frostwire]] and [[gtk-gnutella]]. Furthermore, multi-protocol file sharing software such as [[MLDonkey]] and [[Shareaza]] adapted in order to support all the major file sharing protocols, so users no longer had to install and configure multiple file sharing programs.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Public opinion of file sharing==
In 2004 there were an estimated 70 million people participating in online file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html |title=Law professors examine ethical controversies of peer-to-peer file sharing|last = Delgado |first = Ray |work=Stanford Report |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=March 17, 2004 |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625030926/http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html |archivedate=June 25, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[CBS News]] poll in 2009, 58% of [[United States|Americans]] who follow the file sharing issue, considered it acceptable "if a person owns the music CD and shares it with a limited number of friends and acquaintances"; with 18- to 29-year-olds this percentage reached as much as 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml |title=Poll: Young Say File Sharing OK |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=January 20, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130162846/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml |archivedate=November 30, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his survey of file-sharing culture, Caraway (2012) noted that 74.4% of participants believed musicians should accept file sharing as a means for promotion and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1216/720|title = Survey of File-Sharing Culture|date = 2012|accessdate = November 25, 2015|website = [[International Journal of Communication]]|publisher = [[USC Annenberg Press]], [[Creative Commons license]] (by-nc-nd)|last = Caraway|first = Brett Robert |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090451/http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1216/720|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact==
According to David Glenn, writing in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', "A majority of economic studies have concluded that file sharing hurts sales".&lt;ref name="HigherEdu"&gt;Glenn, David. Dispute Over the Economics of File Sharing Intensifies, ''[[Chronicle.com]]'', July 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review by Professor Peter Tschmuck found 22 [[independent study|independent studies]] on the effects of music file sharing. "Of these 22 studies, 14 – roughly two-thirds – conclude that unauthorized downloads have a 'negative or even highly negative impact' on recorded music sales. Three of the studies found no significant impact while the remaining five found a positive impact."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Terry. [http://www.copyhype.com/2012/02/more-evidence-for-copyright-protection/ More Evidence for Copyright Protection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205093806/http://www.copyhype.com/2012/02/more-evidence-for-copyright-protection/ |date=February 5, 2012 }}, copyhype.com, February 1, 2012. "The literature review looked at a 23rd study but did not classify it here since the author presented a mixed conclusion: the overall effect of unauthorized downloads is insignificant, but for unknown artists, there is a 'strongly negative' effect on recorded music sales."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AJ Sokolov, Daniel .

A study by economists [[Felix Oberholzer-Gee]] and Koleman Strumpf in 2004 concluded that music file sharing's effect on sales was "statistically indistinguishable from zero".&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;Levine, Robert.

"In many creative industries, monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative. Data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers. Since the advent of file sharing, the production of music, books, and movies has increased sharply."&lt;ref&gt;Oberholzer &amp; Strumpf.

"[T]his figure includes re-releases, new compilations of existing songs, and new digital-only versions of catalog albums. SoundScan has also steadily increased the number of retailers (especially non-traditional retailers) in their sample over the years, better capturing the number of new releases brought to market. What Oberholzer and Strumpf found was better ability to track new album releases, not greater incentive to create them."&lt;ref&gt;Friedlander, Joshua P. &amp; Lamy, Jonathan.

A 2006 study prepared by Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz, published by [[Industry Canada]], was "unable to discover any direct relationship between P2P file-sharing and CD purchases in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/h_ip01456e.html The Impact of Music Downloads and P2P File-Sharing on the Purchase of Music: A Study for Industry Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914010619/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/ippd-dppi.nsf/en/h_ip01456e.html |date=September 14, 2008 }}, Birgitte Andersen and Marion Frenz&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this survey were similarly criticized by academics and a subsequent revaluation of the same data by Dr. George R.

Only 25% of people say they would not have bought the music if it were not available on P2P for free." Barker thus concludes; "This clearly suggests P2P network availability is reducing music demand of 75% of music downloaders which is quite contrary to Andersen and Frenz's much published claim."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, George R.

===Market dominance===
A paper in journal ''[[Operations Research: A Journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences|Management Science]]'' found that file sharing decreased the chance of survival for low ranked albums on music charts and increased exposure to albums that were ranked high on the music charts, allowing popular and well known artists to remain on the music charts more often. This had a negative impact for new and less known artists while promoting the work of already popular artists and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharjee, Sudip., Gopal, Ram D., Lertwachara, Kaveepan. Marsden, James R. &amp; Telang, Rahul. [http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/53/9/1359.full.pdf+html The Effect of Digital Sharing Technologies on Music Markets: A Survival Analysis of Albums on Ranking Charts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214152135/http://mansci.journal.informs.org/content/53/9/1359.full.pdf+html |date=February 14, 2012 }} ''Management Science'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study that examined pre-release file sharing of music albums, using BitTorrent software, also discovered positive impacts for "established and popular artists but not newer and smaller artists." According to Robert G. Hammond of [[North Carolina State University]], an album that leaked one month early would see a modest increase in sales. "This increase in sales is small relative to other factors that have been found to affect album sales."

&lt;blockquote&gt;"File-sharing proponents commonly argue that file sharing democratizes music consumption by 'leveling the playing field' for new/small artists relative to established/popular artists, by allowing artists to have their work heard by a wider audience, lessening the advantage held by established/popular artists in terms of promotional and other support. My results suggest that the opposite is happening, which is consistent with evidence on file-sharing behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Hammond. Robert G. "[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rghammon/Hammond_File_Sharing_Leak.pdf Profit Leak? Pre-Release File Sharing and the Music Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523032458/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rghammon/Hammond_File_Sharing_Leak.pdf |date=May 23, 2012 }}" May 2012. File sharing benefits mainstream albums such as pop music but not albums in niche genres such as indie music. ... Further, the finding that file sharing redistributes sales toward established/popular artists is inconsistent with claims made by proponents of file sharing that file sharing democratizes music consumption."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Billboard'' cautioned that this research looked only at the pre-release period and not continuous file sharing following a release date. "The problem in believing [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|piracy]] helps sales is deciding where to draw the line between legal and illegal ... Implicit in the study is the fact that both buyers and sellers are required in order for pre-release file sharing to have a positive impact on album sales. Without iTunes, Amazon and Best Buy, file-sharers would be just file sharers rather than purchasers. If you carry out the 'file sharing should be legal' argument to its logical conclusion, today's retailers will be tomorrow's file-sharing services that integrate with their respective cloud storage services."&lt;ref&gt;Peoples, Glenn.

===Availability===
Many argue that file-sharing has forced the owners of entertainment content to make it more widely available legally through fee or advertising on demand on the internet. In a 2011 report by [[Sandvine]] showed that [[Netflix]] traffic had come to surpass that of [[Bittorrent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/epicenter/2011/05/SandvineGlobalInternetSpringReport2011.pdf Global Internet Phenomena Report - Spring 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113020428/http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/epicenter/2011/05/SandvineGlobalInternetSpringReport2011.pdf |date=January 13, 2012 }} Sandvine Global Internet Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

==Copyright issues==
{{main|Legal aspects of file sharing}}
File sharing raises copyright issues and has led to many lawsuits. In the [[United States]], some of these lawsuits have even reached the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]]. For example, in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.|MGM v. Grokster]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that the creators of P2P networks can be held liable if their software is marketed as a tool for copyright infringement.

On the other hand, not all file sharing is illegal. Content in the [[public domain]] can be freely shared. Even works covered by [[copyright]] can be shared under certain circumstances. For example, some artists, publishers, and [[record label]]s grant the public a license for unlimited distribution of certain works, sometimes with conditions, and they advocate [[free content]] and file sharing as a promotional tool.

'''''Finn's Hotel''''' is a posthumously-published collection of ten short narrative pieces written by Irish author [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/14/james-joyce-collection-published James Joyce's 'last undiscovered' collection to be published | Books | theguardian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Written in 1923, the works were not published until 2013 by [[Ithys Press]], who claimed the work to be a precursor to Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.&lt;ref name=ithyspress&gt;[http://ithyspress.wordpress.com/2013/06/14/finns-hotel-by-james-joyce-first-edition-just-published/ "''Finn's Hotel'' by James Joyce"], ''Ithys Press''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
Ithys Press published their fine arts edition of ''Finn's Hotel'' in June 2013.&lt;ref name=ithyspress /&gt; The edition was arranged with a preface by Danis Rose, an introduction by [[Seamus Deane]], featuring eleven illustrations by [[Casey Sorrow]], and design and letterpress printed by Michael Caine.

The publication attracted controversy as some Joyce scholars labeled the works as drafts, not meant for publication.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/09/specials/joyce-lost.html A Lost Work by Joyce Fuels Scholarly Debate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2013/06/ithys-press-to-release-10-lost-james-joyce-works.html Ithys Press to Release 10 Lost James Joyce Works as Finn's Hotel :: Books :: News :: Paste&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbook.com/literature-nerds-freaking-out-about-lost-james-joyce-collection/ Literature Nerds Freaking Out About ‘Lost’ James Joyce Collection | BlackBook&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the spring of 2014, James O'Sullivan wrote an article for Genetic Joyce Studies, “Finn’s Hotel and the Joycean Canon”, which uses computational stylistics to analyze the text of ''Finn's Hotel'' to determine whether the text is merely early drafts or should be part of Joyce's canon.  O'Sullivan concluded that "the fragments within ''Finn’s Hotel'' are most likely drafts for what became ''Finnegans Wake''" and that statistically "the criticisms of Ithys Press are seemingly upheld."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=James|title=Using stylometry to weigh in on the Finn’s Hotel debate|url=http://josullivan.org/using-stylometry-to-weigh-in-on-the-finns-hotel-debate/|website=http://josullivan.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13712">The '''Getty Conservation Institute''' (GCI), located in [[Los Angeles, California]], is a program of the [[J. Paul Getty Trust]]. It is headquartered at the [[Getty Center]] but also has facilities at the [[Getty Villa]], and commenced operation in 1985.&lt;ref name=GCI&gt;J. Paul Getty Trust. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/institute/ About the Conservation Institute.] Retrieved May 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The GCI is a private international research institution dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. It "serves the conservation community through scientific research, education and training, model field projects, and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field" and "adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust: service, philanthropy, teaching, and access."&lt;ref name=GCI/&gt; GCI has activities in both [[art conservation]] and [[architectural conservation]].&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Adams, Eric. The Getty's conservation mission. ''Architecture'', December 1997, vol. 86, issue 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

GCI conducts scientific research related to art conservation. It offers formal education and training programs, and it has published a number of scholarly books.  GCI has supported field projects around the world to preserve cultural heritage.

== Scientific projects ==
GCI scientists study the deterioration of objects and buildings, and how to prevent or stop such deterioration.&lt;ref name=GCIScience&gt;Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/science/about/ About GCI Science.] Retrieved August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of many projects in this area involved the effect of outdoor and indoor air pollutants on museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/science/pollutants/index.html Pollutants in the museum environment (1985-1998).] Retrieved August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another project analyzed the cause of deterioration of the [[sandstone]] in the original National Capitol Columns now at the [[United States National Arboretum]].&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

In addition, GCI "conducts scientific research on materials' composition."&lt;ref name=GCIScience/&gt; For example, a project on the conservation of photographs has as one of its objectives the creation of an "Atlas of Analytical Signatures of [[List of photographic processes|Photographic Processes]]" which will provide "a precise chemical fingerprint of all the 150 or so ways pictures have been developed."&lt;ref&gt;Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/science/photocon/ Research on the conservation of photographs.] October 2006. Retrieved November 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Randy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/arts/design/01kenn.html Arsenic and old photos.] ''New York Times'', April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of that project, Getty scientists once examined the world's first photograph from nature by [[Nicéphore Niépce]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyden, Jacki, and Dusan Stulik.

Scientists at GCI viewed the CheMin instrument aboard the [[Curiosity rover]], currently exploring the [[Gale crater]] on [[Mars]], as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient works of art without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on ''Curiosity'' directs a beam of [[X-rays]] at particles as small as 400&amp;nbsp;µm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=inXitu Press Release |url=http://www.inxitu.com/new/pdf/NASA%20invention%20of%20the%20year%20award%20v2.pdf |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |publisher=[[InXitu]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803081352/http://www.inxitu.com/new/pdf/NASA%20invention%20of%20the%20year%20award%20v2.pdf |archivedate=August 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reads the [[radiation]] [[scattering|scattered]] back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the ''X-Duetto''. Fitting into a few [[briefcase]]-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity.

== Education and training ==
Training of interested parties around the world is important for the sustainability of GCI's work.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; For example, GCI collaborated with other organizations to create a course "to assist museum personnel in safeguarding their collections from the effects of natural and human-made emergencies."&lt;ref&gt;Getty Conservation Institute. [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/education/teamwork/ Teamwork for Integrated Emergency Management.] Retrieved August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, GCI developed a course on the "Fundamentals of the Conservation of Photographs" which is now taught in eastern Europe by the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava and the Slovak National Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/education/about/|title=About GCI Education|publisher=Getty Trust|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides courses and workshops, GCI has also been involved with long-term education programs, such as establishing a [[Master's degree]] program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in collaboration with the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;A.M.H.S. New conservation program. ''Archaeology'', May/June 1999, vol. 52, issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotsen Institute of Archaeology.

== Field projects ==
GCI's field projects are "selected based on how they fit the institute's goals of raising public awareness, contributing new, broadly applicable information to the field, and supporting cultural heritage" and "must be executed in collaboration with partners… who must be serious about their efforts… so that projects are assured of continuing after the Getty's involvement ceases."&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; Among other completed GCI field projects were efforts to preserve the [[Mogao Caves]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]] in China (announced in 1989);&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David S.

== Dissemination of information ==
It has been stated that "perhaps the institute's most profound contribution to conservation is the dissemination of information and methods learned in the field."&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt; Methods of information dissemination include conferences; lectures; books; and online publications, newsletters, video, and audio.&lt;ref&gt;Getty Conservation Institute.

'''''Hope''''' is a [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] [[oil painting]] by the English painter [[George Frederic Watts]], who completed the first two versions in 1886. Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a [[lyre]] that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with hope to make the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in ''Hope'' was greatly admired, at the time of its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. ''Hope'' proved popular with the [[Aesthetic Movement]], who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in [[platinotype]], and later cheap [[carbon print]]s, soon began to be sold.

Although Watts received many offers to buy the painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works to the nation and felt it would be inappropriate not to include ''Hope''. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the [[South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.

As cheap reproductions of ''Hope'', and from 1908 high-quality prints, began to circulate in large quantities, it became a widely popular image. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] displayed a copy at his [[Sagamore Hill (house)|Sagamore Hill]] home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time ''Hope'' was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the [[Tate Gallery]] ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.

Despite the decline in Watts's popularity, ''Hope'' remained influential. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] based a 1959 sermon, now known as ''Shattered Dreams'', on the theme of the painting, as did [[Jeremiah Wright]] in Chicago in 1990. Among the congregation for the latter was the young [[Barack Obama]], who was deeply moved. Obama took "The Audacity of Hope" as the theme of his [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address]], and as the title of his [[The Audacity of Hope|2006 book]]; he based his successful [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]] around the theme of "Hope".

==Background==
[[File:Watts – Felix on the Bat.jpg|left|thumb|Watts's frontispiece for ''Felix on the Bat'', [[Nicholas Felix]] (Nicholas Wanostrocht), 1845|alt=Cricketer riding a giant bat]]
[[George Frederic Watts]] was born in London in 1817, the son of a musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict [[evangelical Christianity]] led to both a deep knowledge of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient enough as an artist to earn a living as a portrait painter and [[cricket]] illustrator.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|pp=21–22}} Aged 18 he gained admission to the [[Royal Academy schools]], although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=22}} In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate [[Alexander Constantine Ionides]] to copy a portrait of his father by [[Samuel Lane]]; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=23}}

In 1843 he travelled to Italy where he remained for four years.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}} On his return to London he suffered from depression and painted a number of notably gloomy works.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=29}} His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=33}} His portraits were extremely highly regarded.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=33}} In 1867 he was elected a [[Royal Academician]], at the time the highest honour available to an artist,{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}}{{efn-ua|In Watts's time, honours such as knighthoods were only bestowed on presidents of major institutions, not on even the most well-respected artists.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}} In 1885 serious consideration was given to raising Watts to the peerage; had this happened, he would have been the first artist thus honoured.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=69}} In the same year, he refused the offer of a [[baronetcy]].{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}}}} although he rapidly became disillusioned with the culture of the Royal Academy.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=40}} From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects;{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}} by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=xi}} In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at [[Little Holland House]], which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=42}} In 1884 a selection of 50 of his works was shown at New York's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=42}}

Hope is traditionally considered by Christians as a [[Theological virtues|theological virtue]] (a virtue associated with the [[Grace in Christianity|grace of God]], rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=11}}{{efn-ua|The anchor in some Christian depictions of Hope is a reference to {{Bibleverse|Hebrews|6:19|KJV}}, "Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil."{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=11}}}}

During Watts's lifetime, European culture had begun to question the concept of hope.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=11}} A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=11}} The [[Long Depression]] of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, and the importance of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=30}}

[[File:Dorothy Dene.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=curly-haired woman|Dorothy Dene c.&amp;nbsp;1885]]
In late 1885 Watts's adopted daughter Blanche Clogstoun had just lost her infant daughter Isabel to illness,{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=220}} and Watts wrote to a friend that "I see nothing but uncertainty, contention, conflict, beliefs unsettled and nothing established in place of them."&lt;ref name="WyndhamLetter"&gt;Letter from Watts to Madeline Wyndham, 8 December 1885, now in the Tate Archives, quoted {{harvnb|Tromans|2011|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Watts set out to reimagine the depiction of Hope in a society in which economic decline and environmental deterioration were increasingly leading people to question the notion of progress and the existence of God.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=31}}{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=12}}{{efn-ua|[[G. K. Chesterton]], in his 1904 biography of Watts, attempted to describe the attitudes of artists who felt themselves surrounded by ugliness, in a culture in which what had previously been political and religious certainties had been thrown into turmoil by scientific and social developments. 'The attitude of that age&amp;nbsp;[...] was an attitude of devouring and concentrated interest in things which were, by their own system, impossible or unknowable. Men were, in the main, agnostics: they said, "We do not know"; but not one of them ever ventured to say, "We do not care." In most eras of revolt and question, the sceptics reap something from their scepticism: if a man were a believer in the eighteenth century, there was Heaven; if he were an unbeliever, there was the Hell-Fire Club. But these men restrained themselves more than hermits for a hope that was more than half hopeless, and sacrificed hope itself for a liberty which they would not enjoy; they were rebels without deliverance and saints without reward. There may have been and there was something arid and over-pompous about them: a newer and gayer philosophy may be passing before us and changing many things for the better; but we shall not easily see any nobler race of men. And its supreme and acute difference from most periods of scepticism, from the later Renaissance, from the Restoration and from the hedonism of our own time was this, that when the creeds crumbled and the gods seemed to break up and vanish, it did not fall back, as we do, on things yet more solid and definite, upon art and wine and high finance and industrial efficiency and vices. It fell in love with abstractions and became enamoured of great and desolate words.'{{sfn|Chesterton|1904|p=12}}}}

Other artists of the period had already begun to experiment with alternative methods of depicting Hope in art. Some, such as the upcoming young painter [[Evelyn De Morgan]], drew on the imagery of [[Psalm 137]] and its description of exiled musicians refusing to play for their captors.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=13}} Meanwhile, [[Edward Burne-Jones]], a friend of Watts who specialised in painting mythological and allegorical topics, in 1871 completed the [[Modello|cartoon]] for a planned [[stained glass]] window depicting Hope for St Margaret's Church in [[Hopton-on-Sea]].{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=13}}{{efn-ua|Burne-Jones created multiple versions of his ''Hope'' design throughout the rest of his life. Other than the Hopton window itself, significant versions of the work include an 1877 watercolour now in the [[Dunedin Public Art Gallery]], and an 1896 oil painting now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=13}}}} Burne-Jones's design showed Hope upright and defiant in a prison cell, holding a [[Aaron's rod|flowering rod]].{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=13}}

Watts generally worked on his allegorical paintings on and off over an extended period, but it appears that ''Hope'' was completed relatively quickly. He left no notes regarding his creation of the work, but his close friend Emilie Barrington noted that "a beautiful friend of mine", almost certainly [[Dorothy Dene]], modelled for ''Hope'' in 1885.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=16}} (Dorothy Dene, née Ada Alice Pullen, was better known as a model for [[Frederic Leighton]] but is known to have also modelled for Watts in this period. Although the facial features of ''Hope'' are obscured in Watts's painting, her distinctive jawline and hair are both recognisable.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=16}}) By the end of 1885 Watts had settled on the design of the painting.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=17}}

''Hope'' shows its central character alone, with no other human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=12}} She is dressed in [[Classical antiquity|classical]] costume, based on the [[Elgin Marbles]];{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=12}} Nicholas Tromans of [[Kingston University]] speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=12}} Her pose is based on that of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Night (Michelangelo)|Night]]'', in an intentionally strained position.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=135}} She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=13}}{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=19}} The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer is the source of light.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=60}} Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition of shapes, creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with [[pastel]] work than with oil painting.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=222}}

The design bears close similarities to Burne-Jones's ''Luna'' (painted in watercolour 1870 and in oils {{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1872–1875), which also shows a female figure in classical drapery on a globe surrounded by clouds.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=13}} As with many of Watts's works the style of the painting was rooted in the European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement, but also drew heavily on the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] of painting.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=39}} Other works which have been suggested as possible influences on ''Hope'' include Burne-Jones's ''The Wheel of Fortune'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1870),{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=14}}{{efn-ua|The best known version of ''The Wheel of Fortune'' is the 1883 version now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], which bears little resemblance to ''Hope''.

[[File:Watts – Idle Child of Fancy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Idle Child of Fancy''|alt=naked child sitting on a globe holding a bow and arrow]]
''Hope'' is closely related to ''Idle Child of Fancy'', completed by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of the virtues, Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in ''Hope'' and ''Idle Child'' Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=14}} It is believed to be the first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=14}}

The figure of Hope holds a broken [[lyre]], based on an ancient Athenian wood and tortoiseshell lyre then on display in the British Museum.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=14}}{{efn-ua|British Museum item number 1816,0610.501; the lyre was sold to the museum by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] in 1816. {{Asof|2016}} the lyre remains on public display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=463837&amp;partId=1&amp;people=97339&amp;peoA=97339-3-17&amp;page=1|title=Lyre|publisher=The British Museum|accessdate=24 September 2016|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Although broken musical instruments were a frequently occurring motif in European art, they had never previously been associated with Hope.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=14}}{{efn-ua|Since antiquity the unstrung lyre had been considered a symbol of separated lovers and unrequited love.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=15}} The use of the unstrung lyre as symbolic of separated lovers dates back at least to the early Roman Empire. [[Petronius]]'s ''[[Satyricon]]'', written in the first century A.D., mentions a visit to an art gallery by the narrator Encolpius in which he sees a painting of Apollo holding an unstrung lyre in tribute to his recently-deceased lover [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]].{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=15}}}} Hope's lyre has only a single string remaining, on which she attempts to play.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=15}}{{efn-ua|Playing musical instruments using only a single string had been popularised in the early 19th century by [[Niccolò Paganini]]. It is not certain whether Watts was intentionally aiming to evoke a sense of ostentatious virtuosity in ''Hope''.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=14–15}}}} She strains to listen to the sound of the single unbroken string, symbolising both persistence and fragility, and the closeness of hope and despair.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=135}} Watts had recently shown interest in the idea of a continuity between the visual arts and music, and had previously made use of musical instruments as a way to invigorate the subjects of his portraits.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=220}}

Above the central figure shines a single small star at the very top of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of the central figure herself.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=15–16}} The distance of the star from the central figure, and the fact that it is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=16}}

Although the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] was traditionally the most prestigious venue for English artists to display their new material, Watts chose to exhibit ''Hope'' at the smaller [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. In 1882 the Grosvenor Gallery had staged a [[retrospective exhibition]] of Watts's work and he felt an attachment to the venue.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=19}} Also, at this time the Grosvenor Gallery was generally more receptive than the Royal Academy to experimentation.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=19}} ''Hope'' was given the prime spot in the exhibition, in the centre of the gallery's longest wall.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=19}}

Watts's use of colour was an immediate success with critics; even those who otherwise disliked the piece were impressed by Watts's skilful use of colour, tone and harmony. Its subject and Watts's technique immediately drew criticism from the press.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=20}} ''[[The Times]]'' described it as "one of the most interesting of [Watts's] recent pictures" but observed that while "in point of colour Mr.&amp;nbsp;Watts has seldom given us anything more lovely and delicate&amp;nbsp;... and there is great beauty in the drawing, though it must be owned that the angles are too many and too marked".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Grosvenor Gallery |day_of_week=Monday |date=3 May 1886 |page_number=7 |issue=31749 |column=A }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Portfolio''&lt;!-- Don't wikilink unless an article's written, the existing [[Portfolio Magazine]] article is about an unrelated magazine from the 1970s --&gt; praised Watts's ''Repentance of Cain'' but thought ''Hope'' "a poetic but somewhat inferior composition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 1886|title=Art Chronicle|journal=The Portfolio|location=London|page=84|url=https://archive.org/stream/portfolioh17hame/portfolioh17hame_djvu.txt|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Child]] of ''[[The Fortnightly Review]]'' dismissed ''Hope'' as "a ghastly and apocalyptic allegory",&lt;ref name="Child"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Child|first=Theodore|date=June 1886|title=Pictures in London and Paris|journal=The Fortnightly Review|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London|volume=45|issue=39|page=789}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|In the same review, Child described Watts's ''The Soul's Prison'' as a "sinister spider's web of red and green slime".&lt;ref name="Child" /&gt;}} while the highly regarded critic [[Claude Phillips]] considered it "an exquisite concept, insufficiently realised by a failed execution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Claude|date=July 1886|title=Correspondence d'Angleterre|journal=Gazette des Beaux-Arts|location=Paris|page=76|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|"C'est une pensée exquise, insuffisamment mise en évidence par une exécution défaillante."}}

Despite its initial rejection by critics, ''Hope'' proved immediately popular with many in the then-influential [[Aesthetic Movement]], who considered beauty the primary purpose of art.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=20}}{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=26}} Watts, who saw art as a medium for moral messages, strongly disliked the doctrine of "art for art's sake",{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=19}} but the followers of Aestheticism greatly admired Watts's use of colour and symbolism in ''Hope''.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=20–21}} Soon after its exhibition poems based on the image began to be published, and [[platinotype]] reproductions—at the time the photographic process best able to capture subtle variations in tone—became popular.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=21}} The first platinotype reproductions of ''Hope'' were produced by [[Henry Herschel Hay Cameron]], son of Watts's close friend [[Julia Margaret Cameron]].{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=21}}

===Religious interpretations===
[[File:Watts – Mammon.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Hope'' was interpreted by some as a companion to ''[[Mammon (painting)|Mammon]]'' (1885).|alt=fat guy sitting on some naked people]]
Because ''Hope'' was a work that was impossible to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous,{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=223}} and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=21}} Scottish theologian [[P. T. Forsyth]] felt that ''Hope'' was a companion to Watts's 1885 ''[[Mammon (painting)|Mammon]]'' in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them in the absence of faith.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=34}} Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=34}} Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=34}}

Watts's supporters claimed that the image of ''Hope'' had near-miraculous redemptive powers.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=60–61}} In his 1908 work ''Sermons in Art by the Great Masters'', [[Stoke Newington]] Presbyterian minister James Burns wrote of a woman who had been walking to the Thames with the intention of suicide, but had passed the image of ''Hope'' in a shop window and been so inspired by the sight of it that rather than attempting suicide she instead emigrated to Australia.{{sfn|Burns|1908|p=17}} In 1918 Watts's biographer [[Henry William Shrewsbury]] wrote of "a poor girl, character-broken and heart-broken, wandering about the streets of London with a growing feeling that nothing remained but to destroy herself" seeing a photograph of ''Hope'', using the last of her money to buy the photograph, until "looking at it every day, the message sank into her soul, and she fought her way back to a life of purity and honour".{{sfn|Shrewsbury|1918|p=64}} When [[music hall]] star [[Marie Lloyd]] died in 1922 after a life beset with alcohol, illness and depression, it was noted that among her possessions was a print of ''Hope''; one reporter observed that among her other possessions, it looked "like a good deed in a naughty world".{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=62}}

Watts himself was ambivalent when questioned about the religious significance of the image, saying that "I made Hope blind so expecting nothing",{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=34}} although after his death his widow [[Mary Fraser Tytler|Mary Seton Watts]] wrote that the message of the painting was that "Faith must be the companion of Hope. Faith is the substance, the assurance of things hoped for, because it is the evidence of things not seen."{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=34}} Malcolm Warner, curator of the [[Yale Center for British Art]], interpreted the work differently, writing in 1996 that "the quiet sound of the lyre's single string is all that is left of the full music of religious faith; those who still listen are blindfolded in the sense that, even if real reasons for Hope exist, they cannot see them; Hope remains a virtue, but in the age of scientific materialism a weak and ambiguous one".{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=135}}

[[File:Watts – Faith, Hope &amp; Charity.jpg|right|thumb|upright=.9|''Faith, Hope and Charity'' (1900) showed Hope with her lyre restrung, joining forces with Love to restrain Faith.|alt=a woman with a sword is restrained by two other women]]
In 1900, shortly before his death, Watts again painted the character in ''Faith, Hope and Charity'' (now in the [[Hugh Lane Gallery]], Dublin). This shows her smiling and with her lyre restrung, working with Love to persuade a blood-stained Faith to sheath her sword; Tromans writes that "the message would appear to be that if Faith is going to resume her importance for humanity&amp;nbsp;... it will have to be in a role deferential to the more constant Love and Hope."{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=35}}

==Second version==
By the time ''Hope'' was exhibited, Watts had already committed himself to donate his most significant works to the nation, and although he received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include ''Hope'' in this donation, in light of the fact that it was already being considered one of his most important pictures.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=21}} In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated to the nation allowing him to sell the original.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=21}} Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=21–22}} The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}}

In late 1886 this second version was one of nine paintings donated to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in the first instalment of Watts's gift to the nation.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}} Meanwhile, the original was briefly displayed in Nottingham before being sold to the [[steam tractor]] entrepreneur [[Joseph Ruston]] in 1887.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}} Its whereabouts was long unknown until in 1986 it was auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] for £869,000 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|869000|1986|r=-5}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}), 100 years after its first exhibition.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=64}}

On their donation to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts were hung on the staircase leading to the library,{{efn-ua|Not all staff at the South Kensington Museum welcomed Watts's gift; an internal memo of the time commented that "it is very difficult to deal with a man like this who has a very great idea of his own genius and in whom a ''great many'' of the public also believe".{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=36}}}} but ''Hope'' proved a popular loan to other institutions as a symbol of current British art. At the [[Royal Jubilee Exhibition]] of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. ''Hope'', only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=9}} It was then exhibited at the 1888 [[Melbourne Centennial Exhibition]] and the 1889 [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]].{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=49}} In 1897 it was one of the 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created [[Tate Gallery|National Gallery of British Art]] (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain);{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=9}} at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works.{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=5}} The Tate Gallery considered ''Hope'' one of the highlights of their collection and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=37}}

===Other painted versions===
Needing funds to pay for his new house and studio in [[Compton, Guildford|Compton, Surrey]], now the [[Watts Gallery]], Watts produced further copies of ''Hope'' for private sale. A small {{convert|66|by|50.8|cm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} version was sold to a private collector in Manchester at some point between 1886 and 1890,{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}} and was exhibited at the Free Picture Exhibition in [[Canning Town]] (an annual event organised by [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel Barnett]] and [[Henrietta Barnett]] in an effort to bring beauty into the lives of the poor{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=23}}) in 1897.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=24}} It is now in the [[Iziko South African National Gallery]], Cape Town.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=28}} Another version, in which Watts included a rainbow surrounding the central figure to reduce the bleakness of the image, was bought by Richard Budgett&lt;!-- Don't wikilink unless he gets an article, the existing article is on someone different --&gt;, a widower whose wife had been a great admirer of Watts,{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}} and remained in the possession of the family until 1997.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=66}} Watts gave his initial [[oil sketch]] to Frederic Leighton; it has been in the collection of the [[Walker Art Gallery]], Liverpool since 1923.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=66}} Watts is thought to have painted at least one further version, but its location is unknown.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}}

==Legacy==
[[File:Hollyer – platinotype of Watts's Hope.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Platinotype by Frederick Hollyer|alt=blurry photograph of a blindfolded girl sitting on an orange]]
Although [[Victorian painting]] styles went out of fashion soon after Watts's death, ''Hope'' has remained extremely influential. Mark Bills, curator of the Watts Gallery, described ''Hope'' as "the most famous and influential" of all Watts's paintings and "a jewel of the late nineteenth-century Symbolist movement".{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=7}} In 1889 socialist agitator [[John Burns]] visited Samuel and Henrietta Barnett in Whitechapel, and  saw a photograph of ''Hope'' among their possessions. After Henrietta explained its significance to him, efforts were made by the coalition of workers' groups which were to become the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to recruit Watts. Although determined to stay outside of politics, Watts wrote in support of striking [[busman|busmen]] in 1891, and in 1895 donated a chalk reproduction of ''Hope'' to the [[Missions to Seamen]] in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] in support of London dock workers.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=33}} (This is believed to be the red chalk version of ''Hope'' now in the Watts Gallery.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=33}}) The passivity of Watts's depiction of Hope drew criticism from some within the socialist movement, who saw her as embodying an unwillingness to commit to action.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=59}} The prominent art critic [[Charles Lewis Hind]] also loathed this passivity, writing in 1902 that "It is not a work that the robust admire, but the solitary and the sad find comfort in it. It reflects the pretty, pitiable, forlorn hope of those who are cursed with a low vitality, and poor physical health".{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=60}}

Henry Cameron's platinotype reproductions of the first version of ''Hope'' had circulated since the painting's exhibition, but were slow to produce and expensive to buy. From the early 1890s photographer [[Frederick Hollyer]] produced large numbers of cheap platinotype reproductions of the second version,{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=35}} particularly after Hollyer formalised his business relationship with Watts in 1896.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=35–36}} Hollyer sold the reproductions both via [[printsellers]] around the country and directly via catalogue, and the print proved extremely popular.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=36}}

[[File:Flaming June, by Frederic Lord Leighton (1830-1896).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Flaming June]]'', Frederic Leighton (1895)|alt=sleeping woman dressed in orange]]
In 1895 Frederic Leighton based his painting ''[[Flaming June]]'', which also depicted Dorothy Dene,{{sfn|Monahan|2016|p=69}} on the composition of Watts's ''Hope''.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}} ''Flaming June'' kept the central figure's pose, but showing her as relaxed and sleeping.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}} Dene had worked closely with Leighton since the 1880s, and was left the then huge sum of £5000 (about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|5000|1896|r=-5}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) in Leighton's will when he died the following year.{{sfn|Robbins|2016|p=71}}{{efn-ua|As well as the £5000 Leighton bequeathed directly to Dene, he left a further £5000 to support her siblings, three of whom had also on occasion modelled for him.{{sfn|Robbins|2016|p=71}}}} By this time, ''Hope'' was becoming an [[cultural icon|icon]] of English popular culture, propelled by the wide distribution of reproductions;{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=36}} in 1898, a year after the opening of the Tate Gallery, its director noted that ''Hope'' was one of the two most popular works in their collection among students.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=37}}{{efn-ua|The only painting in the Tate collection considered as popular was [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]'s ''[[Beata Beatrix]]''.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=37}}}}

As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential [[modernism|Modernist movement]] drew its inspiration from [[Paul Cézanne]] and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=11}} Watts drew particular dislike from English critics, and ''Hope'' came to be seen as a passing fad, emblematic of the excessive sentimentality and poor taste of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=51}} By 1904 author [[E. Nesbit]] used ''Hope'' as a symbol of poor taste in her short story ''The Flying Lodger''&lt;!-- Not 'The New Treasure Seekers'; she repeated the phrase there, but she first used it in 'The Flying Lodger'. --&gt;,{{efn-ua|"All the walls were white plaster, the furniture was white deal—what there was of it, which was precious little. There were no carpets—only white matting. And there was not a single ornament in a single room! There was a clock on the dining-room mantel-piece, but that could not be counted as an ornament because of the useful side of its character. There were only about six pictures—all of a brownish colour. One was the blind girl sitting on an orange with a broken fiddle. It is called Hope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nesbit|first=Edith|authorlink=E. Nesbit|title=Delphi Complete Novels of E.

Although Watts's work was seen as outdated and sentimental by the English Modernist movement, his experimentation with Symbolism and [[Expressionism]] drew respect from the European Modernists, notably the young [[Pablo Picasso]], who echoed ''Hope's'' intentionally distorted features and broad sweeps of blue in ''[[The Old Guitarist]]'' (1903–1904).{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=40}}&lt;ref name="tate.org"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|year= 2004 |url = http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/where-theres-life-theres|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040911091622/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue2/wherethereslife.htm|archivedate=11 September 2004|title = Where there's life there's|work = [[Tate Etc.]]| accessdate = 12 March 2010 | last=Barlow| first= Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Watts's fading reputation at home, by the time of his death in 1904 ''Hope'' had become a globally recognised image. Reproductions circulated in cultures as diverse as Japan, Australia and Poland,{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=49}} and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], President of the United States, displayed a reproduction in his [[Summer White House]] at [[Sagamore Hill (house)|Sagamore Hill]].{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=49}} By 1916, ''Hope'' was well-known enough in the United States that the stage directions for [[Angelina Weld Grimké]]'s ''[[Rachel (play)|Rachel]]'' explicitly use the addition of a copy of ''Hope'' to the set to suggest improvements to the home over the passage of time.{{sfn|Grimké|1920|p=31}}{{efn-ua|''Time:'' October sixteenth, four years later; seven o'clock in the morning. ''Scene:'' The same room. There have been very evident improvements made. The room is not so bare; it is cosier&amp;nbsp;[...] Hanging against the side of the run that faces front is Watts's "Hope".{{sfn|Grimké|1920|p=31}}}}

Some were beginning to see it as embodying sentimentality and bad taste, but ''Hope'' continued to remain popular with the English public. In 1905 ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' noted that it was the most popular picture in the Tate Gallery, and remarked that "there are few print-sellers who fail to exhibit it in their windows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 1905|title=Which Are the Most Popular Pictures? II.—In the Tate Gallery|journal=The Strand Magazine|publisher=George Newnes|location=London}}, reproduced {{harvnb|Tromans|2011|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Watts's death the Autotype Company purchased from Mary Seton Watts the rights to make [[carbon print]] copies of ''Hope'', making reproductions of the image affordable for poorer households,{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=51}} and in 1908 engraver [[Emery Walker]] began to sell full-colour [[photogravure]] prints of ''Hope'', the first publicly available high-quality colour reproductions of the image.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=51–52}}

In 1922 the American film ''[[Hope (1922 film)|Hope]]'', directed by [[Lejaren Hiller, Sr.|Legaren à Hiller]] and starring [[Mary Astor]] and [[Ralph Faulkner]], was based on the imagined origins of the painting. In it Joan, a fisherman's wife, is treated poorly by the rest of her village in her husband's absence, and has only the hope of his return to cling to. His ship returns but bursts into flames, before he is washed up safe and well on shore. The story is interspersed with scenes of Watts explaining the story to a model, and with stills of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=g-XquihcZB8|title=''Hope'' (1922)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Tromans|2011|pp=54–55}} By the time the film was released, the fad for prints of ''Hope'' was long over, to the extent that references to it had become verbal shorthand for authors and artists wanting to indicate that a scene was set in the 1900s–1910s.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=52}} Watts's reputation continued to fade as artistic tastes changed, and in 1938 the Tate Gallery removed their collection of Watts's works from permanent display.{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=7}}

===Later influence===
[[File:Watts – Hope stamp Jordan 1974 low res.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Jordanian 30 fils stamp, 1974|alt=Postage stamp featuring the "Hope" image and words in English and Arabic]]
Despite the steep decline in Watts's popularity, ''Hope'' continued to hold a place in popular culture,{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=220}} and there remained those who considered it a major work. When the Tate Gallery held an exhibition of its Watts holdings in 1954, trade unionist and left-wing M.P. [[Percy Collick]] urged "Labour stalwarts" to attend the exhibition, supposedly privately recounting that he had recently met a Viennese Jewish woman who during "the terrors of the Nazi War" had drawn "renewed faith and hope" from her photographic copy.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=59}}{{efn-ua|The truth of this story is unconfirmed. It does not appear in any of Collick's writings, and first appeared in a 1975 biography of Watts by Wilfred Blunt&lt;!-- Don't link unless he gets an article, the existing [[Wilfred Blunt]] is someone unconnected --&gt; based on private conversation between Blunt and Collick.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=59}}}} Meanwhile, an influential 1959 sermon by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], now known as ''Shattered Dreams'', took ''Hope'' as a symbol of frustrated ambition and the knowledge that few people live to see their wishes fulfilled, arguing that "shattered dreams are a hallmark of our mortal life", and against retreating into either apathetic cynicism, a fatalistic belief in God's will or escapist fantasy in response to failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/shattered-dreams|title=Shattered Dreams|last=King|first=Martin Luther|year=1959|publisher=The King Center|accessdate=25 September 2016|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myths continued to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of ''Hope'', and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the [[Six-Day War]], the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops.&lt;ref name="tate.org" /&gt; There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem from the fact that in early 1974, shortly after the [[Yom Kippur War]] between Israel and Egypt, the image of ''Hope'' appeared on Jordanian postage stamps.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=62}}{{efn-ua|The use of ''Hope'' on Jordanian stamps was not a response to military defeat, but had been planned well before the war took place;{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=62}} it was one of a series of stamps issued by Jordan in 1974 depicting noteworthy European paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jordanpost.com.jo/?page_id=2121|title=Jordan Stamp 1974|year=2015|work=Jordan Post|accessdate=28 September 2016|location=Amman|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002073800/http://jordanpost.com.jo/?page_id=2121|archivedate=2 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a token force of Jordanian troops participated in the Yom Kippur War, their presence was symbolic and there was an agreement between Israel and Jordan that their forces would not engage with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ofer Aderet |title=Jordan and Israel cooperated during Yom Kippur War, documents reveal |newspaper=Haaretz |date=12 September 2013 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.546843}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Likewise, it is regularly claimed that [[Nelson Mandela]] kept a print of ''Hope'' in his cell on [[Robben Island]], a claim for which there is no evidence.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=62}}

In 1990 [[Barack Obama]], at the time a student at [[Harvard Law School]], attended a sermon at the [[Trinity United Church of Christ]] preached by [[Jeremiah Wright]].{{sfn|Obama|1995|p=292}}{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=63}}{{efn-ua|Obama's ''Dreams From My Father'' places him as attending this sermon in 1988 before entering Harvard Law School, but Wright's own records show that the sermon was delivered in 1990.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=74}} In mid-1990 Obama worked as an [[associate attorney]] at the Chicago firm of [[Hopkins &amp; Sutter]] so was in the city at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Aguilar, Louis |date = 11 July 1990 |title = Survey: Law firms slow to add minority partners |newspaper = Chicago Tribune |page = 1 (Business) |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/28774085.html?dids=28774085:28774085&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT |accessdate = 15 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama admits in the preface to ''Dreams From My Father'' that the chronology of events in the book is unreliable.{{sfn|Obama|1995|p=xvii}}}} Taking the [[Books of Samuel]] as a starting point, Wright explained that he had studied Watts's ''Hope'' in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s (Sampson described it as "a study in contradictions"), before discussing the image's significance in the modern world.{{sfn|Obama|1995|p=292}}{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=63}}

{{quote|text=The painting depicts a harpist, a woman who at first glance appears to be sitting atop a great mountain. Until you take a closer look and see that the woman is bruised and bloodied, dressed in tattered rags, the harp reduced to a single frayed string. Your eye is then drawn down to the scene below, down to the valley below, where everywhere are the ravages of famine, the drumbeat of war, a world groaning under strife and deprivation. It is this world, a world where cruise ships throw away more food in a day than most residents of Port-au-Prince see in a year, where white folks' greed runs a world in need, apartheid in one hemisphere, apathy in another hemisphere&amp;nbsp;... That's the world! On which hope sits!&amp;nbsp;[...] And yet consider once again the painting before us. Hope! Like Hannah, that harpist is looking upwards, a few faint tones floating upwards towards the heavens. She dares to hope&amp;nbsp;... she has the audacity&amp;nbsp;... to make music&amp;nbsp;... and praise God&amp;nbsp;... on the one string&amp;nbsp;... she has left!

In particular, Obama misremembered Wright's phrase "The Audacity to Hope" as "The Audacity of Hope".{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=74}}}}}}

Wright's sermon left a great impression on Obama, who recounted Wright's sermon in detail in his memoir ''[[Dreams from My Father]]''.{{sfn|Obama|1995|pp=292–293}} Soon after ''Dreams From My Father'' was published he went into politics, entering the [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|Illinois Senate]]. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]]. In Obama's 2006 memoir ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'', he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety of people he had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve their own lives and to serve their country.{{sfn|Obama|2006|p=356}}
{{quote|text=It wasn't just the struggles of these men and women that had moved me. Rather, it was their determination, their self-reliance, a relentless optimism in the face of hardship.

[[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|Obama's speech]], on the theme of "The Audacity of Hope", was extremely well received. Obama was [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004|elected to the U.S. Senate]] later that year, and two years later published a second volume of memoirs, also titled ''The Audacity of Hope''. Obama continued to campaign on the theme of "hope", and in his [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]] his staff requested that artist [[Shepard Fairey]] amend the wording of an independently produced poster he had created, combining an image of Obama and the word {{smallcaps|progress}}, to instead read {{smallcaps|hope}}.&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;Ben Arnon, "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ben-arnon/how-the-obama-hope-poster_b_133874.html How the Obama "Hope" Poster Reached a Tipping Point and Became a Cultural Phenomenon: An Interview With the Artist Shepard Fairey]", ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', 13 October 2009.

The '''Instant Pot''' is a brand of [[kitchen appliance]]s. The brand's original and primary products are electronically controlled, combined [[pressure cooker]]s and [[slow cooker]]s. The original cookers are marketed as 7-in-1 appliances designed to consolidate the cooking and preparing of food to one device ([[multicooker]]). The brand has since expanded to include non-pressure slow cookers, [[sous-vide]] immersion circulators, and blenders.

==History==
The concept of a multi-purpose cooker has been around since 2006 with the patent from the [[Midea Group]], which would go on to manufacture the Instant Pot,&lt;ref name="cagc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2015/54204r-eng.php|title=Double Insight Inc. recalls Instant Pot Smart Pressure Cooker|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the function and simple structure of what would become the Instant Pot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Electric pressure cooker patent|date=2007-06-30|url=http://www.google.com/patents/CN2904886Y|accessdate=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Robert Wang, Yi Quin, and one other friend, all former employees of [[Nortel]] in Ottawa, Canada, started working on designs for the Instant Pot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-growth/ottawa-entrepreneurs-instant-pot-has-attracted-a-devoted-following-of-home-cooks/article33804422/|title=Ottawa entrepreneur’s Instant Pot has attracted a devoted following of home cooks|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wang is credited as the inventor of the Instant Pot. This beginning model operated as a [[pressure cooker]], [[slow cooker]], rice / [[porridge]] cooker, yogurt maker, [[sauté]] / [[searing]] pan, [[food steamer|steamer]], and food warmer.&lt;ref name="margaretinc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/201706/margaret-rhodes/double-insight-instant-cooking-pot-design-awards-2017.html|title=Fired From His Own Startup, This Founder Invented Amazon's Hit Product of 2016|date=2017-05-15|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model was under development for 18 months.

==Double Insight==
Double Insight Inc was founded by Robert Wang, Yi Quin, and three other partners in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39058736|title=How a cooker developed a cult following|last=Murphy|first=Jessica|date=2017-03-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the distributor and designers of the Instant Pot. &lt;ref name="cagc"/&gt; Wang has a PhD in [[computer science]] with a specialty in [[artificial intelligence]].

The company became profitable in 2012, with the Instant Pot as their main product. In 2016, Double Insight sold more than 215,000 Instant Pots on Amazon's [[Prime Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2185161|title=Amazon&amp;nbsp;— Press Room&amp;nbsp;— Press Release|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/instant-pot-electric-pressure-cooker-recipes.html|title=Why Do Cooks Love the Instant Pot?

===Recalls===
In July 2015 the Instant Pot Smart-60 cooker was recalled, affecting about 1140 units in the United States and Canada. The defect caused electric current to leak, which could potentially shock the product's user. There were four reported instances of this shock before it was recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2015/instant-pot-pressure-cookers-recalled-by-double-insight|title=Instant Pot Pressure Cookers Recalled by Double Insight {{!}} CPSC.gov|website=www.cpsc.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, five production runs of Instant Pot Gem 65 8-in-1 Multicookers were recalled because they were overheating and subsequently melting due to a manufacturing issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/an-instant-pot-multicooker-is-melting-but-not-the-one-you-think/#ftag=CAD590a51e|title=An Instant Pot multicooker is melting -- but not the one you think|last=Bennett|first=Brian|date=2018-02-23|work=[[CNET]]|access-date=2018-02-23|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Manufacturing==
Instant Pots are manufactured by the Midea Group in GuangDong, China. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/hc-sc/2015/54204r-eng.php|title=Double Insight Inc. recalls Instant Pot Smart Pressure Cooker|website=healthycanadians.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intangible property''', also known as '''incorporeal property''', describes something which a [[Natural person|person]] or [[corporation]] can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/[[intellectual property]].  It generally refers to statutory creations such as [[copyright]], [[trademark]]s, or [[patent]]s.  It excludes tangible property like [[real property]] (land, buildings, and [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]]) and [[personal property]] (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.).  In some jurisdictions intangible property are referred to as ''choses in action''.  [https://www.royaltyrange.com/home/blog/what-are-intangibles Intangible] property is used in distinction to [[tangible property]].  It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal intangible property (which is discussed here) and competitive intangible property (which is the source from which legal intangible property is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred).  Competitive intangible property disobeys the intellectual property test of voluntary [[extinguishment]] and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual property (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.

Generally, ownership of intangible property gives the owner a set of legally enforceable rights over reproduction of personal property containing certain content&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royaltyrange.com/home/blog/what-are-intangibles|title=What are intangibles? {{!}} RoyaltyRange|website=www.royaltyrange.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  For example, a copyright owner can control the reproduction of the work forming the copyright.  However, the intangible property forms a set of rights separate from the tangible property that carries the rights.  For example, the owner of a copyright can control the printing of books containing the content, but the book itself is personal property which can be bought and sold without concern over the rights of the copyright holder.

In [[English law]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] legal systems, intangible property is traditionally divided in ''pure intangibles'' (such as debts, intellectual property rights and [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]) and ''documentary intangibles'', which obtain their character through the medium of a document (such as a [[bill of lading]], [[promissory note]] or [[bill of exchange]]).  The recent rise of [[electronic document]]s has blurred the distinction between pure intangibles and documentary intangibles.

==History==
The Aster Dance Club was founded in 1986 in Sarajevo, then part of [[SFR Yugoslavia]] and was named after American dancer, choreographer and actor, [[Fred Astaire]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pkaster.ba/|title= Plesni klub Aster|publisher=pkaster.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally part of the [[Slobodan_Princip#Legacy|Slobodan Princip "Seljo" Student Cultural Club]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pkaster.ba/|title= Plesni klub Aster|publisher=pkaster.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was a founding member of the Bosnian Dance Federation, but ceased to exist in 2000. In 2014 the club was reestablished by former members. That same year it founded the festival in cooperation with the acclaimed Berlin Dance Institute, the [[World DanceSport Federation]] and [[MTV Dance (Europe)|MTV Dance Europe]]. In 2017, the organizers signed a cooperation agreement with the [[2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/kultura/inter-dance-fest-dovodi-najbolje-plesace-u-sarajevo/296584|title= Inter Dance FEST potpisao memorandum o saradnji sa organizatorima EYOF 2019|publisher=Radio Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Format==
The festival is organized in April and lasts for three days. Its format is 19 competitive and 7 non-competitive dance programmes that are held for the first two days of the festival and represent contemporary dance styles from four different continents. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sportsport.ba/magazin/medunarodni-plesni-festival-inter-dance-fest-2018-u-aprilu-u-sarajevu/265130|title=Međunarodni plesni festival Inter Dance FEST 2018 u aprilu u Sarajevu|publisher=sportsport.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third day, organized in cooperation with the [[International Dance Organization]], is reserved for programmes that fall under Performing Arts: [[Tap Dance]], [[Musical Theatre]], [[Contemporary ballet]], [[Lyrical dance]] and [[Concert dance]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/kultura/inter-dance-fest/296955|title=Takmičenje / Inter Dance FEST doveo najbolje plesače u Sarajevo|publisher=Radio Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous panels of international judges decide on the winner of each competitive programme. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sportsport.ba/magazin/medunarodni-plesni-festival-inter-dance-fest-2018-u-aprilu-u-sarajevu/265130|title=Međunarodni plesni festival Inter Dance FEST 2018 u aprilu u Sarajevu|publisher=sportsport.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''L Prize''' (aka the '''Bright Tomorrow Lighting Prize''') is a competition run by the [[United States Department of Energy]] aimed to "spur lighting manufacturers to develop high-quality, high-efficiency [[solid-state lighting]] products to replace the common [[incandescent light bulb]]".&lt;ref name="Lsite"&gt;[http://www.lightingprize.org/index.stm www.lightingprize.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition, launched in May 2008 [http://www.lightingprize.org/lightfair08.stm at Lightfair], offers two prizes for the replacement of two types of bulb, an [[A19 light bulb|A19]] 60-watt incandescent light bulb and a [[PAR 38]] [[Halogen lamp|halogen]] incandescent bulb. The prize fund for the 60&amp;nbsp;W replacement is up to a maximum of [[United States dollar|US$]]10 million and for the PAR 38 up to US$5 million.&lt;ref name="Require"&gt;[http://www.lightingprize.org/pdfs/LPrize-Revision1.pdf LPrize-Revision1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a third category, yet to be publicly defined, called the 21st-century lamp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightingprize.org/requirements.stm L-Prize Requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506170912/http://www.lightingprize.org/requirements.stm |date=2011-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on 3 August 2011, that the winner of the 60 W replacement bulb competition was a bulb made by [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="philwin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightingprize.org/philips-winner.stm |title=DOE Announces Philips as First Winner of the L Prize Competition |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60jS9wT6Q?url=http://www.lightingprize.org/philips-winner.stm |archivedate= 6 August 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="philwinPDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightingprize.org/pdfs/LPrize-winner_media-kit.pdf |title=LPrize-winner_media-kit.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60jSDijaj?url=http://www.lightingprize.org/pdfs/LPrize-winner_media-kit.pdf |archivedate= 6 August 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning bulb was a [[LED lamp]] using less than 10 watts and emitting the equivalent amount of light as a traditional 60-watt incandescent bulb. That amounts to an 83% energy savings. It was announced that Philips would be given the US$10 million cash prize.&lt;ref name="philwin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="philwinPDF" /&gt; The bulb was released commercially in February 2012 through several online sellers. The widespread launch at retail stores, however, was not until [[Earth Day]], April 22.&lt;ref name=philipscatalog&gt;{{cite web|title=Award Winning LED Bulb|url=http://www.usa.ecat.lighting.philips.com/l/professional-lamps/led-lighting-systems/led-bulb/62693/cat/|work=Philips Lighting Catalog|publisher=Philips|accessdate=8 February 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121217165422/http://www.usa.ecat.lighting.philips.com/l/professional-lamps/led-lighting-systems/led-bulb/62693/cat/#|archive-date=2012-12-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the subsidized price was expected to be $22 in the first year, $15 in the second and $8 in the third, the bulb was initially selling for $50–$60 (without rebates) as of July 2012. As of March, 2013 Home Depot began offering the bulbs for $15 in stores.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.homedepot.com/buy/philips-10-watt-60w-led-a19-soft-white-2700k-light-bulb-e-l-prize-award-winner--423244.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many stores sold out, and according to Philips customer service the L-prize bulb has been discontinued.

===Technology===

The winning bulb is able to achieve all of the required specifications by using red and blue LEDs that excite yellow phosphors, which emits the required color of light. This is in contrast to most other LED lights, which use white LEDs to emit light that lacks all of the required characteristics for the L-Prize.

==Future==

===PAR 38 floodlight===
The rules for the PAR 38 lightbulb competition were retooled in July, 2012, keeping the same main specifications. As of June 13, 2014, the competition has been suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lightingprize.org/PAR38.stm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217021220/http://www.lightingprize.org/PAR38.stm |archivedate=2015-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st Century Lamp===
On August 1, 2011, [[Cree_Inc.|Cree]] announced that they had created a bulb that would exceed the DOE specifications for a 21st-century lamp. It emitted 1,300 lumens at 152 lumens per watt with a CRI of 91.2 and a color temperature of 2800 K.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cree.com/news-and-events/cree-news/press-releases/2011/august/110801-21st-century-lamp&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated at the time that they would not be bringing the bulb to market. As of March, 2013 they had not brought the bulb or any bulb like it to market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36755">Many '''works of art''' are claimed to have been designed using '''the golden ratio'''.
However, many of these claims are disputed, or refuted by measurement.&lt;ref name=Markowsky1992/&gt;

The [[golden ratio]], an [[irrational number]], is approximately 1.618; it is often denoted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] φ ([[Phi (letter)|phi]]).

==Early history==
Various authors have claimed that early monuments have [[golden ratio]] proportions, often on conjectural interpretations, using approximate measurements, and only roughly corresponding to 1.618.&lt;ref name=Markowsky1992/&gt; For example, claims have been made about golden ratio proportions in Egyptian, Sumerian and Greek vases, Chinese pottery, Olmec sculptures, and Cretan and Mycenaean products from the late Bronze Age. These predate by some 1,000 years the Greek mathematicians first known to have studied the golden ratio.&lt;ref name="klaus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="curso"/&gt; However, the historical sources are obscure, and the analyses are difficult to compare because they employ differing methods.&lt;ref name="klaus"/&gt;

It is claimed, for instance, that [[Stonehenge]] (3100 BC – 2200 BC) has golden ratio proportions between its concentric circles.&lt;ref name="klaus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trivede, Prash. ''The 27 Celestial Portals: The Real Secret Behind the 12 Star-Signs''. Lotus Press. Page 397&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Elam proposes this relation as early evidence of human cognitive preference for the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly Elam. ''Geometry of Design: Studies in Proportion and Composition By Kimberly Elam''. Princeton Architectural Press. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others point out that this interpretation of Stonehenge "may be doubtful" and that the geometric construction that generates it can only be surmised.&lt;ref name="klaus"&gt;{{cite book | title=Symmetries of Nature: A Handbook for Philosophy of Nature and Science | author=Mainzer, Klaus | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | year=1996 | isbn=3-11-012990-6 | pages=118 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqzaQo6CaA0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=stonehenge+golden-section&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=MY_cR9H5HKiwtAP_26WJDg&amp;sig=zTEHmqsZD1uUuqvofxzlSYrIKNY }}&lt;/ref&gt; As another example, [[Carlos Chanfon Olmos|Carlos Chanfón Olmos]] states that the Sculpture of King [[Gudea]] (c. 2350 BC) has golden proportions between all of its secondary elements repeated many times at its base.&lt;ref name=curso/&gt;

The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (constructed c. 2570 BC by [[Hemiunu]]) exhibits the golden ratio according to various [[pyramidology|pyramidologists]], including Charles Funck-Hellet.&lt;ref name=curso/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindwell"&gt;Lidwell, William; Holden, Kritina; and Butler, Jill. ''Universal Principles of Design''. Rockport Publishers. October 1, 2003. Page 96&lt;/ref&gt; John F. Pile, interior design professor and historian, has claimed that Egyptian designers sought the golden proportions without mathematical techniques and that it is common to see the 1.618:1 ratio, along with many other simpler geometrical concepts, in their architectural details, art, and everyday objects found in tombs. In his opinion, "That the Egyptians knew of it and used it seems certain."{{sfn | Pile | 2005 | p=29}}

From before the beginning of these theories, other historians and mathematicians have proposed alternative theories for the pyramid designs that are not related to any use of the golden ratio, and are instead based on purely rational slopes that only approximate the golden ratio.&lt;ref name="maor"&gt;[[Eli Maor|Maor, Eli]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xU0IPNGRXqEC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=intitle:trigonometric+inauthor:maor+seked+rhind&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=GYo5SJHPCJnstAPNk5S8Cw&amp;sig=dCMf0wTbtg6KwHNbxMS-2Ra_yDc Trigonometric Delights]'', Princeton Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians of those times apparently did not know the [[Pythagorean theorem]]; the only right triangle whose proportions they knew was the 3:4:5 triangle.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Eric Temple. ''The Development of Mathematics'', New York: Dover, 1940, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient and medieval architecture==

===Greece===
[[File:Parthenon from west.jpg|thumb|The Parthenon west façade]]

The [[Acropolis of Athens]] (468–430 BC), including the [[Parthenon]], according to some studies, has many proportions that approximate the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=van&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;se=gglsc&amp;d=5001403053 | title=Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis |author1=Van Mersbergen |author2=Audrey M. | journal=Communication Quarterly | volume=46 | issue=2 | pages=194–195 | year=1998 | publisher=Eastern Communication Association | doi=10.1080/01463379809370095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars question whether the golden ratio was known to or used by Greek artists and architects as a principle of aesthetic proportion.&lt;ref name="livio"/&gt;  Building the Acropolis is calculated to have been started around 600 BC, but the works said to exhibit the golden ratio proportions were created from 468 BC to 430 BC.

The Parthenon (447–432 BC), was a temple of the [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek goddess]] [[Athena]]. The Parthenon's facade as well as elements of its facade and elsewhere are claimed to be circumscribed by a progression of [[golden rectangle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., "Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis", ''Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent studies dispute the view that the golden ratio was employed in the design.&lt;ref name=Markowsky1992&gt;{{cite journal | author=Markowsky, George | journal=The College Mathematics Journal | volume=23 | issue=1 | pages=2–19 |date=January 1992 | title=Misconceptions About the Golden Ratio | doi=10.2307/2686193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="livio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markowsky, George {{cite web |url=http://laptops.maine.edu/GoldenRatio.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719232616/http://laptops.maine.edu/GoldenRatio.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hemenway claims that the Greek sculptor [[Phidias]] (c. 480–c. 430 BC) used the divine proportion in some of his sculptures.&lt;ref name=Hemenway,P&gt;{{cite book | last=Hemenway | first=Priya | title=Divine Proportion: Phi In Art, Nature, and Science | year=2005 | publisher=Sterling | location=New York | isbn=1-4027-3522-7 | pages=96 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=akjSa4AdK4AC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=inauthor:Hemenway+phidias+divine&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=EpvcR_TVIabutAO5hMjwAQ&amp;sig=DXfN9iQeiqf8HqeohZ1Oz_5qRRk#PPA96,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He created ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' in [[Athens]] and ''[[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Statue of Zeus]]'' (one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]) in the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. He is believed to have been in charge of other Parthenon sculptures,  although they may have been executed by his alumni or peers. In the early 20th century, American mathematician [[Mark Barr]] proposed the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[Phi (letter)|phi]] (&lt;big&gt;φ&lt;/big&gt;), the first letter of Phidias's name, to denote the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Theodore Andrea (1979). ''The Curves of Life'', p. 420. Courier Dover Publications, {{isbn|0-486-23701-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lothar Haselberger claims that the temple of [[Apollo]] in [[Didyma]] (c. 334 BC), designed by Daphnis of Mileto and Paionios of Ephesus, has golden proportions.&lt;ref name="curso"/&gt;

===Prehispanic Mesoamerican architecture===

Between 1950 and 1960, Manuel Amabilis applied some of the analysis methods of [[Frederik Macody Lund]] and [[Jay Hambidge]] in several designs of prehispanic buildings, such as  ''El Toloc'' and ''La Iglesia de Las Monjas'' (the Nuns Church), a notable complex of [[Terminal Classic Maya|Terminal Classic]] buildings constructed in the [[Puuc]] architectural style at [[Chichen Itza]]. According to his studies, their proportions are concretized from a series of polygons, circles and pentagrams inscribed, as [[Lund]] found in his studies of Gothic churches. Manuel Amabilis published his studies along with several self-explanatory images of other [[pre-columbian]] buildings made with golden ratio proportions in ''La Arquitectura Precolombina de Mexico''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;q=manuel+amabilis Manue Amabilis]. (1956) ''[http://www.antiqbook.com/boox/dailey/5479.shtml La Arquitectura Precolombina en Mexico]''. Editorial Orion. P. 200, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was awarded the gold medal and the title of ''Academico'' by the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]] (Spain) in the ''Fiesta de la Raza'' ([[Columbus day]]) of 1929.

[[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|The Castle of Chichen Itza]] was built by the [[Maya civilization]] between the 11th and 13th centuries AD as a temple to the god [[Kukulcan]]. John Pile claims that its interior layout has golden ratio proportions. He says that the interior walls are placed so that the outer spaces are related to the central chamber by the golden ratio.{{sfn | Pile | 2005 | p=23}}

===Islamic architecture===
[[File:Grande Mosquée de Kairouan, vue d'ensemble.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]]]]

The [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (built by [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] c. 670 A.D.) has been claimed to use the golden ratio in the design including its plan, the prayer space, court, and minaret,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Boussora, Kenza | author2=Mazouz, Said | url=http://www.nexusjournal.com/BouMaz.html | title=The Use of the Golden Section in the Great Mosque of Kairouan | journal=Nexus Network Journal | volume=6 | issue=1 | date=Spring 2004 | pages=7–16 | doi=10.1007/s00004-004-0002-y | quote=The geometric technique of construction of the golden section seems to have determined the major decisions of the spatial organisation. The golden section appears repeatedly in some part of the building measurements. It is found in the overall proportion of the plan and in the dimensioning of the prayer space, the court and the minaret. The existence of the golden section in some parts of Kairouan mosque indicates that the elements designed and generated with this principle may have been realised at the same period. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004154727/http://www.nexusjournal.com/BouMaz.html | archivedate=2008-10-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ratio does not appear in the original parts of the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brinkworth, Peter |author2=Scott, Paul | title=The Place of Mathematics | journal=Australian Mathematics Teacher | volume=57 | issue=3 | year=2001 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist architecture===
The Stupa of Borobudur in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]] (built eighth to ninth century AD), the largest known Buddhist stupa, has the dimension of the square base related to the diameter of the largest circular terrace as 1.618:1, according to Pile.{{sfn | Pile | 2005 | p=88}}

===Romanesque architecture===
The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style of architecture prevailed in Europe between 900–1200, a period which ends with the transition to [[Gothic architecture]]. The contrast between Romanesque and Gothic concepts in religious buildings can be understood in the epistolary between [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]], [[Cistercian]], and the [[Abbot Suger]] of the order of [[Cluny]], the initiator of [[Gothic art|Gothic]] art in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St. Denis]].

One of the most beautiful works of Romanesque Cistercian is the Abbey of [[Sénanque]] in Provence. The [[Sénanque]] abbatial was founded in 1148 and consecrated in 1178. It was initiated in life of [[St Bernard of Clairvaux]].
“La Lumière à Sénanque” (The Light in Sénanque),&lt;ref&gt;http://upcommons.upc.edu/e-prints/handle/2117/1794&lt;/ref&gt;
a chapter of ''Cîteaux : commentarii cistercienses'', a publication of the [[Cistercian Order]].  Its author, Kim Lloveras i Montserrat, made in 1992 a complete study of the abbatial, and argues that the abbatial church was designed using a system of measures founded in the golden ratio, and that the instruments used for its construction were the “Vescica” and the medieval squares used by the constructors, both designed with the golden ratio. The "Vescica" of [[Sénanque]] is located in the cloister of the monastery, in front of the Chapter, the site of the workshop.

[[File:Laon Cathedral's regulator lines.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of [[Notre-Dame of Laon]] cathedral. According to [[Frederik Macody Lund]], the superimposed regulator lines show that the cathedral has golden proportions.]]

In his 1919 book ''Ad Quadratum'', [[Frederik Macody Lund]], a historian who studied the geometry of several gothic structures, claims that the [[Cathedral of Chartres]] (begun in the 12th century), the [[Notre-Dame of Laon]] (1157–1205), and the [[Notre Dame de Paris]] (1160) are designed according to the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=curso/&gt;  Other scholars argue that until Luca Pacioli's 1509 ''De Divina Proportione'' (see next section), the golden ratio was unknown to artists and architects, although this is not likely the case since the ratio was explicitly defined by Euclid.&lt;ref name="livio"/&gt;

A 2003 conference on medieval architecture resulted in the book ''Ad Quadratum: The Application of Geometry to Medieval Architecture''. According to a summary by one reviewer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Most of the contributors consider that the setting out was done ad quadratum, using the sides of a square and its diagonal. This gave an incommensurate ratio of [square root of (2)] by striking a circular arc (which could easily be done with a rope rotating around a peg). Most also argued that setting out was done geometrically rather than arithmetically (with a measuring rod). Some considered that setting out also involved the use of equilateral or Pythagorean triangles, pentagons, and octagons. Two authors believe the Golden Section (or at least its approximation) was used, but its use in medieval times is not supported by most architectural historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The geometry of Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals. (Ad Quadratum: The Application of Geometry to Medieval Architecture) (Book Review) | journal=Architectural Science Review | volume=46 | issue=3 | pages=337–338 | date=September 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Australian architectural historian John James made a detailed study of the [[Cathedral of Chartres]]. In his work ''The Master Masons of Chartres'' he says that Bronze, one of the master masons, used the golden ratio. It was the same relation as between the arms of their metal square:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bronze by comparison was an innovator, in practical rather than in philosophic things. Amongst other things Bronze was one of the few masters to use the fascinating ratio of the golden mean. For the builder, the most important function Fi, as we write the golden mean, is that if the uses is consistently he will find that every subdivision, no matter how accidentally it may have been derived, will fit somewhere into the series.  Is not too difficult a ratio to reproduce, and Bronze could have had the two arms of his metal square cut to represent it.  All he would than have had to do was to place the square on the stone and, using the string draw between the corners, relate any two lengths by Phi. Nothing like making life easy.&lt;ref&gt;James, John, ''The Master Masons of Chartres''.

[[File:Pacioli De Divina Proportione Head Equilateral Triangle 1509.jpg|upright|thumb|Leonardo da Vinci's illustration of a human head from Pacioli's ''[[De divina proportione|De Divina Proportione]]''&lt;ref name=pacioli/&gt;]]

''[[De divina proportione]]'', written by [[Luca Pacioli]] in Milan in 1496–1498, published in Venice in 1509,&lt;ref name=pacioli&gt;Pacioli, Luca. ''De Divina Proportione''. Venice, 1509.&lt;/ref&gt; features 60 drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], some of which illustrate the appearance of the golden ratio in geometric figures. Starting with part of the work of Leonardo da Vinci, this architectural treatise was a major influence on generations of artists and architects.

''A Glimmer of Light from the Eye of a Giant: Tabular Evidence of a Monument in Harmony with the Universe''. 2001. Page 1&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the theories of the man after which the drawing takes its name, [[Vitruvius]], who in ''De Architectura: The Planning of Temples'' (c. I BC) pointed that the planning of temples depends on symmetry, which must be based on the perfect proportions of the human body.  Some authors feel there is no actual evidence that Da Vinci used the golden ratio in ''Vitruvian Man'';&lt;ref name=devlin&gt;{{cite web | title= Good stories, pity they're not true |date=June 2004 | work=MAA Online | publisher=Mathematical Association of America | author=Keith Devlin | url=http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_06_04.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701231636/http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_06_04.html | archivedate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Olmos&lt;ref name="curso"/&gt; (1991) observes otherwise through geometrical analysis. He also proposes [[Self-portrait (Leonardo da Vinci)|Leonardo da Vinci's ''self portrait'']], [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's ''David'']] (1501–1504), [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''[[Melencolia I]]'' and the classic [[violin]] design by the masters of Cremona ([[Giuseppe Guarneri|Guarneri]], [[Antonio Stradivari|Stradivari]] and several members of the [[Amati]] family) as having similar regulator lines related to the golden ratio.

Da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' (c. 1503–1506) ''"has been the subject of so many volumes of contradicting scholarly and popular speculations that it virtually impossible to reach any unambiguous conclusions"'' with respect to the golden ratio, according to Livio.&lt;ref name="livio"/&gt;

Memoria de el Colegio Nacional, Volume VI, No. 4, Editorial de El Colegio Nacional, Mexico, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; that the golden ratio is an important element in the design of the [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral]] (circa 1667–1813). Olmos claims the same for the design of the cities of [[Coatepec, Mexico|Coatepec]] (1579), Chicoaloapa (1579) and Huejutla (1580), as well as the [[Mérida Cathedral]], the Acolman Temple, ''Cristo Crucificado'' by [[Diego Velázquez]] (1639) and ''[[commons:Category:Paintings of the Immaculate Conception by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|La Inmaculada Concepción]]'' (pictured) of [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]].&lt;ref name="curso"&gt;[[Carlos Chanfon Olmos|Chanfón Olmos, Carlos]].

[[Matila Ghyka]]&lt;ref&gt;Ghyka, Matila. ''The Geometry of Art and Life''. 1946. Page 162&lt;/ref&gt; and others&lt;ref name="palette"&gt;Staszkow, Ronald and Bradshaw, Robert. ''The Mathematical Palette''. Thomson Brooks/Cole. P. 372&lt;/ref&gt; contend that [[Georges Seurat]] used golden ratio proportions in paintings like ''La Parade'', ''Le Pont de Courbevoie'' and ''[[Bathers at Asnières]]''. However, there is no direct evidence to support these claims.&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt;

While the golden ratio appears to govern the geometric structure of Seurat's ''[[Parade de cirque|Parade de cirque (Circus Sideshow)]]'',&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;Michael F. Zimmermann. ''Seurat and the Art Theory of His Time''. Antwerp, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;André Lhote, Encyclopédie française. Vol. 16, part 1, ''Arts et littératures dans la société contemporaine''. Paris, 1935, p. 16.30-7, ill. pp. 16.30-6, 16.31-7&lt;/ref&gt; modern consensus among art historians is that Seurat never used this ''divine proportion'' in his work.&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/GeorgesSeurat18591891 Robert L. Herbert, ''Georges Seurat, 1859-1891'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1991], pp. 340-345, archive.org (full text online)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Herz-Fischler.

''Construction et proportion: apports germaniques dans une theorie de la peinture franchise de 1850 a 1950''. Université de Paris (Ph.D. diss.), 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

The final study of ''Parade'', executed prior to the oil on canvas, is divided horizontally into fourths and vertically into sixths (4 : 6 ratio) corresponding to the dimensions of the canvas, which is one and one-half times wider than its vertical dimension. These axes do not correspond precisely to the golden section, 1 : 1.6, as might have been expected. Rather, they correspond to basic mathematical divisions (simple ratios that appear to approximate the golden section), as noted by Seurat with citations from the mathematician, inventor, esthetician [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]].&lt;ref name="Herbert, archive" /&gt;

===Cubism===
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1910-11, Deux Nus (Two Nudes, Two Women), oil on canvas, 92 x 66 cm, Gothenburg Museum of Art, Sweden.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1910-11, ''[[Deux Nus|Deux Nus (Two Nudes, Two Women)]]'', Gothenburg Museum of Art]]
The idea of the [[Section d'Or]] (or Groupe de Puteaux) originated in the course of conversations between [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Jean Metzinger]] and [[Jacques Villon]]. The group's title was suggested by Villon, after reading a 1910 translation of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''Trattato della Pittura'' by [[Joséphin Péladan]]. Peladan attached great [[Mysticism|mystical]] significance to the [[golden section]] ({{lang-fr|Section d'Or}}), and other similar geometric configurations. For Villon, this symbolized his belief in order and the significance of mathematical proportions, because it reflected patterns and relationships occurring in nature. Jean Metzinger and the Duchamp brothers were passionately interested in mathematics. Jean Metzinger, [[Juan Gris]] and possibly [[Marcel Duchamp]] at this time were associates of [[Maurice Princet]], an amateur mathematician credited for introducing profound and rational scientific arguments into Cubist discussions.&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism"&gt;[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''La Section d'Or'' represented simultaneously a continuity with past traditions and current trends in related fields, while leaving open future developments in the arts.&lt;ref name="La Section d'Or"&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+numéro+spécial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg La Section d'Or, Numéro spécial, 9 Octobre 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balmori, Santos, ''Aurea mesura'', Unam, 1978, 189 p.

===De Stijl===
Some works in the Dutch artistic movement called [[De Stijl]], or neoplasticism, exhibit golden ratio proportions. [[Piet Mondrian]] used the golden section extensively in his neoplasticist, geometrical paintings, created circa 1918–38.&lt;ref name=palette/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bouleau, Charles, ''The Painter's Secret Geometry: A Study of Composition in Art'' (1963) pp. 247-48, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, {{isbn|0-87817-259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mondrian sought proportion in his paintings by observation, knowledge and intuition, rather than geometrical or mathematical methods.&lt;ref&gt;Padovan, Richard.

''Journal of Architecture, Planning and Environmental Engineering'' （Academic Journal, 1993 ） 453,153-158 / ,''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Le Corbusier===
The Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]], famous for his contributions to the [[modernism|modern]] [[International style (architecture)|international style]], centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier's faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as "rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p. 25, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p. 316, Taylor and Francis, {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modulor]]: Le Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], Leonardo da Vinci's  "[[Vitruvian Man]]", the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of [[architecture]]. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], Fibonacci numbers, and the double unit. He took Leonardo's suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system.&lt;ref name="modulor"&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'', p. 35, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p. 320. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}: "Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Modulor: A Harmonious Measure to the Human Scale, Universally Applicable to Architecture and Mechanics'' Le Corbusier reveals he used his system in the Marseilles Unite D'Habitation (in the general plan and section, the front elevation, plan and section of the apartment, in the woodwork, the wall, the roof and some prefabricated furniture), a small office in 35 rue de Sèvres, a factory in Saint-Die and the [[United Nations Headquarters]] building in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor: A Harmonious Measure to the Human Scale, Universally Applicable to Architecture and Mechanics'', Birkhäuser, 2000, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors claim that the shape of the facade of the second is the result of three golden rectangles;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Geometry and the Visual Arts | author=Daniel Pedoe | publisher=Courier Dover Publications | year=1983 | isbn=0-486-24458-X | pages=121 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g24GMnuf36MC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=golden-ratio+united-nations&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=O3fdR7XsOIrysgP6yMXqAQ&amp;sig=_NDCQ2VQ1fYJLepf5I4vsofCxcw }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, each of the three rectangles that can actually be appreciated have different heights.

=== Josep Lluís Sert ===
Catalan architect [[Josep Lluis Sert]], a disciple of [[Le Corbusier]], applied the measures of the [[Modulor]] in all his particular works, including the Sert's House in Cambridge&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikiarquitectura.com/index.php/Sert's_House_in_Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Joan Miró Foundation]] in Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Fundación Joan Miró]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neogothic===
According to the official tourism page of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], the ground floor of the [[Palacio Barolo]] (1923), designed by Italian architect [[Mario Palanti]], is built according to the golden section.&lt;ref name="arg"&gt;[http://www.bue.gov.ar/recorridos/index.php?menu_id=52&amp;info=auto_contenido&amp;lang=en Official tourism page of the city of Buenos Aires] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609080642/http://www.bue.gov.ar/recorridos/index.php?menu_id=52&amp;info=auto_contenido&amp;lang=en |date=2008-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-modern===
Another Swiss architect, [[Mario Botta]], bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in [[Origlio]], the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Simon. ''Analysing Architecture'' (2003)  pp. 154-5, {{isbn|0-415-30685-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[Ernő Lendvai]] analyzes [[Béla Bartók]]'s works as being based on two opposing systems, that of the golden ratio and the [[acoustic scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Lendvai, Ernő (1971). ''Béla Bartók: An Analysis of His Music''. London: Kahn and Averill.&lt;/ref&gt; though other music scholars reject that analysis.&lt;ref name="livio"/&gt; In Bartók's ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' the xylophone progression occurs at the intervals 1:2:3:5:8:5:3:2:1.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Peter F. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgftUKoMnpkC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=bartok+intitle:The+intitle:Dynamics+intitle:of+intitle:Delight+intitle:Architecture+intitle:and+intitle:Aesthetics&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=WkkSR5L6OI--ogLpmoyzBg&amp;sig=Ijw4YifrLhkcdQSMVAjSL5g4zVk The Dynamics of Delight: Architecture and Aesthetics]'' (New York: Routledge, 2003) pp 83, {{isbn|0-415-30010-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French composer [[Erik Satie]] used the golden ratio in several of his pieces, including ''Sonneries de la Rose+Croix''. 

The golden ratio is also apparent in the organisation of the sections in the music of [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''Image: Reflections in the Water'', in which "the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals 34, 21, 13 and 8, and the main climax sits at the phi position."&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;

The musicologist [[Roy Howat]] has observed that the formal boundaries of Debussy’s [[La mer (Debussy)|''La mer'']] correspond exactly to the golden section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Debussy in Proportion: A Musical Analysis | author=Roy Howat | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4bwKykNp24wC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=intitle:Debussy+intitle:in+intitle:Proportion+golden+la-mer&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=KFKlR5b5O4bOiQGQt82pCg&amp;sig=oBWbHkWkhTG11w_BNdx89SWjQTY#PPA169,M1 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1983 | isbn=0-521-31145-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trezise finds the intrinsic evidence "remarkable", but cautions that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy consciously sought such proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Debussy: La Mer | author=Simon Trezise | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1994 | isbn=0-521-44656-2 | pages=53 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THD1nge_UzcC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=inauthor:Trezise+golden+evidence&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=DlSlR-7HJJXEigGR2sS5Cg&amp;sig=5auw0tRu24Jq0aFKOjLyZ2u7BGo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonid Sabaneyev]] hypothesizes that the separate time intervals of the musical pieces connected by the "culmination event", as a rule, are in the ratio of the golden section.&lt;ref&gt;Sabaneev, Leonid and [[Judah A. Joffe|JOFFE, Judah A.]] ''Modern Russian Composers''. 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; However the author attributes this incidence to the instinct of the musicians: ''"All such events are timed by author's instinct to such points of the whole length that they divide temporary durations into separate parts being in the ratio of the golden section."''

Ron Knott&lt;ref&gt;Knott, Ron, ''[Ron Knott's web pages on Mathematics]'', ''[http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibInArt.html Fibonacci Numbers and The Golden Section in Art, Architecture and Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228042058/http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibInArt.html |date=2009-02-28 }}'', Surrey University&lt;/ref&gt; exposes how the golden ratio is unintentionally present in several pieces of classical music:
* An article of ''American Scientist''&lt;ref&gt;May, Mike, "Did Mozart use the Golden mean?", ''American Scientist'', March/April 1996&lt;/ref&gt; ("Did Mozart use the Golden mean?", March/April 1996), reports that John Putz found that there was considerable deviation from ratio section division in many of Mozart's sonatas and claimed that any proximity to this number can be explained by constraints of the sonata form itself.
* Derek Haylock&lt;ref&gt;Haylock, Derek. ''Mathematics Teaching, Volume 84'', p. 56-57. 1978&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the opening motif of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] in C minor, Op. 67 (c. 1804–08), occurs exactly at the golden mean point 0.618 in bar 372 of 601 and again at bar 228 which is the other golden section point (0.618034 from the end of the piece) but he has to use 601 bars to get these figures. This he does by ignoring the final 20 bars that occur after the final appearance of the motif and also ignoring bar 387.

According to author Leon Harkleroad, "Some of the most misguided attempts to link music and mathematics have involved Fibonacci numbers and the related golden ratio."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Math Behind the Music | author=Leon Harkleroad | publisher=Cambridge University Press | page=120|year=2006 | isbn=0-521-81095-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3dsb7Qysh4C&amp;pg=RA4-PA120&amp;dq=misguided+music+mathematics+%22golden+ratio%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=9GJwR7m-HIbktAO_-ayeBw&amp;sig=h_YrTJ6LYBsfmhjexiQvmmPZFFM }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lumi''' is a [[Los Angeles]]-based company founded by Jesse Genet and Stephan Ango that manufactures [[packaging]] and [[brand]]ed supplies. The company got its start developing '''Inkodye''', a photo-reactive [[vat dye]] that develops its color through exposure to UV or sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Photochemical compositions and processes utilizing salts of para-amino triphenylacetonitriles|date=10 May 1960|url=http://www.google.com.au/patents/US2936276|inventor-last=Lyman|inventor-first=Chalkley|issue=US2936276 A|accessdate=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jesse Genet began experimenting with different printing techniques as a teenager in 2004, attempting to print photographs on cotton T-shirts.&lt;ref name="Fleishman"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/03/solar-dye | title=Here comes the sun | first=Glenn | last=Fleishman | date=2013-03-02 | accessdate = 2013-06-04 | publisher = [[The Economist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsatisfied with the results of [[screen printing]] and [[dye-sublimation]] she pursued her research and found what became a precursor to Inkodye, a chemical formula from the 1950s owned by a retired engineer.&lt;ref name="Fleishman" /&gt; After meeting Stephan Ango while studying at [[Art Center College of Design]], the pair acquired the chemical formula and began modernizing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.good.is/posts/wearable-instagram-can-two-designers-revolutionize-photo-printing/ | title=Wearable Instagram: Can Two Designers Revolutionize Photo Printing? | first=Zak | last=Stone | date=2012-08-13 | accessdate = 2013-06-04 | publisher = [[Good Worldwide|GOOD]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lumi launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign in December 2009&lt;ref name="kickstarter"&gt;{{cite web|author=Launched: Dec. 23, 2009 |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lumi/lumi-co-a-new-textile-printing-technology |title=Lumi Co. – A NEW TEXTILE PRINTING TECHNOLOGY&amp;nbsp;— Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=2009-12-23 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fund [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] of the technology. The company raised $13,597 and rewarded its backers with wallets, bags and other products printed using the process. The project was an early success for the Kickstarter platform&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/10100885 | title=Cash-strapped entrepreneurs get creative | first=Claire | last=Prentice | date=2010-05-12 | accessdate = 2016-10-05 | publisher = [[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleishman" /&gt; and went on to win Kickstarter's Best Design Project of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/best-design-project | title = Best Design Project » The Kickstarter Blog — Kickstarter | date=2011-01-12 | accessdate = 2013-06-04 | publisher = [[Kickstarter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Lumi launched a second Kickstarter campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Launched: Jun. 30, 2012 |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lumi/print-on-fabric-using-sunlight-the-lumi-process |title=Print on Fabric Using Sunlight: The Lumi Process by Lumi — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an initial fundraising target of $50,000 to commercialize its printing process, Inkodye. The project was successfully funded, reaching over 500% of the initial target and raising a total of $268,437. Rewards included Inkodye printing kits allowing users to create personalized photographic prints on cotton and other natural materials. In February 2015, Lumi appeared on ABC's [[Shark Tank]] and received 2 offers, but Genet did not accept either of the offers.

In March 2015, Lumi announced its new software platform, [https://www.lumi.com Lumi.com], for designing and ordering custom-made [[packaging]] and [[brand]]ing tools such as [[rubber stamp]]s. The service was funded by seed capital firm [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].&lt;ref name="ycombinator"&gt;{{cite web|author=Launched: Mar. 5, 2015 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/05/yc-backed-lumi-will-help-you-customize-anything-literally-anything-on-the-cheap/ |title=YC-Backed Lumi Will Help You Customize Anything  |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=2015-03-05 |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lumi's platform was inspired by the challenges the company had faced in producing packaging for Inkodye.&lt;ref name="shopfronts"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fastcompany.com/3063332/meet-lumi-the-company-thats-making-mailers-the-new-shopfronts | title=Meet Lumi, The Company That's Making Mailers The New Shopfronts | first=Elizabeth | last=Segran | date=2016-09-26 | accessdate = 2016-10-05 | publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was compared to other services such as ''Blackbox'' by [[Cards Against Humanity]] and ''Make That Thing!'' by [[TopatoCo]], provided by companies that also found success via Kickstarter and looked to simplify fulfillment and manufacturing for others.&lt;ref name="warehouse"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fastcompany.com/3063809/startup-report/warehouse-on-demand | title=Warehouse On Demand | first=Glenn | last=Fleishman | date=2016-09-26 | accessdate = 2016-10-05 | publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inkodye Process==
{{Alternative photography}}
The process of printing with Inkodye resembles that of other [[Alternative process|alternative photographic processes]] though its chemistry is related to [[vat dye]]s such as [[indigo]] rather than iron or silver-based chemicals used in [[cyanotype]] or [[Van Dyke brown (printing)|Van dyke brown]] which have higher toxicity. Inkodye is available in several colors (red, orange, copper, blue, navy, magenta, plum, sepia and black) which can be mixed together and diluted with water.

A monochromatic [[Digital negative (transparency)|digital negative]] is first printed on transparency film generally using an inkjet printer with black ink only. The negative is made to be the same size as the final print. Inkodye is then applied to the desired T-shirt or fabric in its undeveloped state. The negative is placed on top of the sensitized fabric and exposed to sunlight or UV light. Exposure times vary from 3 to 15 minutes depending on the desired color and intensity of light.&lt;ref name="Ray Laury"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imagery on Fabric: A Complete Surface Design Handbook|first=Jean|last=Ray Laury|publisher=C&amp;T Publishing|year=2010|isbn=1-57120-034-7|pages=122–123|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZexEXQM_sIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Imagery+on+Fabric&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0BIxTumIJoXUiAKosqGiBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exposure to sunlight develops the dye's color and binds it to the fabric. The final step is to wash out the unexposed dye using a [[washing machine]] and [[laundry detergent]].&lt;ref name="Lhotka"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Last Layer: New methods in digital printing for photography, fine art, and mixed media|first=Bonny Pierce|last=Lhotka|publisher=New Riders|year=2013|isbn=978-0321905406|pages=185–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===As artist===
Venieri is well known for her evocative sculpture installations which bridge mythology with current events, and for her ability to combine humor with self-reflection on human conditions in our times, through her characters that are taken from mythology, history, fairy tales and daily life. In her stories dreams reinforce reality and reality reinforce dreams.

The provocative visualizations of the universe of Venieri's work offer a Potnian statement about the world in flux in which we live.

She has had many exhibitions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.industrynews.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4402%3Alola-nikolaou-art-gallery-1310-1211-&amp;catid=122%3Aellada&amp;Itemid=315 |title=Account Suspended |publisher=Industrynews.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuxgallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuxgallery.com/site/www/artist_gallery/27|title=The Last Conflict, Stux Gallery, New York|publisher=Stux Gallery.com|accessdate=2012-08-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306213458/http://www.stuxgallery.com/site/www/artist_gallery/27|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="melt.gr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melt.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=134&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=en|title=The Bathhouse of the Winds, Athens|publisher=Melt.gr|date=2011-02-27|accessdate=2012-08-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321111959/http://www.melt.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=134&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2012-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been noted as;

{{blockquote|"Lydia Venieri erects entire mythologies and symbolic systems from the already phantasmagoric world of news media. Her stories are played out using dolls and childlike imagery to counter media dementia, in painting, drawing, photography, video and the internet. Theogony explicates Venieri's universe surveying two decades of work; work of one of the most celebrated and visionary Greek artists of our time."&lt;ref name="artonair"/&gt;}}

She currently shows with [[Stux Gallery]] in New York, Gallery Quang in Paris, Galleri S.E in Norway, Tokyo Terra in Japan and Gallery Isabel Aninat in Chile.

A '''music store''' or '''musical instrument store'''  is a retail business that sells [[musical instrument]]s and related equipment and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/industries/Retail-Trade/Musical-Instrument-Stores.html&lt;/ref&gt; In United States and Canada, most music stores in the 2010s sell a range of electric instruments (e.g., electric guitars), [[instrument amplifier]]s (e.g., [[guitar amplifier]]s); electronic instruments (e.g., synthesizers); drum kits (including drums, [[cymbal]]s and percussion instruments) and acoustic classical, [[concert band]] and [[jazz]] musical instruments such as saxophones, trumpets and violins. In addition, stores typically sell (and sometimes rent) the [[sound reinforcement system]] and [[PA system]] gear used in live concert performances and the [[sound recording]] equipment used to record music, such as microphones and digital recorders.

In the 2010s, music stores can be "[[bricks and mortar]]" stores (either individual [[small business]]es or [[chain store]]s, which may be a regional or national chain); online musical instrument stores, which consist of a website describing the merchandise, various online payment systems, and shipping or delivery systems; or hybrid stores that have both "bricks and mortar" stores and an online store. Some "bricks and mortar" music stores also provide services for a fee, such as [[music lesson]]s, musical instrument repair and guitar amplifier repair.

==Products==
In the 2010s, general music stores typically carry a range of instruments used in [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] such as the electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass, [[guitar string]]s, [[instrument amplifier]]s ([[guitar amplifier]], [[bass amplifier]] and [[keyboard amplifier]]), [[effects unit|electronic effects]] (e.g., [[distortion (music)|distortion]] [[effects unit|pedals]]), [[electronic keyboard]]s (including [[digital piano]]s, [[stage piano]]s, [[clonewheel organ]]s and synthesizers), drum kit components, which include drums, [[cymbal]]s, drum and cymbal stands and drum accessories ([[drum stick]]s, drum heads, etc.) and percussion instruments (e.g., [[tambourine]], [[shaker]]s, etc.). Some stores carry other types of stringed instruments, such as [[mandolin]]s and [[ukulele]]s.

General music stores also typically carry [[sound reinforcement system]] gear such as [[microphone]]s, small-to mid-sized [[mixing console]]s designed for live sound, [[speaker enclosure]]s, [[PA system]]s, [[power amplifier]]s and mic stands and [[sound recording]] equipment such as studio microphones, recording-oriented mixing consoles, [[digital recording]] systems, [[digital audio workstation]]s and digital audio software (e.g., [[softsynth]]s, [[Software synthesizer|virtual instruments]], [[ProTools]], etc.).
[[File:Cascio Interstate Music SuperStore Acoustic Guitar Cabin.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|A selection of acoustic guitars at Cascio Interstate Music SuperStore.]]
General music stores often carry a range of music accessories used during [[rehearsal]]s and performances, such as [[metronome]]s, [[electronic tuner]]s, [[music stand]]s, stand lights and conducting batons.

General music stores may also sell [[brass instrument]]s (e.g., [[trombone]], trumpet, etc.), woodwind instruments ([[flute]], [[clarinet]], saxophone, etc.) and instruments from the violin family (violin, [[viola]], cello and [[double bass|bass]]), but there is usually a smaller selection of these instruments, as compared with the guitar, bass and drum sections.

Some music stores also sell [[sheet music]], including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] songs, [[movie soundtrack]] scores, classical music pieces and instrument methods and studies ("etudes"). In the 2010s, some stores also sell instructional music DVDs and play-along CDs, which typically contain sheet music with the written melodies, which the performer can play or sing while a recording of each song or piece's [[accompaniment]] plays on a CD player.

===Services===
Some music stores also provide services to customers for a fee, such as instrument maintenance and repair, amplifier and sound gear repairs, and/or [[music lesson]]s. Some music stores rent guitars, basses, amplifiers, [[stage piano]]s and [[PA system]] equipment.

==Specialized stores==

Larger cities may have a large enough population to support both general music stores and specialized music stores. Music stores in smaller towns tend to be general music stores, because there is not enough of a customer base to support specialized music stores. In the 2010s, general music stores have had to face competition from online music stores, which offer a huge selection of instruments and equipment.

===Electric guitars===

Electric guitars started appearing in the 1930&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and are one of the most popular [[musical instrument]]s to buy from a music store. Electric guitars can be heard in all types of music from pop, rock, [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[funk]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gak.co.uk/en/electric-guitars|title=Electric Guitars {{!}} Shop Electric Guitars {{!}} GAK|website=www.gak.co.uk|access-date=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream electric guitars stores sell well-known brands like [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Ibanez]]. Most guitar stores sell [[6-string guitar|six-string]] models, bass guitars, [[left handed guitar]]s and electric guitar packages for beginners, which typically include a budget-priced electric guitar, a small practice amplifier, a strap and picks.

''Guitar World'' magazine states that since guitar stores require patrons to try out guitars and amplifiers in the premises, some guitar players are nervous about playing in front of the store staff and other patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/artist-news-viral-videos/dont-be-nervous-play-guitar-store/31147 |title=Don't Be Nervous to Play in a Guitar Store |last=Larson |first=Tyler|date=September 5, 2017 |website=''guitarworld.com'' |publisher=Guitar World |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The columnist, Tyler Larson, states that apart from playing too loud, which is avoided, patrons should feel confident to test out the guitars and amplifiers in the guitar stores, because "...real musicians never look down on anybody for being at a different skill level".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/artist-news-viral-videos/dont-be-nervous-play-guitar-store/31147 |title=Don't Be Nervous to Play in a Guitar Store |last=Larson |first=Tyler|date=September 5, 2017 |website=''guitarworld.com'' |publisher=Guitar World |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[University Press of Kentucky]] book on [[women in music]] states that customers did not treat a woman who worked at a guitar store like she knew anything about guitars until she would use special guitar terms.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Indie folk singer-songwriter/guitarist [[Ani di Franco]] states that for women, in the past, even entering a guitar store was an "act of courage" because it felt like a "boys' club".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Mina; Lewis, Tina; Shaw, Susan M. ''Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music''. University Press of Kentucky. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piano===
[[File:1905 - H S Schultz Piano Store Interior.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The H.S. Schultz Piano Store in 1905.]]
One common specialty store is the piano store, which typically sells a range of [[upright piano]]s and [[grand piano]]s. In the 2010s, some piano shops also sell grand pianos equipped with a digital [[player piano]] mechanism that can play back a recorded performance by activating the hammers. In the 2010s, some piano stores sell high-end [[digital piano]]s.

In 2015, ''The Guardian'' reported that in the US, piano stores have been closing, "...as kids snub lessons for other activities" such as amateur sports, as people taking piano lessons opt for much less costly "electronic keyboards or used pianos" and as children in the 2010s shift their interests away from traditional activities like piano lessons and towards newer computer-oriented activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/02/piano-stores-closing-kids-snub-lessons-compete-technology |title=Piano stores closing across US as kids snub lessons for other activities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 2, 2015 |work= The Guardian|access-date=September 4, 2017 |quote=When Jim Foster opened his piano store 30 years ago, he had 10 competitors selling just pianos. When he closed Foster Family Music in late December, not one was still selling pianos in the Quad-Cities area of Iowa and Illinois. "We did try hard to find a buyer," Foster said. There were no takers. Stores dedicated to selling pianos like Foster's are dwindling across the country as fewer people take up the instrument and those who do often opt for a less expensive electronic keyboard or a used piano. Some blame computers and others note the high cost of new pianos, but what's clear is that a long-term decline in sales has accelerated. The best year for new piano sales in the US was 1909, when more than 364,500 were sold. But after gently falling over the years, piano sales have plunged more recently to between 30,000 and 40,000 annually.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another challenge for piano stores selling new instruments is that there are piano technicians who repair good-quality used pianos and sell them at much less than the cost of a new instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/02/piano-stores-closing-kids-snub-lessons-compete-technology |title=Piano stores closing across US as kids snub lessons for other activities |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 2, 2015 |work= The Guardian|access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some piano stores offer rental of new pianos; as well, some piano stores sell used pianos.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Neil. ''The Piano Lessons Book''. December 8, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-4348-1853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it was reported that historic Detroit piano stores were closing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.axs.com/detroit-piano-stores-closing-amid-country-s-lack-of-interest-in-ebony--35842 |title=Detroit piano stores closing amid country's lack of interest in ebony and ivory |last=Ferro |first=Michael |date=January 5, 2015 |website=''axs.com'' |publisher=AXS.com |access-date=September 4, 2015 |quote=All across the country, there's a sad epidemic spreading much like the annual winter curse of the flu that sidelines scores of people each year. This sickness, though, is one of the heart, and of the soul, as many historic piano stores across the nation are closing their doors as interest in the once-immensely popular instrument fades in the modern era. It's no secret that pianos are becoming less and less popular in today's modern home, as reported by new statistics released this week. Nowhere is that more evident than in Detroit, with piano sales plummeting here in the Motor City. With so many homes in foreclosure and many other buildings, such as schools, dilapidated and awaiting to be torn down, pianos are a much more common sight to see backed away into the corner of a dusty garage or left behind after a hasty foreclosure from the bank. In short, pianos are a luxury that Detroiters simply seem to be able to no longer afford.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well, in 2015, it was reported that "...US piano stores [are being] forced to close as recession, new technology [such as electronic keyboards] and cultural change take their toll."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-15/piano-sales-plunge-in-united-states/6248428 |title=US piano stores forced to close as recession, new technology and cultural change take their toll |last=Millar |first=Lisa |date=March 15, 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor in the declining sales of pianos in the US is that pianos last a long time; high-quality, properly-maintained pianos can remain playable for 60 to 80 years after their original purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-15/piano-sales-plunge-in-united-states/6248428 |title=US piano stores forced to close as recession, new technology and cultural change take their toll |last=Millar |first=Lisa |date=March 15, 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high price of pianos is one factor that is causing the closing of piano stores: "A good grand piano from a respected name costs about as much as a luxury automobile", and as such, children (and their parents) are choosing less expensive instruments, such as electronic keyboards or stringed instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/opinion/columns/story/2015/may/21/piano-stores-and-americeconomics/305469/ |title=Kennedy: Piano stores and American economics |last=Kennedy |first=Mark|website=''timesfreepress.com'' |publisher=Times Free Press |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in China, "piano sales are booming", with most of these piano sales being intended for home use; this rise in sales is in part because the costly instruments are viewed as a [[status symbol]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-15/piano-sales-plunge-in-united-states/6248428 |title=US piano stores forced to close as recession, new technology and cultural change take their toll |last=Millar |first=Lisa |date=March 15, 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=September 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the basement below the [[Steinway]] piano showroom in New York City, a selection of professional grand pianos are available, so that visiting piano performers playing a recital or doing a [[sound recording]] can select the instrument with their preferred sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/30/nyregion/steinway-piano-showroom-is-moving-to-a-new-home-in-midtown.html |title=Changing Keys, Steinway Piano Store Will Relocate in Midtown |last=Barron |first=John |date=October 29, 2014 |work=The New York Times |access-date=September 4, 2017 |quote=Steinway plans to use the space beneath the showroom the way it has long used the basement on 57th Street, as a destination for concert pianists who can try different instruments and choose one for their recitals or recording sessions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violin family===
Another specialty shop is the "violin shop", which, despite its name, often sells various violin family instruments (violin, viola, cello and often double bass, and the bows, strings, [[rosin]], chinrests, and other accessories used with these instruments). Violin shops are often operated by [[luthier]]s (violinmakers) who make violin family instruments and bows for sale. Luthiers also do maintenance and repairs on violin family instruments and bows.

According to ''PBS Newshour'', one US violinmaker who sells his instruments is combining his extensive knowledge of centuries-old violin-building techniques with 2010s-era technology such as "[[CT scan]]s" and "3D lasers", which are giving him new insights into his violin design and construction approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/violinmaker-uses-ct-scans-3d-lasers-hone-craft/ |title=Violinmaker uses CT scans, 3D lasers to hone craft |last=Kargbo |first=Connie |date=June 21, 2014 |website=''pbs.org'' |publisher=PBS Newshour |access-date=September 5, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sheet music===
[[Sheet music]] stores sell printed classical music for songs, instrumental solo pieces, [[chamber music]], and scores for major symphonies and choral works, along with instrumental method books, "etudes" (studies) and graded musical exercises. Many sheet music stores also carry printed music songs for [[popular music]] genres such as rock, pop and musical theatre including individual songs and collections of songs grouped by artist, musical, or genre. Music for guitarists or electric bass players may be in [[tabulature]] notation, which depicts where on the instrument the performer should play a line. In the 2010s, sheet music stores often sell legal, copyright-compliant [[jazz]] [[fake book]]s. Sheet music stores often carry some practice accessories, such as [[metronome]]s, [[music stand]]s and [[tuning fork]]s.

===Other single category stores===
Specialized music stores that sell only guitars, only basses or only drums are more likely to be found in major cities. Guitar and bass-focused stores typically sell instruments and the amplifiers and [[effects unit|effects pedals]] used with these instruments.

===Pro audio===
{{Main|Professional audio store}}
Pro audio stores sell and in many cases, rent [[sound reinforcement system]] components, [[PA system]]s, [[microphone]]s and other audio gear. Some stores also rent "backline" musical gear, such as [[stage piano]]s and [[bass amp]]s.

===Organ stores===
Prior to the widespread availability of lightweight electronic [[clonewheel organ]]s in the 1980s and 1990s that emulate the sound of a heavy, electromechanical [[Hammond organ]], many cities had organ stores which sold large electric and electronic [[theatre organ]]s and [[spinet organ]]s made by Hammond, Lowrey and other manufacturers. These organs were sold for use in private homes and in churches; electric and electronic organs were popular for churches, because they cost significantly less than a [[pipe organ]].

==Used stores==
[[Image:Acoustic bass guitar 1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A music store display showing an acoustic bass guitar and a variety of bass "combo" amplifiers and speaker cabinets.]]

Some music stores sell used, [[Vintage music equipment|vintage or collectible instruments and sound gear]], often using a [[consignment]] model, in which the store only pays the seller for her instrument when it is sold. Even though there has been a major shift towards the use of electronic and digital instruments and sound gear in the 2000s, there is still a strong interest in vintage instruments amongst musicians who play [[blues]], [[roots rock]], [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and [[indie rock]]. Vintage instruments that are sought out include 1950s and 1960s [[Hammond organ]]s, [[Fender Bassman]] amps and electric guitars, 1970s [[Fender Rhodes]] electric pianos and old analog effects, such as 1970s and 1980s [[stompbox]] pedals. Stores that mostly sell used equipment may also sell some new merchandise, such as new [[guitar string]]s, [[patch cord]]s and mic cables. Conversely, some stores that mostly sell new equipment may also sell some vintage, used equipment (typically a small number of high-priced collectible instruments).

==Online stores==
In the 2000s, some music stores sell their instruments and sound gear through a website that contains digital photos of the equipment, which are grouped into categories (e.g., electric guitars, amplifiers, PA gear). Each photo of a product is accompanied by the name and model number of each item, a description of each product's features and the price. The sophistication of online music stores varies. Some online music stores have a single photo of the item, the product name and price, and a few bullets about the features. On the other hand, some online music stores have interactive [[Web 2.0]] features, such as 360-degree [[virtual reality]]-style images of the products, in which the viewer can "turn" the product around to see the back and sides, online comments sections where customers can review their purchases and additional music-related content, such as articles on musical instruments or sound gear written by store staff. Patrons pay electronically at online music stores using a credit card, [[PayPal]] or other electronic payment systems. The goods are shipped through the mail or by express delivery companies such as [[FedEx]]. Some music stores sell their products solely online. In other cases, some stores operate both a "bricks and mortar" store (or chain) and an online store.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12671">[[File:Open research.ogv|500px|thumb|thumbtime=43|Open research is concerned with making scientific research more transparent, more collaborative and more efficient. A central aspect to it is to provide [[open access]] to scientific information, especially to the research published in [[scholarly journal]]s and to the underlying [[scientific data|data]], much of which traditional science tends to hide away. Other aspects are more open forms of collaboration and engagement with a wider audience, including [[citizen science|citizen scientists]] and the public at large.]]

'''Open research''' is research conducted in the spirit of [[free and open-source software]]. Much like open-source schemes that are built around a [[source code]] that is made public, the central theme of open research is to make clear accounts of the methodology freely available via the internet, along with any data or results extracted or derived from them. This permits a massively distributed collaboration, and one in which anyone may participate at any level of the project.

Especially if the research is scientific in nature, it is frequently referred to as [[open science]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see [https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Discovery-New-Networked-Science/dp/0691148902/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319948131&amp;sr=1-1 "Reinventing Discovery"] by Michael Nielsen, Princeton University Press (21 October 2011), {{ISBN|0-691-14890-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woelfle|first=Michael|author2=Olliaro, Piero |author3=Todd, Matthew H. |title=Open science is a research accelerator|journal=Nature Chemistry|date=23 September 2011|volume=3|issue=10|pages=745–748|doi=10.1038/nchem.1149|url=http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v3/n10/full/nchem.1149.html|accessdate=16 October 2013|pmid=21941234|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Open research'' can also include [[social sciences]], the [[humanities]], [[mathematics]], engineering and medicine.

== Types of open projects ==
Important distinctions exist between different types of open projects.

Projects that provide open data but don't offer open collaboration are referred to as "[[Open access (publishing)|open access]]" rather than open research. Providing [[open data]] is a necessary but not sufficient condition for open research, because although the data may be used by anyone, there is no [[Share-alike|requirement for subsequent research to take place openly]]. For example, though there have been many calls for more open collaborative research in drug discovery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Andrew L.|author2=Witty, Michael J. |author3=Nwaka, Solomon |title=Neglected Diseases Mission possible|journal=Nature|date=13 September 2007|volume=449|issue=7159|pages=166–169|doi=10.1038/449166a|pmid=17851512|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7159/full/449166a.html|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the open deposition of large amounts of data,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7296/full/nature09107.html F. -J. Gamo, et al. Thousands of chemical starting points for antimalarial lead identification. ''Nature'' '''2010''', ''465'', 305–310]&lt;/ref&gt; there are very few active, openly collaborative projects in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openwetware.org/wiki/Open_Source_Drug_Discovery Open Source Drug Discovery wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osdd.net/ Indian Open Source Drug Discovery portal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mendeley.com/groups/1150251/open-source-drug-discovery/ Mendeley Group on Open Source Drug Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crowdsourcing]] projects that recruit large numbers of participants to carry out small tasks which are then assembled into a larger project outcome have delivered significant research outcomes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature09304 S. Cooper, ''et al.'' Predicting protein structures with a multiplayer online game. ''Nature'' '''2010''' ''466'', 756–760]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13490.x K. Land et al. Galaxy Zoo: the large-scale spin statistics of spiral galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ''Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.'' '''2008''', ''388'', 1686–1692]&lt;/ref&gt; but these projects are distinct from those in which participants are able to influence the overall direction of the research, or in which participants are expected to have creative input into the science behind the project.

Most open research is conducted within existing research groups. Primary research data are posted which can be added to, or interpreted by, anyone who has the necessary expertise and who can therefore join the collaborative effort. Thus the "end product" of the project (which may still be subject to future expansion or modification) arises from many contributions across multiple research groups, rather than the effort of one group or individual. Open research is therefore distinct from open access in that the output of open research is prone to change with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todd|first=Matthew H.|title=Open access and open source in chemistry|journal=Chemistry Central Journal|date=1 January 2007|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1186/1752-153X-1-3|pmid=17939849|pmc=1975827|url=http://journal.chemistrycentral.com/content/1/1/3|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike open access, true open research must demonstrate live, online collaboration. Project websites that demonstrate this capability have started to become available.&lt;ref name=TSL&gt;[http://www.thesynapticleap.org/ The Synaptic Leap]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MIAWiki&gt;[http://confocal-manawatu.pbworks.com/w/page/49706793/MIAWiki%20Real-Time%20Collaboration/ MIAWiki for Open Research and Collaboration]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, open research became more mainstream with web based platforms such as [[figshare]] continuing to grow in terms of users and publicly available outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, S: [http://research.gigaom.com/2013/12/tools-for-sharing-open-research-materials-zenodo-and-figshare/ Tools for sharing open research materials]

The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Committee met in 2014 to address one key element of the incentive systems: journals' procedures and policies for publication. The committee consisted of disciplinary leaders, journal editors, funding agency representatives, and disciplinary experts largely from the social and behavioral sciences. By developing shared standards for open practices across journals, the committee said it hopes to translate scientific norms and values into concrete actions and change the current incentive structures to drive researchers' behavior toward more openness.&lt;ref name=Science-Mag-2015-06-26/&gt; The committee said it sought to produce guidelines that (a) focus on the commonalities across disciplines, and that (b) define what aspects of the research process should be made available to the community to evaluate, critique, reuse, and extend. The committee added that the guidelines aim to help improve journal policies in order to help transparency, openness, and reproducibility "become more evident in daily practice and ultimately improve the public trust in science, and science itself."&lt;ref name="Science-Mag-2015-06-26"&gt;B.

'''Ori Gersht''' (born 1967) is an [[Israel]]i [[fine art photographer]]. He is a professor of photography at the [[University for the Creative Arts]] in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], Kent, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucreative.ac.uk/index.cfm?articleid=15756 Ori Gersht, UCA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ori Gersht was born in Tel Aviv. He graduated in Photography, Film and Video from [[University of Westminster]], London and studied for an M.A. in Photography from the [[Royal College of Art]], London.
==Art career==
Gersht has exhibited widely in museums and galleries since the early 1990s. He is represented by Angles Gallery in Los Angeles, [[CRG Gallery]] in New York, Ben Brown Fine Arts in London, and [http://nogagallery.com/ Noga Gallery] in Tel Aviv. In 2012, Gersht's show ''History Repeating'' was mounted at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/arts/design/ori-gersht-history-repeating-at-museum-of-fine-arts-in-boston.html?pagewanted=all Beauty, Tender and Fleeting, Amid History’s Ire]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic themes==
Gersht engages the themes of life, death, violence, and beauty. His photographs and films transcribe  images of sites of historical significance—the [[Judean Desert]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Auschwitz]], the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] region of [[Ukraine]], the Lister Route in the [[Pyrenees]] (on which [[Walter Benjamin]] made his ill-fated exodus from Nazi-occupied France)—into ciphers of psychological disruption. Such scenes may not seem out of the ordinary unto themselves, but, through the artist’s focused attention and treatment they evoke the emotional resonance of what has transpired—most often, violence, and, more significantly, the ghosts of war’s most egregious detritus, its refugees.
Pervasive in Gersht’s work is the [[landscape]], as a place, an idea, and an art historical trope. His films and photographs may be compared to paintings in their display—from their unhindered access (no Plexiglas separates their surfaces from the viewer) to the frames surrounding the monitors on which the films often play. Moreover, the vistas and horizons of, for instance, "Between Places" (1998–2000), "White Noise" (1999–2000), "The Clearing/Liquidation" (2005), and "Evaders" (2009), recall Romantic depictions of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. They conjure precedents in both photography, such as the breathtaking vistas of [[Andreas Gursky]] and the landscapes of the American South by [[Sally Mann]], and painting, by [[J.M.W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]], and even [[Mark Rothko]].

In his  [[still life]] series Gersht investigated the relationships between [[photography]], [[technology]] and optical perception, at a pivotal moment in the history of photography where [[digital technology]] both threatens a crisis and promises a breakthrough. Research into the early history of the medium of photography is brought together with theoretical discourse, creating, still image and films that (literally) explode the genre of still life, the beautiful and destructive results captured using cutting-edge technology. In "Pomegranate", a film that references [[Juan Sanchez Cotan]]’s 17th-century still life and [[Harold Edgerton]]’s stroboscopic photography, a high velocity bullet flies across the frame in slow motion and obliterates a suspended [[pomegranate]] fruit, bursting it open and wheeling it slowly into the air like a smashed violated mouth spraying seeds. A peaceful image is transformed into bloodshed, and a dialogue is established between stillness and motion, peace and violence.

Gersht’s photographs and films provide a meditation on life, loss, destiny and chance.  Allusions to the catastrophic violence of the [[French Revolution]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], the bombing of [[Hiroshima]], and the suicide bombs that Gersht anticipated during his childhood in [[Israel]] can all be found in this work.  As such, it reminds us of our past, present, and future, and, above all, the fragility of life itself.

The '''''Portrait of Juan de Pareja''''' is a painting by Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] of his assistant [[Juan de Pareja]], a notable painter in his own right, who was [[Slavery in Spain|enslaved]] and owned by Velázquez at the time the painting was completed. Velázquez painted the portrait in [[Rome]], while traveling in [[Italy]], in 1650.  It is the earliest known [[Portrait painting#Baroque and Rococo|portrait]] of a Spanish man of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=The Image of the Black in Western Art, Volume III|last=Stoichita|first=Victor|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|others=|year=2010|isbn=9780674052611|editor-last=Bindman|editor-first=David|edition=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=226|chapter=The Image of the Black in Spanish Art: Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries|oclc=555658364|editor-last2=Gates, Jr|editor-first2=Henry Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the first painting to sell for more than £1,000,000. At the time of the painting's purchase by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1970 they considered it "among the most important acquisitions in the Museum's history".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 1971|title=Juan de Pareja by Diego Velázquez|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/juan_de_pareja_by_diego_velazquez_the_metropolitan_museum_of_art_bulletin_v_29_no_10_part_ii_june_1971|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in [[New York City]].

==History==
In 1649, as court painter to [[Philip IV of Spain]], Diego Velázquez was sent to Rome to purchase works of art for the [[Alcázar]] in Madrid. Velázquez brought with him Juan de Pareja, a  [[Slavery in Spain|enslaved man]], who served as an assistant in the artist's workshop.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art website"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/437869 Metropolitan Museum of Art website]&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Rome, Velázquez executed an oil painting of Juan de Pareja, which was displayed as part of a larger exhibition of paintings at the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] on 19 March 1650. According to Antonio Palomino's biography of Velázquez, the painting "was generally applauded by all the painters from different countries, who said that the other pictures in the show were art but this one alone was 'truth'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Palomino, Antonio | title= El Museo pictórico y escala óptica | year=1724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Velázquez painted the portrait of [[Juan de Pareja]], who was of Moorish descent,&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art website"/&gt; in his workshop, as an exercise in preparation for his official [[portrait of Pope Innocent X]]. The Pope, a ruddy-faced man who would be depicted in the bright pink and crimson robes of his office, presented a tricky study in both color and composition. Additionally, since he would be executing a portrait from life, Velázquez would be forced to work quickly while still capturing the essence of Innocent X's character. The ''Portrait of Juan de Pareja'' reflects Velázquez's exploration of the difficulties he would encounter in the Pope's portrait. To compensate for a restricted palette of colors, Velázquez adopted a loose, almost impressionistic style of brushwork to bring an intense vitality to his subject.

Juan de Pareja (circa 1610 – 1670) became an artist in his own right, and in 1654 he was freed by Velázquez.&lt;ref name="Metropolitan Museum of Art website"/&gt;

== Provenance and copies ==
The [[Provenance|painting's ownership]] between its first exhibition at the Pantheon in Rome in 1650 and the end of the eighteenth century is unknown. There is no record of the painting in Spain. The earliest record of the ownership of the painting was in essay written in 1765 by [[Francisco Preciado]], Director of the [[Real Academia Española|Royal Spanish Academy]] in Rome. He stated that the painting owned by Cardinal Trajano D'Acquaviva (1694-1747) who lived in Rome.

The painting then reappears in the record as part of the dukes of Baranello's collection in [[Naples]] sometime in the 1700s. It was recorded as part of the collection of [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]], the [[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to the Two Sicilies#Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Naples and.2For the Kingdom of Sicily|British Ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples]] from 1764 to 1798. The inventory of his residence in Naples, Palazzo Sessa, lists  "a portrait of a Moresco slave by Velazquez." Hamilton sent the portrait and his other works of art to London for safekeeping, on board the ship [[HMS Foudroyant (1798)|HMS Fondroyant]] the [[flagship]] of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]], when he left Naples. Hamilton returned to England heavily in debt and the portrait was auctioned at [[Christie's]] in 1801. The auction catalogue listed the painting as Velazquez's "Portrait of a Moorish Slave, that was in his service, and became a great Painter". It sold for 39 guineas and disappeared from the record again.

It later surfaces in the collection of [[Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, 2nd Earl of Radnor|Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie]], 2nd [[Earl of Radnor]] at [[Longford Castle]], [[Salisbury]]. In a catalogue of the Radnor family's collection, published in 1909, stated that the portrait was part of the collection by 1814 and may have been acquired in 1811. It remained in the ownership of the Radnor family for over 150 years until it was sold at Christie's in London for the record sum of £2,310,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/dec/01/archive-velazquez-scarred-price-tag|title=From the Observer archive: 29 November 1970: A Velázquez now forever scarred by its £2m price-tag|last=Gosling|first=Nigel|date=2013-12-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 2,200,000 guineas&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.countrylife.co.uk/luxury/art-and-antiques/5-sales-made-christies-no-5-first-million-pound-picture-144183|title=The 5 sales which made Christie’s - No.5: The first million-pound picture - Country Life|date=2016-12-30|work=Country Life|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or $5,544,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 5, 1971|title=Comment|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1971/06/05/comment-5350|journal=The New Yorker|volume=|pages=31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on 27 November 1970.  It was the first painting to sell for more than a £1,000,000, setting a new record for the price of paintings sold at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/11/the-story-of-the-first-painting-to-sell-for-over-a-million-pounds/|title=The story of the first painting to sell for over a million pounds|last=Cork|first=Richard|date=2014-11-22|work=The Spectator|access-date=2017-10-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alec N. Wildenstein|Alec Wildenstein]] of [[Wildenstein &amp; Company (art dealers)|Wildenstein &amp; Company]] bid for the painting acting on behalf of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bzkFXl1ZkI8C&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Landscape with Figures: A History of Art Dealing in the United States|last=Goldstein|first=Malcolm|date=2000-11-30|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198031277|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was acquired by the Museum in 1971, principally with through from the [[Isaac Dudley Fletcher|Fletcher Fund]], with an understanding the two million dollars would be paid back over time with income generated from the [[Jacob S. Rogers|Rogers Fund]], Fletcher Fund and other funds "restricted to buying funds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dItWAJxHT2MC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=%22fletcher+fund%22+juan+pareja&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEyd-E_fDWAhWCnBoKHd1ZAjUQ6AEISTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fletcher%20fund%22%20juan%20pareja&amp;f=false|title=Making the Mummies Dance: Inside The Metropolitan Museum Of Art|last=Hoving|first=Thomas|date=1994-02-15|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=|isbn=9780671880750|location=|pages=264|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is considered one of the "most important acquisitions in the Museum's history". Theodore Rousseau, when Curator-in-Chief of the Museum, stated that the painting was "one of the finest works of art to come on the market in our time."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legacy and influence==

'''Repurposing''' is the process by which an object with one [[use value]] is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value.

==Description==
Repurposing is as old as [[human civilization]], with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re-appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/04/medieval-recycling/ | title=Medieval Recycling | publisher=Harvard Gazette | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts-and-crafts organizations such as [[Instructables]] and other [[Maker culture]] communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century.  Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-[[libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Malewitz, R. (2014) {{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=22814 | title=The Practice of Misuse | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=3195 | title=Throwaways: Work Culture and Consumer Education | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the [[Earthship]] style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as [[boat fender]]s and [[steel drum]]s or plastic drums as [[feeding trough]]s and/or composting bins. [[Incinerator]] and power plant exhaust stack [[fly-ash]] is used extensively as an [[concrete additive|additive to concrete]], providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as [[Textile|rags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/6081/repurpose/100-ways-repurpose-reuse-broken-household-items | title=100 Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Broken Household Items | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly, take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy, in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel, and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly, in which repurposing vehicles for [[Electric vehicle conversion|electric car conversion]] can be the recommended alternative to that, though its cost can be negligible upfront.

==Examples==
[[File:Skis repurposed as a bench.jpg|thumb|right|Skis repurposed as a bench]]
[[Image:SardiniaCoatHanger.jpg|thumb| A ladder repurposed as a coat rack in [[Sardinia]]]]
[[Image:FunnelLampshadeSardinia.jpg|thumb|A repurposed [[funnel]] [[lampshade]] in [[Sardinia]]]]
[[File:Fence post.jpg|thumb|Railway line repurposed as farm fencing corner post]][[File:NaplesBench.jpg|thumb|Improvised street bench in [[Naples]] (Italy), made from wooden pallet]]
[[File:ImprovisedDrumLondon.jpg|thumb|Improvised [[bass drum]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]].]]
[[File:WestBankCowbell.jpg|thumb|An improvised [[cowbell]], used for sheep or goats. The bell was found in 1988 in a field near [[Tuqu']] (Tekoa) in the Judean hills, the West Bank. The bell's body is made of aluminum, probably a broken kitchen utensil, while the clapper is a brass cartridge case (SMI 25 NATO, probably 7.62×51mm).]]

===Automobiles===
*[[Full-size van]]s from the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] which have been used for airport shuttle service have been repurposed as church vans mainly because of some [[depreciation]] to facilitate affordable cost for thrifty church groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/200401/200401_54_sb6_vans.cfm | title=What Church Leaders Should Know About Church Vans | publisher=Enrichment Journal | accessdate=3 August 2014 | author=Hammar, Richard R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics===
*A [[USB dead drop]] can be mounted on a [[brick wall]] since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Everdrive]] and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download [[ROM image]]s of video game cartridges onto [[SD card]]s while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329014653/http://www.stoneagegamer.com/mega-everdrive-deluxe.html Stoneagegamer's article on the Everdrive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Old Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial [[accelerometer]] of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., [[Quake-Catcher Network]].
*Discarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly [[Project Argus]]), Wi-Fi links, and microwave [[amateur radio]] [[radio beacons]].

===As a tactic for manufacturing goods===
* [[Right-hand-drive]] [[Jeep]] brand vehicles, such as the [[Jeep Wrangler]], which are initially slated for import to right-hand-drive countries, have had some specially designed versions repurposed for US and Canada [[postal service]] mail carrying, in which this tactic of repurposing can consolidate the overhead of retooling for specialty manufacturing of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/ US Drive Right: The Nation's Largest Seller Of Used Factory
Right Hand Drive Vehicles For Postal Carriers&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing of recycled goods===
*[[Reusable packaging]] can be reused for a wide variety of other purposes.
* [[Recycling]] can also involve repurposing of materials, such as products using [[recycled paper]].&lt;ref name="debunking"&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the Myths of Recycled Paper|url=http://recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm|publisher=Recycling Point Dot Com|accessdate=4 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006094659/http://www.recyclingpoint.com.sg/Articles/feb1992myth_of_recycledpaper.htm |archivedate = 6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
[[Drug repositioning]] (also known as "drug repurposing" or "therapeutic switching") is the application of known [[Medication|drugs]] and [[Compound (chemistry)|compounds]] to treat new [[diseases]].&lt;ref name="repurpose2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleigh|first1=Sara H.|last2=Barton|first2=Cheryl L.|title=Repurposing Strategies for Therapeutics|journal=Pharmaceutical Medicine|date=23 August 2012|volume=24|issue=3|pages=151–159|doi=10.1007/BF03256811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[Pfizer]]'s [[Viagra]] for [[erectile dysfunction]] and [[Celgene]]'s [[thalidomide]] for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashburn|first1=TT|last2=Thor|first2=KB|title=Drug repositioning: identifying and developing new uses for existing drugs.|journal=Nature Reviews.

'''Riding Up Front''' ('''RUF'''), Inc. is a California-based [[501(c) organization|non-profit 501(c)(3)]] supporting immigrant rights founded by Wei-En Tan, Ph.D., who is an immigrant to the U.S. In March 2017, RUF launched the RUF Art Blog Project, an ongoing collection of stories from Uber, Lyft, and Taxi passengers and drivers illustrated in collaboration with artists from around the world. The art blog also collects donations to support nonprofits doing work for immigrant populations such as [[American Civil Rights Union|the ACLU]], the [[American Immigration Council]] and the [[International Rescue Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/03/29/immigrant-stories-riding-up-front-art-blog/|title=Stunning art blog tells the stories of immigrant cab drivers from around the world|last=Dupere|first=Katie|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Riding Up Front was originally a personal blog of Tan's that aimed to record memorable conversations she had with her [[Uber (company)|Uber]], [[Lyft]] and Taxi drivers during business trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/27/riding-up-front-art-group-features-immigration-stories-of-uber-lyft-drivers/|title="Riding up Front" art group features immigration stories of Uber, Lyft drivers|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 2016 [[United States presidential election|American elections]], Tan realized there was a growing animosity toward immigrants largely fueled by a lack of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.citylab.com/navigator/2017/03/riding-up-front-with-immigrants-and-their-stories/520776/|title=Riding Along With Drivers' Stories|work=CityLab|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, the President Trump issued the [[Executive Order 13769|travel ban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lbpost.com/life/arts-culture/2000010579-riding-up-front-art-blog-raises-awareness-of-legal-immigrants-one-rideshare-at-a-time|title=Riding Up Front Art Blog Raises Awareness of Legal Immigrants, One Rideshare at a Time|work=Long Beach Post|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Tan and Dr. Anais Rameau, RUF Board Chair, decided to expand the personal blog into a community-driven creative project in hope to humanize immigrants in light of the current political climate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/sd-me-immigrant-blog-20170324-story.html|title=San Diegan uses art blog to share stories of immigrants|last=Morrissey|first=Kate|work=sandiegouniontribune.com|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; both in the U.S. and worldwide.

'''Santa Fe University of Art and Design''' ('''SFUAD''') was a [[For-profit higher education in the United States|for-profit]], accredited four-year university located in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]], US. The university was built from the College of Santa Fe, a Catholic facility founded as '''St. Michael's College''' in 1859, and renamed '''The College of Santa Fe''' in 1966. After financial difficulties in 2009, the campus was purchased by the City of Santa Fe, the State of New Mexico, and [[Laureate Education]], and reopened with a narrowed focus on the film, theater, and other arts. As the Santa Fe University of Art and Design it became a secular college of 950 students.&lt;ref name=petersons/&gt; According to the U.S. Department of Education, as of 2017 the overall graduation rate is 22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/school/?188146-Santa-Fe-University-of-Art-and-Design|title=College Scorecard - Santa Fe University of Art and Design|date=2016|publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university closed in May 2018.&lt;ref name=closure&gt;{{cite web|url=http://santafeuniversity.edu/public/default_site/files/Official_Statement_for_Website.pdf|title=Official Statement - Santa Fe University of Art and Design|date=2017|publisher=Santa Fe University of Art and Design|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{seealso|St. Michael's High School#History}}
St. Michael's College was established at the behest of Archbishop [[Jean-Baptiste Lamy]], who had arrived in New Mexico in 1851 to find that formal schooling in the territory was nonexistent. After establishing the Loretto Academy for girls in 1852, Lamy recruited the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle Christian Brothers]] to open a similar school for boys, and St. Michael's held its first classes in the fall of 1859. In the 1870s, the school appointed a new leader, Brother Botulph, who oversaw its growth into an institution of higher learning. Under Botulph, St. Michael's began offering high school diplomas, and later, teaching certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mission and History | url=https://www.stmichaelssf.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=346686&amp;type=d&amp;pREC_ID=755200 | publisher=St. Michael's High School | accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 it received a charter from the territorial legislature, making it the oldest chartered college in New Mexico.&lt;ref name=bizeducation&gt;[http://santafebiz.org/about/education Colleges and Universities], City of Santa Fe Economic Development&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the school completed a new [[Lamy Building|main building]] which still stands in altered form on Old Santa Fe Trail.

[[Image:LamyBuildingSantaFeNM0.JPG|thumb|left|The 1878 [[Lamy Building]] originally housed St. Michael's College]]
Eventually, with different types of educational institutions becoming more sharply delineated, St. Michael's phased out its post-secondary courses by the end of [[World War I]] to operate strictly as [[St. Michael's High School]]. However, in the 1940s, the school's former principal Brother Benildus of Mary decided to re-establish St. Michael's College as an institution of higher learning. In 1944 he launched a fundraiser to build a new college on the existing campus which fell short of the goal. However, he got a second chance when the former Bruns Army General Hospital on Cerrillos Road was declared surplus property at the end of [[World War II]]. In 1947, Benildus managed to secure a portion of the hospital complex totaling {{convert|125|acre|ha}} and 39 semi-permanent wooden buildings for the new college, which was ready to begin classes in the fall. By 1949 the college had over 200 students, and in 1961 it completed its first permanent building, Brother Benildus Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=St. Michael's College Steeped in SF History | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18296167/the_santa_fe_new_mexican/ | accessdate=March 15, 2018 | work=Santa Fe New Mexican | date=May 28, 1961 | via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the Christian Brothers changed the name of the school to the  College of Santa Fe.&lt;ref name=bizeducation /&gt;

In February 2009, the College of Santa Fe declared a state of financial emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/College-of-Santa-Fe-Declares/42438/ |title=College of Santa Fe Declares Financial Emergency - Graduate Students - The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to merge with [[Highlands University]] faltered due to funding concerns, and the school nearly closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/College-of-Santa-Fe-Says-It/42491 |title=College of Santa Fe Says It Will Close - Graduate Students - The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle.com |date=2009-02-27 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, a public-private partnership that included the City of Santa Fe, the New Mexico State Governor's Office and [[Laureate Education]] (a for-profit corporation) purchased the campus, reopening the school as The College of Santa Fe, under different leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hay|first=Kiera|title=College of Santa Fe Deferred Maintenance Fund Depleted|url=http://www.abqjournal.com/149080/blogs/college-of-santa-fe-deferred-maintenance-fund-depleted.html|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=Albuquerque Journal|date=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/college-of-santa-fe-saved-by-city-deal-with-laureate-education/7530 College of Santa Fe Saved by City Deal With Laureate Education], The Chronicle of Higher Education, July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changinghighereducation.com/2010/02/an-updatecorrection-on-the-college-of-santa-fe.html An update/correction on the College of Santa Fe], Changing Higher Education, Feb 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johan Christian Dahl - Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''Shipwreck on the Norwegian Coast''''' or '''''Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway''''' (Norwegian - ''Skibbrudd ved den norske kyst'') is an 1832 [[Marine painter|marine painting]] by [[JC Dahl]]. It is now in the [[National Gallery of Norway]], to which it was left in 1931 by Louise and Johannes G. Heftye.

Heftye had already painted a first version of the work in 1819, and painted several others in his career, inspired by his five long voyages along the [[Norwegian coastline|coast of Norway]]. A smaller variant is in the Bergen Billedgalleri.

A '''stamp catalog''' (or '''stamp catalogue''') is a catalog of [[postage stamp]] types with descriptions and prices.

The stamp catalog is an essential tool of [[philately]] and [[stamp collecting]]. Stamp catalogs are part of [[philatelic literature]].

== History ==
The first stamp catalog was published in France by [[Oscar Berger-Levrault]] on 17 September 1861 and the first illustrated catalog by [[Alfred Potiquet]] in December 1861 (based on the earlier work).

The first catalogs in Great Britain were published in 1862 by [[Frederick Booty]],&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;Phillips, Stanley. ''Stamp Collecting: A guide to modern philately'', revised edition, Stanley Gibbons, London, 1983, p.243. {{ISBN|0-85259-047-4}}.

Sloane in ''Stamps'', 13 July 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The first in the United States was ''The Stamp Collector's Manual'' by A.C. Kline (a pseudonym for John William Kline), also 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Trenchard and George T. Turner, "John William Kline America's First Philatelic Author", in ''Philatelic Literature Review'', Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 24-41, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally catalogs were just [[Stamp dealer|dealer]]s' price lists, though today that is less common.  The catalogs of some major publishers continue to serve as an official price list for the publisher.  For example, Stanley Gibbons in the United Kingdom specifically states in the catalog that the price listed is the estimated selling price by Stanley Gibbons Ltd.  On the other had, Scott in the United States does not sell stamps.  Rather, the Scott catalog serves as a reference document for expected prices used by buyers and sellers.  Over time, as [[philately]] developed, catalogs tended to accumulate additional supporting details about the stamps, such as dates of issue, color variations, and so forth. As their use by collectors became widespread, the catalogs came to define what was and was not a legitimate stamp, since many collectors would avoid stamps not described in the catalog. In recent years, the [[Internet]] has become a common resource for information about stamps. Some catalogs have an on-line version while others are available only on-line.

== Current catalogs ==
The following catalogs have a worldwide coverage:
*[[Michel catalog|Michel]] - printed, software and online
*[[Scott catalog|Scott]] - printed, pdf-format and online
*[[Stanley Gibbons#Stamp catalogues|Stanley Gibbons]] - printed and online
*[[Yvert et Tellier]] - printed only

These are large undertakings, since there are thousands of new stamps to describe each year, and the prices of all stamps may go up or down. For publishers that are not dealers, the prices are estimated by data from dealers and auctions.

In addition, the catalog publishers usually put out specialized volumes with additional details, generally by nationality: Michel has a specialized German catalog, Scott a specialized US catalog, and so forth.

Many countries have their own "national catalogs", typically put out by a leading publisher or dealer in that country. Postal administrations may themselves put out catalogs, although they tend to be aimed at less-experienced collectors, and rarely provide fully detailed stamp data. Some notable country catalogs include:

In a typical TASK party, a limited number of invited participants each perform tasks as they interpret, as written on slips of paper drawn at random.  Once finished, they write a new task for others, and draw a new one for themselves.  The events are held in public spaces such as university student commons, or in other large areas (outdoors, museums), where the public at large can easily interact as they enter the space.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

[[File:TAGA Logo - 2009.png|thumbnail|right|TAGA Logo]]
The '''Technical Association of the Graphic Arts''' (TAGA) is an organization founded in 1948 in [[Chicago, Illinois]] to publish information about the [[graphic arts]] industry. It currently operates out of [[Warrendale, Pennsylvania]].

==Background==
Founded as the Technical Association of the [[Lithographic]] Industry (TALI), the organization was re-branded as TAGA in 1951&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printing.org/page/3771] at TAGA website&lt;/ref&gt; and has continued with that name ever since. The organization works with student chapters around the world to publish information about the [[graphic arts]] industry on a yearly basis after its Annual Technical Conference held at a different location each year in [[North America]].

TAGA provides to individual members worldwide, also maintains the industry's best permanent set of technical papers and abstracts. TAGA serves the CTO, CIO, and R&amp;D management personnel of printers, publishers, and premedia companies, as well as engineers and scientists employed by graphic arts systems and equipment providers, ink manufacturers, and paper manufacturers. TAGA focuses on graphic arts systems, [[software]], and computer technology developments, as well as areas of press, ink, and paper engineering applications. The association also provides guidance and support to student chapters around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.printing.org/abouttaga|title=About TAGA|website=Printing.org|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, TAGA became a part of [[Printing Industries of America]] and is no longer an independent organization.

==Student chapters==
Established in 1985, the [http://www.printing.org/tagastudent TAGA Student Chapters] are an integral part of the TAGA organization. Organized TAGA Student Chapters as well as individual students at several universities participate in technical research that is presented at the [http://tagaatc.printing.org Annual Technical Conference].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.printing.org/tagastudent|title=TAGA Student Chapters|website=Printing.org|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objectives of the TAGA Student Chapters are:
* To encourage research and scholarship among students at colleges and universities in the graphic arts and related disciplines
* To encourage dialogue among young scholars about technical issues impacting the graphic arts presently and about those issues of future importance
* To establish an organized body of individuals who are dedicated to pursuing careers in graphic arts technology, science, research, or teaching
* To provide students with publishing opportunities through the publication of a technical student publication by the student chapters
* To stimulate future TAGA membership by keeping objectives and activities in the forefront of students studying graphic arts or related disciplines
TAGA Currently has eight participating chapters in 2016: [[Appalachian State University]], [[Ball State University]], [[California Polytechnic State University|Cal Poly State University]], [[Clemson University]], [[Grenoble Institute of Technology]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], [[Ryerson University]], and [[Western Michigan University]].

==Sponsorship==
TAGA is currently [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by several companies related to the graphic arts, including—but not limited to — [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]], [[Fujifilm|FUJIFILM North America]], [http://www.gmgcolor.com/ GMG Color], [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen|Heidelberg USA, Inc.]], [[Konica Minolta|Konica Minolta Business Solutions]], and [[Sappi|Sappi North America]]

The '''''Bean eater''''' (Italian: ''Mangiafagioli'') is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] painter [[Annibale Carracci]]. Dating from 1580-1590 (probably 1583-1585), it is housed in the gallery of [[Palazzo Colonna]] of [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Robert|title=Rome|year=2011|publisher=Hachette|isbn=9780297857853|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3TsPpSRLRAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is connected to the contemporary ''[[Butcher's Shop (Annibale Carracci)|Butcher's Shop]]'' (now at Oxford), for it shares the same popularesque style. Painted in Bologna, it is a broadly and realistically painted still life, which owes much to Flanders and Holland.&lt;ref name=Hibbard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|year=1985|publisher=Westview Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780064301282|page=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carracci was also influenced in the depiction of everyday life subjects by [[Vincenzo Campi]] and [[Bartolomeo Passarotti]]. Manifest is Carracci's capability to adapt his style, making it "lower" when concerning "lower" subjects like the ''Mangiafagioli'', while in his more academic works (such as the broadly contemporary ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Carracci)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'') he was able to use a more classicist composure with the same ease.

{{italic title}}
'''''The Fair Penitent''''' is [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe's]] stage adaptation of the tragedy ''[[The Fatal Dowry]],'' the [[Philip Massinger]] and [[Nathan Field]] collaboration first published in 1632. Rowe's adaptation, premiered onstage in 1702 and first published in 1703, was a great popular success through much of the 18th century, and was praised by critics as demanding as [[Samuel Johnson]] ("There is scarcely any work of any poet so interesting by the fable and so delightful in the language").&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Brawley, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In making his adaptation, Rowe eliminated characters and simplified the action "to create a more focused play than the original." He pursued "neoclassical simplicity" but in the process sacrificed the "underlying moral principles" of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 98-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe shifted the setting from [[Dijon]] to [[Genoa]], and changed the main characters' names:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|''Fatal Dowry''
|''Fair Penitent''
|-
|Rochfort
|Sciolto
|-
|Charalois
|Altamont
|-
|Romont
|Horatio
|-
|Novall Junior
|Lothario
|-
|Pontalier
|Rossano
|-
|Beaumelle
|Calista
|-
|Bellapert
|Lucilla
|}

Rowe also accentuated the role of the [[female protagonist]], making the play much more a vehicle for a female star performer, a "better acting piece" for a prominent actress.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, pp. 124-7. In the original production of ''The Fatal Dowry,'' all the female roles were played by [[boy player|boy actors]], since women did not appear on the English stage until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the original "concentrates largely on the legal and political affairs of the cuckolded husband," Rowe focused far more directly on the domestic tragedy of Calista's infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was staged at both of the major London theatres of the day, [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]; the former production starred [[Sarah Siddons|Mrs. Siddons]] as Calista. The 1703 first edition was dedicated to the [[Duchess of Ormond]]&amp;mdash;but did not credit the original authors of ''The Fatal Dowry,'' leading to later critics' accusations of [[plagiarism]] against Rowe, as in [[William Gifford]]'s edition of Massinger's works.

==Legacy==
The [[eponym]] "[[Lothario]]," meaning "a man who seduces women," stems from the character in this play. The origin of Lothario as a name indicating a seducer though predates the play. The latter is thought to be written in 1619. The character of Lothario as a seducer, albeit in different circumstances, appears earlier in ''[[Don Quixote]]'' by [[Cervantes]]. In this story Lothario is urged by his lifelong friend [[Don Quixote#Other stories|Anselmo]] to attempt to seduce his wife in order to test her faithfulness. At first most unwilling he eventually enters into the scheme with skill and success. This earlier Lothario is a successful seducer.

[[Malcolm Goldstein]] edited ''The Fair Penitent'' for a modern edition in 1969. Critics, both traditional and modern, have debated whether Calista is actually "penitent" for her infidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Marriage Feast At Cana''''' is a painting that was until recently attributed to [[Hieronymus Bosch]]. The painting resides at the [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands.
Several copies exist of this picture.  Until recently the copy in Boijmans has been considered the original.  Dendrochronological analysis, however, has now proven conclusively that it cannot have been painted earlier than 1550.

==Provenance==
A wedding-feast by or after Bosch belonged to the Rubens collection in [[Antwerp]].
The painting at Boijmans was bought in Antwerp by an English painter.  It has been sawed down and the upper corners subsequently shaped into steps.  At the time it showed a portrait and only when the overpainting was removed did the tempera painting of the wedding come to light.  “What was revealed was a poor, not to say, wholly disfigured, painting”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roger H.|last= Marijnissen|title=Hieronymus Bosch.

'''The White Stag Group''' was a group of artists centred on the painters [[Basil Rakoczi]] and [[Kenneth Hall (artist)|Kenneth Hall]].

Founded in London in 1935, the group moved to Ireland in 1939 and stayed until after the [[Second World War]] where they gained Irish members like Thurloe Conolly, Paul Egestorff, Stephen Gilbert and Patrick Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antiquesandartireland.com/2011/10/art-ireland-white-stag/|title=WHITE STAG GROUP EXHIBITION AT ADAM’S, CLANDEBOYE «  antiquesandartireland.com|website=antiquesandartireland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their group philosophy, which they called ''Subjectivist Art'', was not associated with any particular style or set belief. Instead, it encouraged an exploration of [[psychology]] and of [[modernism|modernist]] ideas. They also believed in aesthetic experimentation and [[aesthetics]] as an objective in art. Although formed in London and guided by two British born artists (Hall and Rakozci) the group has been described as "an Irish phenomenon" by the Irish art expert Dr. S.B. Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modernart.ie/en/downloads/whitestagbk.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629203750/http://www.modernart.ie/en/downloads/whitestagbk.doc |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was at the vanguard of modern artistic ideas in Ireland, were involved in the [[Irish Exhibition of Living Art]] and influenced [[Patrick Scott (artist)|Patrick Scott]], [[Gerald Dillon]] and [[Louis le Brocquy]]. The Irish composer [[Brian Boydell]], at that time a visual artist, was also a member of the group. The [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] put on a White Stag retrospective during the summer of 2005.

[[File:Light dispersion of a mercury-vapor lamp with a flint glass prism IPNr°0125.jpg|thumb|White [[light]] is [[dispersion (optics)|dispersed]] by a [[triangular prism (optics)|prism]] into the colors of the visible spectrum.]]

The '''visible spectrum''' is the portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] that is [[visual perception|visible]] to the [[human eye]]. [[Electromagnetic radiation]] in this range of [[wavelength]]s is called '''visible light''' or simply [[light]]. A typical [[human eye]] will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to 700 [[nanometers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Biology: Concepts and Applications | author = Starr, Cecie | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-534-46226-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=RtSpGV_Pl_0C&amp;pg=PA94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430–770 [[Hertz#SI prefixed forms of hertz|THz]].

The spectrum does not contain all the [[color]]s that the human eyes and brain can distinguish. [[Excitation purity|Unsaturated colors]] such as [[pink]], or [[purple]] variations like [[magenta]], for example, are absent because they can only be made from a mix of multiple wavelengths. Colors containing only one wavelength are also called [[Excitation purity|pure colors]] or spectral colors.

Visible wavelengths pass largely unattenuated through the [[Earth's atmosphere]] via the "[[optical window]]" region of the electromagnetic spectrum. An example of this phenomenon is when clean air [[scattering|scatters]] blue light more than red light, and so the midday sky appears blue. The optical window is also referred to as the "visible window" because it overlaps the human visible response spectrum. The [[near infrared]] (NIR) window lies just out of the human vision, as well as the medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) window, and the long wavelength or far infrared (LWIR or FIR) window, although other animals may experience them.

==History==
[[File:Newton's color circle.png|thumb|Newton's color circle, from ''Opticks'' of 1704, showing the colors he associated with [[musical note]]s. The spectral colors from red to violet are divided by the notes of the musical scale, starting at D. The circle completes a full [[octave]], from D to D. Newton's circle places red, at one end of the spectrum, next to violet, at the other. This reflects the fact that non-spectral [[purple]] colors are observed when red and violet light are mixed.]]

In the 13th century, [[Roger Bacon]] theorized that [[rainbow]]s were produced by a similar process to the passage of light through glass or crystal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j8BCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22roger+bacon%22+prism|title=The Science of Logic: An Inquiry Into the Principles of Accurate Thought |first=Peter|last=Coffey|year=1912|publisher=Longmans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[Isaac Newton]] discovered that prisms could disassemble and reassemble white light, and described the phenomenon in his book ''[[Opticks]]''. He was the first to use the word ''spectrum'' ([[Latin]] for "appearance" or "apparition") in this sense in print in 1671 in describing his [[experiment]]s in [[optics]]. Newton observed that, when a narrow beam of [[sunlight]] strikes the face of a glass [[Dispersive prism|prism]] at an angle, some is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] and some of the beam passes into and through the glass, emerging as different-colored bands. Newton hypothesized light to be made up of "corpuscles" (particles) of different colors, with the different colors of light moving at different speeds in transparent matter, red light moving more quickly than violet in glass. The result is that red light is bent ([[refraction|refracted]]) less sharply than violet as it passes through the prism, creating a spectrum of colors.

[[File:Newton prismatic colours.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Newton's observation of prismatic colors ([[David Brewster]] 1855)]] Newton divided the spectrum into seven named colors: [[red]], [[Orange (color)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], [[indigo]], and [[Violet (color)|violet]]. He chose seven colors out of a belief, derived from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Sophism|sophists]], of there being a connection between the colors, the musical notes, the known objects in the [[solar system]], and the days of the week.&lt;ref name="Isacoff2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isacoff|first=Stuart|title=Temperament: How Music Became a Battleground for the Great Minds of Western Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kasFeTRcf4C&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=18 March 2014|date=16 January 2009|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-56051-3|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human eye is relatively insensitive to indigo's frequencies, and some people who have otherwise-good vision cannot distinguish indigo from blue and violet. For this reason, some later commentators, including [[Isaac Asimov]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|title=Eyes on the universe : a history of the telescope|year=1975|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-395-20716-1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that indigo should not be regarded as a color in its own right but merely as a shade of blue or violet. However, the evidence indicates that what Newton meant by "indigo" and "blue" does not correspond to the modern meanings of those color words. Comparing Newton's observation of prismatic colors to a color image of the visible light spectrum shows that "indigo" corresponds to what is today called blue, whereas "blue" corresponds to [[cyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Ralph M.|title=The perception of color|year=1974|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-24785-2|edition=null}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLaren|first=K.|title=Newton's indigo|journal=Color Research &amp; Application|date=March 2007|volume=10|issue=4|pages=225–229|doi=10.1002/col.5080100411}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldman|first=Gary|title=Introduction to light : the physics of light, vision, and color|year=2002|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-42118-6|pages=193|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PbsoAXWbnr4C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Newton+color+Indigo#v=onepage&amp;q=Newton%20color%20Indigo&amp;f=false|edition=Dover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe|Goethe]] wrote about optical spectra in his ''[[Theory of Colours (book)|Theory of Colours]]''. Goethe used the word ''spectrum'' (''Spektrum'') to designate a ghostly optical [[afterimage]], as did [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]''. Goethe argued that the continuous spectrum was a compound phenomenon. Where Newton narrowed the beam of light to isolate the phenomenon, Goethe observed that a wider aperture produces not a spectrum but rather reddish-yellow and blue-cyan edges with [[white]] between them. The spectrum appears only when these edges are close enough to overlap.

In the early 19th century, the concept of the visible spectrum became more definite, as light outside the visible range was discovered and characterized by [[William Herschel]] ([[infrared]]) and [[Johann Wilhelm Ritter]] ([[ultraviolet]]), [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The connection between the visible spectrum and [[color vision]] was explored by Thomas Young and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in the early 19th century. Their [[Young–Helmholtz theory|theory of color vision]] correctly proposed that the eye uses three distinct receptors to perceive color.

Many species can see light within frequencies outside the human "visible spectrum". [[Bee]]s and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light, which helps them find [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] in flowers. Plant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to their appearance in ultraviolet light rather than how colorful they appear to humans. Birds, too, can see into the ultraviolet (300–400&amp;nbsp;nm), and some have sex-dependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuthill|first=Innes C |authorlink=Innes Cuthill |editor=Peter J.B.

[[Spectroscopy]] is the study of objects based on the spectrum of color they emit, absorb or reflect. Spectroscopy is an important investigative tool in [[astronomy]], where scientists use it to analyze the properties of distant objects. Typically, [[astronomical spectroscopy]] uses high-dispersion [[diffraction grating]]s to observe spectra at very high spectral resolutions. [[Helium]] was first detected by analysis of the spectrum of the [[sun]]. [[Chemical element]]s can be detected in astronomical objects by [[emission line]]s and [[absorption line]]s.

The shifting of spectral lines can be used to measure the [[Doppler shift]] ([[red shift]] or [[blue shift]]) of distant objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7075">The '''Wagner Murals''' are the name for over 70 [[mural]] fragments illegally removed from the [[Pre-Columbian]] site of [[Teotihuacán]] in the 1960s.

== Murals of Teotihuacan ==
The murals of Teotihuacán are very different from artistic representations found in neighboring centers.  Few aspects of daily life are represented; the murals are predominantly abstract depictions of mythical deities that probably reflect a communal belief system.  Teotihuacán is also unique in the fact that, even though it is contemporaneous with initial Mayan centers, there are relatively few hieroglyphic inscriptions.  [[Esther Pasztory]], of the Teotihuacán Murals Project, has postulated that they wanted to create an art style distinctly different the preceding Olmec culture and the contemporaneous Mayan centers.  They were not interested in displaying a succession of kingship as commonly shown in other cultures of the area.

Early murals at the site are generally found located in small temples along the Avenue of the Dead and depict animals such as [[quetzal]]s and [[felidae|feline]]s as well as various plant varieties.  During the [[Xolalpan]] stage of Teotihuacán (~AD 400), however, murals could be found in a wider variety of structures including many porticoes of apartment compounds.  Additionally, themes of mythical supernatural deities and the increase in hieroglyphic notations led Pasztory to conclude that this change may mark a sort of decentralization within the society.

The Wagner Murals may help to show this process of decentralization.  One of the best examples of this transition comes from the ''Feathered Serpents and Flowering Trees'' mural.  While there are depictions of serpents and floral aspects common in early Teotihuacán artwork, within the flowering trees there are relatively rare depictions of simple [[glyph]]s.  In all, there are four feathered serpents (two from the Wagner Collection) that accompany nine plants each.  It has been suggested from some scholars that these nine plants with nine different glyphs may represent the nine lords of the underworld.  It also may be one of the first references of the migration myth of the eight tribes of the [[Aztec]]s leaving the cave of origin.

Another predominant theme represented in a number of the Wagner Murals is the image of a figure wearing a three-tassel [[headdress]].  Thought to be connected with independent collections called the St. Louis and San Francisco Collections respectively, these figures are presumed to be originally found in [[Techinantila]] compound of Teotihuacán.  Additional figures of similar form and colorations are found in the Houston and Milwaukee Collections.  All of the figures are facing to the right and disks are placed at regular intervals above the depictions.  If the proportions of this room were equivalent to those found in Teopancaxco (9mx3.4m), then this mural would have contained 20 figures surrounding the room, possibly led by the Storm God.  Additionally, various glyphs under many of these tasseled headdresses may denote the individual names with which they are associated.  As there are no discernible borders at the corners where the mural would be adjoined, these figures are thought to have been read continuously as one viewed them from wall to wall.  A border of footprints along the top of the mural pieces helps to strengthen this notion.

While the figures in this particular group seem to represent specific people or [[deity|deities]] in Teotihuacán, the three-tassel headdress also seems to become a symbol for the people themselves.  In distant areas like Tikal, for example, this three-tassel motif also shows up.  On [[Stela 31]] there is a depiction of what may be a military figure with a shield that is adorned with this very symbol.  On a further note, the Storm God is always shown with the tassel headdress.  Additionally, there are connections of the headdress to [[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan|Great Goddess]] as seen in the [[Tetitla]] compound.  This helps to show how these murals, while out of context, can help growing scholarship on interpretation.  These murals could aide in Pasztory's notion of the transition in Teotihuacán culture.  In the time of the Wagner Murals, iconography was used denote communal ideology and individual identification as well.

Almost all of the fragments were traced back in 1983 and 1984 by Rene Millon to the [[Techinantitla]] compound, some 500 yards east of the Avenue of the Dead and Pyramid of the Moon.  The remainder of the fragments were traced by Millon to the [[Tlacuilapaxco]] compound.

== Origin of the Collection ==
[[Harald Wagner]] was born in [[Falls City, Oregon]] in 1903.  He later went on to obtain a degree in [[Architecture]] from the [[University of Oregon]] at Eugene.  In 1927, Wagner moved to [[San Francisco]] and went to work as a draftsman for the architectural firm of Bliss &amp; Faville.  It was here that Wagner became adamantly interested in [[art]].  Influenced by his mentor, William Faville, and Arthur and Lucia Mathews, popular decor artists in the area, Wagner began to learn and collect art from around the world.  In the 1950s, he traveled for the first time to [[Mexico]] where he fell in love with the country and its people.  He eventually purchased a house there where he lived part-time.  It was here that, in the mid-1960s, he began to acquire a collection of mural pieces from the city of Teotihuacán.  His combined love of architecture and its various artistic components fueled his collective spirit and his collection quickly grew to over seventy pieces.  Although it seems that his original intention of this collection was to sell it for profit, increased awareness of the ethical implications of acquiring such collections nullified their marketability.  In the end, Wagner donated the entire collection to the [[de Young Museum]] in San Francisco as part of his will shortly following his death in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Ron|title=Looted|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/content/printVersion/321933/|publisher=San Francisco Weekly|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230338/http://www.sfweekly.com/content/printVersion/321933/|archivedate=2014-05-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, the collection has been extensively studied by numerous academics of Teotihuacán culture.  Because of excessive looting at the site of Teotihuacán, scholarship has been very difficult to undertake.  Very few murals were known ''in situ'' before the emergence of the Wagner Murals.  However, they may eventually help us to fully understand the artistic depictions created by the people of Teotihuacán.

[[File:great train robbery still.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Justus D. Barnes]] in Western apparel, as "Bronco Billy Anderson", from the [[silent film]] ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), the first Western film]]

The '''Western''' is a [[genre]] of various arts which tell stories set primarily in the latter half of the 19th century in the [[American frontier|American Old West]], often centering on the life of a nomadic [[cowboy]] or [[gunfighter]]&lt;ref name="kimnewman"/&gt; armed with a [[revolver]] and a [[rifle]] who rides a horse. Cowboys and gunslingers typically wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, [[cowboy boot]]s and [[buckskins]]. Recurring characters include the aforementioned cowboys, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], bandits, lawmen, [[bounty hunter]]s, outlaws, soldiers (especially mounted cavalry, such as [[buffalo soldiers]]), and settlers (farmers, ranchers, and townsfolk). The ambience is usually punctuated with a [[Western music (North America)|Western music]] [[Film score|score]], including [[American folk music|American]] and [[Music of Mexico|Mexican folk music]] such as [[country music|country]], [[Indigenous music of North America|Native American music]], [[New Mexico music]], and [[ranchera]]s.

Westerns often stress the harshness of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape of deserts and mountains. Often, the vast landscape plays an important role, presenting a "...mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West".&lt;ref name="Cowie 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowie | first=Peter | title= John Ford and the American West | publisher=Harry Abrams Inc. | location= New York | year=2004 | isbn= 0-8109-4976-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific settings include ranches, small frontier towns, saloons, railways and isolated military forts of the [[Wild West]]. 

Common plots include:
* The construction of a railroad or a telegraph line on the wild frontier.
* Ranchers protecting their family ranch from [[rustler]]s or large landowners or who build a ranch empire.
* Revenge stories, which hinge on the chase and pursuit by someone who has been wronged.
* Stories about cavalry fighting Native Americans.
* Outlaw gang plots.
* Stories about a lawman or bounty hunter tracking down his quarry.
Many Westerns use a stock plot of depicting a crime, then showing the pursuit of the wrongdoer, ending in revenge and retribution, which is often dispensed through a [[shootout]] or [[Fast draw|quick-draw]] duel.&lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;Agnew, Jeremy.

The Western was the most popular [[Hollywood]] genre from the early 20th century to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&amp;f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2. McFarland, Aug 27, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
Western films first became well-attended in the 1930s. [[John Ford]]'s landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' became one of the biggest hits in 1939 and it made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star. Westerns were very popular throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Many of the most acclaimed Westerns were released during this time, including ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'' (1953), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). Classic Westerns such as these have been the inspiration for various films about Western-type characters in contemporary settings, such as ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972), set in the 1970s, and ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005), set in the 21st century.

==Themes==
[[File:Lone ranger silver 1965.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Lone Ranger]]; a famous heroic [[wikt:lawman|lawman]] who was with a cavalry of six Texas Rangers, until they were all killed but him.  He preferred to remain anonymous, so he resigned and built a sixth grave that supposedly held his body.  He fights on as a lawman, wearing a mask, for, "Outlaws live in a world of fear.  Fear of the mysterious."]]
The Western genre sometimes portrays the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature in the name of civilization or the confiscation of the territorial rights of the original, Native American, inhabitants of the frontier.&lt;ref name="kimnewman"&gt;{{cite book| last=Newman | first=Kim | title=Wild West Movies | publisher=Bloomsbury | year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Western depicts a society organized around codes of [[honor]] and personal, direct or private justice–"frontier justice"–dispensed by gunfights. These honor codes are often played out through depictions of feuds or individuals seeking personal [[revenge]] or [[wikt:retribution|retribution]] against someone who has wronged them (e.g., ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' has revenge and retribution as its main themes). This Western depiction of personal justice contrasts sharply with justice systems organized around rationalistic, abstract law that exist in cities, in which [[social order]] is maintained predominately through relatively impersonal institutions such as [[courtroom]]s. The popular perception of the Western is a story that centers on the life of a semi-nomadic wanderer, usually a [[cowboy]] or a [[gunfighter]].&lt;ref name="kimnewman"/&gt;  A showdown or [[Duel#Colonial North America and United States|duel]] at high noon featuring two or more gunfighters is a stereotypical scene in the popular conception of Westerns.

In some ways, such protagonists may be considered the literary descendants of the [[knight errant]] which stood at the center of earlier extensive genres such as the [[King Arthur|Arthurian Romances]].&lt;ref name="kimnewman"/&gt; Like the cowboy or gunfighter of the Western, the knight errant of the earlier European tales and poetry was wandering from place to place on his horse, fighting villains of various kinds and bound to no fixed social structures but only to his own innate code of honor. And like knights errant, the heroes of Westerns frequently rescue [[damsel in distress|damsels in distress]]. Similarly, the wandering protagonists of Westerns share many characteristics with the [[ronin]] in modern Japanese culture.

The Western typically takes these elements and uses them to tell simple morality tales, although some notable examples (e.g. the later Westerns of [[John Ford]] or [[Clint Eastwood]]'s ''[[Unforgiven]]'', about an old hired killer) are more morally ambiguous. Westerns often stress the harshness and isolation of the wilderness and frequently set the action in an arid, desolate landscape. Western films generally have specific settings such as isolated ranches, Native American villages, or small frontier towns with a saloon. Often times, these settings appear deserted and without much structure. Apart from the wilderness, it is usually the saloon that emphasizes that this is the [[Wild West]]: it is the place to go for music (raucous piano playing), women (often [[prostitute]]s), gambling (draw poker or five card stud), drinking (beer or whiskey), brawling and shooting. In some Westerns, where civilization has arrived, the town has a church, a general store, a bank and a school; in others, where frontier rules still hold sway, it is, as [[Sergio Leone]] said, "where life has no value".

The [[American Film Institute]] defines Western films as those "set in the American West that [embody] the spirit, the struggle and the demise of the [[Frontier Thesis|new frontier]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=America's 10 Greatest Films in 10 Classic Genres| url= http://www.afi.com/10top10/ | publisher=[[American Film Institute]] | accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''Western'', used to describe a narrative film genre, appears to have originated with a July 1912 article in ''Motion Picture World'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;McMahan, Alison; ''Alice Guy Blache: Lost Visionary of the Cinema''; New York: Continuum, 2002; 133&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the characteristics of Western films were part of 19th-century popular [[Western fiction]] and were firmly in place before film became a popular art form.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Nash Smith, ''Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth'', Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;  Western films commonly feature protagonists such as cowboys, gunslingers, and bounty hunters, who are often depicted as semi-nomadic wanderers who wear [[Stetson]] hats, [[Kerchief|bandanna]]s, spurs, and [[buckskins]], use revolvers or rifles as everyday tools of survival–and as a means to settle disputes using "frontier justice". Protagonists ride between dusty towns and cattle ranches on their trusty steeds.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Western films were enormously popular in the [[silent film]] era (1894-1927). With the advent of sound in 1927-28, the major Hollywood studios rapidly abandoned Westerns,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/magazine/11schatz.html], ''New York Times Magazine'' (November 10, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the genre to smaller studios and producers. These smaller organizations churned out countless low-budget features and serials in the 1930s. By the late 1930s, the Western film was widely regarded as a "pulp" genre in Hollywood, but its popularity was dramatically revived in 1939 by major studio productions such as ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'' starring [[Errol Flynn]], ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' with [[Tyrone Power]], ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' with [[Joel McCrea]], ''[[Destry Rides Again]]'' featuring [[James Stewart]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]], and the release of John Ford's landmark Western adventure ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'', which became one of the biggest hits of the year. Released through United Artists, ''Stagecoach'' made [[John Wayne]] a mainstream screen star in the wake of a decade of headlining [[B westerns]]. Wayne had been introduced to the screen ten years earlier as the [[leading man]] in director [[Raoul Walsh]]'s [[widescreen]] ''[[The Big Trail]]'', which failed at the box office, due in part to exhibitors' inability to switch over to widescreen during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]. After the Western's renewed commercial successes in the late 1930s, the popularity of the Western continued to rise until its peak in the 1950s, when the number of Western films produced outnumbered all other genres combined.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ylSQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=western+most+popular+film+genre+more+combined&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7cFaVZa4J6zisAT43IDoAg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=western%20most%20popular%20film%20genre%20more%20combined&amp;f=false Indick, William. The Psychology of the Western. Pg. 2 McFarland, Aug 27, 2008. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Western films often depict conflicts with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. While early Eurocentric Westerns frequently portray the "Injuns" as dishonorable villains, the later and more culturally neutral Westerns gave Native Americans a more sympathetic treatment.  Other recurring themes of Westerns include Western treks (e.g. ''The Big Trail'') or perilous journeys (e.g. ''Stagecoach'') or groups of bandits terrorising small towns such as in ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''. Or revisionist westerns like ''[[I Walk the Line (film)|I Walk the Line]]'' (1970) depict sheriffs dueling.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Western Set Universal Studio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Western set at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Hollywood]]]]
Early Westerns were mostly filmed in the studio, just like other early Hollywood films, but when location shooting became more common from the 1930s, producers of Westerns used desolate corners of [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]], or [[Wyoming]]. These settings gave filmmakers the ability to depict vast plains, looming mountains and epic canyons. Productions were also filmed on location at [[movie ranches]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Often, the vast landscape becomes more than a vivid backdrop; it becomes a character in the film. After the early 1950s, various wide screen formats such as [[Cinemascope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] used the expanded width of the screen to display spectacular Western landscapes. [[John Ford]]'s use of [[Monument Valley]] as an expressive landscape in his films from ''[[Stagecoach (1939 film)|Stagecoach]]'' (1939) to ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]'' (1965) "present us with a mythic vision of the plains and deserts of the American West, embodied most memorably in Monument Valley, with its buttes and mesas that tower above the men on horseback, whether they be settlers, soldiers, or Native Americans".&lt;ref name="Cowie 2004"/&gt;

Author and screenwriter [[Frank Gruber]] described seven plots for Westerns:&lt;ref&gt;Gruber, Frank  ''The Pulp Jungle'' Sherbourne Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cgw199010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&amp;pub=2&amp;id=75 |title=No Soft Soap About New And Improved Computer Games |work=Computer Gaming World |date=October 1990 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |page=80 |type=editorial |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233126/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&amp;pub=2&amp;id=75 |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Union Pacific story''. The plot concerns construction of a railroad, a telegraph line, or some other type of modern technology or transportation. Wagon train stories fall into this category.
# ''Ranch story''. The plot concerns threats to the ranch from rustlers or large landowners attempting to force out the proper owners.
# ''Empire story''. The plot involves building a ranch empire or an oil empire from scratch, a classic rags-to-riches plot.
# ''Revenge story''. The plot often involves an elaborate chase and pursuit by a wronged individual, but it may also include elements of the classic mystery story.
# ''Cavalry and Indian story''. The plot revolves around "taming" the wilderness for white settlers.
# ''Outlaw story''. The outlaw gangs dominate the action.
# ''Marshal story''. The lawman and his challenges drive the plot.

Gruber said that good writers used dialogue and plot development to develop these basic plots into believable stories.{{r|cgw199010}} Other subgenres include:
* The [[Spaghetti Western]].
* The [[epic (genre)|epic]] western
* [[singing cowboy]] westerns
* a few [[:Category:Western (genre) comedy films|comedy westerns]] such as:
** ''[[Along Came Jones (film)|Along Came Jones]]'' (1945), in which [[Gary Cooper]] spoofed his western persona
** ''[[The Sheepman]]'' (1958), with [[Glenn Ford]] poking fun at himself
** ''[[Cat Ballou]]'' (1965), with a drunk [[Lee Marvin]] atop a drunk horse. 

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Western was reinvented with the [[revisionist Western]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bandy|first=Mary Lea|title=Ride, Boldly Ride: The Evolution of the American Western|year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley/Los Angeles/London|isbn=978-0-520-25866-2|page=234|author2=Kevin Stoehr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical Western====
[[File:John Wayne - 1961.JPG|right|thumb|[[John Wayne]] in ''[[The Comancheros (film)|The Comancheros]]'' (1961)]]
''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), [[Edwin S. Porter]]'s film starring [[Broncho Billy Anderson]], is often cited as the first Western, though George N. Fenin and William K. Everson point out that the "Edison company had played with Western material for several years prior to ''The Great Train Robbery''. " Nonetheless, they concur that Porter's film "set the pattern—of crime, pursuit, and retribution—for the Western film as a genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fenin|first=George N.|title=The Western: From Silents to Cinerama|year=1962|publisher=Bonanza Books|location=New York|page=47|author2=William K. Everson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's popularity opened the door for Anderson to become the screen's first cowboy star; he made several hundred Western film shorts. So popular was the genre that he soon faced competition from [[Tom Mix]] and [[William S. Hart]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The Golden Age of the Western is epitomized by the work of several directors, most prominent among them, [[John Ford]] (''[[My Darling Clementine]]'', ''[[The Horse Soldiers]]'', ''[[The Searchers]]''). Others include: [[Howard Hawks]] ([[Red River (1948 film)|''Red River'']], [[Rio Bravo (film)|''Rio Bravo'']]), [[Anthony Mann]] (''[[Man of the West]]'', ''[[The Man from Laramie]]''), [[Budd Boetticher]] (''[[Seven Men from Now]]''), [[Delmer Daves]] (''[[The Hanging Tree]]'', [[3:10 to Yuma (1957 film)|''3:10 to Yuma'']]), [[John Sturges]] (''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', ''[[Last Train from Gun Hill]]''), and [[Robert Aldrich]] ([[Vera Cruz (film)|''Vera Cruz'']], ''[[Ulzana's Raid]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oncamera.net.au/genres/drama/western-film/classical-western/|title=Classical Western {{!}}  OnCamera Studio|last=battam@icloud.com|first=Robbie Battam,|website=oncamera.net.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acid Western====
Film critic [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] refers to a makeshift 1960s and 1970s genre called the [[Acid Western]],&lt;ref name=J&gt;{{cite web|website=Jonathanrosenbaum.net|url=https://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/2013/04/responding-to-some-questions-about-acid-westerns-and-dead-man/|author=Rosenbaum, Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Rosenbaum|title=Responding to some questions about “Acid Westerns” and DEAD MAN|date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Jim McBride]], and [[Rudy Wurlitzer]], as well as films like [[Monte Hellman]]'s ''[[The Shooting]]'' (1966), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s bizarre experimental film ''[[El Topo (1970 film)|El Topo (The Mole)]]'' (1970),&lt;ref name=J/&gt; and [[Robert Downey Sr.]]'s ''[[Greaser's Palace]]'' (1972).&lt;ref name=J/&gt; The 1970 film ''El Topo'' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] [[cult movie|cult]] Western and [[underground film]] about the eponymous character, a violent black-clad [[gunfighter]], and his quest for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]. The film is filled with bizarre characters and occurrences, use of maimed and [[dwarfism|dwarf]] performers, and heavy doses of [[Christian symbolism]] and [[Eastern philosophy]]. Some Spaghetti Westerns also crossed over into the Acid Western genre, such as [[Enzo G. Castellari]]'s mystical ''[[Keoma (film)|Keoma]]'' (1976), a Western reworking of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s metaphysical ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957).

More recent Acid Westerns include [[Alex Cox]]'s film ''[[Walker (film)|Walker]]'' (1987) and [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s film ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). Rosenbaum describes the Acid Western as "formulating a chilling, savage frontier poetry to justify its hallucinated agenda"; ultimately, he says, the Acid Western expresses a counterculture sensibility to critique and replace capitalism with alternative forms of exchange.&lt;ref name="Chicago Reader"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0696/06286.html |title=''Acid Western: Dead Man'' |publisher="Chicago Reader" |date=June 26, 1996 |first=Jonathan |last=Rosenbaum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104355/http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0696/06286.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!---We need a section here on Westerns in the 80s, 90s and 2000s---&gt;

====Charro, Cabrito or Chili Westerns====
[[Charro#In cinema|Charro Westerns]], often featuring musical stars as well as action, have been a standard feature of [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] since the 1930s. In the 1930s and 1940s, these were typically films about horsemen in rural Mexican society, displaying a set of cultural concerns very different from the Hollywood meta-narrative, but the overlap between 'charro' movies and westerns became more apparent in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Rashotte, Ryan ''Narco Cinema: Sex, Drugs, and Banda Music in Mexico's B-Filmography'' Palgrave Macmillan, 23 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 Figueredo, Danilo H. ''Revolvers and Pistolas, Vaqueros and Caballeros: Debunking the Old West'' ABC-CLIO, 9 Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comedy Western====
This subgenre is imitative in style in order to mock, comment on, or trivialize the Western genre's established traits, subjects, auteurs' styles, or some other target by means of humorous, satiric, or ironic imitation or parody. A prime example of Comedy Western includes ''[[The Paleface]]'' (1948), which makes a satirical effort to "send-up Owen Wister's novel The Virginian and all the cliches of the Western from the fearless hero to the final shootout on main street. The result was The Paleface (1948) which features a cowardly hero known as "Painless" Peter Potter (Bob Hope), an inept dentist who often entertains the notion that he's a crack sharpshooter and accomplished Indian fighter". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stafford |first1=Jeff |title=The Paleface (1948) |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/88935%7C0/The-Paleface.html |website=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary Western====
Also known as Neo-Westerns, these films have contemporary U.S. settings, and they utilize Old West themes and motifs (a rebellious anti-hero, open plains and desert landscapes, and gunfights). For the most part, they still take place in the [[Western United States|American West]] and reveal the progression of the [[Old West]] mentality into the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This subgenre often features Old West-type characters struggling with displacement in a "civilized" world that rejects their outdated brand of justice.

Examples include [[John Sturges]]'s ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' (1955); ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]'', screenplay by [[Dalton Trumbo]] (1962), ''[[Hud (1963 film)|Hud]]'', starring [[Paul Newman]] (1963); [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971); ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'' (1972); ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (1972); ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974); ''[[Hearts of the West (1975 film)|Hearts of the West]]'' starring [[Jeff Bridges]] (1975); [[Alan J. Pakula]]'s ''[[Comes a Horseman]]'' (1978); ''[[J. W. Coop]]'', directed/co-written by and starring [[Cliff Robertson]]; [[Robert Rodríguez]]'s ''[[El Mariachi]]'' (1992) and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' (2003); [[John Sayles]]'s ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996); [[Tommy Lee Jones]]'s ''[[The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada]]'' (2005); [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' (2005); [[Wim Wenders]]'s ''[[Don't Come Knocking]]'' (2005); [[Joel and Ethan Coen]]'s ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007); the television show ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]'' (2010–2015); ''[[Hell or High Water (film)|Hell or High Water]]'' (2016) and ''[[Wind River (film)|Wind River]]'' (2017), both written by [[Taylor Sheridan]]; and the superhero film ''[[Logan (2017 film)|Logan]]'' (2017). ''[[Call of Juarez: The Cartel]]'' is an example of a Neo-Western video game. Likewise, the television series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', which takes place in modern times, features many examples of Western archetypes. According to creator [[Vince Gilligan]], "After the first ''Breaking Bad'' episode, it started to dawn on me that we could be making a contemporary western. So you see scenes that are like gunfighters squaring off, like [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Lee Van Cleef]]—we have [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] and others like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3019&amp;Itemid=56 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403091323/http://www.local-iq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3019&amp;Itemid=56 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 April 2013 |title=Contemporary Western: An interview with Vince Gilligan |date=27 March 2013 |publisher=[[Local iQ]] |work=News |accessdate=31 May 2013 |place=United States }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precursor to these{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} was the radio series ''[[Tales of the Texas Rangers]]'' (1950–1952), with [[Joel McCrea]], a contemporary detective drama set in Texas, featuring many of the characteristics of traditional Westerns.

====Electric Western====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zachariah.jpg|right|thumbnail|''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' (1971)]] --&gt;
The 1971 film ''[[Zachariah (film)|Zachariah]]'' starring [[John Rubinstein]], [[Don Johnson]] and [[Pat Quinn (actress)|Pat Quinn]] was billed as the "first electric Western."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The film featured multiple performing [[musical ensemble|rock bands]] in an otherwise [[American frontier|American West]] setting.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E3DE163BE53BBC4D51DFB766838A669EDE|title=Zachariah (1970) Screen: 'Zachariah,' an Odd Western|authorlink=Roger Greenspun|author=Greenspun, Roger|date=January 25, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epic Western====
The epic western is a subgenre of the western that emphasizes the story of the American Old West on a grand scale. Many epic westerns are commonly set during a turbulent time, especially a war, as in Sergio Leone's ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966), set during the American Civil War, or Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), set during the Mexican Revolution. One of the grandest films in this genre is Leone's ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), which shows many operatic conflicts centered on control of a town while utilizing wide scale shots on Monument Valley locations against a broad running time. Other notable examples include ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' (1924), ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946), ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956), ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958), ''[[Cimarron (1960 film)|Cimarron]]'' (1960), [[How the West Was Won (film)|''How the West Was Won'']] (1962), ''[[Duck, You Sucker!]]'' (1971), ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' (2007), ''[[Django Unchained]]'' (2012) and  ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' (2015).

====Euro-Western====
Euro Westerns are Western genre films made in [[Western Europe]]. The term can sometimes, but not necessarily, include the [[Spaghetti Western]] subgenre (see below). One example of a Euro Western is the Anglo-Spanish film ''[[Savage Guns (1961 film)|The Savage Guns]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]).  Several Euro-Western films, nicknamed Sauerkraut Westerns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page= 118 |authors=Brookeman, Christopher &amp; British Film Institute |title=The BFI Companion to the Western|publisher= A. Deutsch|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they were made in [[Germany]] and shot in Yugoslavia, were derived from stories by novelist [[Karl May]] and were [[Karl May film adaptations|film adaptations of May's work]]. In the 2010s some new euro-westerns emerged like [[Kristian Levring]]'s [[The Salvation (film)|''The Salvation'']], [[Martin Koolhoven]]'s [[Brimstone (2016 film)|''Brimstone'']] and [[Andreas Prochaska]]'s ''[[The Dark Valley]]''.

====Fantasy Western====
{{main|Weird West}}
Fantasy Westerns mixed in [[fantasy]] settings and themes, and may include Fantasy mythology as background. Some famous examples are [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Stand]]'' and ''[[The Dark Tower series]]'' of novels, the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] comics series ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'', and [[Keiichi Sigsawa]]'s light novel series, ''[[Kino's Journey]]'', illustrated by [[Kouhaku Kuroboshi]].

====Florida Western====
[[Florida Western]]s, also known as Cracker Westerns, are set in [[Florida]] during the [[Second Seminole War]]. An example is ''[[Distant Drums]]'' (1951) starring [[Gary Cooper]].

====Horror Western====
{{main|Weird West}}
A developing subgenre,{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} with roots in films such as ''[[Curse of the Undead]]'' (1959) and ''[[Billy the Kid vs. Dracula]]'' (1966), which depicts the legendary outlaw [[Billy the Kid]] fighting against the notorious vampire. Another example is ''The Ghoul Goes West'', an unproduced [[Ed Wood]] film to star [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Dracula]] in the Old West.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  Recent examples include the films ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) directed by [[Kathryn Bigelow]] which tells the story about a human falling in love with a [[vampire]], ''[[From Dusk till Dawn]]'' (1996) by [[Robert Rodriguez]] deals with outlaws battling vampires across the border, ''[[Vampires]]'' (1998) by [[John Carpenter]] tells about a group of vampires and vampire hunters looking for an ancient relic in the west, ''[[Ravenous (1999 film)|Ravenous]]'' (1999), which deals with cannibalism at a remote US army outpost; ''[[The Burrowers]]'' (2008), about a band of trackers who are stalked by the titular creatures; and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012). ''[[Undead Nightmare]]'' (2010), an expansion to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game in this genre, telling the tale of a [[zombie]] outbreak in the [[Old West]]. ''[[Bone Tomahawk]]'' (2016) one of the most recent entries in the genre received wide critical acclaim for its chilling tale of cannibalism but, like many other movies in the genre, it wasn't a commercial success.

====Curry Westerns and Indo Westerns====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
The first Western films made in India - ''Mosagaalaku Mosagaadu'' (1970), made in Telugu, ''Mappusakshi'' (Malayalam),{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Ganga (1972 film)|Ganga]]'' (1972), and ''Jakkamma'' (Tamil){{citation needed|date=April 2015}} - were based on Classic Westerns. ''[[Thazhvaram]]'' (1990), the Malayalam film directed by [[Bharathan]] and written by noted writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], is perhaps the most resemblant of the Spaghetti Westerns in terms of production and cinematic techniques. Earlier Spaghetti Westerns laid the groundwork for such films as ''[[Adima Changala]]'' (1971) starring [[Prem Nazir]], a hugely popular "zapata Spaghetti Western film in Malayalam, and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) ''[[Khote Sikkay]]'' (1973)  and ''[[Thai Meethu Sathiyam]]'' (1978) are notable Curry Westerns. ''[[Kodama Simham]]'' (1990), a Telugu action film starring [[Chiranjeevi]] and [[Mohan Babu]] was one more addition to the Indo Western genre and fared well at the box office. It was also the first South Indian movie to be dubbed in English as ''Hunters of the Indian Treasure''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |title=Hunters of the Indian Treasure |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205013433/https://socialfeed.info/kodama-simham-english-version-poster-4447156 |archivedate=2017-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Takkari Donga]]'' (2002), starring Telugu Maheshbabu, was applauded by critics but an average runner at box office. ''[[Quick Gun Murugun]]'' (2009), an Indian comedy film which spoofs Indian Western movies, is based on a character created for television promos at the time of the launch of the music network Channel [V] in 1994, which had cult following.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''[[Irumbukkottai Murattu Singam]]'' (2010), a Western adventure comedy film, based on cowboy movies and paying homages to the [[John Wayne]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[Jaishankar]], was made in Tamil.

====Martial arts Western (Wuxia Western)====
While many of these mash-ups (e.g., ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971) and its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'' (1974)) are cheap exploitation films, others are more serious dramas such as the ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' TV series, which ran from 1972 to 1975. Comedy examples include the [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]] collaboration ''[[Shanghai Noon]]'' (2000). Further sub-divisions of this subgenre include ''[[Ninja]] Westerns'' and ''[[Samurai]] Westerns'' (incorporating [[samurai cinema]] themes), such as ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1971) with [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Toshiro Mifune]].

====Meat pie Western====
The [[Meat pie Western]] (also ''Kangaroo Western'')(a slang term which plays on the Italo-western moniker "[[Spaghetti Western]]") is an American Western-style movie or TV series set in Australia, especially the [[Australian Outback]] or the [[The bush#Australia|Australian Bush]].&lt;ref name=AusF&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross Cooper|first=Andrew Pike|title=Australian Film 1900-1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0195507843|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936), ''[[Kangaroo (1952 film)|Kangaroo]]'' (1952), the television series [[Whiplash (TV series)|Whiplash]] (1961), ''[[Mad Dog Morgan]]'' (1976), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]'' (1982), ''[[Five Mile Creek]]'' (1983–85), ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (1991), and ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) are all representative of the genre. The term is used to differentiate more Americanized Australian films from those with a more historical basis, such as those about [[bushrangers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51588737 |title=HOLLYWOOD|work=The Australian Women's Weekly|date= November 4, 1981|page= 157|accessdate= December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northwestern====
The [[Northern (genre)|Northern genre]] is a subgenre of Westerns taking place in [[Alaska]] or [[Western Canada]]. Examples include several versions of the [[Rex Beach]] novel, ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (including 1930's ''[[The Spoilers (1930 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Gary Cooper, and 1942's ''[[The Spoilers (1942 film)|The Spoilers]]'', with Marlene Dietrich, [[Randolph Scott]] and Wayne); ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with James Stewart; ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960) with Wayne;  ''[[Death Hunt]]'' (1981) with [[Charles Bronson]]; and ''[[The Grey Fox]]'' (1983) with [[Richard Farnsworth]].

====Ostern====
{{main|Ostern}}
[[Ostern]]s, also known as "Red Western"s, are produced in [[Eastern Europe]]. They were popular in Communist Eastern European countries and were a particular favorite of [[Joseph Stalin]],&lt;nowiki&gt;￼￼ and usually portrayed the &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] sympathetically, as oppressed people fighting for their rights, in contrast to American Westerns of the time, which frequently portrayed the Indians as villains. Osterns frequently featured [[Romani people|Gypsies]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people in the role of the Indians, due to the shortage of authentic Indians in Eastern Europe.

[[Gojko Mitić]] portrayed righteous, kind-hearted, and charming Indian [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] (e.g., in ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear|Die Söhne der großen Bärin]]'' (1966) directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became honorary chief of the [[Sioux]] tribe, when he visited the United States in the 1990s and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his films. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in [[East Germany]], also starred in several Ostern films.

====Pornographic Western====
The most rare of the Western subgenres, pornographic Westerns use the Old West as a background for stories primarily focused on erotica. The three major examples of the porn Western film are [[Russ Meyer]]'s [[nudie-cutie]] ''[[Wild Gals of the Naked West]]'' (1962), and the hardcore ''[[A Dirty Western]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sweet Savage (1979 film)|Sweet Savage]]'' (1979). ''Sweet Savage'' starred [[Aldo Ray]], a veteran actor who had appeared in traditional Westerns, in a non-sex role. Among videogames, ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' (1982) is an infamous example, considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].

====Revisionist Western====
After the early 1960s, many American filmmakers began to question and change many traditional elements of Westerns, and to make [[Revisionist Western]]s that encouraged audiences to question the simple hero-versus-villain dualism and the morality of using violence to test one's character or to prove oneself right. This is shown in Sam Peckinpah's ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). One major revision was the increasingly positive representation of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who had been treated as "savages" in earlier films. Examples of such revisionist Westerns include ''[[Ride the High Country]] (1962),''[[Richard Harris]]' ''[[A Man Called Horse (film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' (1970), ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Soldier Blue]] (1970),'' ''[[Man in the Wilderness]]'' (1971), ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dead Man]]'' (1995). A few earlier Revisionist Westerns gave women more powerful roles, such as ''[[Westward the Women]]'' (1951) starring [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].  Another earlier work encompassed all these features, ''[[The Last Wagon (1956 film)|The Last Wagon]]'' (1956). In it, [[Richard Widmark]] played a white man raised by [[Comanche]]s and persecuted by [[white people|whites]], with [[Felicia Farr]] and [[Susan Kohner]] playing young women forced into leadership roles.

====Science fiction Western====
The [[science fiction Western]] places [[science fiction]] elements within a traditional Western setting. Examples include ''[[Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter]]'' (1965),''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969) featuring cowboys and dinosaurs. [[John Jakes]]'s "Six Gun Planet" takes place on a future planet colonized by people consciously seeking to recreate the Old West (with cowboys riding robot horses...) [https://books.google.co.il/books/about/On_Wheels_Six_Gun_Planet.html?id=Q6OGZprSGtcC&amp;redir_esc=y]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. The movie ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' (1973) and its sequel ''[[Futureworld]]'' (1976), ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Wild Wild West]]'' (1999), ''[[Cowboys &amp; Aliens]]'' (2011), and the TV series [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'']] (2016, based on the movie). ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010) is an example of a video game that follows this format, with futuristic technology and genetic mutations placed among the western themes and desert sprawl of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave Wasteland]].

====Space Western====
The [[Space Western|Space Western or Space Frontier]] is a subgenre of [[science fiction]] which uses the themes and [[trope (literature)|trope]]s of Westerns within science fiction stories. Subtle influences may include exploration of new, lawless frontiers, while more overt influences may feature literal cowboys in outer space who use [[ray gun]]s and ride robotic horses. Examples include the American television series ''[[Brave Starr]]'' (which aired original episodes from September 1987 to February 1988) and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' (created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002), and the films ''[[Battle Beyond the Stars]]'' (1980), which is a remake of ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]''; ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' (1981), which is a remake of ''[[High Noon]]''; and ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' (2005, based on the ''[[Firefly (television show)|Firefly]]'' TV series). The classic western genre has also been a major influence on science fiction films such as the original ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' movie of 1977. Famously [[Gene Roddenberry]] pitched the concept of the TV show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' as a ''Wagon Train to the stars.''

====Spaghetti Western====
{{main|Spaghetti Western|Zapata Western}}
During the 1960s and 1970s, a revival of the Western emerged in [[Italy]] with the "[[Spaghetti Westerns]]" also known as "Italo-Westerns". The most famous of them is ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'' (1966).  Many of these films are low-budget affairs, shot in locations (for example, the Spanish desert [[Province of Almería|region of Almería]]) chosen for their inexpensive crew and production costs as well as their similarity to landscapes of the [[Southwestern United States]]. Spaghetti Westerns were characterized by the presence of more action and violence than the Hollywood Westerns. Also, the protagonists usually acted out of more selfish motives (money or revenge being the most common) than in the classical westerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frayling, Christopher |title=Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone|publisher=IB Tauris|date= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Spaghetti Westerns demythologized the American Western tradition, and some films from the genre are considered [[revisionist Western]]s.

The Western films directed by [[Sergio Leone]] were felt by some to have a different tone than the Hollywood Westerns.&lt;ref name=TG/&gt; Veteran American actors [[Charles Bronson]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Clint Eastwood]]&lt;ref name=TG/&gt; became famous by starring in Spaghetti Westerns, although the films also provided a showcase for other noted actors such as [[James Coburn]], [[Henry Fonda]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Klaus Kinski]], and [[Jason Robards]]. Eastwood, previously the lead in the television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', unexpectedly found himself catapulted into the forefront of the film industry by Leone's ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]''.&lt;ref name=TG&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Forget the Spaghetti Western – try a Curry Western or a Sauerkraut one|author=Billson, Anne|date=September 15, 2014|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/11096814/Forget-the-Spaghetti-Western-try-a-Curry-Western-or-a-Sauerkraut-one.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weird Western====
{{main|Weird West}}
The [[Weird Western]] subgenre blends elements of a classic Western with other elements. ''[[The Wild Wild West]]'' television series, television movies, and 1999 film adaptation blend the Western with [[steampunk]]. The ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' franchise also blends the Western with superhero elements. The film ''[[Western Religion (film)|Western Religion]]'' (2015), by writer and director [[James O'Brien (filmmaker)|James O'Brien]], introduces the devil into a traditional wild west setting. ''[[Old Man Logan]]'' (2008-2009) graphic novel combines the elements of superhero and post-apocalyptic fiction with western.

===Genre studies===
[[File:Tommixgunslinger.jpg|[[Tom Mix]] in ''Mr. Logan, U.S.A.'', c. 1919|thumb]]

In the 1960s academic and critical attention to cinema as a legitimate art form emerged. With the increased attention, [[film theory]] was developed to attempt to understand the significance of film. From this environment emerged (in conjunction with the literary movement) an enclave of critical studies called [[genre studies]]. This was primarily a semantic and structuralist approach to understanding how similar films convey meaning.

One of the results of genre studies is that some{{who|date=April 2013}} have argued that "Westerns" need not take place in the American West or even in the 19th century, as the codes can be found in other types of films. For example, a very typical Western plot is that an eastern lawman heads west, where he matches wits and trades bullets with a gang of outlaws and thugs, and is aided by a local lawman who is well-meaning but largely ineffective until a critical moment when he redeems himself by saving the hero's life. This description can be used to describe any number of Westerns, but also other films such as ''[[Die Hard]]'' (itself a loose reworking of High Noon) and [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', which are frequently cited examples of films that do not take place in the American West but have many themes and characteristics common to Westerns. Likewise, films set in the [[American Old West]] may not necessarily be considered "Westerns."

===Influences===
Being period drama pieces, both the Western and [[Samurai cinema|samurai genre]] influenced each other in style and themes throughout the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowboys and Shoguns: The American Western, Japanese Jidaigeki, and Cross-Cultural Exchange |url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=srhonorsprog |website=Digitalcommons.uri.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929002901/http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=srhonorsprog |archivedate=2015-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' was a remake of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Seven Samurai]]'', and ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was a remake of Kurosawa's ''[[Yojimbo (movie)|Yojimbo]]'', which itself was inspired by ''[[Red Harvest]]'', an American detective novel by [[Dashiell Hammett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=New DVDs: ‘Films of Kenneth Anger’ and ‘Samurai Classics’|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=January 23, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/movies/homevideo/23dvd.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurosawa was influenced by American Westerns and was a fan of the genre, most especially [[John Ford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Crogan |url=http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |title=Translating Kurosawa |work=Senses of Cinema |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003194402/http://archive.sensesofcinema.com/contents/cteq/00/9/kurosawa.html |archivedate=2009-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |title=Star Wars Origins |publisher=''Far Cry from the Original Site'' |first=Justine |last=Shaw |accessdate=December 20, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103145347/http://www.moongadget.com/origins/kurosawa.html |archivedate=November 3, 2015 |df= }} December 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the [[Cold War]], the Western was a strong influence on Eastern Bloc cinema, which had its own take on the genre, the so-called "[[Red Western]]" or "Ostern". Generally these took two forms: either straight Westerns shot in the Eastern Bloc, or action films involving the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian civil war|civil war]] and the [[Basmachi]] rebellion.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

An offshoot of the Western genre is the "post-apocalyptic" Western, in which a future society, struggling to rebuild after a major catastrophe, is portrayed in a manner very similar to the 19th-century frontier. Examples include ''[[The Postman (film)|The Postman]]'' and the ''[[Mad Max]]'' [[Mad Max (franchise)|series]], and the computer game series ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]''. Many elements of space travel series and films borrow extensively from the conventions of the Western genre. This is particularly the case in the [[space Western]] subgenre of science fiction. [[Peter Hyams]]' ''[[Outland (film)|Outland]]'' transferred the plot of ''[[High Noon]]'' to Io, moon of Jupiter. [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series, pitched his show as "''Wagon Train'' to the stars" early on, but admitted later that this was more about getting it produced in a time that loved Western-themed TV series than about its actual content.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} ''[[The Book of Eli]]'' depicts the post apocalypse as a Western with large knives.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

More recently, the [[space opera]] series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' used an explicitly Western theme for its portrayal of frontier worlds. [[Anime]] shows like ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'' and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' have been similar mixes of science fiction and Western elements. The [[science fiction Western]] can be seen as a subgenre of either Westerns or science fiction. Elements of Western films can be found also in some films belonging essentially to other genres. For example, ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' is a war film, but action and characters are Western-like. The British film ''[[Zulu (1964 film)|Zulu]]'' set during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] has sometimes been compared to a Western, even though it is set in [[South Africa]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The character played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] in [[film noir]] films such as ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]''—an individual bound only by his own private code of honor—has a lot in common with the classic Western hero. In turn, the Western, has also explored noir elements, as with the films ''[[Pursued]]'' and ''[[Sugar Creek (film)|Sugar Creek]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In many of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s books, the settlement of other planets is depicted in ways explicitly modeled on American settlement of the West. For example, in his ''[[Tunnel in the Sky]]'' settlers set out to the planet "New Canaan", via an [[interstellar teleporter]] portal across the galaxy, in [[Conestoga wagon]]s, their captain sporting mustaches and a little goatee and riding a [[Palomino]] horse—with Heinlein explaining that the colonists would need to survive on their own for some years, so horses are more practical than machines.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' is a series of seven books that meshes themes of Westerns, [[high fantasy]], [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]]. The protagonist [[Roland of Gilead|Roland Deschain]] is a gunslinger whose image and personality are largely inspired by the "[[Man with No Name]]" from [[Sergio Leone]]'s films. In addition, the [[superhero]] [[fantasy]] genre has been described as having been derived from the cowboy hero, only powered up to omnipotence in a primarily urban setting. The Western genre has been parodied on a number of occasions, famous examples being ''[[Support Your Local Sheriff!]]'', ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', [[Mel Brooks]]'s ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'', and ''[[Rustler's Rhapsody]]''.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[George Lucas]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' films use many elements of a Western, and Lucas has said he intended for ''Star Wars'' to revitalize cinematic mythology, a part the Western once held. The [[Jedi]], who take their name from [[Jidaigeki]], are modeled after samurai, showing the influence of Kurosawa. The character [[Han Solo]] dressed like an archetypal gunslinger, and the [[Mos Eisley]] cantina is much like an Old West saloon.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Meanwhile, films such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'', which plucked actor [[Sam Elliott]] out of the Old West and into a Los Angeles bowling alley, and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', about a Southern-boy-turned-gigolo in New York (who disappoints a client when he doesn't measure up to Gary Cooper), transplanted Western themes into modern settings for both purposes of parody and homage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert |last=Silva |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/future-of-classic/2009/05/cowboys-in-non-westerns.php |publisher=Not From 'Round Here...

==Literature==
{{Main|Western fiction}}
[[Western fiction]] is a genre of literature set in the [[American Old West]], most commonly between the years of 1860 and 1900. The first critically recognized Western was ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'' (1902) by [[Owen Wister]].{{cite web |url=https://wildwestliving.com/blogs/news/wild-west-literature |title=Classic Wild West Literature }} Other well-known writers of Western fiction include [[Zane Grey]], from the early 1900s, [[Ernest Haycox]], [[Luke Short]], and [[Louis L'Amour]], from the mid 20th century. Many writers better known in other genres, such as [[Leigh Brackett]], [[Elmore Leonard]], and [[Larry McMurtry]], have also written Western novels. The genre's popularity peaked in the 1960s, due in part to the shuttering of many pulp magazines, the popularity of [[Television Westerns|televised Westerns]], and the rise of the spy novel. Readership began to drop off in the mid- to late 1970s and reached a new low in the 2000s. Most bookstores, outside of a few Western states, now only carry a small number of Western novels and short story collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McVeigh, Stephen |title=The American Western|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary forms that share similar themes include stories of the [[American frontier]], the [[gaucho literature]] of [[Argentina]], and tales of the settlement of the [[Australian Outback]].

==Television==

[[File:James Garner Jack Kelly Maverick 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] in ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957)]]
[[Television Westerns]] are a subgenre of the Western. When television became popular in the late 1940s and 1950s, TV Westerns quickly became an audience favorite.&lt;ref&gt;Gary A. Yoggy, ''Riding the Video Range: The Rise and Fall of the Western on Television'' (McFarland &amp; Company, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with re-broadcasts of existing films, a number of movie cowboys had their own TV shows. As demand for the Western increased, new stories and stars were introduced. A number of long-running [[TV Western]]s became classics in their own right, such as: ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' (1949-1957), ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'' (1955-1961), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' (1955-1975),  ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (1957-1962), ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel]]'' (1957-1963), ''[[Wagon Train]]'' (1957-1965), ''[[Sugarfoot]]'' (1957-1961), ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (1958-1963), ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' (1959-1966), ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959-1973),  ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' (1962-1971), and ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1965-1969).   ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'' was the first Western [[television series]] written for adults,&lt;ref name="The Eastern Earps"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burris|first1=Joe|title=The Eastern Earps|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-05-10/features/0505100100_1_wyatt-earp-genealogy-indentured|accessdate=October 20, 2014 |date=May 10, 2005|publisher=Baltimore Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; premiering four days before ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' on September 6, 1955.&lt;ref name="IMDb title|tt0047750"&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0047750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDb title|tt0047736"&gt;{{IMDb title|tt0047736}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The peak year for television Westerns was 1959, with 26 such shows airing during primetime. At least six of them were connected in some extent to [[Wyatt Earp]]: ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'', ''[[Bat Masterson (TV series)|Bat Masterson]]'', ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'', ''[[Broken Arrow (TV series)|Broken Arrow]]'', ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]'', and ''Gunsmoke''.&lt;ref name="guinn"&gt;[Guinn, Jeff. ''The Last Gunfight: The Real Story of the Shootout at the O.K. Corral and How it Changed the American West'' (First hardcover ed.). New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|978-1-4391-5424-3}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing costs of [[American television]] production weeded out most action half hour series in the early 1960s, and their replacement by hour-long television shows, increasingly in color.&lt;ref&gt;Kisseloff, J. (editor) ''The Box: An Oral History of Television''&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Westerns died out in the late 1960s as a result of network changes in [[demographic targeting]] along with pressure from parental television groups. Future entries in the genre would incorporate elements from other genera, such as crime drama and mystery whodunit elements. Western shows from the 1970s included ''[[Hec Ramsey]]'', ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', and ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]''. In the 1990s and 2000s, hour-long Westerns and slickly packaged made-for-TV movie Westerns were introduced, such as: ''[[Lonesome Dove (film)|Lonesome Dove]]'' (1989) and ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''. As well, new elements were once again added to the Western formula, such as the Western-[[science fiction]] show ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', created by [[Joss Whedon]] in 2002. ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' was a critically acclaimed Western series which aired on [[HBO]] from 2004 through 2006.

==Visual art==
{{Main|Artists of the American West}}
A number of visual artists focused their work on representations of the [[American Old West]]. American West-oriented art is sometimes referred to as "Western Art" by Americans. This relatively new category of art includes paintings, sculptures, and sometimes Native American crafts. Initially, subjects included exploration of the Western states and cowboy themes. [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Charles M. Russell]] are two artists who captured the "Wild West" on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Buscombe, Edward |title=Painting the Legend: Frederic Remington and the Western|work=Cinema Journal|date=1984|pages= 12–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some art museums, such as the [[Buffalo Bill Center of the West]] in Wyoming and the [[Autry National Center]] in Los Angeles, feature American Western Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goetzmann, William H. |title=The West of the Imagination|location=New York|publisher= Norton|date= 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
The popularity of Westerns extends beyond films, literature, television, and visual art to include numerous other media forms.

===Anime and manga===
With [[anime]] and [[manga]], the genre tends towards the [[Science fiction Western]] [e.g., ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998 anime), ''[[Trigun]]'' (1995-2007 manga), and ''[[Outlaw Star]]'' (1996-1999 manga)]. Although contemporary Westerns also appear, such as ''[[Kōya no Shōnen Isamu]]'', a 1971 [[shōnen]] manga about a boy with a Japanese father and a Native American mother, or ''[[El Cazador de la Bruja]]'', a 2007 anime television series set in modern-day Mexico. Part 7 of the manga series ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' is based in the American Western setting. The story follows racers in a transcontinental horse race, the "Steel Ball Run" race.

===Comics===
[[Western comics]] have included serious entries (such as the classic comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s (such as ''[[Kid Colt, Outlaw]]'', ''[[Rawhide Kid]]'', and ''[[Red Ryder]]''), cartoons, and parodies (such as ''[[Cocco Bill]]'' and ''[[Lucky Luke]]''). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics leaned toward the [[Weird West]] subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]''. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., ''[[Jonah Hex]]'' and ''[[Loveless (comics)|Loveless]]'').

===Games===
Western [[arcade game]]s, [[computer game]]s, [[role-playing game]]s, and [[video games]] are often either straightforward Westerns or Western Horror hybrids.  Some Western themed-computer games include ''[[The Oregon Trail (1971 video game)|The Oregon Trail]]'' (1971), ''[[Mad Dog McCree]]'' (1990), ''[[Sunset Riders]]'' (1991), ''[[Outlaws (1997 video game)|Outlaws]]'' (1997), ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]'' (2004), ''[[Gun (video game)|Gun]]'' (2005), ''[[Call of Juarez]]'' (2007), ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), and ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' (2018). Other video games adapt the [[Science fiction Western]] or [[Weird West]] subgenres such as ''[[Fallout (video game)|Fallout]]'' (1997), ''[[Gunman Chronicles]]'' (2000), ''[[Darkwatch]]'' (2005), the [[Borderlands (series)|''Borderlands'' series]] (first released in 2009)'', [[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), and ''[[Hard West]]'' (2015).

===Radio dramas===
Western [[radio drama]]s were very popular from the 1930s to the 1960s.  Some popular shows include ''[[Lone Ranger#Original radio series|The Lone Ranger]]'' (first broadcast in 1933), ''[[The Cisco Kid#Radio|The Cisco Kid]]'' (first broadcast in 1942), ''[[Dr. Sixgun]]'' (first broadcast in 1954), ''[[Have Gun – Will Travel#Radio show|Have Gun–Will Travel]]'' (first broadcast in 1958), and ''[[Gunsmoke#Radio series|Gunsmoke]]'' (first broadcast in 1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otrwesterns.com |website=otrwesterns.com |title=Old Time Radio Westerns |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319172946/http://www.otrwesterns.com/ |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web series===
Westerns have been showcased in short episodic web series. Examples include ''[[League of STEAM]]'', ''[[Red Bird (web series)|Red Bird]]'' and [[Arkansas Traveler (web series)|''Arkansas Traveler'']].

'''Zhu Guangqian''' (朱光潛; 19 September 1897 – 6 March 1986) was one of the founder of the study of [[aesthetics]] in 20th-century China.

== History ==
Zhu graduated from the [[Anhui Province Tongcheng Secondary School]]. After earning his BA from Hong Kong University, he went abroad to study aesthetics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[University College, London]], then to [[France]] and the [[University of Strasbourg]] where he earned his doctorate. Later, he returned to China to write ''The Psychology of Art'' (文藝心理學), ''On Poetry'' (詩論), and ''A History of Western Aesthetics'' (西方美學史), ''Letters on Beauty'' (談美書簡). In the 1930s in [[Beijing]], Zhu Guangqian hosted a literary salon that met monthly to recite prose and poetry, east and west. Regulars included [[Wen Yiduo]] (聞一多), [[Chen Mengjia]] (陳夢家), [[Zhu Ziqing]] (朱自清), Zheng Zhenduo (鄭振鐸), Feng Zhi (馮至), [[Shen Congwen]] (沈從文), [[Bing Xin]] (冰心), [[Ling Shuhua]] (淩淑華), [[Bian Zhilin]] (卞之琳), [[Lin Huiyin]] (林徽因) and [[Xiao Qian]] (蕭乾). These were pivotal figures in Republican literature, and it can perhaps be argued that the salon was important to the formation of the so-called Beijing style literature (京派文學) of the period.
